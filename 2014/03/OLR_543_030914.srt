00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Riverhosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week, one cloud gaming service attempts to make a comeback using your existing library of games, and another adds more devices to be able to stream from.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Not to be outdone, the UyU wants you to play their games everywhere, with plans to become a service over the course of 2014.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this and more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 543 for this March 9th of 2014.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And we're here over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, with you guys in our chat room,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
live at the voicegeeksnetwork.com, where we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And here in studio, of course, my name is Rob Roberts, and with me by my side, as she always is, unless she runs off to Disneyland or something, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Because I got fussed out last week. Sup bitches?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Sup?

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sup?

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sup, how you doing?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm tired.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're tired? Try not to fall asleep during the show.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, I'm not, I'm just sort of, I feel off kilter because of the time.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I know it's a three hour show.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The day is weird, and it's weird outside, and weird all the things.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Daylight savings time is quite the evil holiday, isn't it?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Holiday? I don't celebrate it.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't know. Here's why I call it a holiday, because they put it on a calendar.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And so, you know, it's in the holiday section of the calendar.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a warning.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a fuck.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're going to have a bad Sunday because of daylight savings time.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Daylight savings time.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, you know, I was suggesting on Twitter, I said, let's just get rid of it.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Like, you know, I'm sure a lot of people are saying, but I actually have some friends that are like, no, no, no, no, no.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I need the extra hour of daylight. Like, that's a great thing.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, okay, fine. Can we just have this be the last time in our lives that we lose an hour of sleep?

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're done.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll give up the rolling it back and the whole good daylight savings time that comes in the fall, and then we'll never have to lose an hour of sleep.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is that the daylight giving time or something?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Daylight murder time because you're not saving it?

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Perhaps. I don't know. I don't know.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm just, I just, I had a weird day yesterday too, so going out to the BFECA.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I heard, and if you don't mind me giving away all the details of your personal life here on air, I heard that you went out to Susanville, California.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Janesville, Susanville, some other dinky little place.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Here's the thing. Most of you out there listening have probably never heard of Susanville, and there's a reason for that.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's teeny.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, and when you think of California, you think of places like the beach. You might even think about the snow, like Lake Tahoe.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You might think about politics like Sacramento where we're from, but you don't usually think about the middle of the goddamn nowhere forest like Susanville, right?

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, this was up like, we actually did like a whole route. Okay, my best friend has a job that required her to go out and look at some places up around there.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And rather than have her go by herself, I decided to be a good friend, and I said I would go help her out. She fed me, so it was great.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, and hanging out with Becky all day is really fun.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Right.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, we went.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I would hang out all day with Becky. I hope you guys invite me next time.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sure.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can make, I've been to Susanville before. I hung out at the bowling alley like a true Susanville person would.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, we, it wasn't just Susanville we went to. We went to Janesville, which is even smaller, or Jamestown or whatever.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And this is going through like the really boring part of California. You go in past Truckee, past Reno, because you have to cut through Nevada to get up there.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then you're just sort of like in the middle of nowhere and then all of a sudden you drive a little bit on, I think we're on 38.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And then you're in a forest. You're in a national forest. We went to Lake Almonor.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, we circled back around to Lake Almonor, eventually getting to the Plumas National Forest and Portola.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then all of a sudden we're back out of the woods. And we were like in the scenic woods with winding passages and babbling brooks and shit.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And fucking deer. Okay. There's pictures of the mule deer just hanging out in some guy's front yard.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I took a picture of him. It's on my Tumblr.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Here's the thing. As much, as much shit as we're giving Susanville and all this stuff, it actually is really pretty out there.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's super pretty. It's super pretty. And you know, I have to say.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And fucking deer.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And fucking deer. I know. But I have to say that I really enjoyed the scenery.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I mean, I got to see parts of California I've never seen before.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I just don't want to do it for 16 hours again.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because I woke up this morning and I was in pain.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I was like, my back was like, bitch you sat on me for like so many hours.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let me ask this because it is a video game podcast. Did you get to do any like 3DS gaming or Vita?

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I played some Animal Crossing and didn't tag anybody.

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Nobody. Well, I always tag the same person in Truckee every time I've been there.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like the one person with a 3DS in Truckee.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The one person in Truckee. I've tagged them twice which I'm pretty sure I know who it is.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I think it's somebody who works at Bespoke which is where I go get neat typography cards.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And the guy who, but there was a lady this time. The guy wasn't there.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But Bespoke is a really cool little shop in Truckee.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And you know, I go to the Truckee Candy Company and Got Fudge.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I love that you kind of like, have you guys done this with the 3DS street passing?

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Like you've kind of like narrowed down. Like it's kind of like 3DS stalking.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But not like, I don't want to use the word stalking, but I can't think of a better word for it.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Like it's like the whole like deduction. Like I know who you are.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like there's a random person I keep trading with that's got to be one of my neighbors.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And I'm like, are they an adult? Because they might not be.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well I'm sort of recognizing a couple of people I tag at the Land of Cubes in Tech.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I tagged, there's this one girl at like, I always tag her at Starbucks.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And for a moment I thought she actually worked at one of them.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So I said, hey, does somebody by this name work here?

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They're like, no, but man, I tagged this person too.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because I said it was on the, so it was pretty cool.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But yeah, I tagged somebody from Argentina the last, not this past time I was in Truckee.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The week before.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Nice.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But no one this time. So I just, I grew a blue rose in Animal Crossing.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I'm trying to grow another one.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Did you, did you, did the grass finally grow back where Ed used to live?

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
All right.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Look, he's been waiting there very patiently while we've been talking.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hi, Loki.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We've been talking about fucking deer and shit and we will make you wait no longer.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Say hello via the Skyline everybody to Techmaster Loki.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey, how's it going?

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hey, good.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sorry to make you sit through all that, but that was a, I love hearing about deer and stuff.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Have you, have you ever trekked out to the great unknown, Northern California?

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I've been a few places, but I don't think I've ever been to Susanville.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, you're not missing much, to be honest.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're usually the one that has to drive, so you don't get to do a lot of gaming on the long car trips, right?

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That is correct.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, I gotcha.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, Techmaster Loki, of course, joining us via the Skyline once again here.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
For those of you that have missed the memo, they had a baby about seven weeks ago at this point.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Eight? It's almost two months, right?

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, about like six weeks, seven weeks.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So, Loki is joining us via the Skyline while the wife is still healing from delivery, but she, Mrs. Loki is still doing A-OK, right?

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, she's doing fine.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Awesome to hear.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hopefully, I don't know if we've planned the return date for Loki yet, but we're crossing our fingers and our toes that you'll be able to join us when we're back in two weeks at the new studio.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Is that looking like-

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know yet, so.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's fine.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We gotta let Mrs. Loki heal up and all that good stuff, so Loki will have to take the time he needs.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But yeah, tonight, of course, is the last episode in the studio that we're at currently.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I gotta admit, with all the internet up and down time we have sometimes, I won't miss it in that regard.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But Loki hasn't seen the place since before Christmas, so everything will be different for him when he finally does come back.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Dark Sakura, any fond memories of studio apartment dump-a-roo that you're gonna miss?

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, I haven't passed out on your bed here.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I guess, and this is gonna be a little sad, but I had very happy memories of cuddling with the kitties with Marco and Sanrio-chan.

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Which, they both had their name as Maru-chan and San-chan for me.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And kind of answered to it.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
By the way, I found a picture of the fucking deer.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We are concerned how the cat's gonna handle the move, but we think at the end of the day, she's gonna love all the extra sun that the new place gets.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So we think that'll end up being an awesome thing.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So, let's see. So yeah, we will be off next week.

138
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well actually, I should say this, we are actually still gonna do a show. We're gonna do a show in advance.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it's not something that's gonna be broadcast live.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's gonna be an intentionally shorter show that we're gonna tape during the week.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And then we'll actually broadcast it on the feed at the normal time.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And it will take our slot at VOG next Sunday, right after Bobby Black Wolf.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So, sadly the interaction portion will be missing next week.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But we will have something new for you guys on the feed, so you guys won't totally miss us.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Rama says,

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Sky, better internet in the new studio? I hope so. It's to be determined. We don't know yet.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You know, we're really at the mercy of our provider, so I'm hoping it will be fine.

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But we will see. I can say this, we're gonna have a lot more space.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's gonna be back more to those of you guys that have been here since the days when we were in the actual garage studio

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
that we would broadcast on JUSTIN TV, because Twitch didn't exist then.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's gonna be a little more like that. We're not gonna be in a garage,

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
but we'll have an entire section of the house about that big that we get to kind of dedicate to the studios.

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Because podcasting is such a big part of my life, so there's that.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Also on tonight's show, coming up, I want to make sure I plug this.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This was thrown together very last minute, but that's how we roll here at Orange Lounge Radio,

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and I'm actually very excited to welcome back an old friend of ours to the show.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We're gonna welcome back to Segg.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Segg, of course, has been here before, pimping some various projects he's been working on in the past.

159
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
One thing he's gonna talk to us about tonight is he's gonna talk to us about a new game that's coming out this week, actually.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This game's got a bit of buzz around it, so we want to let Segg talk about this game and answer your guys' questions live.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The game is called Dom Pamplemousse, and it is about gender, the economy, and characters that burst into song.

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's kind of like an episode of Glee, it's sounding like. I don't know.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm gonna ask Segg how much this game has in common with Glee.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But I will say, it seems like the actors are all better looking, because they're stop-motion figures.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So that's already a step up on Glee, so there you go.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So we're gonna talk to Segg about that, probably at the top of Part B a little later on.

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
There's quite a bit I could say that's a step up from Glee.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There is quite a bit. Maybe that's not the nicest thing to do, is to compare this game to Glee, but I'm actually trying to say it's better.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's better, guys, it's better.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Lots, lots, much better.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, sg100matt, giving some tips on moving cats.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I know it's a video game podcast, but hey, cat talk is important, too.

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
sg100matt says, best way to move cats is to move everything into the house first, including the litter box.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Bring the cat into the house with everything from the old place in it, so that way they recognize the scent of everything and be more at ease.

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Luckily, that's exactly our plan.

176
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's what we did with Shermie.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We're going to move her when we move all the big furniture, but we're going to set up all the litter and stuff in advance.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We fully expect she'll hide behind the toilet in the bathroom for a day, because that's what she did when we moved here.

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So, the more you know.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Well, I told you about Dan moving Shermie over to the house, right?

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't think so.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I passed out, took a nap.

183
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The last little thing in the house was Shermie in her bed, looking around pathetically, like, where are all my people?

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Where's all my stuff?

185
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So, Dan comes in while I'm passed out in the bed, taps my foot, and then drops the cat on me in her bed.

186
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And said, she was looking lonely, here's the cat.

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I'm like, Shermie!

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And then she died.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's horrible, why am I laughing?

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's because the way you delivered that, you're awful.

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I just couldn't help, you know, I miss my Shermie.

192
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
She was a good cat.

193
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I know you miss Mariko, too.

194
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I know, but you have Midna.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I have Midna.

196
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Midna's a little fucking brat.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No, no, no, no, she's like, mom, mom, feed me, feed me, it's five in the morning, feed me, mom, mom, no cat, busy.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're just sleeping, you're not busy.

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And Will stayed over with his dog, Wintu.

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And the two of them were like, he tried to eat her tail.

201
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But not like in a, I mean, she tried to eat Midna's tail, not in a malicious way, just in a, what's this kind of way?

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Chew, chew, chew.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And Midna's like, bitch, literally.

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So, anyway.

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We're only like 12, 13 minutes into the show.

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We haven't even hit our kickoff topic tonight.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But this is going to be quick because I'm going to actually ask some questions of Dark Sakura and Loki.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Loki, you ready to answer some questions?

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I know Jamie's kind of been chatting away here at the top of the show.

211
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You ready to answer some questions?

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All right.

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All right. Here's the deal.

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Here's why I'm going to ask some questions because I, you know, I try, I try to be hip.

215
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I try to be cool, you know, even, even as I'm getting older, I try to, I try to hang with the cool kids.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I stay on top of like all the latest and greatest in social media.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And I try to figure out, you know, how could, how could OLR or VOG or, or Hoard House or whatever project I'm working on.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How can we embrace social media?

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So one of the sites that I got turned on to recently was a site.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Can we kiss it?

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Huh?

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Can we kiss it?

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You can try. You want to come over here and kiss it?

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's a website.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You said embrace.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is a new website called, well, I guess it's not that new.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's actually been around a couple of years, but I'm treating it like it's new because that's what, you know, older people do.

229
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's a site called ask.fm.

230
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And I guess it's really popular with like the, probably like high school crowd and stuff because what you do, you ask anonymous questions.

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Now some people use this to ask mean questions, but I put this out on Twitter.

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I said, hey, ask me whatever you want anonymously.

233
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It can be about OLR.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It can be about anything, you know, ask me whatever you want.

235
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Because I've been very fortunate in the position I'm at here at OLR where sometimes I get questions about like, you know, from people that might be wondering like how I came out or whatever and are struggling maybe with something similar without themselves or so I wanted to just put that out there.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hey, if you want to ask something anonymously, go for it.

237
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm pretty much an open book with three shows a week out there on iTunes anyway, you know, ask.

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So I've been getting a variety of questions, but some of them have been video game related questions.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So I thought I would, I would give some of this ask.fm and share some of this ask.fm joy with DarkSakura and Loki.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So you guys want to answer some of the questions that I've got on ask.fm this week?

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Sure.

242
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You really don't have a choice because here it goes.

243
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Okay.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So one of the questions I got, if you were an RPG class, which one would you be and why?

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
A class?

246
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, like a white mage or a fighter or a, it doesn't, you know, I'm, my mind goes to Final Fantasy, but maybe not necessarily Final Fantasy.

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I would be the fuck shit up bitch. No, I don't think that's a class.

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know. I've taken like a bajillion different quizzes as to, you know, what class, cause I like answering the stupid fucking quizzes.

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So like for my Homestuck thing, I always get, um, Silph of Heart. So, which is like a healer class.

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay.

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Um, for most of the others, like I really love Summoner, so I'd probably be a Summoner.

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Ah, you would summon the creatures of the world to kill things for you.

253
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah. And then I'd sit back and read a book while they kill shit.

254
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay. That sounds, that sounds very Jamie. I like that.

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
How about you, Loki? If you were an RPG class, what would you be and why?

256
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Uh, I don't know.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
These questions aren't always easy, is it?

258
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, I just normally play like kind of middle, middle of the road, everything. So, you know, like in Final Fantasy 11, I guess that was red mage, but, uh, something like that, I guess.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You'd be like, uh, Edgar in Final Fantasy 6.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I, I think so.

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Sure, why not?

262
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Mechanist?

263
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, a Mechanist or something like that, yeah.

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Or if it was Ragnarok, I think you'd be a blacksmith.

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, where he kind of, kind of the tech guy.

266
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Which by the way, playing a blacksmith is pretty fun in Ragnarok.

267
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But it has to be a tech guy that never fully masters a class.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
For Loki. He gets to like 90% and then switches to a different class. That would be Loki.

269
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Um, here's the next question. And remember guys, I did not brief Dark Soccer and Loki on these questions in advance. We're doing this live, so these answers are very, uh, very raw and might take them a second.

270
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Uh, and if you guys want to answer, go to live.vognetwork.com.

271
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Uh, Queen Simea says, I'm most likely blue mage because I depend on being able to imitate things really well for work.

272
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You know what, that was actually my answer. I said I would be a blue mage and absorb the powers of my enemies and turn around and use those powers against them.

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That was, that was my answer.

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I do kind of like whatever the Moogles do in 6, where they just dance.

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
They dance! It's a dancer!

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They shake their ass at you and then you die.

277
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Alright, awesome. Uh, Raginator says he's a berserker.

278
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Uh, so there you go. Alright, uh, here's the next question. Loki, I'll start with you.

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What's the largest amount of time that you've clocked playing a video game?

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Uh, that would probably be Final Fantasy XI if I'm guessing.

281
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I had a feeling. Why that one?

282
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Because that's the one I played the longest amount of time, I think.

283
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Um, even like Grand Theft Auto IV could be close.

284
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't remember the actual stats on that because I don't think they actually track time.

285
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Um, but I mean, I played enough to where I was at, like, for the...

286
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Because we used to do private games, so unranked private games, and we were at the top of the list.

287
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't know why they kept score on that, but we were at the top of the list for that.

288
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So, I played a lot of that.

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Alright, very good.

290
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Darsakra, what's the largest amount of time you've clocked playing a video game?

291
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, if you want to count just actually being logged into the game,

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Ragon Rock Online, I did stay logged in for an entire week.

293
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Because I'd keep switching to my merchant.

294
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, because you have to do the merchant, and you have to AFK on purpose.

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But, I told you about the week I skipped school to play Final Fantasy VI, or III as it was over here.

296
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah.

297
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, I did that.

298
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Woke up in the morning, played the game, went to bed, I beat it in a week.

299
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And I was taking my sweet time too, just wandering around and writing shit down.

300
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I wrote myself a strategy guide, Rob.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh my god.

302
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, because I used to be really super anal and take notes and draw maps and shit.

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And...

304
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I probably played that game like...

305
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, I would sleep and then get up and play that game some more.

306
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And then, um...

307
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So that's probably the most continuous, but I mean...

308
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Keep in mind though, I've been playing Animal Crossing since May last year.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, and honestly, has the game changed that much since the GameCube?

310
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes, a little.

311
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You've kind of been playing it consistently since 2002.

312
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, no, not consistently, because remember I kind of quit the other ones.

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But this one I've really been enjoying, and I have a Blue Rose now, so shut up.

314
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, now that I think of it, maybe even Dance Dance Revolution, I guess, as a whole, would be probably the most...

315
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm thinking of those sessions of playing. How long have you sat and gamed consecutively?

316
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
My answer to this was World of Warcraft, obviously, for the same type of thing.

317
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Just with everything there was to do in that game and the social aspects of it.

318
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But I also tried to give a non-MMO answer, and I said, honestly, what comes to mind is Mass Effect 3.

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And that's because of the multiplayer mode, in large part.

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I didn't play through it 17 times or whatever, like Dark Soccer did, but it was that multiplayer mode was a great...

321
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Last year, I spent a lot of time playing that.

322
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Actually, I'm going to say as far as continuous gaming goes, actually being up and playing the whole thing, the first Mass Effect that I marathoned my second time through.

323
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Which is so funny, because I was guilty of this too.

324
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And this was another question that I got earlier, was something along the lines of,

325
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
what was a game you completely misjudged the first time you played it?

326
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I said Mass Effect, easy. I know you did that too.

327
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Loki, what about you? I'll throw that question out there too.

328
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What was a game that you completely misjudged the first time you played it, and went back and loved it?

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Once again, going back to the longest time played it, it's not a video game, but I have QZAR.

330
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I played over 500 hours of that.

331
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Wow.

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then Minecraft.

333
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I didn't get it at first.

334
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay, yeah, that's right. I remember you didn't get Minecraft at first either, and you talked about that on the show.

335
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Alright.

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Alright, I got one last question for you guys, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and housekeeping and all that.

337
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And this one's a good one, and this is very characteristic of the type of questions we really get on Ask.fm.

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
DarkSaga, I'll start with you.

339
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Because I already know, I think I know what one of them is going to be.

340
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh shit.

341
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Based on looks alone, what two video game characters would you date, and why?

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
See, I'm not like an aesthetic person. That's the thing. I don't care about what someone looks.

343
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I care about the person behind it.

344
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You know, okay, I would go by, I could say by voice. I mean, definitely if you want to.

345
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But based on pure aesthetics.

346
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Okay, yes.

347
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Pure aesthetics.

348
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Uh, fuck balls.

349
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Dish, dish girl, dish.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
God, I'm trying to think. Actually, I can tell you who my first video game crush was.

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Okay.

352
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's Ryu and Street Fighter.

353
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Okay, that's a good answer.

354
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah?

355
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah.

356
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And so yeah, Ryu would be on the list. Even though he's like kind of old and grizzled now, he's still awesome.

357
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yeah.

358
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And then Strider, hear you.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Ah, these are good answers. I like that.

360
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But that's based on aesthetics. If you wanted to go for hotness and voice, you know, I could tell you that.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I was going to say, I was going to sit here and think Garrus. I mean.

362
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Well, he's not really very pretty, is he?

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes, but the voice. Once you started to talk about the voice.

364
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay, okay, okay. If it was a Mass Effect character, I was going to go for pretty.

365
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The Bishouden of the game is Thane pretty much because he's there to be, you know, sleek, lizardy and pretty.

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And you know, have his own spotlight and glimmer and make you hallucinate if you like him.

367
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And the Citadel is so good with him. So good.

368
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You know, but as much as I adore the character for Garrus, a lot of the, I would say, attraction for the character has to do with, you know, that whole attitude and the voice.

369
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And I admit, I admit I like the spiky bit. That's kind of cool. But I don't know. I just don't think about outward appearances.

370
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's fine.

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So I'm seeing who's pretty. Strider, hear you is pretty.

372
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I actually called, when I answered this question on my own page, I put, you're making me superficial with this answer.

373
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
But I ended up saying, I said, I said Nathan Drake from Uncharted because, what can I say? I like Scruff and that stuff.

374
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And I also said default male Shepard for Mass Effect.

375
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Really?

376
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

377
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't think he's all that hot.

378
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Whatever. That's because you're, that's because you're Team FemShep purity.

379
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You know, okay.

380
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Team FemShep purity means there's no such thing as male Shep. There's like, he doesn't exist in their minds.

381
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You know what, you know, I am gonna, fuck, I was sitting here thinking about it and you know what, I am going to go back and put Garrus on my list.

382
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Garrus and Strider, hear you.

383
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay.

384
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll tell you why.

385
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Why?

386
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Because actually I did think that the spiky bits were awesome.

387
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And I did like the voice and I did like the walk and that's why I started playing Mass Effect to begin with anyway.

388
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So.

389
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
All right. Fair enough.

390
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Can I have three?

391
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Sure. Take all you want.

392
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay. I want Ryu, Strider, hear you, and, oh, actually, you know who's better than hear you?

393
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
All right. It's a three hour show, Dark Sakura, not 17.

394
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Genjiro and Samurai Shodown was one of my other ones.

395
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay. Okay. So fuck.

396
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
All right.

397
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Fuck.

398
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The listeners are dying to know.

399
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And I've been sitting here like not looking at chat so I can't be influenced by anything going on.

400
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
They're all saying Garrus, Garrus, Garrus.

401
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Fuck.

402
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Clerical Error 404 says, Chris Redfield and Bayonetta for me.

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Bayonetta's really hot.

404
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Ooh, Bayonetta's hot.

405
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Really hot.

406
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
All right.

407
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'd hit that.

408
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Hold on though.

409
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
We gotta go.

410
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Because the chat, everybody in the universe.

411
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I do not like Liara.

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Shh. Settle down.

413
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The entire universe is dying to know.

414
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Loki, based on Looks Alone, what two video game characters would you date and why?

415
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Well, clearly at the top of my list of me, if we're going by Looks Alone, it's gotta be the Native American woman from Custer's Revenge.

416
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I mean, those pixels.

417
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Win.

418
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
You are awful.

419
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You're an awful, awful person.

420
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Come on, Loki.

421
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Uh, let's see.

422
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What else?

423
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Uh, I don't know.

424
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
They're video games.

425
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Um, I guess, uh, we'll pick, uh, Kinzie from the Saints Row series.

426
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Okay.

427
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And she's this, like, hot, nerdy chick that's into S&M.

428
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So that'd be kinda, kinda cool.

429
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Okay.

430
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm with you.

431
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm with you.

432
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And then number two.

433
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
No, that was number two.

434
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
No, that was.

435
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Oh, you were serious about that.

436
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
All right.

437
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
All right.

438
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Fair enough.

439
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Fair enough.

440
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
All right.

441
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Uh, guy.

442
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Of course, our chat room, uh, they're dying over there after hearing that ish, that one.

443
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
All right.

444
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Love it.

445
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
GameGrew in chat says it perfectly.

446
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
GameGrew over at live.vognetwork.com.

447
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Loki is magnificent troll.

448
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I mean, if we're, we're doing my aesthetics, then I guess you could say mama, because,

449
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
you know, at least she'd be cooking something.

450
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You know, I, so there's that plus to it.

451
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I mean, cause everybody else is just video game characters.

452
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I mean, everybody good at killing things.

453
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I mean, that doesn't do me any good.

454
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Mama does do the cooking and the gardening and the, and the baby.

455
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
And the crafting.

456
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
So yeah.

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You're a bad man, Loki.

458
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
All right.

459
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I have another person out of my list.

460
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
What?

461
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Rex.

462
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
See, once you got started on the Mass Effect thing, now there's no tournament.

463
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Oh, come on.

464
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
How, how lame is it that Rex wasn't romancable?

465
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
See, originally when you said Rex, I, cause I didn't play Mass Effect.

466
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I thought you were talking about Metal Gear Rex.

467
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And I'm like, wow, that's just weird.

468
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Okay.

469
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'd probably go after Snake too.

470
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
All right.

471
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Look enough, enough, enough.

472
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
We're done with the, uh,

473
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You want to hide in this box?

474
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Did you hear what he just said?

475
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
What?

476
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Do you want to hide in this box?

477
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Sure.

478
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
All right.

479
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Gaming weeks.

480
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

481
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What haven't I been playing?

482
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
It's important to establish the frame of reference we come from this week.

483
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

484
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I did stuff.

485
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You all right over there?

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Chat.

487
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh.

488
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
All right.

490
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Put chat down and tell us what your gaming week was.

491
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

492
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I played some stuff.

493
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I actually did play Mass Effect 3.

494
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I have played, um, some Final Fantasy 14.

495
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I played a shit ton of Animal Crossing.

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And a shit ton more of Animal Crossing.

497
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And I have a blue rose.

498
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Damn.

499
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And, um, um, um, um, I played some of that stuff we're moving on from on the website.

500
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Just to hear how awful my voice is.

501
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And I haven't been playing Bravely Default because I'm still fucking playing Zelda.

502
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And I need to actually put some time into Zelda, which I will be able to do once I am done with other job.

503
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And I am going to be done with other job this week.

504
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And, um, you know, and Ronchon, I will, I don't know.

505
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I respect Patty greatly, but I don't know.

506
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
There might be some fighting going on over that bandana.

507
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Um, but yeah.

508
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's not like a whole bunch of stuff.

509
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Oh, and I bought a game that's called Year Walk that I'm probably going to be starting tomorrow night, to be honest.

510
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Because it just, it was really interesting.

511
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's based off of the, like, I think they said it was a Swedish concept of a year of walking or something.

512
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Or a walk of a year or something.

513
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But it looked like it was a really neat kind of first person game.

514
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So I bought that and I'm going to play it.

515
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And, um, yeah.

516
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I've also been playing, um, like some weird mahjong game.

517
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
That's like, it changes the tile puzzles every stage that you get.

518
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's so weird, but it's kind of addicting.

519
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So, yeah, that's what I've been playing.

520
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Some stuff.

521
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Alright, let's go over to Loki.

522
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

523
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Uh, I didn't play a whole ton this week.

524
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I did get to play a lot more of South Park, the Stick of Truth.

525
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And the game is just awesome.

526
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I mean, the aesthetics of the game alone, it's just, it's like I'm watching the cartoon.

527
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It's fantastic.

528
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And the humor and it's great.

529
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
There's so many small references to all the different episodes in the series.

530
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's seriously packed with so much fan service.

531
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's ridiculous.

532
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I can't wait to play the game, but I haven't been able to tackle it yet.

533
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But it's definitely on my to-do list.

534
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

535
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Alright, that's it?

536
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Just South Park this week for you?

537
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Uh, a little Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

538
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And, yeah, I think that was it.

539
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Alright.

540
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
My gaming week wasn't too thrilling, but keep in mind I'm going through this,

541
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
just keep in mind I'm going through this whole move thing right now.

542
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
So, I don't have a whole lot to share besides I've been playing Diablo 3 quite a bit.

543
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Click, click, click, find treasure, click, click, adventure is Diablo 3.

544
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I've actually finally hit max level and I'm going through the Paragon levels.

545
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think at last check I was Paragon 9 was where I was at in the game.

546
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So, yeah, quite the turnaround from not really caring for Diablo a lot a lot at first,

547
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
but now I've been playing more and more of that.

548
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The 2.0 patch really did great things.

549
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The 50% experience boost they've got going right now is a great incentive to get back in there and check it out.

550
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So, yeah, I approve of what they've been doing there with Diablo 3.

551
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And that's honestly, like between that and Final Fantasy XIV, that's really it.

552
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I downloaded stuff to hopefully play some more things,

553
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
but just with moving and everything I haven't been able to do a lot a lot.

554
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So, that's that.

555
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
So, that's it for my gaming week.

556
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So, let's go to housekeeping.

557
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Just a few quick things for you guys here and then we're going to get into gaming news.

558
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Very important for housekeeping.

559
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
If you haven't heard, it's been all over the network this weekend,

560
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
but over at the Voice of Geeks Network, we have a brand new show that just joined the network over the weekend.

561
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
That show is the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast and we want to welcome them to the network.

562
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
If you've heard of this show before, probably because Grandpa, one of the hosts of Hoard House, which is on Wednesday nights,

563
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
actually launched this show as a Star Trek fan podcast and it's a lot of fun.

564
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I actually was honored to be a guest on the show this last week on episode number five

565
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
and we talked about a particular episode of Deep Space Nine

566
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
and I was able to talk about some of my stories about going to the Star Trek experience and some of the live things.

567
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
And yeah, they're very, very well versed on Star Trek.

568
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So, if you're a fan of the show, we urge you to check out the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

569
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It is going to be a premiere show on VOG Network, meaning we play it before it hits the feed

570
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
and that will be Thursdays at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern,

571
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and then it's going to repeat on Fridays at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern.

572
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But guess what? We're going to do something new.

573
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We're trying some new things with the new shows we launched in 2014.

574
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
We're actually going to preview a brand new episode of the Starboard Power Coupling Podcast.

575
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
We're going to preview that episode tonight after OLR.

576
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So, if you live listeners that like to stay up really late, we're going to play that show for you.

577
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And it actually happens to be that episode I was on this week

578
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and it's the only time we're going to be able to broadcast this episode on VOG

579
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
because come Thursday, they'll be on episode number six.

580
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So, episode five, we'll play one time on the feed.

581
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You're going to hear that tonight, a special preview episode after OLR.

582
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That's only for the live listeners.

583
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
For those of you guys that are listening on the podcast feed,

584
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
though, we urge you to go on over to vognetwork.com and check out the show.

585
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You can also check out the show on their website, starboardpowercoupling.com.

586
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
All right, that's I think all I have for housekeeping.

587
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I know we've said this before, there is no show next week due to the move.

588
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
We will not be here next week. We will be back in two weeks.

589
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
But we will have a show that was priorly taped during the week

590
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
that will play on the feed and on the podcast.

591
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
So most people won't notice a hiccup except the fact that next week's show will be shorter as a result.

592
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
All right, let's get into the news. There's quite a bit that's happened this week, right, Loki?

593
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That's right. One of the things that happened this week was Jack Trenton.

594
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He is stepping down as the president of Sony Computer Entertainment.

595
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And apparently his contract with Sony was up March 31st and is not being renewed.

596
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And apparently this is a mutual agreement, so I guess he's moving on to other things.

597
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And they're going to get some new blood as the president of the company, which should be interesting.

598
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
As long as it's not, you know, kutaragi.

599
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We don't need cranny eating again.

600
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But yeah, so they're going to have, I guess, Sean Layden will be taking over as president.

601
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And he's been with the company for 15 years. So it'll be interesting.

602
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I know, you know, I haven't really been too familiar with Jack Trenton,

603
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,000
but I know he definitely made a good impression on people at last year's E3.

604
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So it'll be interesting to see how, you know, if their focus changes any,

605
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
or if they kind of keep on with what they're doing right now.

606
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, this news kind of, I mean, it came out of nowhere in a way.

607
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
But I mean, these sort of stories usually do, you know.

608
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
These guys, they have their lives and they, you know, sometimes look for other opportunities,

609
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
as many of us do in our own lives, looking for jobs and so forth.

610
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So, you know, when I heard this news about Jack Trenton, I was kind of, I was a little surprised,

611
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
because I was like, wow, he's leaving when things are going really well for Sony.

612
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But then I also took a step back and I said, you know what, he's leaving when things are going really well for Sony.

613
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I mean, Sony, during Jack Trenton's tenure, has really had some ups and downs.

614
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I mean, he came in at a time when Sony was really being shit on after E3,

615
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and he really helped to steer the boat around.

616
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And there was some low points. It was certainly not perfect,

617
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
because, you know, the PlayStation hack and all that happened on his watch.

618
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
But he did what he had to do to make it right and try to make PlayStation Plus a really great deal,

619
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
which, you know, a lot of people are loving the PlayStation Plus.

620
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And, of course, the PlayStation 4 very successful.

621
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So, in many ways, you know, with all the news we've seen about how the PlayStation 4 has been selling,

622
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
he's leaving in a way kind of at the top of the game.

623
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I mean, one could argue that, well, the Vita could be at a better spot.

624
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
But, you know what, he's leaving on a high note.

625
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And I kind of go, okay, well, that, you know, you want to leave when things are on a high note.

626
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And we'll find out after his tenure maybe if another company has snatched him up.

627
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Sometimes you hear about these things in advance, and sometimes you don't.

628
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Like, I think about when Don Mattrick left Xbox, really not that long ago.

629
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That was announced right away that he was going to Zynga.

630
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But, you know, I don't know. It was just a different situation over there.

631
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Could he be the new CEO for King?

632
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
God, I hope not. Don't even tease. That's awful.

633
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Well, I wonder, too, you know, these guys that go that high up,

634
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
he might not necessarily end up in the games industry.

635
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I mean, it's usually an assumption that they're going to end up in a tech place somewhere.

636
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But not necessarily. That's what I'm saying, not necessarily.

637
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com theorizing, saying,

638
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I wonder where he will go to next. Watch him go to Google or Moto.

639
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Hey, you know what, nothing like that's out of the question.

640
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
You know Reggie Fils-Aime over at Nintendo, very charismatic guy over at Nintendo.

641
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You know what Reggie Fils-Aime, one of the jobs he did before he was at Nintendo?

642
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
You know what company he was an executive for?

643
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
If I'm not mistaken, somebody might call me out on this,

644
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
but I believe it was Panda Express was the company he was with.

645
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Don't say that while I'm drinking stuff.

646
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But you like Panda Express.

647
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'd have to go back and look. I thought it was Panda Express, though.

648
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, Bobby said Panda Express.

649
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Yeah. Oh, I trust Bobby. Bobby knows.

650
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But yeah, and of course, obviously, they...

651
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Now it's some freaking orange chicken.

652
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Right? The hot and sour soup's the bomb.

653
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't like hot and sour soup. But I love the orange chicken.

654
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So...

655
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
God damn it.

656
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Yeah, he was with Panda Management Company as Senior Vice President,

657
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and then he was also with VH1 for a while.

658
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
He was also... Oh, this is why he's a badass, ladies and gentlemen.

659
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
He was also a Pizza Hut, so both answers were right.

660
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
He was Senior Director of National Marketing and Pizza Hut.

661
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
He was also a Proctor and Gamble.

662
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And Reggie Fils-Aime, you'll love this, DarkSakura,

663
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Head of Marketing for Guinness in the United States.

664
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
No wonder he's such a badass, right?

665
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Fucking love Guinness.

666
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Now I want fucking Guinness and orange chicken,

667
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and I'm gonna call it the Reggie meal.

668
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Why not?

669
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Then you have to...

670
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But in order to fully be the Reggie meal,

671
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
you would have to play around a Mario Kart or something when it's done.

672
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Then I'd throw up.

673
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't know. That just seems like a...

674
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Well, if you throw up, then your body wasn't ready.

675
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And DarkSakura has just died.

676
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen, she has just fallen out of her chair and died.

677
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
My butt's half on the chair.

678
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Rest in peace, DarkSakura.

679
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm calling this pulling a Bill Cosby now,

680
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
because did you watch Bill Cosby on the Daily Show?

681
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
No.

682
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
He kept falling out of the chair.

683
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It was hilarious.

684
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So I'm calling this pulling a Bill Cosby.

685
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Alright, fine.

686
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
It's a good thing it's a radio show, DarkSakura,

687
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
because I can see you right now.

688
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
My back hurts.

689
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Alright, speaking of Reggie and Mario Kart,

690
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
hey, Mario Kart 8 is gearing up,

691
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
and they're gonna really push the crap out of this game,

692
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
because this is a huge release for the Wii U.

693
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
We talked last week about how you're not gonna be able to play Mario Kart 7 online anymore,

694
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and does it or does it not tie into this?

695
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't know. We'll find out.

696
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
In fact, we have a very interesting email on the whole thing coming up later.

697
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
We'll talk about that.

698
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But Mario Kart 8 is on its way out,

699
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
and some very interesting sponsorships to try to get awareness out there.

700
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And one company that they've partnered up with to promote Mario Kart 8 is Pennzoil.

701
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Now, I get that Pennzoil is obviously a motor...

702
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If you guys don't know, that's a motor oil that they put in your car.

703
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And if you didn't know that and you drive,

704
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
you want to go get your oil changed once in a while.

705
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Pennzoil makes other additives and stuff.

706
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
They do. That's true.

707
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And they're big in the racing circuit, obviously.

708
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh my god, could you imagine the Mario NASCAR car?

709
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
They need to get Danica to get rid of GoDaddy and advertise Mario.

710
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Well, anyway, so Pennzoil announced on Twitter that they are teaming up with Nintendo

711
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
to promote Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U,

712
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
and they're actually planning a demo at South by Southwest,

713
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
which is obviously a huge event down in Austin that they do.

714
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, you know, no surprise, they're taking the game there.

715
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But it's just interesting that Pennzoil is kind of the sponsor.

716
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Usually, you don't... I don't know.

717
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't know. That's just not usually the type of company I see partnering,

718
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
but it obviously makes a lot of sense, even though Pennzoil is something I think of for real cars,

719
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and Mario Kart is very fake in a way.

720
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Like, look at some of the art for Mario.

721
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Doesn't it look like they're trying to make Mario riding Tron bikes best they can

722
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
without it actually being a Tron bike?

723
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah.

724
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
And that whole thing.

725
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Loki, what do you think about the partnership between Pennzoil and Mario Kart?

726
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I don't think it's that big a deal.

727
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm just wondering if we're going to see in-game advertisement for Pennzoil

728
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and for all these other companies that they're partnering with,

729
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
because maybe they're not confident enough that the game will make enough money on its own.

730
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But, I mean, as far as, like, partnering with other retailers

731
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
and different things for certain games, it's not anything new.

732
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I mean, hell, they have, you know, merchandising with Kinects and stuff for toys, so why not?

733
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Some folks in chat correcting me.

734
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Dark Tetsuya said, I said Mario Kart 7, and I think you meant Mario Kart Wii.

735
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Mario Kart 7 isn't, yeah, I misspoke.

736
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Mario Kart 7 is 3DS, sorry.

737
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yes, I meant Mario Kart Wii.

738
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But I'm sure there's people playing Mario Kart 7 as well.

739
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
But you can still play that through Nintendo Network as far as I know, so sorry about that.

740
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I did misspeak.

741
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Also in our chat room, Tigerclaw says it's a real-life Mario Kart, I guess,

742
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and he actually links me to his story.

743
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

744
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Also, one other quick note on Mario Kart, because, you know, it's not that far away, all things considered,

745
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
for such a huge game, just a couple months away.

746
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Mario Kart's going to get a limited edition in Europe for Mario Kart 8.

747
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It will come with a spiny shell collector's item.

748
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yes, you can have your very own blue shell.

749
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
No word if it will work if you throw it at people on the freeway, however.

750
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It has a tail, but, like, two butt holes.

751
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It actually looks kind of like a face with a weird helmet on it.

752
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That's where the leg goes, that's where the other leg goes.

753
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But it looks like either two butt holes or a weird face with a spiky helmet on it.

754
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Well, how else is it supposed to rock it up to first place?

755
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I approve of that fart joke.

756
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh my gosh. Anyway, so yeah, there you go.

757
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You can check that out. You can pre-order either retail or you can pre-order as a standalone game,

758
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and you can get a Mario Kart themed key ring.

759
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Again, that is all in the UK.

760
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
No word if we have anything similar here in the US,

761
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
although I would think they're going to try to do something here in the US,

762
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
especially for the Nintendo diehards.

763
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Like, even a soundtrack or something. Who knows?

764
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
If I were to guess, they'd probably announce something on another Nintendo Direct,

765
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
usually between once they've announced the date for the game and when it comes out.

766
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But it's nothing so far that I've heard of.

767
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Gotcha. So, that's pretty cool that Mario Kart 8 is going to be at South by Southwest.

768
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I know people really want to play this game.

769
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Do you think Nintendo might have some hands-on availability soon for the game?

770
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Like, you know, they've got those demo kiosks all over, like Game Stops and stuff, right?

771
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Do you think they might have some hands-on availability really soon?

772
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Maybe. It'd be a good way to sell the system.

773
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I would think so. I would keep an eye on that stuff,

774
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
because I bet they're going to have the Mario Kart demos playable really soon

775
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
at places like Game Stop and all that stuff, so check that out.

776
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Because I seem to recall some of the other Nintendo stuff.

777
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
They had about six weeks before it was actually out there.

778
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Like, remember the E3 demos they had?

779
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I want to say Mario was available in the stores beforehand,

780
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
so I would think you're going to start to see Mario Kart 8, like, at the end of the month.

781
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Alright, let's move on. More news. DarkSakura.

782
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I got some stuff. This is actually about Keiji Inafune.

783
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
As we know, he's the guy who created Mega Man,

784
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,000
but there is a 2D side-scroller game coming up for the 3DS eShop called Azure Striker Gunvolt,

785
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
which is supposed to play as some dude named Gunvolt,

786
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and he has lightning powers, and he's trying to...

787
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
He's actually running away from a psychic girl that he was trying to kill.

788
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
But it looks like one of the Mega Man games as far as how it plays,

789
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
but it's got some other stuff going on with it that just...

790
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's supposed to change exactly how it plays, and I was watching a little bit of the play,

791
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and it seems like it's pretty neat.

792
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
He's also collaborating with Team Ninja on a zombie spin-off game called...

793
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
A zombie spin-off of Ninja Gaiden called Yaba.

794
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Azure Striker Gunvolt is going to be out in Japan in the summer,

795
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
but nothing about the west, of course.

796
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I had no idea. I guess I just wasn't paying good enough attention.

797
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I had no idea that he was working on anything besides that Kickstarter project at all.

798
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
This information came out from Gematsu.

799
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
He announced it at the BitSummit Indie Games Festival in Kyoto.

800
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Which is interesting, because this is the type of thing they could have sat on for an E3 or something.

801
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
No, that's awesome that they did it at an indie game festival.

802
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It looks pretty neat.

803
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Very cool, yeah. I definitely want to check it out.

804
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah.

805
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Loki, any thoughts on this game?

806
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Azure Striker Gunvolt?

807
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It looks cool.

808
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't know.

809
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Hopefully it doesn't get lost amongst all the other games I have to play this coming month.

810
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
We're starting to get into a crazy time of year.

811
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Well, good for you. It's going to slow down.

812
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Oh, that's good. Well, I've got to play South Park.

813
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Once this move settles down, that's on my absolute to-do list.

814
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And then the Final Fantasy X and X-2 remasters.

815
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I have to do those. I love those games.

816
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah, I don't think those are...

817
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You don't have to hurry that much on those.

818
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
You've played them before.

819
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I know it's not for everybody, but I've got to.

820
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I've got to.

821
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
We'll see. We'll see how far I get before I go like,

822
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Ooh, distraction.

823
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What can I do for you?

824
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You can make Loki read the next story.

825
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Hey, Loki, read the next story.

826
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Alright, I guess I will.

827
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So, we haven't talked about this company in a while,

828
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
but OnLive is back in the news.

829
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
They've got a brand new service called CloudLift,

830
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
and what CloudLift is doing is going to be offering

831
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
some different games on there.

832
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I don't know if they're necessarily rebooting the whole thing,

833
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
but it looks like they have 20 games right now,

834
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
and it's going to include Saints Row IV, Batman Arkham City,

835
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
but they're also saying that they're going to have some MMOs as well at some point.

836
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
I guess they mentioned Second Life Go.

837
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I don't know if that's any different than...

838
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I guess that was the one that's on Android,

839
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
but it's kind of interesting that they're kind of going that route in there.

840
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I don't know if it's necessarily going to be console games anymore,

841
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
or if it's going to be more like PC or something.

842
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Also, they're saying with that, they're going to have it

843
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
where you can, of course, subscribe to stuff,

844
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
be able to stream games that you've purchased on Steam or Origin

845
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
or any other services that are compatible with OnLive as well.

846
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So it looks like you'll be able to stream your own games,

847
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
plus stream games that maybe you don't own,

848
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
or you can buy games through them and that kind of stuff.

849
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So a little bit of a mutation of OnLive.

850
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
It'll be interesting to see how it goes.

851
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I've got to say, Loki, I'm kind of with you

852
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
that I did not realize that OnLive was still around.

853
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I thought that they had folded for some weird reason.

854
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Did they get sold or something?

855
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Yeah, they got sold.

856
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Oh, so this is the big reboot for them, right?

857
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I think so, yeah.

858
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

859
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So yeah, I'm trying to see what happened.

860
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
They had the OnLive desktop that came out in 2012,

861
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and then on August 17th of 2012, the company laid off all its employees.

862
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So okay, so we're not crazy.

863
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Something really big did happen there,

864
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and then they sold off the assets and started a new company,

865
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
also called OnLive.

866
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Yeah, so with the OnLive stuff, like I said, they have CloudLift,

867
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
which this is what they're doing the beta test on right now,

868
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
and that basically allows you to download games into the cloud,

869
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
or you basically own a download copy at home

870
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and play it in the cloud on multiple devices at any time.

871
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Got it.

872
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
So they're saying also that they still have that play pack,

873
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
which is kind of like how OnLive was before.

874
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
It's like an instant cloud library,

875
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
so all these different games you can try for free and stuff.

876
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
So I don't know, it's a neat idea.

877
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, Tigerclaw kind of puts us in another light in our chatroom

878
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

879
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Tigerclaw says,

880
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
This seems interesting because as your Steam library grows,

881
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
so will the amount of storage required to install them.

882
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So having the ability to stream the games you already own

883
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
would be a good way to play them

884
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
without the need to install them in the first place.

885
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
You know, that is a good thought,

886
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
because I don't really want to run out and get a new hard drive,

887
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
and I'm kind of limited with the 500 gigs I have right now.

888
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Or, here's another idea,

889
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
with the fact that they're saying that you can have games

890
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
streaming to an Android tablet,

891
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
you can take your Steam library with you on your tablet,

892
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
just go ahead and play it on the go.

893
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Maybe be able to sync a Bluetooth controller to it or something

894
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and be able to play games like that.

895
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That'd be kind of cool.

896
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
It's very similar to the PlayStation 4 and the Vita,

897
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
the whole remote play thing, or even the Wii U in some ways, right?

898
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, and then they also have the option

899
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
where they're going to allow you to play with a set-top box.

900
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So they have some compatible stuff,

901
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
some smart TVs they're going to support on live as well.

902
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
One being, I guess they have the Google TV by LG

903
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
that's going to support it,

904
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
and the Vizio CoStar R2 that's support on live right now.

905
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But, I don't know, I think it sounds kind of cool.

906
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah, I'll be very curious to see

907
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
maybe if they have a big presence at E3 this year,

908
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
as they did a few years ago when that company first started,

909
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
and everybody was like, this technology will never work.

910
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I remember being at that E3 going,

911
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
this is never going to work, and it worked.

912
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
It was crazy.

913
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Alright, well let's move on and talk about another type of streaming,

914
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
and that is Twitch.

915
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
You know, Twitch has been in the news a lot lately,

916
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
and they've really kind of been blown up as a big gaming company.

917
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I mean, not in the same way as other companies

918
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
where they're actually making games,

919
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
but Twitch really is doing big things with gaming.

920
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And the next big thing is streaming for iOS and Android.

921
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
That's right, pretty soon you're going to be able to stream, capture,

922
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
and archive your gameplay on Android and iOS devices

923
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
when developers enable the functionality in their games

924
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
with Twitch's Mobile Software Development Kit.

925
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
So that's an important thing,

926
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
is that this isn't like something you're going to be able to run

927
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
in the background and stream anything.

928
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
They're going to have to put this in the game

929
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and offer the Twitch support within the game.

930
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But I'm sure there will be plenty of games that actually pick this up.

931
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Think of the way like Minecraft has Twitch streaming built in,

932
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Path of Exile has Twitch streaming built in.

933
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I can't think of other games,

934
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
but I know there's others out there that have that all built in.

935
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And that's what's going to happen on some mobile phone games,

936
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
so they have to actually implement that.

937
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
And so once it's implemented,

938
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
users can actually work with video capture options

939
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
for like the front-facing camera,

940
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
so it can be pointed at you while you play.

941
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Audio capture using either an internal or an external microphone,

942
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and you can actually archive the stream on Twitch and all that.

943
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
So yeah, this is going to be very interesting

944
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,000
to see what games implement this and where it goes.

945
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I would think that maybe Minecraft Pocket Edition

946
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
seems like a likely candidate,

947
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
if Minecraft has really embraced that whole thing.

948
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It'll be very interesting to see what games implement this.

949
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Also, big news out of Twitch.

950
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Big steps to make themselves the new E3 place,

951
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
the place to see all the E3 content,

952
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
because G4 was the big place,

953
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
and they kind of went poop.

954
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And Spike TV I think kind of picked up the slack for a couple years,

955
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and I imagine is still going to do some things involving E3.

956
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
However, Twitch has signed a three-year deal

957
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
to be the gaming conference's official streaming partner.

958
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So this means that official conference streams

959
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
will be broadcast through Twitch,

960
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
which if anybody tried to watch the Nintendo streams on Ustream,

961
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
this is great fucking news, just saying.

962
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I would assume. I don't know.

963
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Does the Nintendo Directs count as part of E3?

964
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
They might not.

965
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But at least you know the Sony and the Microsoft ones and the EA and all that.

966
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That'll all be through Twitch.

967
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
At least they have the YouTube live ones,

968
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
because the Nintendo Directs over Ustream fucking suck.

969
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
That's true.

970
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Nintendo started implementing the YouTubes as well, huh?

971
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't know.

972
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's yet to see if they're going to do Twitch as well.

973
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
But anyway, convention attendees are going to see Twitch feeds on monitors.

974
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
So that's going to be very interesting,

975
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
like actually at the convention.

976
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
There you go.

977
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
No word if those monitors will just be Twitch playing Pokemon

978
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
or Twitch playing E3 attendees or who knows what.

979
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
So there you go.

980
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Big news coming out of Twitch.

981
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Very interesting, the story of that company, especially.

982
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You know, I know earlier in the show,

983
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I talked about when we were streaming OLR on Justin TV.

984
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
If you think about it, that whole phenomenon started as a guy

985
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
who wore a webcam on his head everywhere he went.

986
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And here we are.

987
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That has morphed into now this E3 partner company.

988
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's really, really astonishing.

989
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Yeah.

990
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So anyway, let us move on.

991
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Well, I feel really bad for our friends in South Africa

992
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
because guess what they don't get?

993
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Titanfall.

994
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You know why?

995
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Because their internet sucks.

996
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Basically, and this is the official word coming out of EA,

997
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
after conducting recent online tests for Titanfall,

998
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
we found that these performance rates in South Africa

999
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
were not as high as we need to guarantee a great experience.

1000
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
So we have decided not to release Titanfall in South America at this time.

1001
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
You mean South Africa?

1002
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
South Africa.

1003
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Sorry, South Africa.

1004
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah, it's coming out in South America, somewhere there anyway.

1005
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
So basically, they're like, sorry, but your internet sucks.

1006
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Get all of your upgrades to go in and we'll consider it.

1007
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So another fuck you to EA.

1008
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
People in South Africa deserve to play Titanfall.

1009
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
It's a lose-lose situation.

1010
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's a lose-lose situation because if the game doesn't function properly,

1011
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
then they're going to get bitched at.

1012
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
If they hold it back, they're going to get bitched at.

1013
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
They should have never announced the game in the region in the first place.

1014
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Shoulda, coulda, woulda.

1015
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah, there's no easy, I mean, maybe they could cut the cord a little bit

1016
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
with how much server reliance there is, but let's be real,

1017
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Titanfall is designed to be a multiplayer game.

1018
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Invest in the South African economy so that you can improve web service there

1019
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
and then sell a bajillion copies of your game.

1020
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Not really.

1021
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't know if there's that big of a gaming audience in South Africa,

1022
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
but there's certainly some people that are going to be pissed.

1023
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
100% serious.

1024
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
But, I mean, they need to do the research before they say,

1025
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
oh yeah, you're going to get this.

1026
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So it's just disgusting.

1027
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's another way that EA is fucked up.

1028
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Ouch.

1029
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
All right, well, let's see what games are going to be coming to regions this week.

1030
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Sadly, we don't do South African release dates, but we do.

1031
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I could try.

1032
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
We do start with U.S. release dates.

1033
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So, Loki.

1034
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Well, since we're not in South Africa,

1035
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
we are getting Titanfall on Xbox One and PC this week.

1036
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Also, if you don't happen to own an Xbox One or PC,

1037
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
you can get Dark Souls 2, I guess.

1038
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
That's a good compromise, right?

1039
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So that will be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1040
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Beyond that, there wasn't really a whole bunch else.

1041
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Let's see.

1042
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
We've also got, on 3DS at the end of the week,

1043
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
the brand new Yoshi's New Island.

1044
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So that will be coming out.

1045
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And, let's see, what else?

1046
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh, some other games here.

1047
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's see, Atelier Asia and Loji,

1048
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Alchemist of the Dust Sky on PlayStation 3.

1049
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And then, because this game is going to truly be next gen,

1050
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Putty Squad on PlayStation 4, PS3, and Vita this week as well.

1051
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But you probably don't need that on PlayStation 4.

1052
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And by the way, this wouldn't be on your list

1053
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
because I know you do retail stuff

1054
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
and this game is coming on Steam and Humble Store

1055
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
and digital platforms.

1056
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
But our guest that's coming on later, the SEG,

1057
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
wants us to make sure that we plug Dominique Pamplemousse

1058
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
this week as well.

1059
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And that's on Tuesday,

1060
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
and we'll give SEG plenty of time to promote the crap out of that.

1061
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
But that is this week in the digital distribution channels.

1062
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
All right, let's travel over to Japan

1063
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
and check out what's coming out there.

1064
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I don't know if they get the Pamplemousse this week as well.

1065
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I'll have to ask SEG how the worldwide stuff works.

1066
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
But I can tell you what is coming out on their consoles over there.

1067
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
They are still basking in the launch of the PlayStation 4,

1068
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
so we have no new games this week.

1069
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
But we do have some games over on the PlayStation 3.

1070
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Just like Loki mentioned a minute ago,

1071
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Dark Souls 2 is coming out there

1072
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
in a regular and collector's edition.

1073
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I don't know how well these games do in Japan.

1074
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Perhaps I see AkumaJP's in chat, maybe he knows.

1075
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I don't know if these games are very well received over there

1076
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,000
because they're not like Final Fantasy games or other types of JRPGs.

1077
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
They're hard as hell.

1078
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I think there would be a certain allure to those, but we'll see.

1079
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But those games are out on the PlayStation 3 this week,

1080
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Dark Souls 2 in regular and collector's edition.

1081
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Also on the Xbox 360.

1082
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
By the way, Xbox 360 getting a ton of stuff

1083
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
in the Platinum Collection as well in Japan,

1084
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
including Forza Horizon, Gears of War trilogy pack,

1085
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and also there's some Xbox Live membership cards coming out in Japan

1086
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
that are Titanfall branded.

1087
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
But yet, I don't see Titanfall on their release schedule.

1088
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So, I don't know, that's weird.

1089
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
On the PlayStation Vita, Phantom Breaker Battlegrounds on the 13th of March,

1090
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
like all these other games are coming out.

1091
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And lastly but not leastly, taking a look at the Wii U and the 3DS.

1092
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
On the 3DS, we have Chujin Ultra Baseball Card Battle.

1093
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
For those of you that want to play baseball,

1094
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
would you want to do it with cards?

1095
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
But Rob, why would you be surprised if Titanfall is not coming to Japan?

1096
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
The Xbox One hasn't launched there.

1097
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I said 360.

1098
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh yeah, that's not until the end of the month.

1099
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Ah, okay, there you go.

1100
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So, yeah, no, we still don't know when the Xbox One is out in Japan, right?

1101
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
We're thinking at this point it's going to be holiday, right?

1102
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Ah, who knows.

1103
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I don't know.

1104
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
One thing I am eyeing on the 3DS, this is a week off,

1105
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:19,000
but on the 20th they're getting Game Center CX Sanchome no Arino.

1106
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Is this the sequel to Retro Game Challenge?

1107
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Because I kind of think it is.

1108
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
There was supposed to be a third one coming, yeah.

1109
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That is fucking awesome.

1110
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Well, that's coming to Japan.

1111
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Like, yeah, I'm almost positive that's what this game is,

1112
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
is the Retro Game Challenge, the next game in that series on the 3DS.

1113
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah, the Game Center, yeah.

1114
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Yeah, hot.

1115
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
All right, oh, quickly, I'm taking a peek at the Wii U.

1116
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Nothing on the Wii U this week.

1117
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Nothing new on the Wii U until the 27th.

1118
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
So how about the UK, DarkSakura?

1119
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
There's some stuff coming out.

1120
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I mean, we know that on the 13th Titanfall is the big thing over there.

1121
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
But before that, 1954 Alcatraz is going to be out on the 11th,

1122
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and then that's for PC and Mac.

1123
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And then, like I said, on the 13th is Titanfall for,

1124
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
it looks like Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC, it's saying.

1125
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And then on the 14th we have Dark Souls 2,

1126
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Darksiders Collection, and Red Faction Collection,

1127
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and Yoshi's New Island.

1128
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And that be all.

1129
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
All right.

1130
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
By the way, AkumaJP telling me that Dark Souls sells like hotcakes

1131
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
over there in Japan, since I'd asked.

1132
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Thank you, Akuma.

1133
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game,

1134
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
O of the Week.

1135
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Loki.

1136
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
All right.

1137
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
So since we just got done talking about OnLive,

1138
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
a service that we thought wasn't around anymore,

1139
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
this one I'm surprised is still around, and that is the Ouya.

1140
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Well, as a last-ditch effort to make themselves relevant,

1141
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
they have launched a new, I guess, focus that's called Ouya Everywhere.

1142
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's basically Ouya without buying an Ouya.

1143
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
So you are able to have the Ouya storefront and the OS

1144
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and that kind of stuff, but you'll be able to play it on TVs, PCs,

1145
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
even without actually having a system.

1146
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And I guess one of the partners that they announced already,

1147
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I guess the first one, crazy enough, is their competitor,

1148
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
the Mad Catz Mojo microconsole, which is coming out later this spring.

1149
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And that will support the Ouya.

1150
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I don't get it.

1151
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I mean, because at this point, it's like saying,

1152
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
well, if I don't need the console to play these games,

1153
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
especially a lot of these games that are on the Ouya console are on PCs,

1154
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:53,000
so why would I get this for PC to play Android games that are also on PC?

1155
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I don't understand.

1156
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yeah, it's interesting.

1157
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
This does seem a little bit like, help, we're Ouya, help, look at us.

1158
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
You know what I mean?

1159
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Yeah, here's their quote.

1160
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
It says, one thing you'll start to see is Ouya on other people's devices.

1161
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
We started with a $99 box, but we always wanted to create a console platform.

1162
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
No, they didn't always want to create a console platform, come on.

1163
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
They wanted to create a console platform that could live on other people's devices.

1164
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That was never the plan.

1165
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
The plan is to make these microconsoles, and you thought they would take off, and they did.

1166
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
We just knew it was going to take a little bit of time to get it ready.

1167
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Now, we think the software is good enough.

1168
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
It'll be ready to be embedded in other people's devices.

1169
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
We actually start having some of these conversations during CES,

1170
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and the take-up was so great that we're jumping into strategy with both of our feet this year.

1171
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Now, here's the thing with that Mojo console.

1172
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I think that even implements stuff a lot better than, say, the Ouya does,

1173
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:03,000
because you can map the controls for any games, even games that are not meant to have actual controller inputs.

1174
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
They're just touch screen only.

1175
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You can kind of map them so that they work with it.

1176
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I just don't know.

1177
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Honestly, it's been a while since I've looked at the Ouya,

1178
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:19,000
but their interface in OS was a piece of shit and a fucking mess the last time I looked at it.

1179
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:27,000
They must have done some serious revisions or something because I just don't see how this would be even worth it.

1180
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
It's almost to me like getting the Amazon Marketplace on my phone or something like that.

1181
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I have the standard Google Play Store, or I can use this Amazon one for some reason,

1182
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
even though the same things are on both. I don't know.

1183
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Didn't you sell your Ouya, or are you still using it as a doorstop?

1184
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Oh, no, I sold it a long time ago.

1185
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
All right. One more story for you guys about a game that definitely makes people perk up when we talk about it,

1186
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
and that is Portal. Who doesn't love that series?

1187
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Will there ever be a Portal 3, I wonder?

1188
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's not what this story is about, but it just makes me openly wonder.

1189
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Valve can't count to three.

1190
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Yeah, Valve can't count to three.

1191
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
However, we will talk about another way you can experience the joy and wonder of the Portal universe,

1192
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
and that is through a board game.

1193
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
We don't talk about board games enough on this show, but board games are pretty sweet.

1194
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Most of them. There's a few stinkers out there, I'm sure, but I bet this will be a lot of fun.

1195
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It's the Portal board game coming from Valve and Cryptozoic.

1196
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
It is supposed to be hitting shelves a little later this year.

1197
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
They don't have a final title yet.

1198
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
The working title is Portal Uncooperative Cake Acquisition Game, which sounds good to me.

1199
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
I mean, it makes sense, and obviously everybody gets the joke with the cake and so forth.

1200
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Apparently, in the game, even though they say cooperative in the title, it's very uncooperative, as the title says.

1201
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:01,000
It's very competitive where you play from two to four players, and you actually play as a test subject in a test environment,

1202
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
and you try to either kill off your opponent's pawns, or you might get yourself killed.

1203
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Now, you do cooperate once in a while if you're trying to kill somebody else.

1204
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So, there might be that whole, like, oh, Jamie and I are gonna team up to take Matt out, but then we have to turn on each other.

1205
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
So, there'll be some of that diabolical gameplay.

1206
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I don't know what you're talking about. Prepare for deadly neurotoxin.

1207
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So, and yeah, I don't know if this is what the game looks like there, that we're looking at a little picture here in studio,

1208
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
but that looks kind of cool, like it's got an isometric sort of look to it.

1209
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I wonder if it'll actually be like a three-dimensional kind of board. So, we'll see.

1210
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
But yeah, you can check that out a little later this year on the Portal board game.

1211
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Would you check out a Portal board game, Dark Soccer?

1212
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I might.

1213
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I might? Alright.

1214
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Alright, well, in the meantime, Dark Soccer's gonna go into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, this is a classic game.

1215
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
This time I'm riding a bicycle through the vault.

1216
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
That's right. Oh, you're gonna get on your bike and ride through the vault.

1217
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Yep.

1218
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
She's getting her prop cycle on, yo.

1219
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
No, no, no. Not a prop cycle. This is a bike. Remember, we're old school.

1220
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That wasn't the game of the week.

1221
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And I'm running over people's lawns.

1222
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Oh, I think I know where this is going.

1223
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
And throwing things through their windows and being chased out by dogs and people break dancing and cars.

1224
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Have you guys figured out where the classic game of the week is going?

1225
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1226
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
It's Paperboy. Yay.

1227
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yay.

1228
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Yeah. Um, I love the music in Paperboy so much.

1229
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Like this music right here, right after you select the level.

1230
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I have to, we have to hear this.

1231
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Which I just want to say for the people that end up seeing this on YouTube later on,

1232
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
because we do put all our shows up on YouTube as well at username OrangeLawnsRadio.

1233
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
The person who recorded this Playboy playthrough is like totally cheating.

1234
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Hacks left, look, he's riding through fences and through houses.

1235
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah.

1236
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
He is the hacking.

1237
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Got it because it has the music.

1238
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah, this is not very classic gameplay, but at least it is classic music.

1239
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Yeah, because I like being able to find the arcade music.

1240
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
And this is the longest one I could find.

1241
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
It didn't have people fucking talking over it.

1242
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Hey, look at me, I'm playing Paperboy.

1243
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Boy, I'm terrible at this game.

1244
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Anyway, you play as a boy delivering paper.

1245
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So you have to deliver the newspapers to your subscribers,

1246
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
vandalize the non-subscribers home, and still avoid all the hazards.

1247
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And you lose your subscribers by missing your delivery or damaging your subscriber's house.

1248
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So you have three levels of difficulty.

1249
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You have easy street, middle road, and hard way.

1250
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Which, I just thought of the name.

1251
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
You know, we're clever.

1252
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
So you have to perfectly deliver the papers to your subscribers for an entire week and not crash.

1253
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Which will eat up alive.

1254
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And that's before the week ends.

1255
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And so you have seven in-game days.

1256
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
You have Monday through Sunday.

1257
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I guess you get the Sunday paper too.

1258
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So, the houses are really easy to tell apart.

1259
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Your subscribers look like they have regular houses.

1260
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Your non-subscribers have red windows and black houses.

1261
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And they're kind of creepy looking.

1262
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And you have really weird neighbors.

1263
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Like, really weird people in the neighborhood.

1264
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So you have, as far as your hazards, you have fire hydrants, storm drains, break dancers, cars, skateboards, drunks,

1265
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,000
kids with radio-controlled toys, and then you have a tornado, oversized house cats, and the grand reaper.

1266
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
You also have to cross intersections that have motorcycles and cars going through.

1267
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And then, you can actually throw your papers, though, at some of the people.

1268
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Like the people fighting in the street and the break dancer.

1269
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
And you get extra points for doing that.

1270
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And you have to pick up more stacks of papers as you go.

1271
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:49,000
A perfect delivery is when you deliver to all of your subscriber and you get double points for each house that you deliver to.

1272
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
If you get a perfect delivery.

1273
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
You also have a training course at the end that basically lets you practice doing stuff in different levels.

1274
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And then you get a recap of your delivery.

1275
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
The chatters are calling me out saying I called this game Playboy.

1276
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Did I call this game Playboy?

1277
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I didn't pay attention.

1278
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I meant to say Paperboy.

1279
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But you know what?

1280
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
If it was a topless girl riding a bike, that would be something to play, too.

1281
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
That would be BMX XXX.

1282
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I guess y'all know where my mind was at.

1283
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:35,000
So anyway, when you get anything happening in the game, you get an actual paper that shows your little Paperboy guy on it.

1284
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Like if you do perfect, Paperboy wins an award for outstanding paper delivery.

1285
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:45,000
If you lose all your lives, you get one that says Paperboy calls it quits.

1286
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And if you lose all your subscribers, you get a headline that says Paperboy fired.

1287
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
With a digital voice going you're fired.

1288
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
And there's different voice clips in the game, too.

1289
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:01,000
There's one that says Paperboy stopped me at nothing in his valiant effort to save this land from TV journalism.

1290
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And then you get the list you hang ten when you run into a skateboarder.

1291
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And then when you run over tricyclists, he says I hate that kid.

1292
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:20,000
So it's running on the Atari System 2 hardware with a 10 megahertz digital equipment corporation T11.

1293
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And sound and coin, it's 2.2 megahertz MOS technology 6502.

1294
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And the sound chips are pokies.

1295
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Same hardware. This is clearly the same hardware that ran 720.

1296
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Texas Instruments TMS-5220 for the speech.

1297
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
One of the Indiana Jones games was on this hardware, too.

1298
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Yeah, I think so.

1299
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And there's another one. Is it Rolling Thunder?

1300
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
There's another one I can't think of.

1301
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Well, at any rate, there is also a bug where you can skirt the finish line at the end of the training course.

1302
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And play the training course over and over again until you crash.

1303
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And so you get garbage data on the screen and you get a huge F-score.

1304
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So that is a glitch in the game.

1305
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,000
There's different ports. We had the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron.

1306
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And that one, some of those different versions you can actually play as a paper girl instead of a paper boy.

1307
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Which is awesome.

1308
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
There's a Commodore 64 version. There's a Commodore 16.

1309
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
And yes, I played the shit out of the Commodore 64 version as a kid since you wanted to know.

1310
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Okay.

1311
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Apple II, TRS-80.

1312
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
God damn it, I lost my page.

1313
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:48,000
There was a DOS version, Apple IIGS, the Famicom NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Atari ST, Amiga, Atari Lynx, which I have that version.

1314
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Sega Master System Game Gear and Mega Drive slash Genesis.

1315
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
The NES version is the first NES game to be developed in the US.

1316
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
There were home versions that spawned sequels like Paperboy II.

1317
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And then there was a Paperboy 64 for the Nintendo 64.

1318
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's currently been included in Midway Arcade Treasures and on various systems for the GameCube, PS2, PSP, Xbox and Windows.

1319
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
There's a mobile version out.

1320
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Paperboy had a release on Xbox Live Arcade for the 360 on February 14th, 2007, but it's been delisted.

1321
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
There is an anniversary version that came out on iOS on December 18th.

1322
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So the Paperboy appeared in an episode of Captain N.

1323
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Which, okay.

1324
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:48,000
There's a scene in Police Academy 3 back in training where the game is featured.

1325
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:57,000
There is a, the game is on a BBC TV show called First Class.

1326
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And the Paperboy is in Wreck-It Ralph.

1327
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
He's hanging out at Game Central Station.

1328
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Oh really?

1329
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yes.

1330
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I missed that.

1331
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So there you go.

1332
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Alright, that's a good one.

1333
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I remember this game very fondly.

1334
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I love the music.

1335
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Want to hear a little more here?

1336
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yeah, let's hear some more.

1337
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
See, see, this is how I do the frickin' hearse.

1338
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I told you the guy was cheating in this video.

1339
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
He's cheating like crazy.

1340
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
It's kind of got a little Playboy vibe in the video.

1341
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
In the soundtrack.

1342
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
He's playing it alright.

1343
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Alright, there it is.

1344
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Your classic game of the week.

1345
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Paperboy.

1346
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
On everything.

1347
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
In the 80s, honestly.

1348
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
But started in the arcade.

1349
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
There you go.

1350
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Good pick, Tarsaka.

1351
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Good pick.

1352
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Thank you.

1353
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Hey, we'll be right back.

1354
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
We're going to take a break.

1355
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
We'll be right back after this break.

1356
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
The SEG is going to be here to talk all about that game we were mentioning earlier in the

1357
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
show, releasing this week.

1358
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Dominique Pamplemousse.

1359
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
We're going to get all the facts on that game.

1360
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And if I should keep saying it that way, maybe I shouldn't.

1361
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
And, of course, rapid fire news.

1362
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
The Fugu question of the week and plenty more when we come back after this with more of

1363
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Orange Lawn's radio.

1364
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1365
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:24,000
We are live, of course, on this Sunday evening with episode number, I think I actually might

1366
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
have lost count.

1367
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
What episode number are we on tonight?

1368
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
We're on episode number 543 of our show for this March the 9th of 2014.

1369
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And Loki, of course, joining us on the Skype line, right?

1370
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Hopefully he's back.

1371
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I don't know.

1372
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
He might have went AFK for a baby.

1373
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
No, no, I'm here.

1374
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I'm sorry.

1375
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Oh, hey.

1376
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
How's it going, Loki?

1377
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Going all right.

1378
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
So I know those of you guys who listen to the podcast don't really get to see this side

1379
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
of things.

1380
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,000
But in studio, we always take a quick break so that we can do things like use the bathroom,

1381
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
top off our drinks, and so forth.

1382
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Or in the case of tonight's show, set up an interview, which I'm going to get to and get

1383
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
here in two seconds.

1384
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
But I literally was running back with like 15 seconds left to spare.

1385
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And now I've knocked over the iPad and I barely got the recording of the show started and

1386
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
all that stuff.

1387
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
But that's how we do it live here at OLR, right?

1388
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Rob, Rob, Rob.

1389
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
What?

1390
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,000
What?

1391
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Fix it.

1392
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I'm trying.

1393
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And now this stupid iPad keeps locking up on me and I'm going to lose our guest if I'm

1394
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
not careful.

1395
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Well, you know, somebody else could be talking while you get the little magnet attached.

1396
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
All right.

1397
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Well, there we go.

1398
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And we can finally get to our interview that we're going to start off with here at the

1399
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
top of our program for this Part B.

1400
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:38,000
And joining us on the line tonight is our pal, the Seg.

1401
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Shucks.

1402
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Howdy.

1403
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
How are you all doing?

1404
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Good.

1405
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,000
How are you doing, Seg?

1406
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Good to hear from you.

1407
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I'm doing rather fine.

1408
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Tired and a little stressed out, but otherwise.

1409
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Stressed out?

1410
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
You?

1411
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
How could you be stressed?

1412
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
You talk like it's a game release week or something.

1413
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I know, right?

1414
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
So, yeah.

1415
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Oh, my gosh.

1416
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Who would be releasing a game against Titanfall, Seg?

1417
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Well, Dalek actually is releasing a game on Tuesday.

1418
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
But also me and Deidre.

1419
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
No, all kidding aside.

1420
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
All kidding aside, come on.

1421
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
There's always, you know, there's always these big, big AAA games coming out.

1422
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Like, you know, your South Park last week, your Titanfall and your Final Fantasy X, you

1423
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
know, in a couple weeks and so forth.

1424
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
But let us not forget the indie games.

1425
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Because the indie games, you know, they come out.

1426
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And sometimes indie games, they take a little while to build, right?

1427
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Minecraft wasn't built in a day.

1428
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
And some of these indie games become gigantic.

1429
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I don't know.

1430
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
There's some stuff in Minecraft that's been built in a day.

1431
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
I guess that's very true.

1432
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
But, no, you've got an indie game that you've been kind of assisting with.

1433
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I'm not sure.

1434
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
What is your official title with it?

1435
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Well, official title, Deidre came up with this, and I really like it, is Professional

1436
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Extrovert.

1437
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Appropriate.

1438
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Appropriate.

1439
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:07,000
So, my role is basically biz dev, community management, build, distribution, release,

1440
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
and all the other things for releasing Dominique Palpemuse.

1441
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Tell us a little bit about Dominique Palpemuse.

1442
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,000
So, Dominique Palpemuse is a detective noir point-and-click adventure musical done in

1443
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
stop-motion animation about gender and the economy.

1444
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Okay.

1445
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You realize there's going to be a bunch of people out there saying, literally what?

1446
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Yeah.

1447
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:42,000
So, this is a project that, like two years ago now, Deidre set up as an Indiegogo project

1448
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
of just, hey, I want to do a thing.

1449
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And the budget was very modest.

1450
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I mean, I want to say it got just a shy over 10K in total, which, you know, it's a video

1451
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
game, folks.

1452
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
That's very, very inexpensive.

1453
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:11,000
And made this game that was done in all stop-motion animation, where Deidre did everything.

1454
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:22,000
The writing, music, the programming, and it's all stop-motion of real figures and sets

1455
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
that Deidre made.

1456
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:29,000
So, it's all pictures and done in black and white.

1457
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So, it has a very unique, a very, I'll say, raw.

1458
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,000
It's not the kind of polish you would normally see in a triple-A title.

1459
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
You know, it's very, it has a very unique look to it.

1460
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
When you say stop-motion, I mean, if you think about stop-motion animation, that means literally

1461
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
like click, take a picture, okay, move just a little slight bit, click, take another picture,

1462
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
move a slight bit.

1463
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I mean, that is an extraordinary amount of patience for one person.

1464
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:05,000
And stop-motion, I don't think you really see that in, what video games out there had stop-motion,

1465
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
maybe like Clay Fighter?

1466
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Yeah.

1467
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
There were some, I think there was one game that had a sort of stop-motion thing.

1468
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
But honestly, the whole idea of a stop-motion game just sounds fantastic to me.

1469
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah.

1470
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Because I like, and this was something I've been trying to incorporate in my own personal design,

1471
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
is incorporating real-life textures and objects in a digital environment.

1472
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
And this just hit all of my happy buttons, so.

1473
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:35,000
That's astounding, this stop-motion game that literally one person, it's a one-person show, essentially.

1474
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Yeah.

1475
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
As far as the creation goes.

1476
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It's all Deidre.

1477
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Oh, that's amazing.

1478
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It's done a wonderful job.

1479
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And so, it actually, you know, technically this game's already been released.

1480
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:57,000
But it was on dominicpalpamuse.com, which you can buy it now and I'll get to where it gets new in a moment.

1481
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And you know you're going to have to spell that.

1482
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Just saying.

1483
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Yeah.

1484
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:10,000
If you, you know, our SEO's pretty good, where if you make a good attempt at the spelling, I'd know that it's two words.

1485
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Okay.

1486
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
You're pretty good to go.

1487
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:29,000
So, the game was released just through app, iPad, you know, through the app store, and just a simple payment service thing on the website.

1488
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And then Deidre submitted it to the festival circuit, and first it got digital selection for Indiecade,

1489
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
which is a really nice festival that happens in L.A., Culver City.

1490
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And I helped out and came along with them to showcase the game as the professional booth dude for the game.

1491
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I think I heard somewhere, and I could be wrong, but I thought it was in the news this week that Indiecade was announced as coming to GamerX2 as well, right?

1492
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Or that Cards Against Humanity was sponsoring something with that?

1493
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I hope I don't have that mixed up.

1494
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I haven't heard, but I've been in my own dome of seclusion this past two, three weeks.

1495
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:21,000
You've been in the Dominique Pample booth all week trying to get this taken care of. No, that's cool.

1496
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:37,000
So, a digital section was showcasing it there, and then Deidre put it to the IGF, Independent Games Festival, which goes along with GDC, Game Developers Conference.

1497
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And there wasn't just one nomination, or two, or three, but four, including the Sam McNally grand prize, the top prize.

1498
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
That's amazing. Congrats.

1499
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And they were tied three ways for most nominated title, but the categories that were nominated for it are the Grand McNally Grand Prize, Excellence in Narrative, Excellence in Audio, because it is a musical, and the Nouveau Award, which is the Experimental Games category.

1500
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Get out. An experimental game?

1501
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And, you know, it is an absolute honor, because we're in the same space as games like Paper Please, and The Yog, and Device Six, and all of these other titles.

1502
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:55,000
And just, you know, it's really a testament to the work that Deidre has put into this project, and it's really resonated with people that have played.

1503
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And so, with that, the morning that the IGF nominations came in, I messaged Deidre, and going, you know, obviously, congratulations.

1504
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Right.

1505
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And knowing the impending doom that was coming soon, I offered my services as what we now call professional extrovert, because one of the things I knew that was coming was Steam, because Steam has a tradition of outright offering anyone who has gotten nominated for an IGF, just, we can make money with this.

1506
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:49,000
So they offer the distribution on Steam, and I have a little bit of familiarity with releasing games on Steam.

1507
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
You know, sixty-four titles in a row by belt, anyway.

1508
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Not to.

1509
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:15,000
But, okay, so this is how, you pretty much just kind of answered the big question, because there has been some people out there on the interwebs wondering, how come this game, being the super fierce indie that it is, clearly, pretty much all being done by one person, how did this game not do the Steam greenlight, but it's because of the nominations?

1510
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Yes, it's because of the nominations.

1511
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You know, we've been through enough of a gauntlet already, and to be at this high of an honor, it's a no-brainer, and always has been a no-brainer for Valve.

1512
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And it's also opened up other opportunities.

1513
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
For example, we're also with Humble.

1514
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
You know, Humble Bundle Humble.

1515
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:46,000
We're not in a bundle, but we have a widget and will be in the store as of Tuesday.

1516
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Right, so many people forget that Humble has their own store that they're running to where you can get Steam keys if you want and so forth.

1517
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Yeah, and if you get from Humble, you will get Steam keys.

1518
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
PC and Mac as well, right?

1519
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Yep, Windows, Mac.

1520
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
No funny business.

1521
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
You get both.

1522
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And yeah, we're also on iPad, but App Store, there is no dials for us to turn in order to get anything rolled in with that, so it's sadly its own separate thing.

1523
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Let me ask you some, let me get into some real deep questions about the game, because obviously this game is tackling some pretty interesting subject matter in a very interesting way with the stop motion in the musical.

1524
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And one of those things that the game is tackling is gender identity, correct? Is an issue that's tackled in the game.

1525
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So how does one tackle gender identity issues through a video game?

1526
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Well, you know, I don't want to speak out of turn with Deidre and the work that they're doing.

1527
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:09,000
But it's really just, you know, when I play the piece, I see it as Deidre honestly trying to address these issues and experiences that they've had.

1528
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And putting it, you know, putting it to a game, but in a way that it's not, you know, it's not inaccessible to people.

1529
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Like, I mean, I fully completely identify as male, 100%, and I'm not put off by this because I know that this is experiences that other people go through.

1530
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:40,000
And I am enriched by that because I'm experiencing things that I will never go through and I don't go through.

1531
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And, you know, I think this is really the point of art is to make something that isn't your experience accessible.

1532
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:58,000
You know, you're kind of hitting on the next question I was going to ask because the next thing that I had on my list here is that, you know, the probably the number one audience that listens to our show.

1533
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:12,000
And it's no secret that the stereotype of your average gamer is a, you know, late teens, early 20s, white cis male, straight guy, you know, what's in this game for them?

1534
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
But you're kind of, you know, since you're many of those things yourself, you're kind of hitting on it.

1535
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,000
It's about, I don't want to say storytelling, but it is certainly, I mean, because that sounds like fiction, but it's definitely like...

1536
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Well, it is fiction.

1537
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Well, okay, okay. The game is fiction, but you're definitely getting some very non-fictional elements in it, right?

1538
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah. You know, it's, you know, it's totally a fiction game. It's not autobiographical by any means.

1539
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Sure.

1540
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:57,000
But, you know, it's, you know, this has definitely been the double diamond of promoting because it's such a weird, off-the-radar game in so many different ways.

1541
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But where I find people have the enjoyment on it are either they personally identify with it or they've had a great experience and it's not what they would normally get from other media.

1542
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And, you know, I mean, I know we're talking so much about the genders and issues and all that, but it's not like it's beating it over your head, you know?

1543
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And I think that's a very important point to make as well, is that you know this happens in gaming media all of the time.

1544
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
There's that one thing that we flip and fixate on.

1545
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Yup.

1546
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:45,000
And then, you know, just like gaming media can't get over that one thing that that one guy said at that one conference, and then we like fixate on that, right?

1547
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:56,000
But no, I think that's a great kind of thing to put out there is that, you know, the man just said, it's stop motion, it's a musical, it's, you know, there's many different points to this.

1548
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Now, we'd love to in this industry inevitably compare games to each other, you know, like, oh, Tomb Raider, it's just like Uncharted now, you know, all this stuff, right?

1549
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:11,000
But, you know, I'm kind of looking at this game and I'm going, can this be compared to anything?

1550
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Well, it is your traditional point and click adventure game.

1551
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Straight up. It's, you know, if you like point and click adventures, you're going to feel at home with this.

1552
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
You know, it is that, that's the style.

1553
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So, you know, that's where it comes with similarities if I was doing the elevator pitch for it, if I was getting a publishing deal, is that it's point and click adventure, but, you know, in a traditional sense.

1554
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Okay.

1555
01:28:43,000 --> 01:29:03,000
But it's just the content matter is definitely not what you would normally get from most other works and, you know, we are all so blessed to be able to reach this kind of audience.

1556
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Both, you know, first of all, thankful for the backers that funded this to make this happen.

1557
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And really, that was all, that was going to be it.

1558
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:23,000
You know, the submission to the festival circuit was, you know, a given and it's just like, you know, the game's done, here you go.

1559
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Fill out some forms.

1560
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:43,000
But now it's just breathed new life into this because there's so much of an interest with it and such positive response from the criticism world that we're, you know, we're able to do these opportunities.

1561
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Now, Deidre is currently a grad student at University of California Santa Cruz under the Center for Games and Playable Media and is focused doing that.

1562
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Wait, so on top of making this game, Deidre is a student.

1563
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Deidre finished this just before or just about starting grad school.

1564
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Okay. Wow.

1565
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
They'll have to correct me if I'm wrong but that's about the timeline.

1566
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:23,000
So the game was done around the time if not before starting at Santa Cruz.

1567
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Wow.

1568
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:33,000
But now it's, you know, if I didn't come along, I'm not trying to sound self-important, but if I didn't come along or someone like me didn't come along for Deidre,

1569
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:45,000
I don't think we would be seeing this kind of release because it's a lot of work and, I mean, it's a lot of work for me and I know what I should be doing.

1570
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Tell me quickly here, I'm going to get to this in a minute here, we're actually going to give away a couple copies of the game just to find people that are listening and we'll get to that in a minute.

1571
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:06,000
But I want to know too first quickly, I don't have a whole lot of time left to say because he very agreeably agreed to do a last minute interview here tonight so I've got to kind of wrap up things quick.

1572
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
But if you guys have questions, live.vognetwork.com, you can always, you know, fire as well.

1573
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You guys are on Twitter, I'm sure you'd be happy to answer questions there or through the website and so forth.

1574
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I want to ask though real quick before we get to the giveaway and the pimpage and all that of where to get the game.

1575
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Music, obviously music is a big part of this game. What is some of the music like in the game?

1576
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Actually, I'm sorry we didn't prepare this, can you call up the website and play the trailer? It's less than a minute.

1577
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I think that would be a very good thing.

1578
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:45,000
If I can remember how to spell it, oh wait no, luckily I have your Twitter, I have it in my history.

1579
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Guess who now has it on her iPad.

1580
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
That was quick.

1581
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Yay!

1582
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Hey, you sold at least one.

1583
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Just the giant trailer here on the page?

1584
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Yeah, just play it, play it.

1585
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Alright, here you go. I'm going to play this here for you guys.

1586
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Pimple Mouse.

1587
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
It's Pamplemousse.

1588
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Are you a boy or a girl?

1589
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
No, I'm a detective.

1590
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It's just a pile of mail, a bunch of bills I haven't paid.

1591
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I can't believe the lights still turn on in this place.

1592
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Casey Bingham? I've sort of heard of him, I think.

1593
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,000
He's a singer and he's like, you know, cute and stuff?

1594
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Uh, suffice to say, he can't be easily replaced.

1595
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:44,000
God, search the room, try to find something that'll tell me something about what's going on with Devon and this thing she's got with Casey Bingham.

1596
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
See it? That's the trailer.

1597
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:54,000
This is very, like, I mean this in a nice way. It's not going to sound nice, but it's very odd.

1598
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Yeah, it is odd. You know, like, good odd.

1599
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It's odd in that Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Animation Festival kind of way. Does that make sense?

1600
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Yeah. You know, I don't think it would be that kind of fitting there, but it's odd.

1601
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
It is a completely different experience from what it used to.

1602
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
And, you know, we also have a demo of the game.

1603
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:24,000
It's in Flash at our website too, so you can play that as well.

1604
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I know it's in Flash, but, you know, in browser demo.

1605
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
There you go. Yeah, exactly. You gotta embrace that however you can.

1606
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Quick question from RageNator in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1607
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
I don't know if you know the answer to this because I know you didn't design, but I'm going to try you anyway.

1608
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:45,000
What was the motivation to have the game be a point-and-click game as opposed to be a platformer?

1609
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So maybe just, like, why, if you know, why did Deidre go point-and-click with it?

1610
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Well, I don't want to speak definitively. However, no.

1611
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:06,000
So Deidre is very active in the IF community, that's interactive fiction community.

1612
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Worked at Hothead for a while. Was an intern at Telltale. Actually, here's an interesting story.

1613
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Deidre was an intern at Telltale and done with the internship a month before I started at Telltale.

1614
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,000
But we didn't meet until that year GDC.

1615
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:28,000
So it's like two people who went to the same high school that never met each other till, like, after college.

1616
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Yes, exactly.

1617
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That's funny.

1618
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,000
So, of course, if Deidre was at Telltale, like, there's definitely that exposure, right?

1619
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Yeah.

1620
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
So, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.

1621
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:48,000
There's also a piece they did earlier that's also on Deidre's website, the link is towards the bottom,

1622
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:56,000
called Life Flashes By, which is another point-and-click adventure, 2D animation, not a musical.

1623
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
But that's completely free and available too, so that's available.

1624
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:12,000
So it's definitely not anywhere outside of the realm of their development and experience.

1625
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Gotcha, gotcha.

1626
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Alright, well, Seg, we're gonna have to wrap up here, but I do want to allow folks an opportunity to check out Dominique Pumblemoose for themselves.

1627
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:29,000
If you would like to, we're gonna do two contests here on the show to win some codes for the game, which is, these are Humble codes, right?

1628
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
These are Humble Bundle codes, which also include the Steam key with it.

1629
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Okay, so that ought to be accessible to everybody, unless you really wanted it on iPad.

1630
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
But if you want it on iPad, go get it on iPad, it's available right now, which Dark Soccer just did.

1631
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I did, and $5 is not a whole lot to pay for a good game.

1632
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Nope, not at all.

1633
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,000
So, if you would like to get one for free, however, we're gonna give one away to our live folks and one away to our podcast folks.

1634
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:03,000
So if you would like to win a copy through the podcast, and this is only through the podcast listeners, send an email right now to participate at orangelaunceradio.com

1635
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
and just say somewhere in there, I want Dominique Pumblemoose!

1636
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And we'll choose just one, we'll just do a good old random draw, and we'll let you know who won in two weeks when we're back with an all-new Orange Lawns Radio.

1637
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
For those of you that are live, I'm gonna see if you were paying attention.

1638
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And I'm gonna have you answer a little question.

1639
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
So here's the question, and you gotta answer it.

1640
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:29,000
How many awards, how many awards is Dominique Pumblemoose up for at the IGF Awards?

1641
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
You can send your message over private message to Skye in the chatroom, S-K-I-E.

1642
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:40,000
And first person to get that in there with the correct answer will win their very own Humble Key for Dominique Pumblemoose.

1643
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Now, Seg, before I let you go, please, commence the pimpage.

1644
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
How can people get more of this game? What's the website and all that good stuff?

1645
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
The website is DominiquePumblemoose.

1646
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:54,000
If you make your best guess at Googling that, it will probably show up.

1647
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Just know that it's two words. And it will show up.

1648
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Actually, the thing is, even though our big release day is Tuesday, you can go to the website and just buy it from Humble right now.

1649
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Sneak peek, you guys! Early release exclusive for OLR listeners, wink wink nudge.

1650
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Oh, that's right! There's going to be Steam trading cards for Pumblemoose.

1651
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:36,000
And some unique emoticons. It's all the characters' faces as emoticons.

1652
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And there's a rare drop. There's two rare drops. One of which is the cartoon version of Deidre, their face.

1653
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And one is the cartoon face of yours truly.

1654
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Nice!

1655
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So the whole Steam trading card thing is out there. I had to do that art too.

1656
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I've been doing all the support art and everything.

1657
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I don't sleep ever.

1658
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Oh, and one more thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I don't have that many details because they haven't really published them out.

1659
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:25,000
But the IGF and GDC awards, they go back to back, literally in the same room, will be streamed on GameSpot.com this following Wednesday.

1660
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
So not this week, but next week Wednesday.

1661
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And it will be streamed 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.

1662
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And you can see us waiting in the wings and seeing our fate for all the IGF and Game Choice awards that are right after.

1663
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Alright, well don't be too nervous when you have to go up there and accept some awards.

1664
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I imagine Deidre will be doing most of that.

1665
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Yeah, it's all Deidre.

1666
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
You get to stand behind Deidre and just, you know, thumbs up. Hey!

1667
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
That's the suit. Talk to me for business.

1668
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Alright, by the way, For the Fallen Dreams, our winner there in the chat room.

1669
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
For the Fallen Dreams with the correct answer of 4.

1670
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Like seriously, like one second ahead of ActDeft.

1671
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
And then we had some other people that submitted some incorrect answers. I'm sorry guys.

1672
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:29,000
But good attempt, good attempt. So I will get, I got For the Fallen Dreams' email and I will get you in touch with them so you can get that code on over.

1673
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And then if you didn't win tonight, if your name is not For the Fallen Dreams and you didn't win tonight, you do still have that opportunity through Participate at OrangeDawnTreaty.com.

1674
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
We will pull a random emailer in two weeks. So.

1675
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Cool.

1676
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Awesome. Segg, thank you so much for being on the show tonight. Best of luck.

1677
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Thank you. This really means a lot to me.

1678
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
It means a lot to me that you would come on this show.

1679
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:56,000
You know, the press is hard. And especially when you have to do everything else too.

1680
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Hey, I always say, indies gotta look out for each other.

1681
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:09,000
And that's, I know I'm usually saying that in the context of indie podcasting, but that is so true about indie video gaming and the media as well.

1682
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:13,000
We gotta stick together. So I'm really glad we could help bring a little awareness towards such a title.

1683
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I'm not sure people would have heard of otherwise necessarily. So you know what? There you go.

1684
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:25,000
There you go. So, all right. Well, Segg, again, best of luck and take a nap this weekend. You earned it.

1685
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
After Tuesday, I'll be able to nap and then GDC happens. Oh, God.

1686
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
All right. All right, buddy. Take care. Thank you so much for being here. Have a...

1687
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Yep, you too.

1688
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
All right.

1689
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Goodbye, O.O.I.

1690
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Goodbye.

1691
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Bye.

1692
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:44,000
All right. Always wonderful to hear from Segg here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1693
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
That was great. And especially for coming on at such last minute notice and giving a nice little interview there.

1694
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Dark Sakura gonna check out the game, let us know what she thinks.

1695
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Yeah, except I have to play it all at home because I can't take this to the land of cubes and tech.

1696
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Segg, by the way, is over in our chat room now if you had another question that you weren't able to get in over at live.vognetwork.com.

1697
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Meanwhile, we've got some rapid fire news to jump into here as we get more into part B of our show.

1698
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Loki, how you doing? You ready for some news?

1699
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Sure.

1700
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Go for it.

1701
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Okay. So, Titanfall, this is coming out, of course, on Tuesday.

1702
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:31,000
And they've already said, hey, you know, we understand that early copies do get out there and we're not gonna ban players because of that.

1703
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
They're saying, you know, about playing early, we're not gonna stop you or ban legit copies.

1704
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
It's pre-launch so there may be interruptions in the service as we prep servers.

1705
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Also, the servers don't go live until 12.01 a.m. on the 11th in the local time.

1706
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:55,000
So, I don't know how much you're gonna be able to play an online game when the servers aren't online.

1707
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Yeah, it's not gonna do much good to get an early copy of a multiplayer game for which there's no servers.

1708
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Well, I don't know, the servers still might be up right now because I was like reading a GAF forum post earlier and there's some people capturing footage for multiplayer games and stuff.

1709
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So, maybe they are testing them still but, you know, definitely you're gonna get in trouble if you start streaming that stuff.

1710
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:27,000
And then also, of course, you know, you can preload it on Origin if you want to do the PC version. It's 50 gigabytes. That's ridiculous.

1711
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
That is gigantic.

1712
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Yeah. And then, of course, in GameStop fashion, you may well be aware that the PlayStation 4 cameras are pretty impossible to find.

1713
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Well, just like anything else that's hard to find at GameStop, they decided to go ahead and raise the retail price on that.

1714
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So, no longer will you find it for $59.99 but you can get it for now $69.99.

1715
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:03,000
So, that kind of is annoying. But I guess they're well within the right to do that. Of course, I'm also well within my right to not shop there.

1716
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Yeah. You guys know I've really been trying to get a PlayStation 4 camera and I kind of gave up.

1717
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
And although I'm like, yay, they're in stock again, this just pisses me off.

1718
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Like, why is GameStop the only store getting these just so they can turn around and fuck people by doing this? This is ridiculous.

1719
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
I don't need a camera that bad. Like, Iamoverit.com. I am over it officially.

1720
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,000
And then, last but not least, there's some pretty cool Humble Undles going on right now.

1721
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Of course, they have a weekly sale that features all these different PopCap games including, you know, for whatever amount you want,

1722
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Pagle Deluxe, Bejeweled 3, Bookworm Deluxe, Escape, Rose Cliff Island, and Feeding Frenzy 2 Deluxe.

1723
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
And if you pay $6 or more, you get Plants vs. Obvious Game of the Year Edition, Pagle Nights, and Zuma's Revenge.

1724
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So, that's a pretty good deal there. And all those unlock on Steam or Origin.

1725
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I did pick that up.

1726
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
You did?

1727
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Yeah, I did. Why not? Especially these old school PopCap games. I really like them and why not, you know?

1728
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And then, of course, if you're, you know, there's another one going on as well. Devolver Digital is doing a double debut bundle.

1729
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:24,000
And that you can find at hummebundle.com slash devolver.

1730
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:29,000
And this one's going towards the Brandon Boyer Cancer Treatment Relief.

1731
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And if you're not familiar with Brandon Boyer, he's the chairman of the Independent Games Festival and also the site Venus Patrol.

1732
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:48,000
And, of course, he was diagnosed with cancer and he's currently trying to get some funding for his treatments.

1733
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:55,000
So, going towards that, of course, they have a bundle. It's five games and five indie movies.

1734
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:01,000
And with the games, they have Duke Nukem 3D, Megaton Edition, Shadow Warrior, Classic Redux.

1735
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Also, was it Defense Technica, Mark Echo's Getting Up, Contents Under Pressure, and Cosmic DJ.

1736
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And then with that, the films Mars, Good Game, Austin High, The Poisoning, and One Couch at a Time.

1737
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
So, it's like some indie films and that kind of stuff.

1738
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
And if you want to get everything, you know, it's ten bucks.

1739
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Otherwise, you get, you know, just Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior and that kind of stuff.

1740
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
So, check it out.

1741
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:32,000
I also see some heartfelt comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1742
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, yeah, the Brandon Boyer story is sad.

1743
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Saig says, Brandon is the best person, which obviously Saig was just talking at length about a lot of this indie stuff.

1744
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Blackwolf says he got insurance, then got diagnosed with cancer, but it was before ACA went into effect.

1745
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
And so, him just telling his doctor, yeah, I had a stomachache once that gave his insurance company the reason to say,

1746
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
pre-existing condition, pay for it yourself.

1747
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I guess this has already been looked into, but I thought that pre-existing actually had to come off of plans back in 2011.

1748
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Or earlier when they first signed the thing into law.

1749
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
I think it was depending on state.

1750
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Yeah, that might have been it. It might have depended on state.

1751
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
That's really unfortunate.

1752
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Proof we had a broken system.

1753
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Yeah, I can't really comment further, but I'm glad to hear that the troops are rallying around them.

1754
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Alright, well, let's move on. I got some news here.

1755
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
So, we talked about the Humble Bundle a minute ago for PopCap, and speaking of PopCap releases,

1756
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Pagle 2 is on its way onto the Xbox 360.

1757
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
I don't know if you guys know, but Pagle 2 has been out on Xbox One.

1758
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
But unlike other PopCap games, it hasn't shown up everywhere.

1759
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Well, that trend will finally break soon. It looks like Xbox 360 will be getting its version on May 7th.

1760
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:59,000
There you go. The game costs $12 on Xbox One. It's assumed that's the price on Xbox 360, but we don't know for sure yet.

1761
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Also, dual mode just launched in the Xbox One version for two players fighting locally over the title of Pagle Master.

1762
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
EA did not announce any other platforms, but they do say they will be bringing it pretty much everywhere.

1763
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
It's just a matter of time.

1764
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
This is interesting that this game is actually getting made.

1765
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Shaq-Fu, A Legend Reborn. This has been rumored for weeks and weeks here on the program, but yeah.

1766
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:33,000
There is a sequel to Shaq-Fu coming. There's a whole little trailer out there for it.

1767
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Why?

1768
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Well, here's the thing. It may or may not actually happen because it's on IndieGoGo.

1769
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,000
To make the game happen, they will need $450,000.

1770
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Now, they're a little bit tongue-in-cheek about this. They're not actually claiming that Shaq-Fu was just an amazing thing.

1771
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
But they are saying that Shaq-Fu, A Legend Reborn is what the original game should have been.

1772
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,000
So there you go. There's a trailer up if you want to check that out.

1773
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,000
And just so you know, they've raised $69,000 in change so far.

1774
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:10,000
But they do have 42 days left, so there are still a ways in the goal. They're just over 10%.

1775
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:15,000
But they do have 42 days left, so that's a lot of time to contribute to Shaq-Fu.

1776
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
I was going to say, fear not though. They're flexible funding, so even if they don't raise that amount, they're going to get your money.

1777
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Yes, I noticed that was on IndieGoGo and not the other sites.

1778
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Alright, one other thing here. I did not even know that this was a thing, but apparently the internet has already embraced Goat Simulator.

1779
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Oh yes.

1780
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I need this. What is this?

1781
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Tell me about Goat Simulator, because I honestly don't know much about it.

1782
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
How do you goat?

1783
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Let's see. Goat Simulator is a game that's by, I'm trying to remember the company now.

1784
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
But basically it started off as like a game jam within their studio.

1785
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And it was just like this thing, it was just really dumb that they made in Unreal Engine 3.

1786
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:05,000
And they posted an internet video of it, and it just took off viral.

1787
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:11,000
So yeah, it's Koffenstein Studios, they did, oh god I can't remember the name now.

1788
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
It's really happening y'all, it's really happening.

1789
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Goat Simulator will be released on April 1st. No fooling, even though that's, I know, appropriate, right?

1790
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Sadly only available on PC and no multiplayer functionality, but you know what?

1791
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
If it sells really well, I think anything is possible.

1792
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Ten dollars is the asking price.

1793
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
If you want to go pre-order the game, you can right now.

1794
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
The website is goat-simulator.com.

1795
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:47,000
You know, that's really bad because I read that at first as Goat Stimulator, and that's not a game I want to play.

1796
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
You know, I made that joke in the chatroom actually.

1797
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Oh did you?

1798
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I said Goat Simulator and then said better than Goat Stimulator.

1799
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I think for the sake of the show, you should really check out the video.

1800
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Okay.

1801
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
The trailer that's on there.

1802
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
On their website?

1803
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
On their website.

1804
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I want a goat.

1805
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Alright. Here we go.

1806
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I'm gonna play the goat game.

1807
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Another video, poor Jason.

1808
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Poor Jason.

1809
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Alright, here we go.

1810
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I'm gonna look at this trailer right now here for Goat Simulator, which I've never seen.

1811
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Oh my God.

1812
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
This is great.

1813
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I can't control the volume.

1814
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
You're just flicking the goat everywhere.

1815
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Butts.

1816
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Butts.

1817
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I want to be a goat.

1818
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
More goat, please.

1819
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Oh my God.

1820
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
You're bouncing a goat around on a trampoline through windows.

1821
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
This, this looks like...

1822
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
This looks like a Loki dream game.

1823
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
It looks like a giant sandbox Grand Theft Auto thing, except the main character is a goat.

1824
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And you can lick stuff.

1825
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Alright, now I've seen everything.

1826
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,000
It's fantastic.

1827
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Jason said this music makes me feel like I'm drunk.

1828
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Oh God, alright.

1829
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
And Dungeon Buster says you play as a goat and can katamari things with your tongue.

1830
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:04,000
But here's the best part though.

1831
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:08,000
They're trying to get Steam, was it Steam Workshop support for it.

1832
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Oh no.

1833
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:12,000
So everybody can put their own things in it.

1834
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Great.

1835
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Great.

1836
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Alright.

1837
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
This is gonna happen.

1838
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Alright, Dark Soccer.

1839
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
What do you got for us?

1840
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
I have a couple things.

1841
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
First of all is going to be the release date for Watch Dogs.

1842
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
It's gonna be May 27th according to Ubisoft.

1843
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,000
So they said that the Wii U version could be a few months after the game's release.

1844
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,000
And then in other news, coming from Retro Studios as soon as it freaking works,

1845
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
is that they're actually saying we'll be lucky to someday return to Metroid.

1846
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:53,000
There was an interview with Michael Kelbal that said that they would really like to,

1847
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
and that they're developing a new game since they did the Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze,

1848
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
and that they really, really want to do a Metroid game.

1849
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
The quote is, if the fans keep asking them, maybe we'll answer.

1850
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
That's it.

1851
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Alrighty, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1852
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities,

1853
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
and we tackle it in the foogle question of the week.

1854
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Tonight's...

1855
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I didn't let the music appropriately play.

1856
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Sorry, I was just in a hurry to tackle our question tonight.

1857
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Rob, let the music play.

1858
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Let the music play.

1859
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,000
He won't get away.

1860
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Alright.

1861
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
The foogle question of the week has to do with the sponsorship question we were asking earlier

1862
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
between Penzoil and Mario Kart 8.

1863
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Now, not totally asking what you guys think about it,

1864
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
but we wanted to know what did you think would be an interesting sponsorship

1865
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:50,000
or a promotional tie-in between a corporation and a video game.

1866
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,000
So serious or funny, whatever you want to do there.

1867
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
So here we go. Here are some of the answers from Facebook.

1868
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Tech 2030 says, what about Boeing branded airships in Final Fantasy?

1869
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Makes sense.

1870
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Asfer says, cooking mama, cooking with Paula Deen.

1871
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
The limited edition comes packaged with two sticks of butter, y'all.

1872
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
No.

1873
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,000
As long as she sticks to, like, two or three canned lines, we're fine.

1874
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Awesome Unicorn says, I guess they missed the boat to cross-promote Bravely Default

1875
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
by offering subprime lending with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

1876
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
That's a good political joke. That's a good one.

1877
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I've worked in the mortgage industry when everything popped, so...

1878
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Yeah.

1879
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Let's see.

1880
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Degenerate Johnny says, Depends sponsored underwear and Outlast would be the perfect partnership.

1881
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Players would not have to worry when they shit themselves during the jump scares.

1882
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,000
You nasty.

1883
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I love our listeners.

1884
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Let's see.

1885
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Our listeners are like listening to Tumblr without all the social justice.

1886
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,000
There's some really bad answers coming up here. You ready?

1887
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
More. More.

1888
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Chiggers says, Mirror's Edge and Dramamine.

1889
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
That's a good one.

1890
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:16,000
That would be a good one.

1891
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Okay.

1892
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Our good pal, Shane Alinko.

1893
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Oh, Shane.

1894
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Warner Brothers could partner with the Red Cross for some fun Mortal Kombat tie-in.

1895
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:31,000
You know. No, no, no. Remember.

1896
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I think it was the Australian Red Cross?

1897
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Mm-hmm.

1898
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Teamed up with Konami for that whole Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 promotion.

1899
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
You know when the Saw movies come out.

1900
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
God, no, no, no, no.

1901
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,000
As much as I hate those movies, they do blood drives for that, too.

1902
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Because I've had friends that have done that.

1903
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
They should do is like Southwest Airlines in Mortal Kombat.

1904
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
You get over here and Southwest.

1905
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Get over here and donate.

1906
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Alright.

1907
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Let's go to some of the answers over on Google Plus.

1908
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Which, of course, you can find us at Google.com slash plus.

1909
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Orange Launch Radio. All one word.

1910
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Just a few.

1911
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,000
We didn't have quite the discussion blow up over there on Google Plus tonight.

1912
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
I'm just going to read a couple of these here.

1913
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Retertainment says, Tiger Woods PGA Tour and Viagra.

1914
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Some of them don't need it.

1915
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
And lastly, Flaco Jones said,

1916
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Since they sponsored the TV show, KFC should also sponsor the Walking Deads game.

1917
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Or the Walking Dead games.

1918
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:43,000
But only if they continue to juxtapose images of people eating their food with zombies eating people.

1919
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Tastes about the same.

1920
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Yeah, right.

1921
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Crunchy brain.

1922
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
It's probably made from the same material, too.

1923
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
SSG100 Matt says, Dope War sponsored by Dare.

1924
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Yeah, I saw that one.

1925
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
That was pretty funny.

1926
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
The Double Down is made of people.

1927
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
People.

1928
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Charlton Heston presents.

1929
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Those were only some of the answers.

1930
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:12,000
You can read the rest over at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1931
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Meanwhile, we've got more news for you.

1932
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Loki.

1933
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1934
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
What?

1935
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Act Defted. Have a good one.

1936
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
What?

1937
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Kirby and Kirby vacuums.

1938
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Yes.

1939
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
You guys are going to end up reading them all anyway.

1940
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
All right.

1941
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Loki, what do you got for us?

1942
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
All right.

1943
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Unfortunately, there's been some layoffs at Sony Santa Monica.

1944
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Apparently, also along with that, a next gen game cancellation.

1945
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:45,000
And basically, they said this is a result of a cycle of resource realignment against priority growth areas within SCE-WWS.

1946
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
We do not take these decisions lightly.

1947
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,000
However, sometimes it's necessary to make changes to better serve the future projects of our studio.

1948
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And we have offered outplacement services and severance packages to ease the transition of those impacted.

1949
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And they haven't really said, I guess there was supposed to be an unannounced PS4 title in development.

1950
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:17,000
But they haven't really said what that was, although they kind of made another comment about it saying that there's not a single business on the planet where every single project that is started is a success.

1951
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And that's just what happens here.

1952
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Sometimes high profile projects or studios need a reboot.

1953
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
And that's what happened here.

1954
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Santa Monica will always have a hugely important part of our global family of studios.

1955
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
It's a huge studio and that's right up there around 200 people even after the recent layoffs.

1956
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:42,000
And of course, they're not saying which project we're going on.

1957
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:45,000
But I guess they're rebooting everything.

1958
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Maybe they thought they needed like fresh blood, I guess.

1959
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I can see them maybe doing like a PlayStation 4 version of God of War or something.

1960
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Maybe it's just not testing well or something. I don't know.

1961
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:06,000
You know, SSG100 Matt in our chat room brings up a good point saying the Order 1886 was being done by Sony Santa Monica.

1962
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,000
So could that have been an impacted game?

1963
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:16,000
It seemed like it was far along from what we were seeing, but I hope it's not that one.

1964
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:21,000
I had heard rumors, and you know, again, rumors take it with a huge salt lick.

1965
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:27,000
But they had a game that was very similar to Destiny that was in the making.

1966
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And that unfortunately, Destiny was looking like a better game to make a long story extremely short.

1967
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And that was the cause.

1968
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:42,000
But again, that could have evolved from like a NeoGaf post from somebody's uncle or something.

1969
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
You know, I don't know. So take it with a huge grain of salt.

1970
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:50,000
I just hope the Order 1886 is still something that's going to be happening because I like that it's a new IP.

1971
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
It's a little bit different. I think a lot of people are here for the werewolf and steampunk type of thing.

1972
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I think it's still going to be one because remember, they just got done showing it off at like some Sony press event not too long ago.

1973
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:10,000
So I think that's still coming. It's just maybe whatever else they haven't really announced yet that they're working on wasn't panning out.

1974
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:18,000
But they're not the only ones. Disney Interactive has also laid off 700 people and they're planning to scale back their annual game output.

1975
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Which is weird because their annual game output is like one or two games.

1976
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Well, don't they do a shit ton of mobile? You're thinking of like Disney Infinity and that stuff.

1977
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Isn't this like their mobile side that does like Where's My Water was one of their big games?

1978
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I know there's a ton of Disney games on iPhone.

1979
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Well, I think it's just the whole group. Maybe they are scaling back some of their internet mobile games and that kind of stuff.

1980
01:59:51,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I don't know. Maybe some of the movie tie-in games are scaling back because I don't really know if they have like scheduled as far as animated features coming out this year.

1981
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:11,000
That would make a lot of sense actually because sometimes those tie-in games too, they seem to work with other companies.

1982
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Like I think of the one that comes to mind is that there was that Tangled Temple Run game.

1983
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,000
I don't think Disney did that themselves. I think they worked with the creators of Temple Run to make that.

1984
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Well, yeah, and they also licensed their stuff out like Phineas and Ferb. They had a game that was done by Majesco.

1985
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:36,000
There's been other like, you know, I want to say even some of the Cars games weren't necessarily done by Disney at one time.

1986
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:43,000
But, I mean, I'm sure we'll see a new Disney Infinity from them this year because I think we've run out of characters as of April.

1987
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:46,000
So I'm sure they're going to be announcing something about that soon.

1988
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:54,000
And then I don't really expect much more from them. Maybe a couple handheld games. That's about it.

1989
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Well, our thoughts go out to the impacted workers. I swear to God it's been like three weeks in a row we've been talking layoff stories.

1990
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,000
So I don't know what gives. I thought things were ticking up for the game industry.

1991
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
But our thoughts are with those impacted and hoping you guys can land somewhere else.

1992
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Yeah.

1993
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Maybe Square Enix is hiring. That's the story I'm going to get into next. I don't know.

1994
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:20,000
But I know Square Enix is polling people right now to get fan feedback on Kingdom Hearts.

1995
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Kingdom Hearts polling the fans to see what platforms gamers are currently playing on and what genre people prefer.

1996
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Now here's something interesting.

1997
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Kingdom Hearts 3, it's been announced for PlayStation 4, it's been announced for Xbox One, hasn't been announced for Wii U.

1998
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:46,000
So this news has been gaining a lot of traction on Nintendo websites to basically go hit the poll and say show Wii U some love.

1999
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Show them that there is fans out there that want to see Kingdom Hearts on Wii U.

2000
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:59,000
So very interesting. I don't know. Again, it's just a poll. I don't know if it'll have that full impact.

2001
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:06,000
But it could be very interesting. I just don't think Kingdom Hearts 3, I mean if they're going for the look, it probably can't really be done on Wii U.

2002
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I hate to say it, but I think they're, you know, again, Wii U is built a little more on the 360 PlayStation 3 with a little more oomph.

2003
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:21,000
But I would think that if they know that there's a huge following for Kingdom Hearts on Nintendo, maybe there could be a side story or something.

2004
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
You know, and certainly there was Dream Drop Distance on a Nintendo platform.

2005
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:30,000
So it's not like Square Enix is going to say F you to all Nintendo platforms.

2006
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,000
So you never know what might happen with that. So good luck.

2007
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Alright, DarkSakura.

2008
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Well, I have some news. And this is actually going to be more something that I think we need to play for people.

2009
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:50,000
There is actually a video out for GamerX2, which is the convention you went to last year.

2010
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And I'm going to do my best to make it to this year.

2011
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:04,000
And it has Ellen McLean, who was GLaDOS in Portal, and John Patrick Lowry, who was the sniper in Team Fortress 2, showing some love for the convention.

2012
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:09,000
And I honestly think that it's better just to let it play, but everyone should be supporting it.

2013
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
It's July 11th through 13th at the Intercontinental Hotel in San Francisco.

2014
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
And play it.

2015
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Sure, there's just a couple minutes, so let's take a listen.

2016
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Who doesn't love the voices of Ellen McLean and John Patrick Lowry?

2017
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
I mean, they could be reading the phone book, and I'd be excited.

2018
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Yes.

2019
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
But this is much better than a phone book.

2020
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:39,000
In a world where gay gamers gather together to get their game on, gamble, gallop, and geek out to giddiness in a great gala of grandeur and glee.

2021
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Will you be the one to say them nay?

2022
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Will you be the one to crush their dreams?

2023
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Will you be the one to say,

2024
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Oh gee, you don't get a party.

2025
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Oh gee, you don't deserve a party.

2026
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Oh gee, why don't you go home and cry in your pillow?

2027
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Oi, you poop on my party, I'll put a prime pinna on that pumpkinette of yours.

2028
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Hello.

2029
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Oh, have you gained a little weight since last we spoke?

2030
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Well, no matter.

2031
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
The Sniper and I are just having a quiet evening here at home.

2032
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
And we thought we'd say a few words in support of GamerX.

2033
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
It's happening this July in beautiful San Francisco.

2034
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
The city by the bay.

2035
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Now we certainly wouldn't want to get the impression that we're coercing you into supporting this wonderful gathering.

2036
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Perhaps you think it's a good idea.

2037
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Perhaps you don't.

2038
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Perhaps you're a forward-thinking progressive who feels that all human beings should be able to come together to celebrate themselves and their friends.

2039
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Or maybe you're a reactionary pig.

2040
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Either way, we don't want you to think that I would release large quantities of deadly neurotoxin if you don't give generously to GamerX.

2041
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Look into your hearts.

2042
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
And please give generously.

2043
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Really generously.

2044
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
I'd hate to get angry.

2045
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I love her.

2046
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:26,000
If you haven't seen the actual YouTube, which you can see over on GamerX's YouTube channel, which is just G-A-Y-M-E-R-X.

2047
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Just getting to see the video of her doing that voice.

2048
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
With the cute face.

2049
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
She does such little cute faces and things. She's great.

2050
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Well, there is an ongoing Kickstarter that you can go to.

2051
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:45,000
And so far, well, as of the time of the announcement, there's 18 grand scheduled so far.

2052
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Nice. So they've hit their goal.

2053
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And basically they said that David Gator from BioWare, basically the dude who's writing Dragon Age, is going to be there.

2054
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
There's a bunch of people there.

2055
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
There's the co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, I guess that's how it's pronounced.

2056
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Just a bunch.

2057
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,000
And a wrestler, Darren Young.

2058
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,000
So Bobby Wrestling Chat is going to be there.

2059
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,000
And so lots of stuff is going on. I really want to go this year.

2060
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Cards Against Humanity, the huge AAA sponsor this year.

2061
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I really want to go.

2062
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Well, I will tell you this, too. On the podcast front, I'm a huge supporter of indie podcasters.

2063
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:25,000
And I do network on Facebook with a great group of independent podcasters.

2064
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Of course, great.

2065
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Hey, Loki, you all right over there?

2066
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Yeah, sorry.

2067
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Breaking out the power tools.

2068
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
All right. Anyway, mid-show.

2069
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Just some of the other indie podcasts that are going to be there.

2070
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Obviously, Grandpa from Hoard House and the just announced T'Vog starboard power company.

2071
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:43,000
He is going for sure as well.

2072
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Some other great GLBT podcast.

2073
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
My buddies from Game Buoy.

2074
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:48,000
You know I love me.

2075
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Some Captain Spike and First Mate Slidekick.

2076
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
They're there as well.

2077
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Game Bar is going to have some representation.

2078
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I'm positive Jason's going back this year and maybe his co-host as well.

2079
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I don't know.

2080
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
I know Koopa Club will be represented.

2081
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Those guys are going as well.

2082
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
One of the new kids on the block who has an amazing show.

2083
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Amazing.

2084
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Donnie Wahlberg?

2085
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Video.

2086
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,000
No, this is better than Donnie and Mark put together is video game realness.

2087
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I know they're trying really hard.

2088
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
They got to come all the way from Canada though.

2089
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
And it's cold up there, y'all.

2090
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
But check at least all those shows out.

2091
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,000
And yeah, hopefully some of them at GamerX too this year.

2092
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,000
And there hopefully will be another panel of some sort.

2093
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
That's in the planning as well.

2094
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
So, yeah.

2095
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I want to go.

2096
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
You should go.

2097
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
If I can.

2098
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
All right.

2099
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Let's move on.

2100
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Some more news.

2101
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Where are we at now?

2102
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Loki.

2103
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:48,000
All right.

2104
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
All right.

2105
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
So let's see.

2106
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Put away the parrot.

2107
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Parrot?

2108
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
What parrot?

2109
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I can't believe that they're actually going to make this.

2110
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:00,000
But apparently The Last of Us is going to be a film now.

2111
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I mean the game was cinematic enough.

2112
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So I just thought they'd leave it at that.

2113
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
But yes, now they're going to be partnering with Scream Gems, Brian Dukes, and Eric Ling.

2114
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I guess they're saying that it's going to be written also by basically the team at Naughty Dog.

2115
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:28,000
So hopefully that means there'll be a faithful translation of the actual game into movie.

2116
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Because usually it's kind of not very good.

2117
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
No word, though, on when exactly this is expected to be released.

2118
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Probably not for a few years, I'm guessing, at this point.

2119
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Yeah, this has got to be really early on.

2120
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
So.

2121
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Codeman in our chat says, oh god, the story will be ruined, dammit.

2122
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Well, we'll see.

2123
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,000
We'll see.

2124
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:59,000
The good news is somebody's got to be the first great video game movie.

2125
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Maybe it'll be this one.

2126
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Maybe?

2127
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Mm-hmm.

2128
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Hey, this is a video game that maybe they'll turn this into a movie as well.

2129
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Because this is supposed to have some pretty kick butt writing behind it.

2130
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:17,000
It's Quantum Break, which of course is one of the Xbox One exclusive games that we're sure to get a look at later this year.

2131
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:25,000
It's developed by the same guys who did Alan Wake, which was really underrated in some ways on the Xbox 360.

2132
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Great soundtrack and great game.

2133
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Very Silent Hill meets Twin Peaks.

2134
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
It was really good.

2135
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:35,000
But anyway, those developers, they moved on and they're making Quantum Break.

2136
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Well, this is pretty cool.

2137
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
There's now an Oscar connection.

2138
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
You know, last week our show was up against the Oscars.

2139
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,000
And I'm sure many of you have read about all the movies that won Oscars by this point.

2140
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
And one of those movies that won quite a few Oscars was Gravity.

2141
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Gravity didn't win the best picture prize.

2142
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:51,000
That was 12 Years a Slave.

2143
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
But Gravity did pick up a lot of technical awards and things of that sort.

2144
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Well, what's pretty cool is that some visual effects work in the game will be some of the talent that actually made Gravity that won a lot of those VFX Oscars.

2145
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
So that's really cool.

2146
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:15,000
They were congratulating Greg Luden on the Remedy Games website for the Oscar that he got for Gravity.

2147
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And so, yeah, he worked with Gravity's computer-regenerated interiors with the free-floating space objects and so forth.

2148
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And now he's working on visual effects for Quantum Break and scripting and designing events as level design.

2149
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:38,000
So even though we may not have the first great video game that's been turned into a movie, we certainly are seeing movie elements going into video games.

2150
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I know I for one am very excited about Quantum Break.

2151
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:46,000
That's probably what's going to break me eventually and make me get an Xbox One.

2152
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
So I'm very excited about that.

2153
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,000
All right.

2154
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Let us get to the mailbag.

2155
02:10:52,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Every week you guys send us an email at participate at orangeloungeradio.com and we dive into the mailbag and read some of our favorite emails here on air.

2156
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,000
And we get very mad at all those emails that you drown us in.

2157
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Grr, I hate reading.

2158
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Grr, I hate it.

2159
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I never learn to read.

2160
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I hate it when I play the wrong music bumper.

2161
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Let's try this instead.

2162
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
First email.

2163
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Dear OLR.

2164
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Dear emailer.

2165
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:37,000
In regards to the discussion last week regarding what video game movies will have to do in order to attain widespread critical recognition, it seems that production companies will have to take a serious look at what source material is chosen.

2166
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
That I agree with right away.

2167
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Scanning the Wikipedia list of films based on video games, the source material is almost universally fighting action or horror games.

2168
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:55,000
These are all types of movies that tend to perform well in the box office and fall short in the major awards season.

2169
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:00,000
A problem also arises when considering games that are more story driven such as RPGs.

2170
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:07,000
While I would love to see any number of, let's say, Final Fantasy games adapted, the time constraints of a film would be incredibly difficult to overcome.

2171
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So if big budget action titles, fighters, horror games, sprawling RPGs, and games with effectively no story such as your typical platformer are out, what video game industry darling does that leave us with?

2172
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
That's right, bite-sized indie games.

2173
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,000
You had touched on this idea a bit mentioning Journey, but how about Papo & Yo?

2174
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,000
After all, Pan's Labyrinth won three Oscars and was nominated for three more.

2175
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:36,000
And To the Moon, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind won one and was nominated for another. That's a good movie.

2176
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I know this has been as much to do with the quality of the finished product as it does with the content, but these are games that feature subjects and set pieces that have proven popular with Academy voters.

2177
02:12:48,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Additionally, if these smaller and more sophisticated stories managed more frequently to get the type of exposure this would bring, it could really stand to improve the reputation of gaming as a whole.

2178
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Because really, a Call of Duty or GTA movie isn't going to change anyone's mind about anything, no matter how stimulating it may be to watch.

2179
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Apologies for the lack of any real question beyond something like what indie games have enough story to make a movie, but I just wanted to give my two cents.

2180
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:22,000
So I will now look forward to the day when directors stop thinking that making a video game movie means throwing a dart at the top of a list of-

2181
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
At the top of-

2182
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And tongue tied means throwing a dart at a top ten list of best sellers and start thinking a little smaller and more personal. Until then, stay awesome.

2183
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And that's from Awesome Unicorn.

2184
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:41,000
For that great email, for what it's worth, however, I mean, there is that Minecraft movie and Minecraft did start as an indie game.

2185
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:52,000
I mean, I realize it's grown like crazy, but, you know, there is that. And it sounds like they're approaching it the right way if it's going to be like the Lego movie was type of thing.

2186
02:13:52,000 --> 02:14:00,000
But I do agree with the thought that we don't necessarily always have to think of big budget, like it's got to be like the hot selling games are the only things that are going to make good movies.

2187
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Because we do have good stories and lots of great video games that might make for a good movie.

2188
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:24,000
For the record, I have seen very quality acting coming from those, you know, action and whatever genre that, honestly, if these same actors had been in the indie film or other type of, you know, Oscar-y film, then they would have easily taken the prize. So, I'm just saying.

2189
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Tiger Claw, reminding us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com that, by the way, the Need for Speed movie comes out on March 14th. I know, because I saw Flaco's article on VOG.

2190
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
It said, who knows, it could actually be good considering the games never really had a story.

2191
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:43,000
It's going to be Fast and Furious, the new.

2192
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Exactly. It's just to hold the Fast and Furious crowd over while they figure out what they're going to do with the next movie.

2193
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Okay, next email. We have one more after this.

2194
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Hey OLR Crew, AZHP here. I just wanted to throw in my two cents on the whole Wii and DS Online plug-pull that's going to happen soon.

2195
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I used to be an employee of GameSpy, now acquired slash defunct, so I don't have to worry about telling you guys this stuff, which is actually the company that hosts all the matchmaking for every single Wii and DS Online titles.

2196
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Since you guys are near and dear to my heart, I'm giving you guys the exclusive scoop on this.

2197
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Out of all GameSpy titles that ever existed, including huge games like Borderlands, Mortal Kombat 9, GTA 5, etc., surprisingly the consistently highest traffic title is Mario Kart Wii.

2198
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Now GameSpy got acquired by Glu Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game company a year or so ago, which is around the time I left the company.

2199
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:42,000
So I heard their division isn't doing so well. High turnover, my old manager got pushed out for political reasons.

2200
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:48,000
He was a grade A d-bag. And Glu is probably losing money on that acquisition.

2201
02:15:48,000 --> 02:16:00,000
So I'm guessing that what happened is Glu is trying to cut their losses on the acquisition by either charging a huge amount of money to Nintendo to keep their servers running, enough to justify keeping the engineers to keep the servers maintained at least.

2202
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:05,000
Or they straight up wouldn't renew the contract so they could let those engineers go.

2203
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:14,000
So either Nintendo wouldn't renew for the higher price, or couldn't renew, and it doesn't make financial sense for them to port all their games to new servers they run in-house.

2204
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
That's why you're seeing Wii and DS titles go offline.

2205
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I hope this helps shed some light on the reason behind why Nintendo is shutting off their servers.

2206
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:29,000
They don't hate their fans, and they're probably not trying to drive everyone to just play 3DS and Wii U, though that's an added bonus.

2207
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:35,000
They just don't want to fork the money over to Glu or can't to keep the servers running on a new contract. Here's always AZHP.

2208
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Thank you for sharing that with us, and I hope you all were paying attention because I think that's it.

2209
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:53,000
And it's not just because there might be that insider's perspective or whatever. I think when it's stated like that, it makes a crap ton of sense.

2210
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Agreed.

2211
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
We're going to have to put a second gold star by his name.

2212
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Yep. You're our first double gold star recipient.

2213
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Our first double gold star recipient.

2214
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
One more email?

2215
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
One more email.

2216
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Hello. This is coming from, um, I'm just going to say Ronnie, because he didn't list a name.

2217
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Okay.

2218
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Hello. I have been a listener since the live 365 days, and I really enjoy the show. This is my first email, and I'm about to start college soon.

2219
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I was wondering what your advice on balancing video game time and college study time. Is there a good formula?

2220
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Um, I will say yes, there is.

2221
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Um, when it's at the start of the semester, you can probably get away with gaming a bit more.

2222
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:42,000
You just want to, the way that I do it when I have, because keep in mind, I was a, you know, a graphic design major.

2223
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:46,000
I had a lot of projects, time intensive projects.

2224
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:55,000
And for me, um, I would at least make sure I had one day a week that was my completely not school related time.

2225
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:01,000
So that I could, um, just focus on other things, have fun, let my brain relax.

2226
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Because everyone needs that. If you keep studying all the time, you're going to burn yourself out.

2227
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
So that's what I say.

2228
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Have a night that's you.

2229
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Um, yeah, I, I'm not the best person to answer this question because I kind of didn't finish college.

2230
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,000
And, you know, maybe it's because I didn't prioritize the right way.

2231
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:24,000
But I'll tell you kind of some things I've learned in my adult life is that certainly there's, that you can make time for video games.

2232
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
I think a lot of people go, oh, you'll never be more stressed out than you are in college.

2233
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,000
You'll never, I kind of don't think that's the case. I think your adult life stays just as busy as you are in college.

2234
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:40,000
It's just that you are so overwhelmed and it's so, you know, new, that whole experience that, you know, for me, I wasn't able to do it.

2235
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
But not everybody is.

2236
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
So if you want the best chance for success, I'm going to tell you what I do in my adult life.

2237
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,000
And the best example is probably like the, the actually comes back to this show, OLR.

2238
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:56,000
There is a period of time when I wasn't really posting OLR to the podcast feed for like four days, five days.

2239
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I just kind of, I kind of did it whenever I fucking felt like it, you know, type of thing, which to be fair, it's a free show.

2240
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
And I have the right to do that.

2241
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:10,000
But at the same time, if I want to have the loyalty from the listeners, then I've got to be loyal to them.

2242
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:15,000
If they're, if I expect that, you know, they're going to stay loyal to OLR, then I've got to be loyal and making sure the show gets up on time.

2243
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:24,000
So I had to make a promise to myself, no video games, no MMOs, no nothing until the show gets uploaded right away on Sunday nights.

2244
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Now, granted, if there's another priority, like, oh, you have to go get your partner from work or he'll be standing out in the cold all night.

2245
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Then yes, I'll do that first and then upload the show.

2246
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:42,000
But I think that's what you have to do, Ronnie, to really have that key for success is you really have to promise yourself, I'm not going to touch the games until I finish the work.

2247
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,000
And either you're going to be able to do that or you're not.

2248
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:51,000
You know, you could also have what my issue was.

2249
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
I have a very strong visual memory.

2250
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I couldn't study. I don't study.

2251
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:01,000
If I don't pick it up the first time I read the information, I won't pick it up at all.

2252
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Or not even read it, but from my presentation in class.

2253
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I have to tie something that I am hearing with something I'm seeing.

2254
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,000
But once I do that, I don't have a problem.

2255
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I want to make one clarification because I'm reading the comments in chat, Ron.

2256
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:20,000
It made me realize that I left this big logic gap that people might infer something I'm saying.

2257
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:24,000
So I just want to be very clear because I see Bobby in chat going, don't remind me.

2258
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
And I know a lot of other podcast producers do wait two or three days to put their content up.

2259
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:34,000
So I'm not saying that if you don't do it in a certain amount of time, you're not loyal to your listeners.

2260
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
That's not what I'm trying to say. I want to make that very clear.

2261
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,000
You have to find what works for you.

2262
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:47,000
And what I'm trying to say is that if I don't do it right away, I will slack off until the time.

2263
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
It's all about self-motivation.

2264
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Exactly.

2265
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,000
You have to do it the way you know you can do it.

2266
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Exactly.

2267
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
For me, it works best that I do it right away.

2268
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Like for me, I work better under a deadline.

2269
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:04,000
So I admit I'm kind of a last minute sort of person, but then I get like this really random burst of productivity.

2270
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,000
And I freaking take advantage of it when I have one of those bursts of productivity and I get everything done.

2271
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,000
And then I'm like, oh, crap, I don't have my deadlines anymore.

2272
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:16,000
So I sort of lose track of my other stuff until once again, I'm under a deadline.

2273
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
So your own motivation.

2274
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Let me get some comments in chat because chat is lighting up on this topic as well.

2275
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Speaking of Bobby, Bobby said, I actually play more video games in college than I do now.

2276
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I had more free time because I didn't have as many responsibilities.

2277
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
I had classes and a part time job and that's it.

2278
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
I didn't have to worry about bills and stuff.

2279
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:38,000
So some say, you know, that's a very good perspective that it might get a little worse as you get older.

2280
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
But being an adult is cool.

2281
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I was in band in college.

2282
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Yeah.

2283
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,000
So I did band, I did orchestra and I did jazz band.

2284
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,000
So most of my time was taken up by music because I had those obligations.

2285
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,000
SSJ 100 Matt says, I had roommates who were game designers.

2286
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,000
They failed out because they played too many video games, ironically.

2287
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:07,000
And the other thing is that I actually, I think that I got more responsible with my education once I was a little older

2288
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:11,000
and then started working full time and going to school almost full time.

2289
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Because, I mean, you remember how busy I was at the mortgage job and going to school and doing OLR on top of that.

2290
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:23,000
So it's going to be fun trying to go back to school in the summer.

2291
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:29,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Sky, man, we got ripped a couple of weeks ago for not posting on time.

2292
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
You know, and it's going to happen.

2293
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And I think the audience is going to forgive that mistakes are going to be made or heaven forbid you take a week off.

2294
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Like we're taking a week off next week.

2295
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
And I think most of our listeners are pretty understanding about that,

2296
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,000
especially because we're trying to put out like a mini show or something to kind of bridge the gap a little bit.

2297
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
So, you know, I think the audience can kind of forgive a certain way.

2298
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:53,000
But if you don't have some type of like regularity, that's when you leave your audience open to go find something else to fill the void.

2299
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
That's the only danger.

2300
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,000
But, you know, one or two weeks, you're not really risking going to lose a whole lot.

2301
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:06,000
But if you consistently are all over the place, consistently inconsistent, you're not going to get that consistency out of your listeners either.

2302
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
That's just something I've learned over doing this for a long time.

2303
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I remember what else it was I was doing when I went to the University of South Alabama.

2304
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I drank a lot and then I moved out here and everything got better.

2305
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
So there's a little bit more to this email. OK.

2306
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:24,000
I realize college is all about self-independence and actually learning on your own.

2307
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:30,000
But the few games they do enjoy are addictive and require a lot of time and effort, such as Civilization five, banished fallouts and Minecraft.

2308
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Plus, I want to keep up with the culture, especially as I listen to your show.

2309
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Should I give up on gaming cold turkey until I'm done with my semester or vacation?

2310
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Or did you manage to perfect a good balance with study time that I can adopt?

2311
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I have seen some people go as far as snapping their game discs.

2312
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:50,000
However, I think this is stupid and my games are all on Steam anyway. Thanks.

2313
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
And I guess we answered that question.

2314
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Yeah, I guess we kind of ended up answering it. You have to do what works for you.

2315
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:57,000
I think the snapping the game disc, that's a little much.

2316
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
That's a little extreme and tabloid.

2317
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I don't think you should have to go that far. But I mean, maybe, maybe you put your I mean, again, you said it's all on Steam, so it's not going to batter.

2318
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:19,000
But maybe you take the person you trust most in the world, your best friend, your significant other, your your mother, father, take the person you trust most in the world.

2319
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Give them your Steam password and say, change it and then give it back to me when X, Y, Z is done.

2320
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,000
You know, it might come to that point where essentially you have to give the keys to somebody else, right?

2321
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Yeah, but I think you should have a little bit more faith in yourself.

2322
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And I agree that you have to gauge yourself.

2323
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:41,000
You know, like, you know, every I'll admit there are some times I skipped class to go watch Sailor Moon.

2324
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I'll admit or my thing at the time was actually running warriors because that was freaking cool.

2325
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:53,000
But, you know, would stay up until two in the morning playing to Shinden because I had class at 10 the next day.

2326
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Right. You know, but that's part of the experience is, you know, if you're going to do your gaming, perhaps do something more multiplayer.

2327
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Use it as a social moment and then use it when you're done with your regular studies.

2328
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
You know, and even with your study, allot yourself time.

2329
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Study in bursts of 20 minutes, take five minute break, another 20 minutes, five minute break.

2330
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
But don't overload yourself with your study.

2331
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,000
You will burn out.

2332
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:24,000
It's all balance. You can't give up your fun for the sake of your responsibility.

2333
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:28,000
But at the same time, you can't let your responsibility eat you.

2334
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:34,000
So say bye. And yes, I played a lot of to Shinden when I was just in college, because that was 1994.

2335
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:40,000
My roommate's boyfriend had a PlayStation. No, 1995, got a PlayStation.

2336
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:45,000
My good friend had a Japanese Sega Saturn, so I would spend a lot of time over his dorm playing that, too.

2337
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
So, yeah, I did a lot of gaming in college the first time.

2338
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
That's it.

2339
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:56,000
All right. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you have an email to send us for a future week.

2340
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,000
In the meantime, now I can play the angry music.

2341
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Now I can get to that because it's time for the FUs of the week.

2342
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Here is punishment.

2343
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:17,000
This is fucked up.

2344
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:24,000
A few goes to my bizarre allergies, because I've been kind of straying a little bit from my healthy eating style.

2345
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:32,000
And I found really tasty, low carb, whole wheat tortillas and my allergies starting to act up again.

2346
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,000
So it's clearly something going on with wheat.

2347
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:40,000
And I've had weird, you know, I had that really bizarre rash the other week.

2348
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:48,000
So I have to cut back out all the wheat again and getting back on the straight and narrow until I go to Disneyland for my birthday.

2349
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:53,000
So, yeah, fuck wheat.

2350
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Loki.

2351
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:00,000
After the people that go into the self-checkout line and don't know how to use the self-checkout line,

2352
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I waited in line for about like 5-10 minutes for someone checking out one thing.

2353
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:15,000
It's like I was out of there in 30 seconds, but I don't know why these people stand there kind of staring at the screen not knowing what to do.

2354
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I'm just going to give an FU to the stress of moving.

2355
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:31,000
And the fact, I'm going to, I'll say this, I'm going to give an FU to the fact that I know that people dig through the garbage here at my apartment complex as they do at most apartment complexes.

2356
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And part of why I'm excited to move into a house is that, yay, I can put the garbage out right when they come to pick it up and all that stuff.

2357
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,000
So that's exciting.

2358
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:43,000
But the thing that like really pisses me off is that, like, I've got all this mail and the shredders kind of dead.

2359
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
So it's like, and I don't want to throw it away because people go through the garbage.

2360
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,000
So it's like, I've got my shredder works. Does it? I've got a lot.

2361
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
But it's okay. You can bring it over and use my shredder.

2362
02:27:53,000 --> 02:28:01,000
We've been talking about, uh, just maybe taking a big bulk thing over to like Staples or one of those stores that, you know, office stores that does the shredding, but it's just irritating.

2363
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I can also talk to Dan and see if you can use a secure shred at, that's an option.

2364
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,000
You never know. You never know. Anyway, so, all right.

2365
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Um, let's get into a couple more news stories for you guys.

2366
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,000
And we're going to get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2367
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:22,000
But first, let's get to Loki.

2368
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Yes, so everybody's favorite space simulation game is now teaming up with NASA.

2369
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Kerbel Space Program is teaming up with NASA to actually do, what is it, an asteroid redirect mission.

2370
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:42,000
And it's supposed to be based off of real NASA data.

2371
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:49,000
And that they're, I don't know, I guess maybe allowing people to kind of try to come up with their own ideas.

2372
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Basically, Kerbel Space Program is giving the gamers a chance to dream big even if they're not astrophysicists.

2373
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:07,000
The relationship with NASA, the very beacon of big dreams and imagination is going to give players a real opportunity to learn about the universe we're living in.

2374
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:16,000
And I guess, you know, what this mission entails is attempting to land astronauts on an asteroid orbiting between our moon.

2375
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:26,000
So, I'm guessing, or beyond our moon, so I'm guessing that, are we looking at like a Armageddon type situation here?

2376
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Are we going to land on the asteroid and blow it up or something like that? I mean, is that what we're doing here?

2377
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Either way, it looks like it'll be fun.

2378
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:42,000
That sounds awesome. I like it when real life kind of meets video games like that.

2379
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Have you played this Kerbel Space Program at all? Because I know I really haven't.

2380
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I haven't. I kind of wanted, though.

2381
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Yeah?

2382
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:53,000
I mean, it looks good. I'll wait for it until it goes on sale.

2383
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Awesome. I think it was in a Humble Bundle recently, though. I don't know if it's going to get much cheaper than that.

2384
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,000
No, it wasn't. You're thinking Starbound.

2385
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Yeah, if it was in Humble Bundle, I would have remembered that.

2386
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Maybe it was in one of the other indie bundles, because I swear I got that game through one of those.

2387
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
But anyway, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line.

2388
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:22,000
And this is actually pretty sad, and I don't like to end shows on sad notes, but it is what it is.

2389
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,000
I've got a report that Jeff Edwards passed away this past week at the age of 83.

2390
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:31,000
He died on March 5th, 2014, in Santa Monica, California.

2391
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Probably best known for hosting game shows. He hosted Jackpot and Treasure Hunt.

2392
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:41,000
And, of course, why would I bring him up on a video game podcast, Dark Sakura?

2393
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,000
What else did he host that we all know? If you grew up in the 80s.

2394
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
What? No.

2395
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Oh, I thought you knew.

2396
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:49,000
No, I didn't.

2397
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Loki, do you know?

2398
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Nope.

2399
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:56,000
I know his name, so I'm trying to run through my head.

2400
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Starrcade.

2401
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Starrcade, oh my god, yeah.

2402
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:05,000
The granddaddy of playing the video game shows there in the early 80s.

2403
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Sorry to put you on the spot, Jamie. I thought you knew. I thought that's why you went off.

2404
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Thanks, Rob.

2405
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Sorry.

2406
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:15,000
But, yeah, obviously a very well-known game show host just from that and so forth.

2407
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:18,000
So, yeah, really sad to hear that.

2408
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I mean, he was 83, but still, you know, these are never any fun to report on.

2409
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:28,000
So, tip one back for the man that gave away arcade machines.

2410
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Actually, I saw an episode on YouTube. They are all on YouTube.

2411
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:34,000
There's, like, people that have archived, like, every single episode on YouTube.

2412
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Nice.

2413
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
They gave away a fucking Tron machine in a couple episodes.

2414
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
What?

2415
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Little jerk kids that won the Tron machine.

2416
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Yeah, I bet they don't even have it anymore. Jerks.

2417
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:50,000
All right. We are going to go to the Skype line right now.

2418
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype.

2419
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call.

2420
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Dartetsuya says, I was surprised that he was that old when he started.

2421
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Yeah, he kind of – because if you think about it, you know, that show was back in the 80s.

2422
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
That was, what, like 30 years ago.

2423
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
He was in his 50s when that show was on.

2424
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:11,000
So, hey, there's still hope for me to host a game show someday, right?

2425
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
We need to get you a sparkly jacket.

2426
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I have a sparkly jacket.

2427
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Well, of course you do, Rocky.

2428
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
When were you Columbia?

2429
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Birdcage Cinemas, late 90s, early 2000s.

2430
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
You seriously were Columbia?

2431
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I did Columbia one time, but I wore somebody else's.

2432
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I wore Jessica's jacket or somebody else's back in the – from those days.

2433
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'm just trying to picture you as Columbia.

2434
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Well, I was walking down the street just to have an opinion.

2435
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Okay. I guess if I could do Dr. Scott, you can do Columbia.

2436
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Do you want me to tap dance right now for you?

2437
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:43,000
No.

2438
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Quick, somebody call. Are you going to get tap danced?

2439
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
You can make the squeal noise.

2440
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Mm-hmm.

2441
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Eddie!

2442
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Eddie!

2443
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Sadly, there's people listening to this show that have never seen the Rocky Horror Pictures show.

2444
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
That's your homework assignment, everybody.

2445
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Poor children.

2446
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Watch it and make sure you have friends with you who have seen it

2447
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:03,000
so that you at least won't get caught out as a virgin at the real show.

2448
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
All right. We are going to go to the phones right now and take a call

2449
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
because we do have a caller on the line.

2450
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry. Who's this?

2451
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
This is Raging Aider.

2452
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Hey, Raging Aider. Nice to see you. What's up?

2453
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Nice to see you, too.

2454
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:19,000
How long since you had Justin TV?

2455
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Justin TV. When were those days?

2456
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
That was like the mid-300s with those episodes.

2457
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Those were the other house.

2458
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:28,000
That was two studios ago.

2459
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Yes.

2460
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,000
It was a while ago.

2461
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Yeah, it's been a while.

2462
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:40,000
But anyway, a couple really quick random questions.

2463
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,000
You know, DarkSakura already knows that I mentioned this to her

2464
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,000
on Steam's chat, I think, yesterday.

2465
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I just signed up for Origin yesterday.

2466
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Now, probably one of the first games I'm probably going to plan on buying on there

2467
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:06,000
would be Mass Effect 3.

2468
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Do it.

2469
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:08,000
A worthy choice.

2470
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Now, I know you guys are big fans of the series.

2471
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:17,000
No, us? Loki hates it, for what it's worth.

2472
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Get all the games if you don't have them.

2473
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,000
You can't just start on three.

2474
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I'm just starting to really get into the series myself,

2475
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,000
and I just barely started playing the first game,

2476
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:37,000
and actually I haven't played the third one yet, but that's precisely the point.

2477
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Now, the question is, how is the multiplayer on Mass Effect 3?

2478
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Is it any good?

2479
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
What's the best part of the game?

2480
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
It's really good, Rage Nator,

2481
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:51,000
and the reason why is because they focused on co-op instead of competitive.

2482
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:54,000
In fact, there is no competitive multiplayer in Mass Effect 3,

2483
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,000
which I can see where some people might see that as a bummer, which is fine.

2484
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Maybe that'll be in the next Mass Effect game, but it is all co-op,

2485
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
and essentially what it is is that it's four of you defending a base.

2486
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,000
You defend a base against ten waves of aliens.

2487
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
And different missions for each wave, too.

2488
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Yes, waves three, six, and ten have special missions,

2489
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:17,000
and that might be like, hold this point, or escort this drone.

2490
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Or carry this item, so you can't run while you're carrying it.

2491
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:25,000
So you have to cooperate, and that's why I think the multiplayer attracts people

2492
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:29,000
like myself and Dark Soccer, who don't usually play shooter-type multiplayer,

2493
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:33,000
is because it fosters an environment of helping people.

2494
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:36,000
And the people that are going to be like, man, you suck, and duh-duh-duh-duh-duh,

2495
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
they don't usually play on beginner anyway.

2496
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:42,000
They don't play on the bronze matches. They're all in gold and platinum.

2497
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
The bronze matches are more fun anyway.

2498
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:47,000
You just sort of fuck around from time to time.

2499
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,000
And if somebody's being that big of an asshat, then you leave and they're fucked.

2500
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,000
We've done silver matches anyway, and it was pretty fun.

2501
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Remember that one time we tried a platinum match,

2502
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
and we almost made it through one wave?

2503
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Yeah, I know. Platinum matches are pretty scary.

2504
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
But yeah, there's a lot to that.

2505
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Here's my only concern, Reginator. Here's my concern.

2506
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:07,000
I'm going to be real with you because you're getting into Mass Effect 3 a little late in the game.

2507
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:12,000
I worry because EA has this tendency when they got a new game coming out,

2508
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
they're going to yank the servers on the old game.

2509
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:22,000
I think you've got at least a good year left because this is all the Mass Effect we have right now.

2510
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Until they announce Mass Effect Next, I can't call it Mass Effect 4

2511
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:27,000
because they say it's going to be something else,

2512
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:30,000
but until we know what Mass Effect Next really is,

2513
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
then I can't really sit here one way or the other and say, you know,

2514
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
when these multiplayer servers are going to go down.

2515
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:39,000
So I think you've got a good year left.

2516
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:44,000
How about, though, we set a night that we run you through the ropes of multiplayer some night?

2517
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:49,000
You're very kind. For me, it's going to have to be a couple weeks because I'm moving,

2518
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
so I can't volunteer for that.

2519
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I gave you my origin. I don't care who knows it. It's Kuro Tsubasa, like my Tumblr.

2520
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
But I bet you will find some other VoG people that will help you out.

2521
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Maybe you guys can convince Bobby Black Wolf to finally use his copy.

2522
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Yeah, Bobby. Play with us.

2523
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Actually, I did send out four or five invites already.

2524
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
One person already accepted. I was just waiting for the rest of the people to log in.

2525
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I haven't signed into Origin in like five months, so if I'm one of them, I'll get around to it eventually.

2526
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I didn't sign into Origin for a little while,

2527
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,000
and I'm actually, while I'm trying to finish my 17th...

2528
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Actually, no, I'm on my 18th playthrough of Mass Effect 3 right now.

2529
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:37,000
And when I finish that one, then I'm going to be going to Dragon Age 2 to give it another good run-through again.

2530
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Yeah, I kind of think of it. I saw Dragon Age listed on their online store,

2531
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:51,000
and I don't know a whole lot about that series.

2532
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Above and beyond, maybe one or two trailers that I may have seen on PlayStation Network.

2533
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:03,000
But would you say that Dragon Age is a good series to play if you like role-playing games?

2534
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I love Dragon Age 2. It's a lot more combat-oriented, but there's plenty of good role-play elements in it.

2535
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I couldn't get into it the way that Alan really got into it, and Shane, one of my best friends, is really into it.

2536
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I couldn't get into it the way they did.

2537
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Maybe, you know what though, but again, Mass Effect was a game I tried,

2538
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:27,000
and I just didn't get back to it until years later, and I was like,

2539
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
this is the best thing ever. So I think I just need to go back and try Dragon Age again.

2540
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,000
I kept starting the first Dragon Age and kept stopping it,

2541
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:38,000
and then I just picked up Dragon Age 2 and just played and played the crap out of it,

2542
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
and then got to this one part that I couldn't beat,

2543
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
because I was a stupid idiot and brought Fenris into this one dream level.

2544
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Fenris, by the way, is awesome, and you want to have them on your good side.

2545
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:52,000
But then I went back and played through on PC.

2546
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:56,000
I started having these problems with my hand, and I've beaten the game on PC,

2547
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:00,000
and I'm actually going to be kind of skipping the first Dragon Age again and going back to Dragon Age 2.

2548
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Ragenator, I feel like in some ways we've seen you groan as a gamer as you've been listening to OLR.

2549
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I know you've been listening for a while now, but I remember when you first would call this show,

2550
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,000
you'd be talking about Nintendo 64 games and stuff that was really classics,

2551
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:17,000
and now you're getting up to games from like last year, so I'm impressed, Ragenator.

2552
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Yeah, honestly, you know, as weird as this sounds,

2553
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:32,000
my PlayStation 3 being stolen a year and a half ago is actually a good thing in a sense.

2554
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:39,000
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but before my PlayStation 3 was stolen,

2555
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:44,000
I would never in a million years consider PC gaming.

2556
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Now that it's gone, I kind of like begrudgingly signed up for Steam.

2557
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:55,000
And now it's a whole new world! There you go.

2558
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
All right, well, Ragenator, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls,

2559
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:02,000
but have fun on Origin, and I will try to jump in the game and kill some of the Reapers.

2560
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
You'll learn why we call it LoLirgin.

2561
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
All right. Bye, buddy. Take care.

2562
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Yep, you too. Take care.

2563
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:12,000
All right, that was Ragenator on our Skype line at 1877 Game OLR,

2564
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,000
or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

2565
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
and BobbyBlackWolf in chat saying,

2566
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I haven't opened Origin in a year. It was SimCity.

2567
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:24,000
And apparently BobbyBlackWolf and Shane having a discussion about

2568
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:27,000
that they can't like the same things, apparently,

2569
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:28,000
which is why Bobby doesn't like Mass Effect.

2570
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
They're playing Final Fantasy XIV.

2571
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Yeah, very good point.

2572
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Oh, actually, what Shane just said.

2573
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Yeah, Shane just said that in the chat.

2574
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:39,000
But, to be fair, Shane, Bobby always makes fun of Endgame,

2575
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
which is all you sign in to do.

2576
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I need to fucking catch up.

2577
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I just hit level 34.

2578
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I feel like I'm being so slow.

2579
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Oh, that's all right.

2580
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I took my time with WoW, too.

2581
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
You know what, though? The converse of that?

2582
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Oh, by the way, again, the Skype line is open at 1877 Game OLR,

2583
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,000
username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2584
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
The converse of that, DarkSakura,

2585
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
is that when you burn through the content too fast, like where I'm at,

2586
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:04,000
I only sign in to raid, and then outside of that, I'm like,

2587
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,000
what else am I going to do?

2588
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Should I level another class?

2589
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Eh, I'm over it.

2590
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:08,000
I'm going to go play Diablo.

2591
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

2592
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Yeah, I mean, but I also started another character

2593
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
so I could play with Junami.

2594
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Oh, nice.

2595
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:16,000
On the work server.

2596
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Shane's been really trying to get me to go back to Final Fantasy XI,

2597
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
which apparently they've made all these quality of life changes.

2598
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
You can just zip through a lot of the content

2599
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:28,000
you used to have to find parties for and all this stuff, so.

2600
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Well, the only change they need to make is make it go free to play.

2601
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Right? That's the one change they need to make,

2602
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
and I'll be on Final Fantasy XI tomorrow.

2603
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
You hear that, Shane?

2604
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Make it free to play, and you got it.

2605
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:39,000
I'm back.

2606
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
But I don't know, it's Square Enix.

2607
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Do you see Square Enix doing a free-to-play MMO like that?

2608
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
I mean, I guess they have free-to-play mobile games.

2609
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Some of them are free.

2610
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
They'll monetize the crap out of it, though.

2611
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:51,000
They'll have you buying Gil and all sorts of garbage like that.

2612
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Yeah, some of them are pretty awful.

2613
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Well, you know, and I talk about this with World of Warcraft,

2614
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:00,000
is that I always say that Blizzard should just give the vanilla game away

2615
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:06,000
and then sell the expansions, and as far as Final Fantasy XI goes,

2616
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
I think they could do that there as well,

2617
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:11,000
is that they could give away the vanilla game

2618
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:15,000
and then just sell the expansions or something like that.

2619
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Let's see.

2620
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,000
I have a problem that if I get to Endgame in XIV,

2621
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I'm going to get bored again and then go back to Space Goats

2622
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:25,000
when it comes out for a while.

2623
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Dan's like, no, but I don't know.

2624
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Unfortunately, the listeners are not able to hear my voice right now

2625
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
because our server went down.

2626
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:36,000
It's not us.

2627
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Unfortunately.

2628
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
Yeah.

2629
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:39,000
No.

2630
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,000
So I can put a call out for calls, but we're not going to get any.

2631
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:47,000
So I guess I can go to Twitter at this point.

2632
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Hopefully we'll get through at some point.

2633
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
God, that pisses me off.

2634
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I get pissed off too.

2635
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I've about had it with this hosting server.

2636
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:56,000
So have I.

2637
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
We need to tell them to best TFU.

2638
02:42:58,000 --> 02:42:59,000
It's getting a little ridiculous,

2639
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:03,000
and I think we've given them the stern email before

2640
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:06,000
that they are not to do reboots on our server on Sunday night,

2641
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
and yet here we are.

2642
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:12,000
So something's going to happen with that.

2643
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
They're going to lose some business.

2644
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Meanwhile, I'm going to our Twitter,

2645
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:21,000
and SG100Matt tweeted us a story about Jeff Edwards,

2646
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:24,000
so a lot of people thinking about Jeff Edwards.

2647
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Our friend Marin Marvel, Tiara, tweeted and said,

2648
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
OLR is going up against Neil T. Sun.

2649
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:31,000
What is that?

2650
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
And Cosmos right now.

2651
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Oh, because Cosmos is back with...

2652
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Neil Tyson.

2653
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Yeah.

2654
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:40,000
And says, sorry, guys.

2655
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Got to get my science nerd on.

2656
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
This is why we podcast the show.

2657
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:44,000
I can forgive.

2658
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,000
We're back, by the way.

2659
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:46,000
I can forgive.

2660
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Oh, good.

2661
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:48,000
We're back.

2662
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
You guys missed my little rant where I've basically said,

2663
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
as far as this server host of ours goes,

2664
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:56,000
I have had it officially.

2665
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Yeah, we've reconnected.

2666
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:58,000
We're streaming.

2667
02:43:58,000 --> 02:43:59,000
We're good.

2668
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
We're good.

2669
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Although, honestly, I'm going to go back

2670
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:04,000
and download the torrent of Cosmos so I can watch it,

2671
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:09,000
because, man, I grew up with Carl Sagan and Cosmos, you know?

2672
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
And what was that show that had that old guy

2673
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,000
that would walk on, like, a path of stars

2674
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
or something in outer space?

2675
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Do you remember that show, Rob?

2676
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
I don't.

2677
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
It was like this astronomy show.

2678
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Mm-mm.

2679
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000
The fuck show was that?

2680
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Oh, my God, because I used to watch that show.

2681
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
I'm like, oh, my God, he's in space.

2682
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
And then I got older, but I kept watching it.

2683
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,000
It was a really good show.

2684
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
God, help me, chat room.

2685
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,000
I don't remember what this show was, and I'm old.

2686
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:34,000
In response to last week's show,

2687
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Picuruno said, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a great game, no joke,

2688
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:42,000
and I did get both zombie DLC packs for Train Simulator.

2689
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
They actually have a story.

2690
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Act deft on a couple things from last week.

2691
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
My Little Pony, Fighting is Magic tribute edition

2692
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
is released by fans.

2693
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Note, this is not done by main six, the original devs.

2694
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Oh, maybe that was a story for last week's show,

2695
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
or maybe that was submitted for this week.

2696
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I don't know anymore.

2697
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:02,000
It says six days.

2698
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,000
So, put out one more call for calls.

2699
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2700
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,000
But I wouldn't be surprised at all if our little upsy and downsies

2701
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:16,000
with the server.

2702
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I want someone to remind me what the fuck that show was,

2703
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,000
because it's really pissing me off now.

2704
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Describe it one more time.

2705
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:23,000
It had, like, some old guy, not old, but, you know,

2706
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:29,000
silver-haired guy, kind of, not portly, but kind of...

2707
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,000
Fluffy.

2708
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Fluffy.

2709
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:36,000
And, oh my God, no, it wasn't Harry Caray, Space the Infinite Frontier.

2710
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:40,000
And he would wear, like, these sweaters with his collar poking out

2711
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
and would just, like, talk about space.

2712
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
It was an astronomy show.

2713
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:45,000
No, it wasn't Mr. Wizard?

2714
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:46,000
No, it wasn't Mr. Wizard.

2715
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Mr. Wizard wasn't Fluffy either.

2716
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:48,000
It wasn't Mr. Wizard.

2717
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
You know Mr. Wizard hated kids.

2718
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Yes, I heard that.

2719
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:54,000
That's got to be an underground legend thing, though.

2720
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:58,000
But he'd, like, walk up into space and everything

2721
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
on, like, his trail of stars.

2722
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Now I don't freaking remember what it was called.

2723
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
That was an awesome show.

2724
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
All right.

2725
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,000
I'll put one more call out.

2726
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,000
1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2727
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Meanwhile, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories for us tonight?

2728
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:13,000
I haven't called on you yet.

2729
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:14,000
I do, actually.

2730
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:17,000
There's going to be an update to Just Cause 2 multiplayer,

2731
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:18,000
and you remember that mod?

2732
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:22,000
It allows you to play, like, thousands of people online at one time.

2733
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Well, they've added a few things.

2734
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Earthquakes, real-time vehicle color changing.

2735
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
You can teleport.

2736
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Gibs on death.

2737
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:34,000
You can also do a Back to the Future-style car teleportation.

2738
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Hats, heat-seeking missiles, and cars that drive in the water.

2739
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Plus, you can also blend objects together,

2740
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:47,000
so they have a picture of an airplane combined with a whale.

2741
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Good stuff.

2742
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,000
All right.

2743
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
I had a call, and then they hung up, so,

2744
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:55,000
because I had them on hold while Loki was finishing that thought.

2745
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Darsakha, you found your show?

2746
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Yes, it was Stargazers, with Jack Fulley, Horkmimer.

2747
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I'm double-checking that this is him,

2748
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
but the show used to be called Star Hustler.

2749
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:12,000
So, that was our buddy, VX JasonXV, who Google-food that for you.

2750
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:15,000
I found it, but then I went back and saw that he did it.

2751
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Okay.

2752
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Star Hustler sounds like an awesome sci-fi series.

2753
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,000
It does.

2754
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:20,000
And there's not a picture of him.

2755
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Crap.

2756
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
But it was a cool show.

2757
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,000
He died in, oh, he died in Florida in 2010.

2758
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Oh, sad.

2759
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
What a sad ending to that story.

2760
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Any other last-minute stories, Loki,

2761
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:37,000
while we wait to see if somebody calls back, or?

2762
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:38,000
That was it.

2763
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:39,000
That was it.

2764
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
It was him, and that was the show.

2765
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Oh, my God.

2766
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
No, I didn't have anything else.

2767
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,000
All right.

2768
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Well, it is after 9 o'clock, so I guess I'm going to go ahead

2769
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:51,000
and shut down the Skype line and wrap things up for the night.

2770
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Sorry to those that didn't get through,

2771
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
but if you want to email us, participate.

2772
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:57,000
At orangelandtrader.com is the place to send those emails.

2773
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Once again, we will not be back next week.

2774
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:04,000
We'll have something taped, so podcast listeners,

2775
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
nothing will actually change for you except a plan

2776
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
that the show will be a little shorter next week.

2777
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:13,000
Live folks, you will hear that show debut Sunday night here

2778
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
on the network, and then Starboard Power Coupling

2779
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:18,000
in their preview spot right after us next Sunday,

2780
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:21,000
and then we'll be back live in two weeks.

2781
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Everybody, please cross your fingers and toes for me.

2782
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
I need all the happy thoughts I can.

2783
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:28,000
Not only did the move goes well, but the internet works very well

2784
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
in the new place, and we're able to get everything set up.

2785
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Because if not, fuck you, Comcast.

2786
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Yeah, because if not, I don't know what's going to happen.

2787
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:38,000
I just want to warn people there's the possibility.

2788
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
We'll be in my living room.

2789
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Yeah, there's a possibility if things go wrong,

2790
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
we could be gone for more than a week.

2791
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:47,000
So I just want to prepare everybody for that, but trust us.

2792
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:50,000
We will do all that we can to be back ASAP.

2793
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:56,000
That's just my disclaimer in my whole I love you guys.

2794
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Tune in and listen to every minute of every show.

2795
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:03,000
So trust me, we will be back ASAP just in case.

2796
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Meanwhile, that is it.

2797
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
It's about time to wrap up another week of the show.

2798
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
You know what? You said meanwhile,

2799
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
and it made me think of Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice.

2800
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:15,000
And Becky and I passed the Hall of Justice.

2801
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:16,000
The Hall of Justice.

2802
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,000
The Hall of Justice.

2803
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:18,000
In Susanville?

2804
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Not in Susanville, but up in one of those little small towns.

2805
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
And we wanted to go back and take a picture of it.

2806
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Nice.

2807
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
But we also passed a red phone booth.

2808
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,000
That's awesome.

2809
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Like an old school red phone booth.

2810
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Nice.

2811
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,000
That's cool.

2812
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:32,000
All right.

2813
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Well, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2814
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Thank you guys as always for tuning in every week and supporting our show.

2815
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:38,000
We appreciate it.

2816
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:42,000
You know, all we say, just if you like the show, help spread the word.

2817
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Leave a nice review on iTunes.

2818
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Stitcher's really great too.

2819
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
We need more good reviews there.

2820
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Also, tell a friend or two or five or 50 about the show and help us spread the word.

2821
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,000
That is all we ask.

2822
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:57,000
And spread the word about all independent broadcasting and all the great hardworking.

2823
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:00,000
I just gave a shout out to like five other podcast buddies of mine.

2824
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:03,000
I know there's a lot of other hardworking people out there at the Voice of Geeks Network

2825
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:07,000
and other networks out there and just everybody that works hard.

2826
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:11,000
Also, eat your vegetables.

2827
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Because I believe in your health.

2828
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Loki, I really hope that we're able to see you in a couple weeks.

2829
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:18,000
But if not, I understand.

2830
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
We'll do the Skype thing a little longer.

2831
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:23,000
But do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2832
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:26,000
More people need to play on the Minecraft server, including me.

2833
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Including me?

2834
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:30,000
I've been very failing in getting on there.

2835
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:31,000
I'll try to log in tomorrow.

2836
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Yeah.

2837
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:33,000
All right.

2838
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:38,000
My final thought for tonight is I at least hope the internet holds up better at the new place.

2839
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:41,000
And Dark Soccer, last but not least, your final thought.

2840
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Here's my new catchphrase.

2841
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Question everything.

2842
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Hmm.

2843
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,000
All right.

2844
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:47,000
That's going to do it.

2845
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
We will see you next time from our brand new studio in two weeks.

2846
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
Until then, good night.

2847
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:24,000
See you next week.

2848
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Bye.
