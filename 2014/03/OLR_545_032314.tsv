0	17840	This week, GDC is come and gone and the future is bright for 2014. Microsoft has given a
17840	21720	date for more of the Xbox One's release and the VR space is growing. Valve added a VR
21720	25240	mode to Steam and Sony showed off its concept to GDC. All this and more on the show where
25240	31720	every gamer has a voice.
31720	34880	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34880	41080	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number
41080	52100	545 for March 23, 2014 from our brand new studio N7. That's number 7. My name is Rob
52100	57860	Roberts and joining me here in our new digs is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.
57860	63360	It's echoey. It is a little echoey. Hello from space. I'm hoping that doesn't get picked
63360	67680	up by the mics too much but we might have to dampen the noise in here a little more
67680	73200	because this is supposed to be like a dining room. I ain't dampening shit. I'm okay because
73200	76880	people will fuss at me now that I've been doing it like I did it all of twice and then
76880	82340	fussed out when I didn't do it the third time. So sup bitches. Sup. So do you like
82340	87720	the new digs? I do. I do. I really like this door behind me that no one can see me just
87720	91260	pointing to. I know because it is Orange Lounge Radio. I fucking love that door and I want
91260	97160	to steal it. I'm taking that door home. Now by the way Jamie I have to apologize in advance
97160	101380	tonight because I'm kind of stealing your M.O. I've been getting over a sinus infection
101380	107660	the past few days which I know is usually your thing to be sick. Girl. No. So if I sound
107660	111460	different that's not the new studio's fault. That is the fact that. That's Rob's disease.
111460	115340	Yeah I'm actually getting over like I was really bad like this is I've had this since
115340	121740	Tuesday and I still can't shake it. Well you know I've avoided my annual sinus infection,
121740	126400	my sort of springtime infection because I found that there's a corticosteroid that's
126400	131180	over the counter and I bought the fuck out of it. And now my face doesn't feel like death
131180	135940	like it normally does right about now. Hooray. So. You stick it up your nose and you squeeze
135940	139820	shit up there. That sounds gross. And then you snort it. That sounds gross. When I put
139820	145140	it that way yeah it does. Alright well joining us not on the Skype line tonight but here
145140	151820	in studio welcome back everybody tech master Loki live in the flesh. I'm I'm sitting here
151820	156500	I'm trying to find spots on the carpet and the floor that aren't. Wobbly for the. Wobbly
156500	160300	yes. Oh yeah good luck good luck with that. It's alright I think I figured it out. We
160300	164060	got to get used to the new digs and break them in a little bit. Well welcome back. Yeah
164060	169540	it's nice to actually be out of the kitchen. And in our kitchen. Well yeah it's it's it's
169540	174660	such it's so hard to like like I feel like seriously it's like mute mute mute mute mute
174660	179860	and just yeah yeah with all the kids and stuff in the background. So well I can make some
179860	185300	extra noise or something if it helps. I've been reading about the saga of Screamy. Yep
185300	191580	he also noticed what Captain Fuzzy Pants. I don't know about according to your lady.
191580	198940	He likes to scream. Well I don't say he likes his colicky so he screams himself to sleep
198940	207220	every night for a while which is why hopefully I'll be back next week because you know this
207220	211020	is the first night that the wife's put. Well she has her mom coming over to help but this
211020	216020	is the first time she's gonna be wrangling both kids at the same time you know. And so
216020	221780	tonight's a trial run with. She's not entirely happy with that but I was like it's like well
221780	229380	I'm gonna let you make this decision. I'm like I'm going sorry Nellie. But I'm like
229380	233620	it's been four months. Yeah I was just gonna say how did you like Dark Soccer's Christmas
233620	238860	present. You guys think I'm kidding but no he just opened it. Loki got to open his Christmas
238860	243980	present finally. I like it it's great. Share the chocolate with Nellie it sounds like she needs
243980	248020	it. Yeah there you go there you go butter her up with chocolate that always works. But you know
248020	253220	what I have to say I'm glad for people who can do the kid thing. Oh yeah. So glad I don't have any.
253220	261620	I have a cat. Yeah that's a you know parents my child is a cat. And Sanrio is finally getting
261620	265300	used to this whole new house you know she hid behind the toilet for a day and I posted. She
265300	268620	was trying to be one with the toilet. Well I posted that picture on Twitter where she was
268860	274780	trying to hide under the litter box. She doesn't like to be around other people at all. But now
274780	279900	she's kind of exploring a little more and actually she likes to jump up on the windowsill which was
279900	286180	something we never had in the apartment. Kitty cats need sunshine. Yeah absolutely absolutely.
286180	291460	Well believe it or not it is a show about video games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle. We
291460	295860	do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby
295900	301420	Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network. Live.vognetwork.com is the place where you can
301420	307620	join us live if you want to chat along with our show tonight. And let's see going to going to
307620	313500	our chat room VX Jason XV says I'm not hearing echo. Well that's a good thing. Jason would know.
313500	318100	And by the way I'm glad Jason said something because this reminds me to acknowledge Jason
318100	323340	because Jason has helped out Studio N7 from afar as well. You guys might remember now I'm not
323340	326100	gonna promise this is gonna fix everything but you guys might remember especially if you're a
326100	330900	live listener the show has a tendency to drop once in a while. Well Jason said I think I have
330900	335940	an idea how to fix that. So he got us a brand new cable modem so we no longer have to rely on a
335940	340660	rental from the cable company. So thank you Jason. Big round of applause for Jay. I mean as if he
340660	344860	doesn't do enough for the show. It helps. That was very kind. I know going from like a rental modem
344860	350500	to a you know my own modem it helps. Now that I said now that I said that we're gonna drop in
350500	356260	five seconds. Dan and I invested in our own about a year ago. It made all the difference. Yeah so
356260	361460	um well either way I appreciate the fact that I don't have to rent another one or the other one
361460	366740	anymore I can just take it back so that'll be great. Tech 2030 in chat says it sounds a little
366740	370580	different than the old studio. Well hopefully in a good way. We tried to rebalance the mics and
370580	375500	everything. There's just not enough fuzzy furniture in the room that's why it's not yet. I think that
375500	381620	my tablet just doesn't like the connection though because I keep popping in and out. Don't. Well
381620	387540	we'll try to we'll try to work. Basted. Um Loki had a great idea though for the studio. We should
387540	392140	get like try to go to a yard sale and get one of those really tacky orange couches and have it here
392140	395780	on the side wall for the guests. Actually that's something that you can do yourself you know. What?
395780	399500	If you can get a couch that's in decent shape all you have to do is buy the right kind of material
399500	404140	and you can just sort of over upholster it. Yeah but like an or just even like put an orange throw
404140	408300	on it or something. Well no I'd say over upholster it and you know make sure it's really good. But
408300	416820	yeah I know how to do all that stuff. I'm crafty. There you go. Awesome. All right um let's see.
416820	422740	Tech 2030 clarifies just different. I don't know how to explain it and saying it doesn't sound bad
422740	427340	at all. Well that's good. I'm glad. I'm glad to hear things are in good shape. So listen it's a
427380	434340	trade-off. You either get my crappy headset audio or you get a slight reverberation from the kind
434340	438020	of empty room. Which we'll work on. We're gonna add more stuff in here and then. Speaking of which
438020	445660	I got like I said I've got a a bar top arcade cabinet that I built that's just sitting collecting
445660	450980	dust and one of the spare desks you know and my work. Also have a signed poster from True Crime
450980	456220	New York signed by the entire voice cast that's framed. They just gave me the frame they're like
456220	461220	I don't want to take that thing out of the frame. It frames yours now. I'm like okay cool. You know
461220	465220	there's a night if we don't get that orange couch there's a nice spot here for either like an arcade
465220	469980	machine or maybe a pinball machine. Maybe I can finally get that baby pac-man machine I've always
469980	476980	wanted my entire life. You want to borrow World Cup? Don't get it. Don't tempt me. Come get it. No
476980	481940	we were sticking with our three. Yeah no I don't blame you. No but we know how to get you into this
482100	486940	but for the record this is not the time to get into pinball. Is it getting really expensive? It's
486940	492220	been getting really expensive for the past two years like my when we got a jackpot we made a
492220	497900	really good trade for it we traded our old what do we have before we traded something for it the
497900	506060	the I think it was Black Knight 2000 is one of the things we traded for it but now like the
506060	511660	Twilight Zone that we got the I think we got it for around three grand at the time easily is going
511700	518420	for upwards of five and six so it's really really just appreciated since then. Gosh it's almost
518420	524620	like the home market the pinball market you know. Try to do trades and work and learn to shop them
524620	529900	and then pick up something light start trading up. Yeah I'm not interested in building up the
529900	534140	massive collection well I mean well you guys don't have the massive collection. We had 13 at
534140	539100	one time which is pretty decent. That's pretty we know a guy who has like 30 there's almost all the
539100	543940	new Stearns. There's still a YouTube out there on our YouTube channel over at Orange Launch Radio
543940	550740	on YouTube which by the way you know not only does Jason do the enhanced episodes of the show
550740	554420	over there but if you go back in the archives a little bit we actually did a tour of Jamie's
554420	559700	house a few years ago when she had all of those 13 tables so that was that was a really impressive
559700	565060	site of course you don't live in the house anymore but no and we're probably gonna be moving before
565220	570140	the years out we're gonna be looking for a new house but I guess I'm new today I got some new
570140	579140	I got some new. Tell us about your new acquisition today. Well the the vibe my poor old vibe is gone.
579140	586340	I have a Fiat now and it's blue it is very fucking blue and it's little and cute and I may have
586340	591620	ordered an Alliance sticker for it because I didn't think the N7 sticker looked fine on it
591620	596580	so since it's all blue it's gonna be I don't know what's call it either we were gonna call
596580	603180	it the Ferrari at because Fiat owns Ferrari but they also in Dodge so then I guess not you can't
603180	609900	have it all so I don't know. I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw by
609900	615260	the way linked that video. As long as I'm not in it you can show it. You're in it. You're
615300	621500	definitely in it but I'm looking at chat and the pagan Jew is in chat say who is my new
621500	625220	friend I was gonna say I have not seen that name in chat before but I love I love that I love that
625220	630740	name the pagan Jew says man I what I've always wanted are those table style miss pac-man it's
630740	635420	like the cocktail table machines right yeah what how wouldn't you love that for a little table
635420	643220	right here instead of well there is a tutorial out on building one of your own but building a
643220	648860	coffee table size so that you have the middle part is the gaming area and the other you know
648860	653740	places to set your drinks and stuff down on I just need to get a pac-man battle royale those
653740	662580	are only what $5,000 you can swing it steam what steam oh just get downloaded on steam and run it
662580	668500	on a computer or something yeah yeah yeah I got you I got you or or I'm sure you know I they can't
668500	674340	be that sophisticated I'm sure that they'll dump it eventually for the record because the pagan
674340	682020	Jew brought it up I actually did start thinking about calling my my little Fiat the Kodiak because
682020	689100	it's the same color as the yeah too much Mass Effect it's a really pretty color though it
689100	695700	really is it's little though like I think I would have to if like you and Alan were to both come
695700	700340	with me in that car someone would have to sit sideways and backseat yeah Alan and I would not
700340	707060	both fit in your car yeah it's little Dan fit in it but our buddy that we actually actually have a
707060	711220	friend that works at car max that's where we got my car from he was like I'm gonna sit behind Jamie
711220	719540	cuz Dan pushed the seat all the way and no so yeah all right well okay so we've talked about a
719540	724220	lot of non gaming things we've talked about Loki's coming back to the show we've talked about our new
724220	728500	studio we've talked about dark sacros car let's get back to what the show is all about it's video
728500	732100	games and we're gonna start off talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we
732100	735940	have been playing this week so that you got a frame of reference where our heads are at this
735940	742780	week with video games dark Sakura well I am playing through Mass Effect 3 again because and I'm gonna
742780	747740	go ahead and put this out there for everybody if anyone besides me is doing mods and finds after
747740	753900	you update your in video drivers that text mod and you mod are not working it actually is a
753900	760220	conflict with the Nvidia drivers and I have put up old Nvidia drivers on Mass Effect thing I did it
760220	767020	like two days ago so you can download run the old drivers and your mods will work again and text mod
767020	775580	and you mod but I was I'm playing more Mass Effect 3 I'm trying to finish out run number 17 so that I
775620	780580	can finish run number 18 I might actually just completely start over and make a completely
780580	787100	different character I haven't decided yet I might actually finish the game with not with my weirdo
787100	795500	albino Shepherd I don't know anyway so um I am also I started doing hunting logs on Final Fantasy
795500	803740	17 17 fuck the fuck Wow 14 travel to the few yes I time child avatars no fort what the fuck is seven
803740	810140	is all well I mean if you think about it 11 was an MMO 11 teen there was 12 13 and 14 is an MMO so
810140	816540	15 16 17 will be the next MMO so maybe I do you know something Darcy are you did you just breach
816540	829020	an NDA no I didn't anyway I meant 14 so whatevs um so anyway um I I I figured out I'm basically
829020	833460	just running around doing as much of the hunting log as I can and I'm on the appropriate level for
833500	840660	myself now like I am halfway through the hunting log the level for hunting log so that's really I'm
840660	847780	happy I'm still playing Animal Crossing and I now have blue roses so if anyone wants blue roses I
847780	858580	could be persuaded to turn on my game tonight and give one lucky person in chat who messages me
858580	866160	first to blue roses if such a person desires and what's the big flippin deal about is they
866160	872300	take fucking forever it took me an entire year to get hybrid Reds and then and I had to do perfect
872300	878740	town to do it so now did you have to grind the bones of Ed in or yes I had to sacrifice Ed to
878740	885260	the gods of my village no what you have to do is you have to you know you start off with your white
885300	889980	red or yellow roses you have to breed orange roses then you have to breed purple roses then
889980	894100	you have to breed purple and orange roses together to get a hybrid red and you have to have two hybrid
894100	899460	Reds to eventually maybe breed a blue I have so many fucking flowers in my village but now I have
899460	909940	like a big clutch of blue roses and so I in fact I will tell you what I will be kind enough to give
909940	915220	two people in chat blue roses because I have enough to do that all right well there you go
915220	920860	like reverse bachelor style or is that no they don't give them or they give them a rose of their
920860	924660	stains yeah I don't watch the bachelors yeah they give him a rose of their study so it is bachelors
924660	929100	there was a girl from Sacramento apparently on that show I heard and she got she got she got
929100	933460	totally screwed over by the guy in the end that's what I heard but I hear all this stuff you know on
933460	937860	the radios because I don't watch you know I like survivor and big bro I love Big Brother but that's
937860	942540	about the most reality TV I was oh and RuPaul's Drag Race that's that's important too but RuPaul's
942540	947060	RuPaul's Drag Race just transcends all other television they should get interesting like
947060	953540	reality twists you know they think they're going on a show for bachelor but it's survivor haha well
953540	958020	I always said that the best season of Survivor would be when they cast a bunch of drag queens
958020	965580	I mean let's be real that's that is must-see TV right there come on now to tie it back to video
965580	969660	games though have you ever have you ever played some of those video games based on TV there's
969660	974460	like a bachelor video game on mobile oh yes there is on the Wii and there's yet that's right there
974460	978380	was that and there's like a survivor video game also on the Wii and there well there was like an
978380	983820	old-school one on PC they're all terrible they are so like how are they too bad how are these
983820	989780	games so bad like in the licensing like well like at least like Wheel of Fortune Jeopardy the game
989780	993580	should press your luck like at least you know what you're gonna get you are gonna get those games and
993620	998020	even though they might not be the most fluid presentation sometimes they work well enough
998020	1004820	for what they are but oh my god like Survivor is just bad it's so bad but anyway sorry I don't know
1004820	1008260	how we got on a tangent somehow we were on Dark Soccer's gaming weeks just talking about blue
1008260	1012420	roses did you did you get people to join your village yet I have two people and I am going to
1012420	1020420	go plant two roses near my train station I mean sorry four roses near my train station and two
1020460	1024740	are gonna be for acts deft and two will be for Queen Simeon there you go and then if you want
1024740	1028740	to try and steal it from one of them get to her village quickly and start whapping people with
1028740	1034540	bug nets and only the survivor will win all right Loki while she does that how was your gaming week
1034540	1041580	didn't play that much this week I think I played a little bit South Park I played Call of Duty
1041580	1045140	modern warfare 2 because I actually picked that up because we're kind of we were getting bored
1045180	1050700	with just modern warfare 1 because we've played it before we actually started off in modern warfare
1050700	1055700	1 then we moved to modern warfare 3 when we were playing on Xbox and then you know they wanted to
1055700	1060380	kind of go back to modern warfare 1 because it was what we considered the best game that we played in
1060380	1064420	the series so far well then I picked up modern warfare 2 and I think that's the best game in the
1064420	1070380	series so far and then I started the grind you know because in modern warfare 1 I had the grind
1070380	1076380	quite a bit just to get leveled up but apparently there's a lot of hackers on modern warfare 2 so it
1076380	1081300	didn't take me it only took me five games before I got into a modded game and I'm already ranked 70
1081300	1087940	now so hackers yeah my Xbox live game no it this is PlayStation Network and then you think no this
1087940	1094860	is PlayStation Network I'm playing on PlayStation 3 right now so yes and sorry hackers on my internet
1094860	1099980	thing but here's the thing though and like I don't really understand you know the point of it but
1100300	1107700	it was kind of like generous but like I don't this is retarded at the same time because when he came
1107700	1111500	in the first thing that happened was he ranked everybody up to seven unlocked everything so I'm
1111500	1115780	like hey cool I got all my stuff unlocked and then he proceeded to kill everybody with an aimbot I'm
1115780	1121540	like okay well this is I guess I guess I'll let you kill me the name but because you did rank me
1121540	1126300	up to 70 but you know I just don't I don't know why I'm still in this game and eventually it
1126300	1131860	actually the server detected that he was cheating and then kicked him off but the hell kinda like
1131860	1138620	what is that I'm good I'm gonna bring you up up up up and then take you down I don't get it but
1138620	1143860	I'm like hey cool now I made you and now I'm gonna break you snap it kind of sucks because I was
1143860	1147940	enjoying you know kind of leveling up and grinding a little bit because I was you know enjoying you
1147940	1151940	figuring out the classes and stuff and then they got ranked up to 70 I'm like well I don't need to
1151940	1157820	play this anymore so I'll just wait until we play her actual private matches but technically I didn't
1157820	1164180	cheat somebody else I benefited well this happened to my co-worker on modern warfare one he got
1164180	1171300	ranked up to level 50 and so I you know he got everything unlocked because at one time I was
1171300	1176260	like hey why is your clan tag marked as something and he's like I don't know I don't know how to
1176260	1183220	change that so I played that I played more South Park the stick of truth and that game is hilarious
1183220	1194620	and what else they play a little bit 2048 just because you know it's addicting and how what else
1194620	1201900	I think that's actually it oh I played a little bit modern warfare one because we this Wednesday
1201900	1208060	we actually played a private game but that's probably gonna be the end of that so yeah lots
1208060	1214860	of modern warfare old modern warfare games and I don't know I don't have a lot of gaming time
1214860	1219140	anymore so it's it's kind of limited to that with two kids you don't have gaming time what are you
1219140	1224620	talking about oh yeah all right my gaming week I was also pressed for time a little bit this week
1224620	1229080	with you know the whole moving thing and in trying to get everything wrapped up with the other
1229080	1234280	apartment which finally took those keys over on Saturday and it felt so good to be rid of that
1234280	1240560	but anyway I did fit in a little gaming time and one game that's been taking up quite a bit of my
1240560	1244320	time besides besides Final Fantasy 14 that's always a given because I'm on a rating team in
1244320	1248480	Final Fantasy 14 so I'm always playing that you know at least one or two two nights a week but
1248480	1254160	I've been playing Diablo 3 again you know I know I've been talking about this on the show the past
1254160	1258000	couple weeks but with the expansion coming out this this Tuesday is the big day for the expansion
1258520	1262520	they were doing an experience boost they were doing 50% experience boost for a couple weeks
1262520	1267120	well they up the ante for this weekend only and it's a hundred percent experience boost so it's
1267120	1272080	like get my paragon levels get my paragon levels as fast I can because in Diablo if you didn't know
1272080	1277400	you level your character from 1 to 60 and then in the expansion that's going to be 70 but once you
1277400	1282000	hit max level you start grinding these things called paragon levels and the paragon levels go
1282000	1287840	from 1 to 500 which I know seems like wow you can level your character to 500 it doesn't really work
1287840	1292440	that way because the paragon levels all they do is they give you one stat boost and they rotate
1292440	1299080	through four categories it's like offensive defensive utility and a potpourri I don't know
1299080	1303840	there's some other thing but you you choose basically what you want to put your stats in
1303840	1307840	in those but the cool thing about the paragon levels is that they are for all of your characters
1307840	1313120	so let's say I am paragon level 26 which is where my character is at right now if I start a brand
1313160	1318960	new character she'll be level 1 but character level or paragon level 26 so I can still put
1318960	1324560	those 26 points and stat boosts into my level 1 character so that's pretty cool that's why a lot
1324560	1331640	of people get 26 per character or is it just you know it's 26 per character but it's not I mean
1331640	1337360	it's not the gigantic boost you it sounds like it is like 26 levels because like let me like okay
1337360	1342480	it cycles through the four and one of them is offensive and so I keep putting my points in
1342480	1348560	critical hit chance so each point is a tenth of a percent increase in critical hit chance so it's
1348560	1355320	not okay so it's like the Borderlands 2 system that they have for experience awesome points or
1355320	1359360	something I bet it is yeah I bet it's a very similar thing they probably won one probably
1359360	1363800	borrowed from the other and probably yeah I would be surprised at all so that's that's a big thing
1363800	1369040	everybody grinding because knowing that the expansion hits Tuesday now instead of paragon
1369040	1372040	leveling everybody's gonna be taking their characters to level 70 but they'll be able
1372080	1377240	to carry those paragon levels with them as they level through act 5 so it's you know people are
1377240	1383480	very busy with that so been we have a clan for Horde house my other show so you know just finding
1383480	1387080	other people to play with them their eyes they haven't given you a way to just pay to level up
1387080	1395000	to 70 yeah right or giving you a free boost with the pre-order for the expansion none of that yet
1395000	1401920	not yet not yet we can level up really fast now but anyway yeah also in Diablo news this week
1401960	1407160	the auction house shut down so that is done so if you were staying away from Diablo 3 because
1407160	1411720	you were waiting for the auction house to go away well here's a chance there's no more auction house
1411720	1416600	the icon is still there because people can claim their items and cash out everything through like
1416600	1422680	June but you can't list things anymore it's it's done so there you go so there's that the only
1422680	1429280	thing that makes me a little sour face at Diablo 3 is I was reading the FAQ for the expansion and
1429280	1432560	everything for the expansion on launch day and they're telling people what to expect and
1432560	1438400	everything right and so if you remember when Diablo 3 originally launched everybody was
1438400	1442920	hitting that error 37 right it was a big big thing and you know the game got a lot of shit
1442920	1448280	because you know back when Diablo 2 did not have mandatory online I didn't have to deal with this
1448280	1455560	fuckery well they're saying on the FAQ launch page you might hit a queue when logging into
1455640	1460840	Diablo 3 and you know if you hit the queue just wait and you'll be able to attack the monster and
1460840	1467480	I'm kind of thinking like that doesn't help the case that people do not like that this game has
1467480	1472880	mandatory online which by the way is not a problem in the PlayStation and Xbox versions still don't
1472880	1478520	know when the PlayStation 4 version is coming out but I imagine the holiday at this point they're
1478520	1482160	gonna bundle it with the expand they're waiting for all the PC people to buy the expansion I
1482160	1486280	thought they already they're gonna announce 30 or they said that the PlayStation 4 version was
1486280	1491480	gonna be that you know with the reaper of souls and stuff in there is I how can it not at this
1491480	1495960	point they may have but and I missed it but how can it not at this point but they wouldn't want
1495960	1499440	to announce that because that's gonna cut into PC sales of the people who want to play it now
1499440	1503880	so they're gonna wait until a month after and then they'll announce that the ps4 one officially
1503880	1510640	has both well watch I've been following Blizzard way too long it's exactly how it's gonna go down
1511600	1517520	so anyway God where was I with that whole mess yeah oh yes there's gonna be a queue to possibly
1517520	1521760	get into Diablo thumbs yeah a little a little ridiculous a little ridiculous so I am making
1521760	1526680	a little bit of stank face at the game for that but I'm also not the type of Diablo player where
1526680	1532360	I have to be in there day one like I'm not like that big on it so if I can't play right away then
1532360	1537480	what else I'm not not worried about it one other game I've been playing this week and I think a lot
1537480	1541200	of you all you all out there have been playing this as well I have been playing the Final Fantasy
1541200	1547640	10 HD remaster which does include 10 2 but I've only been playing 10 because you know I want to
1547640	1555040	play that first huh what what can I do for you no I'm not playing 10 2 yet I'm playing playing just
1555040	1562520	10 right now but um I it is what you would expect it is Final Fantasy 10 but it's in widescreen and
1562520	1567080	with with up bridge graphics you know Alan walked in when I was playing and he's like I can't really
1567180	1571760	tell the difference I could though like and I don't know if that's just the quality of TV has
1571760	1575880	gone up in the 10 years or no longer than that probably 15 years since Final Fantasy 10 was first
1575880	1583360	out but just like I'm like the colors are more vibrant things just look crisper and better this
1583360	1588120	soundtrack has been redone a little bit and I don't find the redo the redos of the songs are
1588120	1594000	faithful to the originals they didn't like like completely screw up the chocobo music or anything
1594080	1600040	like that like everything still stays faithful to the original the only thing I don't remember the
1600040	1605760	loading times being such a bear in the Final Fantasy 10 version on PlayStation 2 or loading
1605760	1613400	times yeah oh yeah like you know and it's just the put in the disc launch the game oh okay now
1613400	1618400	I'm on the main menu where I choose which game do I want to play all right pick FF 10 loading
1618400	1624160	all right gonna click load game loading gonna load my game loading this is kind of like all right
1624160	1627640	there's a lot of loading screens here and I was kind of surprised didn't do any type of like
1627640	1632000	install or anything to try and maybe minimize that a little bit but that's like my one little
1632000	1637720	bitch and you know what to be honest maybe it was that way and I just forgot after all these years
1637720	1642320	but I felt like on PlayStation 2 it seemed like I kind of got in there a little faster and got to
1642320	1649000	play my game or as you know you gotta say say your time aside go get your drink and your sandwich
1649000	1654920	before you play your game but that's my one one minor little bitch with Final Fantasy 10 otherwise
1654920	1660800	it's it's a great deal especially if you know I realized we have a lot of listeners that are
1660800	1665840	probably like 18 to 21 you know kind of in that range so you were probably too young when Final
1665840	1670080	Fantasy 10 first came out and maybe you've gone back and experienced it which you know thumbs up
1670080	1675440	good for you but if you somehow miss these games but you do kind of like Japanese RPGs and you like
1675440	1679080	those types of games or you're interested in them I think this is a great way to pick them up you
1679080	1684160	know it's only what it's like 40 bucks for the two games it's that's a great deal and it's not only
1684160	1688680	the two games they are the international versions for the first time in America so that's pretty
1688680	1692960	cool because you can do the alternate sphere grid I had I have the international version for
1692960	1700160	10-2 so okay there you go but you had to import that right yeah yeah I did but it played just
1700160	1706080	fine it also comes with the audio drama that plays over some credits there was like a Final
1706080	1711520	Fantasy 10 audio drama or something that came after 10-2 and then there's a another Final
1711520	1717280	Fantasy 10 like extended movie or something or is there am I thinking last mission oh no there's
1717280	1723360	like every bonus that goes with Final Fantasy 10 is all there I mean it's all with it I'm trying
1723360	1727720	to be that guy who goes through and plays one at a time but if it goes anything like Kingdom Hearts
1727720	1732160	did I'll get like a quarter of the way through the game and then be like oh my South Park game
1732160	1740640	is here time to go play that because I'm waiting on that now so it's fantastic yeah I'm going to
1740640	1746240	the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com act deft and chat says Final Fantasy 10 sucks anyway well
1746240	1753360	you know what that's what I have to say Syal in chat says I'll play Diablo 3 when offline mode
1753360	1759880	becomes a thing the PlayStation 3 version or Xbox 360 version are for you offline mode is a thing
1759880	1766560	in those games if you're curious so there you go s2100 Matt says kind of reminds me of the horrible
1766560	1770840	loading times for the Final Fantasy Chronicles disc Final Fantasy 4 and chrono trigger for ps1
1770840	1775760	well here's the good news it doesn't load for like battles and things like that I mean that
1775800	1780920	feels fluid like that was the annoying pain in the ass thing about those was like every time you
1780920	1784840	got into a random battle there was like a little loading time that was a bit much on those like old
1784840	1790080	PlayStation games but you don't you don't have that here it's not that bad so all right so that's
1790080	1796800	gonna do it for our gaming weeks so quickly our housekeeping I don't have a whole lot to say here
1796800	1802400	since you know we had our week off last week but I hope you got y'all enjoyed the tape show that we
1802400	1807280	ran over Loki's budgeted time sorry about that but we made it work sorry it was the baby crying
1807280	1812320	I understand but I'm glad we were able to do something for the listeners I saw there were a
1812320	1816080	lot of people that use the passphrase that's hidden in the show to check in so I know a lot
1816080	1820040	of you guys were checking it out one way or another so I'm glad we could do a little something for you
1820040	1825320	guys but now we're back to our form and and hopefully coming at you for the next next many
1825320	1831800	few weeks here solid twitter.com slash olr facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google.com
1831800	1836640	slash plus orange lounge radio all the different ways you can follow us on social media I should
1836640	1841760	throw this little a little teaser out there too we are thinking about what we're gonna do for a
1841760	1846440	new look at orange lounge radio.com because you know we've had that old website that we've kind
1846440	1851440	of neglected a little bit ever since vog network launched because a lot of the focus has been over
1851440	1855680	there and with good reason but we are gonna kind of take a look at what can we do to orange
1855680	1860160	lounge radio.com to kind of make it a real central hub for show related things and more
1860160	1864640	info about the show and you know the fact that this show does have a 12 year history behind it
1864640	1869040	and counting so you know kind of some of the historical things for our show and what we can
1869040	1876040	put on there so we're old don't remind me you know what these posters these posters keep me young you
1876040	1880920	see that that is some of these posters are older than some of our listeners that's a DDR second
1880920	1887040	mix marquee which which of these posters would be older than one of our listeners maybe the second
1887040	1892240	mix marquee second mix marquee that would be for one of the Silent Hill 3 poster baby I don't know
1892240	1899720	I would hope I would hope we don't have 12 11 come out it was 2005 so you were doing second mix yeah
1899720	1908360	anyway cloud here on a wall scroll um to give the visual to you guys there will I will probably do
1908360	1913520	a YouTube of it I'll do like a little YouTube to put for the channel and and have Jason make it
1913520	1917560	nice if he's willing to do that and put it up on our channels that way you guys can go check out
1917560	1922240	our YouTube channel we'll give you a little visual look of our studio once once we get a little more
1922240	1929920	in here I think it'll be really ready to show off so yeah there you go um okay so let's get into our
1929920	1935600	gaming news tonight Loki once you start us off so it was rumored that they were gonna do this and
1935640	1943920	of course they did it so Sony kind of announced their codenamed project Morpheus what that is is
1943920	1950960	basically their VR headset and spec wise it sounds kind of similar to the oculus rift it's you know
1950960	1963800	1080p 90 plus degrees field of view also kind of utilizes the PlayStation camera I guess it
1963840	1970960	sort of has like the same move motion sensors built into it and of course a bunch of support
1970960	1976240	from all sorts of middleware and development companies that unity havoc you know epic games
1976240	1986720	Autodesk crytek you know all the big guys and of course no information on price no information on
1986720	1992240	release date or anything like that they did show off some tech demos utilizing games that are
1992240	1999040	already out there like thief looks interesting I mean I'm kind of excited about VR actually
1999040	2003720	coming mainstream to consoles my only concern of course with anything that you know you have
2003720	2009600	like a new technology is the first few games that come out for it are gonna be very gimmicky
2009600	2016600	it's just like I don't know like even with the 3d stuff on the 3ds or with the motion controls
2016600	2023080	on the Wii and even the second screen on the DS it was just gimmick gimmick gimmick gimmick this
2023080	2027320	isn't really needed oh hey or hate the Kinect any games that have come out for the Kinect they
2027320	2031440	haven't been dancing game and pretty much gimmick gimmick gimmick gimmick so that's the only thing
2031440	2036200	I'm concerned about and probably price point because you know that's really expensive then
2036200	2040640	I don't really want to buy it well the cost of the technology may come down a little bit though
2040640	2044400	by the time this thing actually comes out I mean I really don't think you guys should expect to see
2044400	2048800	it this year I think we're talking out there I think they even said not this year yeah holiday
2048800	2055120	2015 maybe I mean and you guys have to remember it is game developers conference this announcement
2055120	2059520	was not an e3 type of announcement and that's where some people you know and Bobby gets into
2059520	2063400	this a lot more on his show where he you know and he kind of has that perspective because he does
2063400	2067920	develop games like flappy vlog and all that right so he does kind of have that perspective and and
2067920	2073080	that game developers conference is not e3 and we kind of have to remember that sometimes we get
2073080	2077800	thrown little tidbits you get thrown little things and you know to try and get excitement
2077800	2081880	and sure ever everybody wants the media to report on them so sometimes you're gonna get a little
2081880	2086120	bone thrown at you but you have to remember the news isn't really for you and something like this
2086120	2092360	especially for Sony to kind of say all right we are gonna do this for the PlayStation 4 can get
2092360	2096280	developers thinking all right what kind of game do I want to make because you can't really make
2096280	2102360	a PlayStation 4 game overnight you know people are working on now the stuff that's gonna come out
2102360	2107640	holiday 2015 holiday 2016 for heaven's sake you know things that are way way out that's how long
2107640	2112560	a video game takes to make so I mean by kind of announcing this publicly to the developers now
2112560	2117720	it's kind of like all right no more of this leaked stuff we all know this is something we're working
2117720	2122560	on here's the specs and you know good luck have fun with it I would love to see like something
2122560	2126960	like this being patched into like currently you know like games that are already out there even
2126960	2131000	like re-releasing them with this kind of like how they do with kind of the move stuff obviously you
2131000	2137120	know adding motion controls versus adding you know a whole second camera to make it stereoscopic
2137120	2141680	and all that stuff and head tracking and all that it's a lot more complicated but it'd be kind of
2141680	2146560	cool you know to be able to play like say Killzone or something like that in VR or even Minecraft in
2146560	2152840	VR I mean cuz obviously the oculus rift version was pretty cool so I would like to try that and
2152840	2157360	also you know if the price point is nice I'm going to our chat room real quick real quick
2157680	2162680	Ragingator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says will project Morpheus offer users the choice of
2162680	2168640	a red pill or a blue pill hahaha well let us not let us not forget project Morpheus won't be the
2168640	2173800	final name I mean there's all there's development names all the time yeah we're still playing the
2173800	2179000	revolution in ultra 64 y'all right yeah besides the project Morpheus that's something more I'd
2179000	2189400	see associated with the one fuck off all right but speaking of the choice I hate you so much go
2189400	2193680	back home all right I'm kidding all right it is good to have you back speaking of the choice
2193680	2199080	between the red pill and the blue pill now users are gonna be faced with a choice between project
2199080	2204800	Morpheus and oculus rift or are they and then also there's you know Microsoft what they're coming out
2204800	2209120	with remember that there's this whole roadmap thing that leaked out I want to say is it been
2209120	2215680	a year or two years now you know talking about the whole you know Kinect and Xbox one and you know
2215680	2221680	this whole project for tell fortaleza which I guess they're singing translates to fortress in
2221680	2225880	Portuguese if I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean but they're saying it's supposed
2225880	2231440	to be like some sort of like augmented reality of VR type thing and it's something that they're
2231440	2236400	apparently working on this is now also being confirmed by like I guess a second source now
2236400	2240400	it's whatever happened to the the luma room thing that Microsoft was doing I thought that was their
2240400	2247440	thing um no that was something else but it apparently is just too costly right now with
2247440	2252520	you know what's out there I mean how you're asking someone to basically set up a projector
2252520	2258920	that's gonna project stuff on the walls I mean that sounds cool but it's just it's too expensive
2258920	2264280	and just imagine trying to sell that you need a very specific room for that it's just not something
2264280	2270040	that anybody could do I mean it'd be neat if they can actually do that and pull it off well now wait
2270040	2273800	a minute you dodged my question let's go back are you gonna are you do you feel like you're gonna
2273800	2279000	have to make a choice between oculus rift and project Morpheus or do you think there's room in
2279000	2285360	a gamer's house for both depends on the price and just you know once again like I haven't really been
2285360	2294160	jumping into just buying you know a PlayStation 4 and Xbox one or even a new gaming PC I'm just
2294160	2300120	gotta see what's gonna be for it I'm not gonna just jump in and buy you know a new console and
2300120	2307520	like you know $200 plus device and you know what were they gonna support with it I mean what kind
2307520	2311840	of games are gonna see cuz remember you know we did this with like the Kinect and stuff like oh
2311920	2315840	you need to get the Kinect to play all these games and then it's very limited way you can play it's
2315840	2320320	like okay I can play dancing games or I can play games that implement Kinect for really stupid
2320320	2325360	reasons you know you know I don't know it I gotta wait and see what they have for it I mean I think
2325360	2331240	I'd hope with VR that there's gonna be some cooler stuff with it but it's all gonna be also how
2331240	2335160	sensitive everything is you know is it gonna be able to pick up movements out you know obviously
2335160	2339800	with this these newer cameras and stuff they're a lot better than the original connector even the
2339800	2346160	PlayStation I was so I'm hoping that it will be a better experience but I have to see that I have
2346160	2354480	to see the reviews games all that stuff for me even though I I get the competitions healthy and
2354480	2358700	I think that'll be kind of a good thing in this case you know and I get that they are and they
2358700	2363680	aren't competing I mean the PC market and the console market are very different right and the
2363680	2368420	things that are gonna be good for oculus rift on PC versus Morpheus on ps4 is just like back to
2368420	2373820	those same adages about PlayStation 4 I see about console gaming in general versus PC gaming is that
2373820	2377780	you know with console gaming you have your sets of standards and you never have to worry about
2377780	2382740	that but at the same time you are stuck within those standards whereas PCs can kind of always
2382740	2386780	continuously upgrade right so that's you know there's gonna be pros and cons between the two
2386780	2391860	you know whatever and I'm sure you're gonna see some game overlap between the two for me the the
2391860	2397660	honest-to-god thing I'm having a hard time conceptualizing is how why would I want two
2397660	2404660	VR headsets in my house and maybe this is just like a I'm not like like I'm sure there was a
2404660	2410700	time in a day where people were going like you mean I need to have a Nintendo and a Sega in my
2410700	2416300	house I don't need both right or even way back in the day I need to have two television sets in my
2416300	2422620	house what am I gonna do with two television sets I only need one so maybe that's just I you know
2422620	2426860	again once like all the games are there it might but I just right now I'm like I don't want to buy
2426860	2433220	two VR sets the thing is like you know I kind of view a VR set is almost like having a TV it's like
2433220	2438900	well this is stupid that I should have a second TV to play a second game system on one this TV
2438900	2442660	could easily play both game systems they should just be able to switch back and forth and here's
2442660	2447740	the thing like they're even talking with the other project Morpheus headset they have a game
2447740	2454940	with the Eve Valkyrie I think is what it was that is a game that's being co-published by oculus so
2454940	2459500	that's kind of interesting right there that there's a little bit I don't know if it's being done by a
2459500	2466540	different company for you know for the PlayStation 4 but the fact that that's also coming to this
2466540	2472180	head says well it's like it would be nice if it was just all oculus or all one company together
2472740	2478420	making this device that could be used across everything but of course everybody wants their
2478420	2482700	own things so they can patent it and sue each other and all that fun stuff I'm going to our
2482700	2488980	chat room over at live dot vog network calm Akuma JP says in Japan no room to spare oh that's a good
2488980	2494140	point and you know I'm not I'm not were there Japanese developers in that list of people for
2494140	2498660	project Morpheus because now that I think about it you know again I don't follow oculus rift as
2498660	2503980	closely as say Bobby or some of the other fans will but our Japanese developers it wasn't it
2503980	2508220	wasn't necessarily developers it's more of like engines and middleware and that type of stuff so
2508220	2514340	like you know unity unity or even like you know unreal and stuff that's used by different
2514340	2520140	developers you know it could be you know from all all corners of the world so I don't think that's
2520140	2524860	I'm sure that especially you know being that I think that would take off from Japan if the
2524860	2529500	prices right because you know that is a big selling point not a lot of space VR could be
2529500	2533340	pretty cool well I'm curious if there's going to be like maybe a cultural difference you know
2533340	2538420	sometimes there are differences in the games that work in Japan versus that work here and vice versa
2538420	2543940	I'm curious if VR is something that's going to be on both sides you know because Sony obviously has
2543940	2549260	a big presence in Japan and America so I just I'm just kind of curious I mean I just I honestly
2549260	2554580	don't know how well VR is received in Japan maybe maybe Akuma or some of our other folks know well
2554820	2560700	Bobby Black Wolf's there saying in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com there are a lot of Asian
2560700	2566860	developers working on the rift that's where most of the porn is from actually I'm and that's what
2566860	2571380	I was gonna say I'm totally looking forward to all the you know all the not necessarily pornographic
2571380	2576580	but all the perverted games coming from Japan who never use this there's a there's a very big plus
2576580	2582020	in the oculus rift column I'm serious there's a very big plus in the oculus rift column you know
2582020	2587900	why because everything on the PlayStation one's gonna be controlled whereas the oculus rift you
2587900	2592740	can literally you know anybody that has a dev kit can make stuff for it and I'm not just you know
2592740	2599220	I'm not just talking about porn although you know hey but you know it's it's the other stuff as well
2599220	2603300	you're not gonna really be able to get that same homegrown stuff on the PlayStation 4 I mean yes I
2603300	2608060	know that PlayStation embraces the indie developers and so forth but it's it's so much different like
2608060	2613740	you know like Bobby Black Wolf can't put flappy vog on PlayStation 4 as easy as he put it out
2613740	2617220	there on the internet you know I mean that's that's like the difference what I'm saying so
2617220	2626980	anyway let's see Alan alchemy in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says VR porn is
2626980	2632660	terrifying because you have a helmet on like you can be jerking it and have three people watching
2632660	2638220	you with their cell phones out that is not a future I want to live in not only that but
2638220	2643020	because you know like something like this device would be utilizing a secondary camera you could
2643020	2647060	actually watch yourself jerking and have the VR camera on at the same time you'd have it like
2647060	2651700	you know picture-in-picture almost if you're into that sort of thing I guess Wow so like
2651700	2657380	would would cam sex have a whole new thing to it we're like I don't know I don't know it's
2657380	2667100	POB to the max wouldn't be camp starvation too much like hamster so I don't know people are
2667100	2673660	into hamsters let's see SSG 100 man our chair at live.vognetwork.com says the hardcore gamers
2673660	2678220	only compile a margin of the overall profits towards gaming sales while the hardcore gamers
2678220	2683180	might have interest in this it doesn't mean that the casual people will jump at this VR not just
2683180	2692700	the Sony thing but also the rift well it depends on if they can get Wii Sports on it or all tongue
2692700	2699220	and cheekiness aside if they can find that Wii Sports type of game that sells it I mean think
2699220	2707980	about it Wii Sports sold the Wii that is how you push a peripheral I has there ever in history been
2707980	2712940	a game that better sold a peripheral than Wii Sports I don't think there has Super Mario
2712940	2720140	Brothers that wasn't that's not really a peripheral that's the whole damn system I don't
2720140	2727480	well me I can't you might and I'm sure somebody's gonna say DDR but dude Wii Sports was million
2727480	2733220	DDR zillion for the master system I don't know about that because well I mean the whole hair
2733220	2739340	to Wii Sports come on not in that respect but zillion was pretty big for pushing master systems
2739340	2745660	because they based the whole light gun off of the zillion gun maybe centipede and a trackball
2745660	2752500	I'm reaching here but that that's a tempest that in the trackball that was a good point good point
2752500	2755980	that's what I'm saying though I mean we could we could name all these different types of things
2755980	2761020	here but that's what I'm saying is that oculus rift and project Morpheus need its Wii Sports
2761020	2766660	that's what's gonna really sell those things all right let's move on with some other news here
2766660	2770860	because it is only a three-hour show we could talk VR all night long I'm sure but I want to
2770860	2775140	talk a little bit about some really big retail news that broke I think it was around the same
2775140	2779460	time as game developers conference but this was not from game developers conference Walmart
2779460	2787900	announced that starting March 26 you can trade in your used games at more than 3100 Walmart stores
2787900	2793140	and in exchange you'll get a gift card that you can use at Walmart or Sam's Club all the exchange
2793140	2798060	products will be sent for refurbishment and then will be made available for purchase in like new
2798060	2805340	condition so Walmart don't fall for it don't fall for it you are you are already ready to hate on
2805340	2810180	this well I fucking hate Walmart I don't really try not to give them my business they're a highly
2810180	2816220	disreputable company uh-huh they're just just research their business practices before you
2816220	2821100	give them it I like GameStop better than Walmart oh that's it okay but here okay so the hate boner
2821140	2826220	is strong with this one but but your your hate boner for Walmart does that have anything to do
2826220	2829220	with the whole use or do you think there's something about this used game practice that
2829220	2833020	actually is going to be bad no I don't there's anything about the practice it's just that I think
2833020	2841660	that in terms of social morality they're about the lowest on the pole you can get so I don't support
2841660	2846780	them I would rather other people not support them I would rather just go to the mom-and-pop stores
2846780	2854020	go to games go to GameStop before you go there and definitely go to Costco before you go to Sam's
2854020	2859100	Club um just to give you an idea about how some things are going for Walmart right now the
2859100	2863500	PlayStation 4 you can trade in for three hundred and seventy five dollars the Xbox one three
2863500	2869460	hundred and ninety dollars the that's a pretty good trade-in value I'd have to say the Wii U
2869460	2877780	deluxe $120 a 3g Vita is $95 that's actually kind of tempting because I don't really need the 3g in
2877780	2885100	my Vita I've never used it Grand Theft Auto 5 do not give them money $27 I won't $27 72 cents
2885100	2891700	Super Mario 3d World $38 those really aren't bad values but I mean honestly at the end of the day
2891700	2896940	Dark Sakura what I prefer to do I cut out the middleman entirely well I mean I sell my games
2896980	2901500	on eBay I mean so I guess yeah eBay is the middleman but I feel like it does still put
2901500	2905720	me direct with the buyer and I get profit that way I would like to point out to Tiger Claw that
2905720	2911700	people of Walmart is really a very not everyone who goes to Walmart looks like that that's just
2911700	2917620	playing into stereotypes sure but the average person doesn't choose to educate themselves on
2917620	2924260	the business practices of the place that they go to so I really really would rather that people
2924460	2929660	actually put conscious effort into making the world a bit of a better place and not putting
2929660	2932740	money into the hands of the people who are trying to fuck it over well here's the thing though Dark
2932740	2939260	Sakura is that people you know the reality of the situation is Walmart is huge whether we like it or
2939260	2946020	not they're huge they're a behemoth out there and I I could really see where this is gonna be a big
2946020	2950640	thing I think it would have been a bigger thing five years ago I think Walmart's really late to
2950640	2956720	the game in this regard but you know if if you had been able to take your games in and get that
2956720	2961280	money that you could put towards groceries especially when the recession hit I think that
2961280	2967000	would have been huge for Walmart yeah but I think that I would still be able to find other ways to
2967000	2971600	get money there are there's a there's actually other places out there who will give you money
2971600	2976560	for your games we have dimple sure and you probably get as much well dimples a local chain
2976560	2980400	but a lot of places everybody's getting in on this Amazon you do their Amazon you can buy a lot of
2980880	2985840	groceries out from Amazon in some cities you can do this for through I think Best Buy was to you
2985840	2990120	but I think they ended it but there's there's definitely other places that you can go look you
2990120	2994040	probably know a few more to that I'm not thinking of but what's your thoughts on Walmart taking the
2994040	2999880	used games do you think it'll be successful for sure they'll do okay with it I don't know if it's
2999880	3005080	gonna be just like it all depends on what what their trade-in values are and what they're
3005080	3010160	reselling their used games at I mean that's really gonna decide how successful is because you know
3010440	3015360	all they're gonna do is you know someone's gonna come up with a metric where okay game
3015360	3019560	subs give me this Walmart's give me this here's where I'm gonna go you know especially if they're
3019560	3024920	looking just to turn it around and purchase games with it now I don't know if Walmart does pre-orders
3024920	3032000	on new games I mean I think that they do but I don't know no target does so I would think where
3032000	3035960	one does the other probably does too but see that that's the thing is I mean I'm sure they don't
3035960	3040640	really care because they're just looking at reselling that you know used stuff and making
3040640	3047480	more of a profit margin from it so they could care less about you know the people that usually go to
3047480	3052480	Walmart are looking for deals I mean and even the few time I don't really care to shop at Walmart
3052480	3058760	either but the few times I have gone there because I purposely need something cheaply made are the
3058760	3064400	only times I've gone to Walmart like I need a really shitty sheet for a theater production
3064400	3068880	and I actually need it to be so shitty that it see through when you put a light behind it I think
3068880	3075200	that was the last time I went to Walmart it was I actually needed a terrible sheet but it but anyway
3075200	3080160	that the people that you you usually are going to Walmart looking for deals I would think are gonna
3080160	3084760	really benefit from having to use games there because they're gonna be cheaper and people are
3084760	3089160	gonna be like hey I don't care that it's a minute they'll throw in a dump in and people eat it up
3089160	3093000	just like they eat up the cheap DVDs that they have yeah for real I don't know you can see that
3093000	3099680	happening act-def in our chat room at live that vog network comm says Walmart does pre-orders so
3099680	3104760	there you go I confirm that they do that do that I'm not surprised at all it doesn't seem like a
3104760	3110360	particularly difficult thing for a company to do and you know kind of gets gets a little bit of
3110360	3115280	their money and their customer loyalty from that all right anyway let's move on with some more news
3115280	3122400	dark soccer with some interesting news coming up as soon as I can get my connection till you know
3122800	3128400	to participate with the show live instead of participate five you know five hours from now
3128400	3134160	so this is I know I'm actually not super sad about this but you remember I met somebody who
3134160	3140800	was on my list of people to meet one year at e3 and it was this particular kind of rock star
3140800	3149240	fella it was a Igarashi Koji who designed most of the latest to Castlevania games and was one
3149240	3156880	of the developers for Symphony of the Night or as it was in Japan Nocturne in the Moonlight which
3156880	3164920	is I think a better name basically he left Konami his last day was on March 15th and I'm gonna go
3164920	3168800	ahead and read his quote because I actually like how he says it he said I've decided to break out
3168800	3173440	on my own to have the freedom to make the kind of games I really want to make the same kind I think
3173440	3178720	fans of my past games want as well leaving Konami was a big decision not one I took lightly I've
3178720	3183480	spent my entire career there made many friends had a lot of great opportunities but I hope all
3183480	3188360	the gamers and fans have supported me in the past will join me in being excited about what comes
3188360	3197240	next wish me luck and I just got to meet him I you know we he put up with my really at the time
3197240	3207640	awful Japanese and he's just a really neat guy I mean just you know to have met just once but I'm
3208040	3212440	actually not sad to see him leaving Konami I think that we're gonna see I would like to be able to
3212440	3218520	see his work with a lot more freedom because he's clearly very creative has fantastic ideas and I
3218520	3223320	think it's gonna be good for him and for the gaming community in general to see what else he
3223320	3228320	can come up with it's kind of interesting seeing that the reason one of the reasons I guess he left
3228320	3233320	it was the whole fact that Konami is now kind of focusing more on social gaming and kind of the
3233320	3237840	mobile scene you know basically he said you know the more hardcore the game the less suitable is
3237840	3242640	for the casual market unfortunately I'm good at making core experiences so it was two years of
3242640	3248320	making the game that leaned to hardcore for the social market so it was canceled then I'd try
3248320	3255480	again and be canceled and again and be canceled so this this is a very interesting read of sorts
3255480	3259320	on where Konami in general has been heading because you know I think we were even just a
3259320	3264800	couple weeks sitting here going what is really Konami got in their in their cards right now
3264800	3269160	besides Metal Gear these days on consoles the metal gear and Pro Evo that's they don't they
3269160	3273720	don't really push out a lot of the franchises like they used to back in the day when we had a show
3273720	3278760	that was half dedicated to one of their franchise a Konami franchise I mean that is not the same
3278760	3283760	Konami that's there now but yeah they really crank out social stuff mobile phones and let's not forget
3284160	3291800	and pachinko and really lucrative market for them actually Konami's in that business to listen
3291800	3296160	let's not forget that you go to a casino and you'll see the Konami logo on a lot of the slot
3296160	3300440	machines it's always cracked me up before the record where's my DDR slot machine I want to know
3300440	3305880	I would also like to point out to people who call the Castlevania games on the handhelds as
3305880	3311360	Metroidvania yeah she said when working on Symphony of the Night that his biggest influence was
3311360	3316760	actually the Legend of Zelda that Metroid didn't factor into it oh interesting that it was the
3316760	3326300	the exploration and finding and hidden things here and there that inspired part of the item
3326300	3333720	system for Symphony of the Night and the subsequent games go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
3333720	3337560	Tigerclaw says how long before the former Castlevania developer starts a Kickstarter
3337560	3343520	for Castlevania like game who knows probably not long well I mean there was that story out there
3343520	3349560	about that he would be happy to go work on a Metroid game and I think I think somebody posted
3349560	3353940	that to my wall on Facebook and I responded with that picture of the cat that's all over
3353940	3358160	tumblr that has that look on its face it just has the caption heavy breathing because that's exactly
3358160	3365520	like yes yes how many times have I posted that on Facebook but I mean seriously like I would love
3365560	3371600	for him to go work on a Metroid game I mean the newer Castlevania games were kind of crap I don't
3371600	3374720	think he wasn't involved with the newer ones all right I don't think so because newer Castlevania
3374720	3379720	games weren't they kind of forced them to be Castlevania as it was yeah exactly originally
3379720	3383920	going to be a Castlevania game yeah so I mean I don't know like I don't know about how you
3383920	3387960	guys feel but I kind of think like Castlevania peaked a long time I tried to make Castlevania
3387960	3392720	several times with not quite Castlevania games you know with the Lords of Shadows and then there
3392720	3398920	was that one that was God and I can't remember the name now but it was you're fighting robots
3398920	3407800	and instead of blood it was oil or something and it it was nano breaker I think oh yes I do remember
3407800	3415040	you know what I remember that game when it was cyber bot it was nano break yes I remember them
3415040	3419400	yeah it was they were demoing that at e3 when you're a man I like cyber bots yeah I think I did it
3419400	3425520	for a classic game once already 3ds ones are awesome I don't know dark Tetsuya telling me
3425520	3430760	there is a beat mania slot machine I didn't know you said DDR yeah I did say DDR but I mean that's
3430760	3434000	still pretty cool although I'm sure they don't make it anymore cuz my money's dead would you
3434000	3439680	heard well that I think technically they're think technically they're still making you beat but
3439680	3445120	whatever hey the money lives on on on iPads don't you know huh cyber bots is Capcom's number one
3445120	3452040	game don't lie it's a quote it's a devil out quote from puzzle fighter that's oh that's right
3452040	3457720	that's old-school everyone here's like what cyber bots reaching into the archive for quotes there
3457720	3463520	all right he's not the only guy leaving lots of people are leaving different companies and for
3463520	3467560	pretty much the same reasons kind of move on and do their own thing another person that's actually
3467680	3474640	leaving Sony stig a moose and he's not working I guess at Sony Santa Monica he was kind of the
3474640	3482880	creative director of God war 3 and I get guests basically you know they canceled what his new
3482880	3492760	project and so you know he's basically left the company after being there for 11 years also along
3492760	3504960	with him at sucker punch was see here Jamie Grissom er and basically he left after working on
3504960	3512400	infamous second son but he's been there for quite a while as well a lot of these guys is kind of
3512400	3518160	moving on and doing their own thing going back India yes this has to be related to the layoff
3518160	3522720	news from a couple weeks ago what they laid off those people at Sony Santa Monica and this says
3522720	3528120	that his project got canceled so he left that that has to be tied together and this one I'm
3528120	3534760	kind of disappointed about but hopefully he's gonna be doing some great stuff on his own Tetsuya
3534760	3540360	Mizuguchi has departed Q entertainment and of course you may recognize that name from such
3540360	3548320	wonderful games including rez and rez like games like child of Eden basically saying that uh you
3548400	3555400	know I guess he's moving on to his own well I thought that there was news like about a year
3555400	3561560	ago that he was taking on another role anyway because I seem to remember morning the Mizuguchi
3561560	3565640	was gonna be making another game anytime soon before and I thought there was something I mean
3565640	3569400	I don't think the news was that he had left the company but that he was taking some type of like
3569400	3574600	other role within it so I mean and they're even kind of confused on that sucks though cuz I love
3574600	3577320	his work I guess there's like some anonymous sources they're saying that you know they're
3577320	3581600	kind of confused when he may have left that he's been keeping a secret that he's been gone and he
3581600	3588080	may have actually departed was it last year sometime so I don't know what the hell's Q
3588080	3594160	doing then that's interest no idea I haven't really seen anything developing so maybe there's
3594160	3597320	got they've got something in secret they're working on no big no where he would be pretty
3597320	3604120	awesome huh harmonics yeah I don't know in East meets West West kind of thing could be interesting
3604360	3609360	badass I kind of I think with like the visual styles that he's got with his games and stuff
3609360	3615040	that fit right in with you know was it uh their brand new shooter that they've got you know there
3615040	3619000	is a reality though that maybe he doesn't want to do video games anymore like the guy who did
3619000	3623800	Katamari Damacy right ended up making like kids rides yeah he came back and started making like
3623800	3629920	smaller video I mean he keeps coming back and making little videos here and there and he'll
3629960	3634480	come back hopefully we haven't seen the last of music and you caught a Mario fucking awesome
3634480	3638720	that's just that's a series that's been kind of quiet for a little while huh it's cuz he drove
3638720	3643960	it into the ground it's like hey it's a new game Oh psych it's just still the old levels again it's
3643960	3648320	another new ads kids old levels that it that is a series I'd like to see kind of come but that
3648320	3652040	that's something they could put on project Morpheus because that will make people sick
3652040	3663240	whatsoever can you imagine Katamari Damacy in VR it would make for an interesting like survival
3663240	3670680	mode where you're running away from the giant Katamari Akuma JP with a clarification on now
3670680	3676720	where Tetsuya Mizuguchi is gone Akuma JP says he was going to teach in a university and Q is doing
3676720	3682480	social games so I mean this is really like a running theme is I mean maybe not so much the
3682480	3688960	Sony one but we're seeing that companies shifts toward social games is driving the old guard and
3688960	3695400	some of these these faces that really developed the classic games we love out well they're taking
3695400	3699920	the safe route because it's it's a you know social gaming is where they're making a lot of money so
3699920	3704800	you can't fault them for wanting to you know keep their company profitable but at the same time it's
3704800	3710400	like yeah it does kind of suck that these guys are going but you know if the you know these
3710400	3716800	creative guys that are you know known for these fantastic games they're not necessarily needed
3716800	3720640	for a lot of these social games anymore because I mean you don't have to be too entirely creative
3720640	3726600	to come up with something that's gonna sell okay on you know mobile devices I could see them you
3726600	3730400	know going on to form their own you know spinning off to form their own companies and a lot of these
3730400	3734880	guys do that and you see a lot of stuff being kick-started or you know that's why there's a
3734880	3741140	whole indie resurgence again so I I don't know it's I'm hopeful that he'll make something cool
3741140	3747000	lots of very passionate comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com game guru says
3747000	3751600	it is kind of sad that both Capcom and Konami are both essentially going to disappear for the mobile
3751600	3757080	market Jason with a little bit of a rant here saying people make social games with the same
3757080	3761680	boring-ass formula if there's one thing Nintendo got right it's the incredibly light use of
3761680	3767320	effective social elements Nintendo Network Super Mario 3d world low Nintendo is doing
3767320	3774120	non real-time social better than anyone else hmm dark Tetsuya supports that comment that she actually
3774120	3783800	do agree I don't know I do and I don't like I I don't I don't know like I do still enjoy those
3783800	3790080	elements that Nintendo puts in their games but yet I still yearn for like Nintendo to really push
3790080	3796640	that envelope further with online like where is my true online experience I don't even think like
3796640	3800560	the stuff that they have implemented in some of these games and you know with the whole you know
3800560	3804560	hey I could leave a comment here in this part of the game stuff that they do on the Wii U I don't
3804560	3810040	think that's if you didn't have that like you'd really miss it I would think I just think it's
3810040	3814600	kind of like oh that's gonna neat but it doesn't really add that much it doesn't say like wow I
3814600	3819220	need to get this version of the game because it has this feature in it that's never crossing
3819220	3823920	anyone's mind it just kind of something that I do that's like see you look hey we have internet
3823920	3829360	we understand social media we're hip we're cool you know I think the coolest thing that Mario
3829360	3835640	does is when it gets the ghosts in the levels that came from you know other people running it
3835640	3839920	that I think I think that's the coolest use of the social media and that's the kind of stuff
3839960	3843520	I would like to see like more of I think that's that's really cool that's not even social media
3843520	3847840	that's like shit they were doing from the DS like where you would you know get ghost data from
3847840	3854200	people and stuff I just don't it's not that new it's cool I like that they have that but it's I
3854200	3859600	wouldn't even go as far as saying it's like social media it's just you're sharing ghost data I mean
3859600	3866520	let's let let's not overly complicate things all right let's move on with some more news and that
3866520	3871120	has to do with the Xbox one which we haven't talked a whole lot about tonight but I know a
3871120	3875000	lot of people have been picking up Xbox ones because like there was a big sale this week on
3875000	3879320	that new Titanfall bundle right like I think Walmart marked it on 50 bucks and then Best Buy
3879320	3885000	was price matching it so a lot of people picking up an Xbox one right now and a lot more people
3885000	3891440	gonna be picking them up in September because the Xbox one will come to 26 more markets in September
3891440	3899400	eight of those were part of the original launch lineup that includes places like Denmark Russia
3899400	3904880	Sweden Switzerland they were cut from the original launch plans but now they will be launching there
3904880	3910600	in September one of the other big places of note where the game will be launching in September will
3910600	3917960	be Japan so finally Japan gets its Xbox one but the question is who cares will they care yeah
3918200	3923440	Akuma do you think other people will care it's all about the games right well it could I mean
3923440	3929440	let's see what happens at e3 because you know if you think about it okay if the system is coming
3929440	3935120	out in Japan in September this is the opportunity this e3 for Microsoft to get up on stage and say
3935120	3941160	hey XYZ Japanese developer who has been secretly working on an Xbox one exclusive this whole time
3941160	3945760	such as they weren't getting those some good support for the Xbox before for a lot of the
3945760	3951360	shooters so I wonder if that would be enough to you know if they start getting more local development
3951360	3957640	for like just those bullet hell games would that get people to buy to hell more RPGs I have a
3957640	3965360	tinfoil hat theory Akuma JP says don't care I have a tinfoil hat yeah well what's missed Walker
3965360	3971360	doing right now because we know remember they were big stuck in the bathroom with explosive diarrhea
3972000	3978920	no but they remember they they were a big start of the push for exclusives on the Xbox 360 when
3978920	3984240	they have Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey which you know but the problem is again Lost Odyssey wasn't
3984240	3988520	exactly a huge sales behemoth which is criminal because that game is fucking amazing I thought
3988520	3994960	that Blue Dragon was really fun and on the Wii I know they did last story was on the Wii right
3994960	3998960	and I know they've done some DS games in between there but what are what's like their big project
3998960	4005040	they're doing right now hmm I don't see them working on something for the Wii U maybe maybe
4005040	4011480	maybe I don't know maybe yet did the last story sell better than Lost Odyssey did now miss Walker
4011480	4017680	didn't do Dragon Quest right there were no no that's I get confused because it's the same art
4017680	4025400	square enix well yeah but I mean think of the out source development no and well we never got
4025400	4029920	the Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest X is the MMO we never got that anyway which is weird I don't
4029920	4033920	think that would do that well over here I it's just it's one of those things is you know they
4033920	4039360	don't have a lot of people that have just you know you're cornering the Wii U market then you
4039360	4043560	have you know people that are gonna play an MMO on this thing it's just I don't know that it's
4043560	4051320	too risky to bring it over here Akuma JP says missed Walker is in social games too that's a
4051320	4057800	sad laugh um Akuma JP also says yeah like like Dart Sakura had quoted earlier they don't care
4057800	4063800	people who want to play Titanfall will buy that's kind of what's happening over here like five
4063800	4069560	people well I don't know I think it's more magic well me actually in Japan probably not a lot but
4069560	4074720	I should have to say after seeing Titanfall in action yeah III think it would be it would
4074720	4080520	actually be a decent selling factor it actually is pretty good yeah on Xbox I mean I mean not
4080520	4084680	Xbox but I saw the PC one yeah and it was it was pretty good but see that's the thing it's like if
4084680	4089760	they really want to play Titanfall I think they just pick it up on PC why wait you know almost
4089760	4098480	six months yeah all right um let's anyway lots and lots of regions that the Xbox will be coming to
4098480	4107520	other big places Argentina India Israel Korea Saudi Arabia Singapore South Africa those are
4107520	4111720	just some of the countries a lot lots and lots of places getting the Xbox one a little later this
4111720	4118480	year so please look forward to it to register participation for this week's episode of Orange
4118480	4123600	Laundry radio at vog network comm use the passphrase belt well how about something that has
4123600	4130040	nothing to do with actual gaming systems but does affect gaming systems let's hear it well Netflix
4130040	4136920	we've been talking about the whole deal with the net neutrality popping up and since the the ruling
4136960	4141680	past and just on top of that there were the other situations where we're seeing Netflix making deals
4141680	4148080	with Comcast and you know other companies trying to get a bandwidth deals well now Netflix is sort
4148080	4159200	of turning it over and their CEO Reed Hastings put on a blog post this past Thursday that that
4159200	4166280	uh basically they're just he's just completely they said that the original definition of net
4166280	4174800	neutrality isn't fitting and it needs to be changed to to basically describe better the
4174800	4180400	activities around customer activities and what's going to you know demand what's going to use more
4180400	4186560	services can use less this quote says without strong net neutrality companies like Comcast can
4186560	4190720	make these demands driving up cost and prices for everyone else which is basically what we've been
4190720	4197600	saying anyway yet they've gone and make that deal so is this you know a case of a little hypocrisy
4197600	4203840	or is it that this is something that was already in the works is it I just don't understand why
4203840	4208240	they would just switch over like that but it I mean but it's a correct statement we know we see
4208240	4217000	it's happening already and there's also a Comcast executive though who was saying that the Netflix
4217000	4222600	CEO was wrong this is the open internet rules never were designed to deal with peering and
4222600	4227920	internet connection providers like Netflix have always paid for their connection so we've got a
4227920	4233320	little bit of an argument here well obviously there's concern about net neutrality because
4233320	4238880	it's in some ways it's kind of a ticking time bomb when it comes to gaming specifically because you
4238880	4244960	know we don't know what might happen where you know I think what's ultimately gonna happen is
4244960	4249680	that you're gonna see that these these providers start to put their data caps out there and they
4249680	4253920	have the different plans and they're gonna try to sell these cheaper plans that are very stringent
4253920	4260280	on the data caps but yet there will be certain services that will not count towards the data cap
4260280	4264440	which I think already happens with Comcast and they're like Xfinity movies and things like that
4264440	4268360	I don't think count towards whatever I don't even know if they're enforcing data caps right now but
4268360	4275240	you know they had that thing I and but it's just a matter of time before we see will Xbox live count
4275240	4281320	towards that will PlayStation Network count towards that will something like on live or
4281320	4287120	one of those streaming gaming solutions will they try to be the ones that you know I get the free
4287120	4293160	pass on the bandwidth I don't know but I I just don't think like Comcast can be so bold as to
4293160	4298000	start telling these tiered internet things because it's gonna be a huge revolt it's not like customers
4298040	4303600	don't have the choice to go other places yes they may have not have other cable providers in your
4303600	4309160	area but shit I know people that would go back to DSL rather than put up with this tiered internet
4309160	4314280	bullshit well also I'd like to read what the pagans you just said and the theory behind the deal is
4314280	4318520	good marketing because of the upcoming merger they want sure they can play nice at least that's what
4318520	4328160	I heard on NPR and why did Alan say but when doesn't he say but he doesn't want the internet
4328160	4336720	to regulate the pictures of butts going on out there I think is the problem but anyway yeah I
4336720	4343600	think I think that's a good theory that Comcast is making nice nice with Netflix because that could
4343600	4347640	have been a thorn in their side with the merger coming up and you know they're gonna have to
4348640	4357080	show that it's not antitrust basically that they control too much so anyway also hmm I agree with
4357080	4364080	butts who doesn't agree with butts all right well coming soon to a gaming store near you let's see
4364080	4372040	if there's some video games that may feature butts Loki anything in the u.s. sorry no butts this time
4372040	4379080	cut the rope triple treat coming out on 3ds the witch in the hundred night on PlayStation 3
4379080	4386760	although the alternate artwork for that does feature I think her but Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls
4386760	4394920	I think there's a butter to in that on PC Dynasty Warriors 8 extreme legends on PlayStation 3 and
4394920	4402280	extreme legends complete edition on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 deception for blood ties
4402280	4411960	on PlayStation 3 and on the Vita Cabela's big-game hunt her pro hunts on ps3 Xbox 360 and Wii U and
4411960	4421360	that is Alan alchemy by the way in our chat room clarifying his comment saying I said butts because
4421400	4426960	Comcast which actually is a perfectly valid explanation now that you say that Jamie do
4426960	4432440	you accept that explanation that's all the time well that's a game because before the show I said
4432440	4437520	that you liked big butts and you cannot lie you other brothers can't deny all right going to Japan
4437520	4442760	and talking about some of the releases over there hey on the PlayStation 3 biohazard 6 premium
4442760	4447240	edition L and Excel I don't I didn't even know that there was like a new like that game has
4447240	4450280	already been out so I don't know they're re-releasing it again for some reason on the
4450280	4458200	25th this week let's see also Hatsune Miku project diva f-second ooh I did not know this was the
4458200	4462560	thing that was coming out soon but yeah that's coming on the PlayStation 3 on the 27th and I'm
4462560	4467000	sure there'll be some people that are very excited about that one of the surviving music game
4467000	4474400	franchises there that's probably come out over here in the summer yeah in 2015 no no they released
4474400	4478400	the first one last summer did it come did it come out pretty quick that's come I think it's pretty
4478400	4487360	quick also some repackaging and re-releases for sleeping dogs Hong Kong Himitsu Keisatsu and Tomb
4487360	4492920	Raider game of the year edition are also out on the PlayStation 3 this week winning post 8 comes
4492920	4498080	out this week in regular and 20th anniversary premium box that is all on the PlayStation 3 in
4498080	4505360	Japan on the Xbox 360 this week Titanfall is released in Japan although I'm not sure if some

4670800	4675040	realness which you all should check out if you haven't been listening to it it's a really fun
4675040	4679120	show but they've been talking a lot about smite it's it's kind of like a League of Legends style
4679120	4683120	game I know it does like more like you can do like first-person points of view or not not for
4683120	4686840	but like more like World of Warcraft looking because you know how League of Legends is kind
4686840	4690840	of like a like a top-down sort of thing but like I guess smites a little more like World of
4690840	4694760	Warcraft leading so I it's kind of one of those style games I would also like to point out for
4694760	4699520	people next month that goat simulator comes out next month and everyone needs this game I'm going
4699520	4705920	to be getting goat simulator the heat Loki's been talking sorry I'm great give it up for the goats
4705920	4711880	that it that is when I a I convinced my sister she doesn't even have steam or anything I'm like
4711880	4716560	dude you need to get that's coming out next and you know in two weeks and she's like okay well
4716560	4724640	we need to hook up Sean's computer and you know give it up for the goat see it looks great but
4724640	4730520	here's the best here's the but what here's the best part but yes the best part about goat
4730520	4740840	simulator besides the fact goat emulator beside the fact that it looks crazy is steam they're
4740840	4746240	gonna have the whole steam or workshop support so you're gonna be able to make your own shit
4746800	4750320	if you really want to I don't know if it would probably get voted off there because it's
4750320	4756200	inappropriate you could make your own goat say yeah I have this weird feeling that goat simulators
4756200	4762160	like the new minecraft like wait like I kind of think I it just I don't call it a hunch kind of
4762160	4766840	think goat simulators the new minecraft reginator says what about goat simulator to goat stimulator
4766840	4774680	oh I saw there like sirs you are a damn pervy I've been in the corner I've been following the
4774680	4778960	guys that you know they make the game and just like just basically trolling everywhere to try
4778960	4784200	to find you know some sort of new footage of the game and the best I could do with someone posted
4784200	4789800	a vine video that they had of playing goat simulator at GDC that cliffy B had that I don't
4789800	4793880	remember but it was something yeah where he had the tongue stuck to the back of the car and he
4793880	4799360	was being drunk around in circles like oh god I need this game now it's so amazing it does look
4799360	4804400	like a game that you you would have made it really did it's like you love you guys you guys know
4804400	4808920	Loki loves his sandbox games come on grand theft auto 5 he never shuts up about it Saints Row 4
4808920	4814500	he never shuts up about it he loves the sandbox game what is goat simulator it's just I just
4814500	4822280	stewed in parts with goats and it's not ridiculous over the top which is the other but I see you
4822280	4825960	know I would get this too because you know what my one of my favorite animals and all the entire
4825960	4832000	universe is goats because I love their eyes and goats are the best they're the most adorable
4832000	4836840	things ever and like the goats that are at fairy tale land here in Sacramento for when I have to
4836840	4841640	go with Becky and she takes Julian and I just hang out with goats say you love the goats say you do
4841640	4850960	I love cats yeah okay how's that you happy you ever have to do a new intro you know what you
4850960	4857400	guys can bite me and you're gonna say that you guys are awful okay here I am trying to support
4857400	4866080	independent gaming and you guys are being you know what that indie game yeah I know plenty of what's
4866080	4872360	pick that indie game is probably the first one in a long time where all three of us said pre-ordered
4872360	4886160	I don't know I think the game is pretty mad I like big goats and I cannot lie oh come on were
4886160	4895880	you raised in a barn no all right um that's it for the UK dates yes I'm seriously hoping that
4895880	4901160	they put goat boy in that that game somehow all right Loki why don't you reach on in and pull
4901160	4911280	out another story for us okay so um there was I guess Siliconera had asked Nintendo about you
4911280	4917200	know unity coming possibly to the 3ds because you know it's supported on the Wii U and hell that's
4917200	4921800	how a lot of those you know indie games are on the Wii U's because people are building them in
4921800	4929240	unity and porting them over using the unity export stuff and of course the generic answer that they
4929240	4934840	got I don't even know this is exactly news is we're definitely looking at it so there you go
4934840	4942480	they're definitely looking at something so I'm definitely looking at it yeah my eyes are in that
4942480	4953440	general direction what you're you have you already forgotten about the goats have not but I I heard
4953440	4957600	aren't they aren't there supposed to be like 50 games or something using this that are coming to
4957600	4962320	we use soon I thought there's a lot of games that are using it I'm not sure on the exact number but
4962320	4967320	I can imagine like 50 games that sounds about right makes everybody I mean a lot of people are
4967320	4972840	using unity especially because the Wii U doesn't really support a ton of different engines that
4972840	4979560	you know can be multi-platform so I can see it's one of the few that you know people are developing
4979560	4984120	games for that's easy to port to other systems how they added support for the Vita and you know
4984120	4992440	PlayStation 3 for it supports most of the consoles out there right now all right well as SSG 100 Matt
4992440	4998440	in our chat room says moving on to the next topic well apparently your boyfriend thinks we need Jesus
4998440	5006640	why don't you tell him a thing or two let me tell you a thing all right moving on let me tell you
5006640	5012320	about Unreal Engine 4 Unreal Engine 4 this is some other big news that came out of game developers
5012320	5017840	conference Unreal Engine 4 is gonna be out it's it's gonna be basically available to plenty more
5017840	5023320	people it's it's open to the public essentially for the low low cost of $19 a month but there is
5023320	5028960	a catch if you are going to profit off the game it will involve a royalty agreement asking for
5028960	5034880	5% in gross sales so you know but I mean you can do a lot with Unreal Engine so it might be worth
5034880	5038840	it to some people so yeah Unreal Engine 4 is gonna be available to the public it's a subscription
5038840	5043800	based service there this is the same thing that triple-a game developers have been using for lots
5043800	5048200	and lots of money but yeah it's big big news coming out of game developers conference direct
5048200	5053440	out of direct out of the mouth of Tim Sweeney who is the epic games founder so this is great because
5053440	5060220	you know assuming that developers are willing to take the you know 5% agreement a lot of indie
5060220	5065920	games can really focus on you know making that game and you know the engine will do a lot of
5066080	5072120	hopefully the legwork for them we see a lot a lot of games out there that use Unreal Engine 3 as it
5072120	5078360	is you know things like forget doesn't Final Fantasy 13 run on Unreal some of it like like
5078360	5082200	there's a lot of weird games out there you wouldn't think run on this engine that do I know the last
5082200	5086920	remnant ran on yeah real yeah there's just a lot of games out there that run on it like the Mortal
5086920	5094800	Kombat games do right pretty sure they do so you know this could be a great thing for Loki this
5094800	5098000	sounds like the type of thing where you might be raising an eyebrow going is this another thing I
5098000	5102560	should play with no I don't want to learn something else you don't want to learn something else ones
5102560	5110480	enough for you yeah maybe later fair enough all right well before we get to our break here we're
5110480	5116680	gonna go back to a classic time in gaming it's a classic time when there was no engine there was no
5116680	5122200	do-it-yourself you end up you want to make a video game you learned assembly language we've
5122200	5126920	bought a very expensive you had you had a Texas Instruments computer and programmed a little
5126920	5131960	bleeping ball that's right dark soccer is gonna take us to the classic game of the week archive
5131960	5138080	dark soccer what is a video game that you think the kids out there should be playing this week
5138080	5142960	speaking of things that come on he's fucking run into the ground nothing is as great as the
5142960	5149040	original Frogger what a what a timely choice unintentionally and I will tell you about Frogger
5149280	5154960	and my history with this game before I go further into it and to be clear this is the original
5154960	5163920	arcade game not the pot not the shit not the dumps that Konami took on the franchise so anyway I
5163920	5174520	imagine me around eight years old on roller skates playing Frogger it's damn hard to play Frogger on
5174520	5178800	roller skates it's hard to play almost any arcade game on roller skates and I did play a stand-up
5178800	5185680	pole position on roller skates as well I played the exact same Frogger machine at Babalu skating
5185680	5193040	rink in Dothan Alabama every summer for probably the next 11 years after that so and it still
5193040	5198400	worked it had some burnin it was old but damn machine still worked and now it's gone and I
5198400	5204320	mourn that particular Frogger but that was my Frogger anyway Frogger is a game we play as a
5204320	5211200	stupid frog and you were trying to get across the street and then across the pond into your little
5211200	5216200	froggy hole and sometimes crocodiles might try to eat you which I've never seen a crocodile eat a
5216200	5222960	frog but I have seen it grab a man by its leg this happened for now I've seen this having him
5223280	5231400	because I'm from the swamp anyway a Frogger came out in 1981 it was developed by Konami and licensed
5231400	5238200	by Sega and Gremlin at the time so basically you just have to navigate traffic you know keep from
5238200	5244320	getting run over by the damn front by the trucks and apparently a Formula One cars go on the street
5244320	5253880	in whatever town this is and all kinds of things it is you know one of the very classics of games
5253880	5262800	it also was one of the first games that used more than one CPU is choose 80 processors it is
5262800	5271920	basically still super popular and shush don't judge me for saying froggy hole okay I'm not the
5271920	5275600	one having an obsession with froggy don't get distracted by chat especially when they're being
5275600	5285560	perverts up so anyway by 2005 Frogger sold more than 20 million copies worldwide including 5
5285560	5292760	million in the u.s. so yeah you use a joystick you you know have to navigate the froggy around you can
5292760	5298680	send them up and the different types of vehicles that you can be smushed flat by our cars trucks
5298680	5307320	buses dune buggies bulldozers vans taxis bicyclists motors and or motorcycles that will just cut
5307320	5312520	through traffic and then in the next half you have crocodiles and turtles the turtles can sink
5312520	5317160	into the ground the crocodiles can eat you but you can land on their backs you can ride their ass the
5317160	5324320	entire way if you want and then you land in your frog home sorry not frog hole and the levels are
5324320	5329800	timed so different things will kill you make turning you into a little skull and crossbones
5329800	5338400	which the last time I saw a frog a frog skull it was when I was cutting into it when I was in ninth
5338400	5346960	grade in biology class so at any rate you could be hit by a car you could jump into the water run
5346960	5354280	into snakes otters or into crocodiles jaws you can jump into a home invaded by a crocodile you
5354280	5359080	can stay on a diving turtle that is submerged to ride a log crocodile turtle off the screen
5359080	5365800	jump onto a log a home already occupied by a frog jump into the side of a home or in the bush and
5365800	5372880	running out of time before getting your froggy home as far as other versions there have been
5372880	5379360	many others there have been clones as people in chat room are mentioning right now Sierra had the
5379360	5386080	magnetic media rights as far as cartridge versions Parker medic media as in discs Oh
5386080	5395680	okay Parker brothers licensed it from Sega for cartridges we've seen copies on the TRS 80 the
5395680	5402240	Sinclair 1000 and Sinclair 2068 sorry it has just clicked for me after all these years why
5402240	5407640	Frogger two three deep which was the one I loved on Commodore 64 was only ever on cartridge because
5407640	5413960	it was a Parker brothers game I just had an aha moment Thank You dark soccer I feel welcome
5413960	5420960	lightened we had Atari 2600 versions the multiple releases and there was a cassette for the
5420960	5427040	supercharger and Tommy there was a Tomy Tudor version that was also licensed from Konami
5427040	5433000	themselves but not it's not clear if it's been developed by Konami Parker brothers also did the
5433000	5439000	releases for 2600 and television Atari 5200 which I have the clique of vision which I have
5439000	5446040	Atari 8-bit computers the vic-20 and Commodore 64 as you mentioned Rob Sierra had the Commodore
5446040	5452520	64 disk versions which is why there were two versions on the Commodore 64 and there's Apple
5452520	5460400	to those the original 128 came Macintosh the IBM PC the Atari 2600 supercharger and then the versions
5460400	5468680	for the TRS 80 color computer and Sinclair did had a version developed by corn soft in the UK
5468680	5476400	about 10 million was spent on advertising for Frogger and it was advertised along with the
5476400	5483360	Empire Strikes Back there's your Star Wars thing Coleco also had a mini arcade tabletop version
5483360	5489760	that was released also along with Pac-Man Galaxian and Donkey Kong I have one of those taken apart
5489760	5498120	awesome now there were clones of it including froggy for the ZX spectrum hopper by anchor
5498120	5505080	anchor and soft for the BBC micro and the acorn electron there was another Frogger for the BBC
5505080	5511800	micro ZX spectrum there was Frogger for sharp MZ 700 in the UK and a version of done for the new
5511800	5520800	brand by the name of elite the Atari 2600 also had a game named freeway that its working title
5520800	5527720	was bloody human freeway awesome so I mean like I said there's just been like a bunch of different
5527720	5534840	versions I mean we have them by Hasbro we have them you know rereleases for PlayStation we have
5534840	5541120	there was a prototype based off a Frogger for the Sega Game Gear that was never released but
5541120	5547120	apparently I think there are leaks of the ROM set out there was a Porta Frogger for Xbox Live
5547120	5554760	Arcade and that was developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Konami so then you were right
5554760	5560760	the sequel to Frogger was Frogger 2 3 deep in 1984 there was another Frogger in 1997 Frogger
5560760	5565480	2 swap is revenge in 2000 and then a bunch of shit that Konami took on the franchise well
5565800	5572080	well that first Konami won the Frogger in 97 that was a huge game that was a huge that was on the
5572080	5576800	original PlayStation that was a huge game it was very different you know because it had the larger
5576800	5583560	kind of worlds you know that game I thought was incredibly boring I I owned it actually I didn't
5583560	5589280	I didn't mind it I thought it was cool well how about some pop culture references this time Frogger
5589280	5598600	had an animated series as part of the Saturday Supercade the CBS did it was included with it
5598600	5604680	was Frogger pitfall Harry and then their segments were replaced by kangaroo and space ace and there
5604680	5611800	was a segment on remember that show VR troopers they were beating a frog monster called amphibidor
5611800	5617720	based off of Frogger and it's been mentioned in that horrid horde show Seinfeld which I still
5617720	5626240	do not like to show MTV movie that was a really funny episode though okay well basically there
5626240	5631880	was a reference to a bunch of different early games in that one and Frogger was in wreck-it Ralph
5631880	5640160	hanging around a game central station and in 1982 and that's why I'm saying stay tuned to the very
5640160	5646240	end of the show tonight Buckner and Garcia did a song called froggies lament that was on the
5646240	5652040	Pac-Man fever soundtrack and as I recall for single wasn't it the b-side I don't know bad
5652040	5659360	religion did a song called Frogger where he says that Los Angeles is trying to play Frogger with
5659360	5670720	his life yeah there's basically quite a number of different references but the best of them ever in
5671400	5677080	2006 there's a group in Austin Texas that modified a Roomba dressed as a Frogger to do a real-life
5677080	5683400	version of the game that used a bitch a Bluetooth controller the Roomba was able to get across the
5683400	5689600	street 10 times 40 lanes and survived for 15 minutes before it was quote killed by an SUV a
5689600	5697440	game over you know and actually Frogger has been a nickname for disease as well I don't know if I
5697440	5707000	was it was a name given to the jumping gene for a particular family fruit fly okay then there you
5707000	5713480	go is that it there's all the highest by the way the highest Frogger score by Michael Smith
5713480	5717640	of Springfield Virginia and the world record was nine hundred and seventy thousand four hundred and
5717640	5725120	forty points and he beat Pat Lafayette on December 26 on 2099 and I'm guessing that's a some sort of
5725120	5731720	yeah it's a Twin Galaxies thing so whatever all right what evs there Frogger there it is your
5731720	5738520	konami shit there it is your classic game of the week Frogger which really is a real real classic
5738520	5743400	if you think about it yeah I mean all those references alone no Frogger will ever be as
5743400	5750280	awesome as me on my roller skates as a seven-year-old playing at Babalu skating rink in Dothan Alabama
5750280	5759640	well fair enough all right here then Rob uh-huh it was long and bored straight my hair when I
5759640	5767080	was seven went to my ass you will never see it be that long ever all right we're gonna take a break
5767080	5770920	Jamie's doctor I'm just looking at the related videos by the way to the Frogger video and
5770920	5776080	somebody recreated it of course in Grand Theft Auto Frogger of course they did that's hilarious
5776080	5779920	that seems like the type of thing Loki would have done all right we're gonna take a break guys when
5779960	5783920	we come back to plenty more orange launch radio including rapid-fire news the frugal question of

5955960	5960760	patent-ending all right let's uh let's do some rapid-fire news it's a video game podcast let's
5960760	5965800	talk about what's going on in games real quick Loki so looking forward to playing Titanfall
5965800	5970680	and 360 was supposed to be coming out this week but then at the last minute they're like hey it's
5970680	5978160	not ready and so it's now coming out on April 8th in North America and April 11th in Europe
5978160	5984280	and they said no we'll we see a few things that can be made even better and so we're giving
5984280	5991160	blue point a little bit more time to deliver an epic Titanfall experience for the 360 according
5991160	5999920	to the press release more like it's not done yet and that they they're working on epic day
5999920	6007880	one patch but you know that's neither here and there but yeah hopefully it's an awesome game
6007880	6015680	PlayStation 4 they announced that they're also offering in these some new development tools
6015680	6021840	to help with publishing games on their console including with that you know the ability to export
6021840	6030160	to PlayStation 4 on game maker studio as well as mono game which is I guess free to license
6030160	6036080	Sony computer entertainment developers and also of course you know unity does support PlayStation
6036080	6044280	3 and PlayStation 4 and I guess our PlayStation 3 and Vita and the PlayStation 4 version of the
6044280	6052240	export is coming for I guess some early access people in April and so that would be pretty cool
6052240	6059360	also they're authoring tools framework I guess this free open source available to download and
6059360	6064000	they use that you know in their first party games like you know last of us and beyond two souls and
6064000	6074760	that kind of stuff so pretty cool and then also they're going to be doing some more updates to the
6074760	6081240	PlayStation 4 firmware that's gonna allow you to do some game capture without HDCP restrictions
6081240	6088000	because right now you're kind of limited how you can capture on you know the PlayStation 4 but with
6088000	6093640	that you're gonna be able to I guess you know export clips and that kind of stuff you know you
6093680	6101840	can record and share longer clips of gameplay sessions and you know beyond I don't know if you
6101840	6108440	can yeah upping the resolution on ustream and twitch streams to 720p which is gonna be coming
6108440	6112800	in a later update so that's kind of cool that they're doing that and also the ability to save
6112800	6119040	videos and screenshots to a USB Drive so you know you want to edit them off your PlayStation 4 you
6119040	6126120	can do that as well instead of having to just export and stuff that's awesome all right well
6126120	6131400	moving on to some other news disregarding Mega Man Legends 3 you know it broke many hearts that
6131400	6137960	this game did not end up happening including the Mega Man creator KJ Inafune still wants Mega Man
6137960	6143400	Legends 3 to happen he said recently that if somebody asked even right now what's the game
6143400	6148520	you want to create most it's still Legends 3 I put so much effort into that game so much passion
6148520	6154040	into that game but it didn't happen it's always a regret in my mind even now we all know that it's
6154040	6158840	not gonna happen though as long as Capcom holds the IP but if they asked me to make the game I
6158840	6165040	could still gather most of the original team even right now so hey I'd be happy to see a mighty
6165040	6173400	number 9 legends if you know what I mean that by the way in comments to a US gamer moving on I
6173400	6179160	mentioned during the Japanese release dates that a new Nintendo Wii U was coming well it's just a
6179160	6182920	different type of bundle here what's happening is that the Wii U premium pack in Japan is being
6182920	6189880	replaced with a Wii Sports Club bundle hmm so yes a Wii Sports Club bundle is going on sale in Japan
6189880	6197280	starting on March 27th it will be a 32 gig Wii U premium console with a gamepad and then we use
6197280	6202680	our excuse me Wii Sports Club passes for events like bowling golf and tennis from Wii U Sports
6202680	6207360	Club because remember we use sports clubs that whole weird like free-to-play thing where you can
6207360	6213200	like demo it for 24 hours or you can buy one game or you can buy yeah so it comes with passes for
6213200	6218520	some of the games there and of course a Wiimote controller and a wrist strap all for the low low
6218520	6224640	price of 30,000 yen as you say they include a Wii remote with that that's just bullshit I know of
6224640	6230000	course there's a there's a Wii remote there so you can actually play the game and lastly also about
6230000	6239240	Nintendo a trademark for QOL in Japan for a number of products QOL quality of life and the trademarks
6239240	6243480	are covering things including portable gaming devices standalone gaming devices merchandise
6243480	6250000	beauty products so very interesting nobody knows though what exactly this could be about although
6250000	6254280	some people think it could be some type of new fitness initiative well yeah I remember they were
6254280	6258840	talking about that they wanted to kind of go in that direction in which I still don't I mean I
6258840	6267840	cool but once again I don't think this is gonna I don't know where they're going well I ranted a
6267840	6273160	few weeks ago about how Nintendo should have had the Fitbit craze and they lost it and maybe this
6273160	6277640	is their chance to try and still capture that although I kind of thought we you or we fit you
6277640	6281400	was supposed to kind of have that whole thing in it so I don't know what else they're enhancing to
6281400	6289080	the fitness thing but we'll see I just don't I don't get it right now I mean it to me this is
6289080	6295520	almost like how I didn't get the Wii vitality sensor and I still don't get that and it's cool
6295520	6299760	the app they want to you know do something where you can exercise and they can do all that sort of
6299760	6303880	tracking stuff but the problem is there's already stuff out there that does that and probably does
6303880	6309360	it better and just because it has my has a me in it doesn't mean I'm gonna fucking buy it or I'm
6309360	6315640	gonna buy a system for it so I'm I just wait and see what they're gonna do with this we'll see
6315640	6323080	dark soccer what do you have for us we have some stuff basically we've got going on and this is
6323080	6329120	kind of sad but all of the DLC for guitar hero DJ hero and band hero is going to be going away
6329120	6338320	as of March 31st so yeah I get it while the getting's good and guitar hero on iOS is going
6338320	6345000	to be discounted through the end of the month on the App Store in other news we have a new
6345000	6355160	character that has been revealed for ultra Street Fighter 4 and that's Decapra Decapra Decapra who's
6355160	6361360	one of bison's dolls or I should say Vega for the Japanese version she's the arch villain of the
6361360	6369960	doll guard and she is a clone of Cammy also and this one was really sad and Dan and I actually
6369960	6374560	talked about this because part of what put him in the hospital for congestive heart failure were
6374560	6383160	energy drinks and a Norwegian team teen I'm sorry basically was part of a he was 14 year old kid
6383160	6390880	named Henrik who was at his cafeteria school doing a Call of Duty land party that lasted 16
6390920	6396800	hours he said this is the quote I was playing Call of Duty then everything went dark and I passed
6396800	6405920	out he was sent to a hospital in Lillehammer who basically he was in a coma for several days his
6405920	6411560	kidney started to fail other organs started to fail and it was because he had been drinking
6411560	6419320	energy drinks the entire time the rest of the rest of his health had been pretty okay all up until
6419440	6427400	that point but it was the combination of lack of sleep focused attention and just drinking
6427400	6432560	consistent energy drinks for the period of 16 hours he drank four liters of energy drinks that's
6432560	6438880	a little excessive that's even you wouldn't drink that much that's just stupid that is also 14 which
6438880	6444280	goes along with you know stupid and that that's a good way to make your heart explode yeah but but
6444440	6451160	and the reason I'm saying the soup is more like an ignorant thing you think the human brains under
6451160	6455880	like 25 years old are not programmed to think about long-term effects they're programmed to
6455880	6461800	think about immediate reward so that is I need to stay awake let me drink another I need to stay
6461800	6467320	awake let me drink another and not putting any thought at all into what is this going to do to
6467320	6473000	my kidneys take a break my liver can't process this much taurine when you're when you're playing
6473080	6477280	games or you know doing anything like that take a break why do you think we take a break here at
6477280	6481960	OLR instead of doing three hours because people's gotta pee take a little break to you know drink
6481960	6488560	water and use the restroom and all that stuff so all right anyhow let us take a break on over to
6488560	6494360	our Facebook and Google Plus communities because when you slam those words together you get FUGL
6494360	6501240	Plus but we just call it FUGL for short in a segment we call the FUGL question of the week
6503000	6515640	heading on over to our communities we're gonna get some responses to this question tonight we
6515640	6519840	are sure that many of you have heard the news this week that Igarashi left Konami after many
6519840	6523840	years of working on the Castlevania series so we thought we'd use this as an excuse to ask our
6523840	6528400	audience about their thoughts on Castlevania the past and the present do you have a favorite game
6528400	6532800	in the series do you still play the new games or could you never get into the series and why
6533640	6537800	so we're gonna get people's thoughts on Castlevania tonight so let's start with over on
6537800	6542480	Facebook wicked from the nerdgasm Network who says the Castlevania series is a very personal
6542480	6547760	favorite of mine I originally cut my gaming teeth playing countless hours of Castlevania 2 just
6547760	6552680	trying to decipher what the hell the villagers were telling me I never did beat the game until
6552680	6557760	I was into my 20s though sorry guys I suddenly decided to get a case of the hiccups my favorite
6557760	6561960	game in the series fluctuates a lot especially after all of my game challenges over the past 18
6561960	6566640	months right now it's Aria of sorrow followed up by Symphony of the night sandwiched by dawn of
6566640	6571800	sorrow in third I fell in love with the Metroidvania style of Symphony growing up and I feel the sorrow
6571800	6576720	pair took the spirit of the game and ran with it I like the classic style side scrollers especially
6576720	6582240	Rondo of blood and super Castlevania 4 but I never could get into the 3d ones sour taste to
6582240	6587100	my mouth from Castlevania 64 I guess then I know a while back I think he went through and played
6587100	6591740	like every single stinking Castlevania game because they they do these like little challenges
6591740	6596980	on their show where they play every game in a series it's pretty impressive let's see dark
6596980	6601380	Tetsuya says favorite game in the series has got to be Symphony of the night games like that helped
6601380	6608420	inspire my favorite indie title ever wink what could that be as for egos future well if he follows
6608420	6612940	in the footsteps of KJ and ifune I'm very excited about the prospect of a similar game with his
6612940	6619540	influence yeah I'm sure that's just a matter of time our pal Jeremy from Koopa Club says I love
6619540	6624700	this series my faves are the original games the more action-oriented ones I like the Metroid style
6624700	6629740	games as well but those don't appeal to me as much as say super Castlevania 4 does the first
6629740	6634220	Lords of Shadow isn't all that bad but it's not really that great either I haven't played the
6634220	6638260	other two games in the series and maybe I will someday but right now I have no desire to really
6638260	6644940	reward Konami with any of my time oh snap I also don't see why anyone is sad that Ega left chances
6644940	6648860	are he'd never have made another Castlevania game anyway given that they had him working on social
6648860	6654620	games for the past few years and I'm adding into that and canceling them let him leave and make
6654620	6660420	something better I can agree with that Ian also from Koopa Club that's Koopa with a Q Club with
6660420	6667060	the K another great podcast says I remember liking Castlevania 64 a bunch and really got into the DS
6667060	6671740	games I'm not sad about him leaving either as that appears to be the trend that people are doing
6671740	6675940	I'm hoping the Silent Hill masterminds follow suit and we will get kickstarters out the ass
6675940	6682740	and vag for their respected games what do you think dark Sakura how about kickstarters out the ass and
6682740	6693780	vag don't know no no no no no no no no no no no no no SSJ 100 Matt giving us our favorite kind of
6693860	6701340	answer a haiku here we go are you ready for the haiku whipping vampires never get that's all you
6701340	6708540	already lost whipping vampire oh no I just kidding I can't count just kidding that whipping vampires
6708540	6716700	that's for no way whipping vampires I made the same mistake it's yeah um fam whipping higher
6717580	6726940	vampires vampires is two syllables Rob I'll let it slide whipping vampires never gets old except
6726940	6733900	when it is Simon's quest that is a lie Simon's quest is one of my favorites don't spread lies
6733900	6742060	on my show our friend Shane says Castlevania 3 only because it had a pirate named Grant
6742220	6747460	de nasty cracks me up every time I read it was that a mistranslation thing or is that really
6747460	6754620	was grant de nasty grant de nasty according to the website how many syllables calm vampire is two
6754620	6762060	syllables but what about vampires that would use syllables will be two syllables thought I'd try
6762060	6771220	unless you're from Texas or Alabama or somewhere vampires then it's got 50 all right and lastly
6771340	6776980	nemesis 47 on Facebook nemesis 47 says Castlevania Symphony the night on the old PlayStation one
6776980	6781620	still to this day one of my favorite games in the series I still remember the time I beat it and got
6781620	6787340	the good ending by exploring every nook and cranny in the castle remember getting that stinking
6787340	6791300	upside-down castle the first time in one of the top 10 moments in gaming ever when you unlock
6791300	6796780	that upside-down castle and you're like ah fuck no it's after you get through with with butthole
6796780	6804660	shaft which is what I called him related to the acid badge Kickstarter no no no butthole shaft
6804660	6816080	was yes the dark priest shaft I'm just talking about shaft shut your mouth um I still what I
6816080	6820740	always wanted to do that was I was trying to find because you know there was the hidden track for
6820740	6827500	Maria having been turned into or possessed by the succubus hmm but I never did find that in the
6827500	6834900	Japanese one which Dan imported before he and I got together wow that's actually pretty impressive
6834900	6842140	yeah all right let's see going to Google Plus and reading some of the answers over there act
6842140	6847140	deaf says super Castlevania 4 is definitely my favorite in the series that was a good one I love
6847140	6851580	that one on Super Nintendo and then there was Castlevania 5 on the Super Nintendo and I remember
6851580	6856220	thinking at the time this game is ass and it wasn't until much later I learned about how it's
6856220	6863140	because Castlevania 5 was it was um why can't the name slips me not symphony night but the one before
6863140	6869500	it Rondo blood blood oh blood crammed into a Super Nintendo cartridge and it wasn't Castlevania 5
6869500	6874580	it was actually listed as Dracula X Oh was it I thought they called it five here they it was
6874580	6879460	Dracula I think it made might have like given it a subtitle is Super Castlevania 5 yeah cuz Super
6879460	6888180	Castlevania 4 was the redo of the first one but it wasn't really a redo sort of it was first style
6888180	6896380	yeah but um but yeah Dracula X was in fact I've got the box and manual and everything but nothing
6896380	6901260	is as awesome as playing the damn game on the PC Engine because oh my god I remember you brought

6945620	6949880	played Symphony of the Night before I even played the Nintendo and Super Nintendo versions but I

6954500	6962060	64 what but any more modern 3d Castlevania than that just hasn't attracted me that is some by the

7014460	7021060	all right let's move on we got more news to get to and your calls and emails pretty soon here but
7021060	7027100	starting off with Loki so the oh yeah has done a lot of weird made a lot of weird decisions lately
7027100	7034580	in making itself irrelevant but now they're doing I guess I want to call this almost like the final
7034580	7039740	nail in the coffin but they're now dropping the free to try requirement for developers because you
7039740	7045220	may remember when the OUYA came out all the games around the OUYA had a free component to them so
7045220	7049260	you can at least try them out now that's not required so now basically it's the Android
7049260	7056420	marketplace on a really shitty console that now you can also play those games on other things
7056420	7063180	including maybe soon PC so what's the point again tell me do you regret your decision to back that
7063180	7069260	Kickstarter ah yes I do but at least I got to try the console out for a while and I mean I made
7069300	7076860	most of my money back so hey ladies again extended rental it was a it was a rental it was a red box
7076860	7081380	but a silver box yeah it's like when I used to rent consoles and I got to try it too so it worked
7081380	7092660	out yeah so I got to laugh at it but yeah I don't know why they would do that but whatever um also
7093060	7100220	apparently Disney interactive they are scaling back and that story was left over from last week
7100220	7106460	oh I'm sorry how was my bad on the Cheryl tonight sorry fired I knew there'd be a mistake I knew we
7106460	7110700	would come to the new studio and there'd be some damn mistake well this it was just that not worse
7110700	7117860	the best part is we can edit that out we do it live here at all our fuck it we'll do it live
7117860	7122180	well I just want to reiterate from last week that Disney interactive is making less games
7122420	7130300	because you know what they made like what one game last year you know one console game Disney
7130300	7135900	infinity oh I'm sorry two games there's planes to like everybody else social so social is huge
7135900	7140220	on social yeah and so you know what's gonna happen now there's not gonna be planes this year so fuck
7140220	7143980	you people that like planes you're only getting get Disney infinity too if that ever comes out
7143980	7150940	which it probably will because it made a lot of money all right anyway moving on to more recent
7150940	7158900	news and things that are upcoming to the PlayStation 4 apparently pre-loading is supposed
7158900	7163140	to be a thing that's coming to the PlayStation 4 I thought this was something that was already
7163140	7169380	available on games but I guess not sucker punch which of course is the studio behind infamous
7169380	7174980	second son said on Twitter that this is a feature that's coming later in the spring there was a
7174980	7179940	tweet that said quote no preload until April this of course a response to all the people that wanted
7179940	7183660	to play infamous second son which I know none of us were able to talk about during our gaming
7183660	7187140	weeks none of us have played it I know my buddy Shane's been playing it a lot he really likes
7187140	7191220	it a lot he says he said it reminds him of crackdown it looks like it looks good I need to
7191220	7196420	try that I never really got into the other games but no no I it's making it sound really good so
7196420	7200780	I have to check that out but anyway yeah sucker punch said that in the tweet no preload until
7200780	7206560	April so this could mean that future games will be something you can digitally download and then
7206560	7209920	play on the launch day I don't know what big games are coming out in April I know there's
7209920	7214440	Final Fantasy 14 but that's a little different being an MMO so yeah I don't know I don't know
7214440	7220480	but that'll be cool that people can download the games and then play them at midnight on the launch
7220480	7230800	day as a lot of people will be doing with Diablo 3 this week I'm sure dark soccer so this is just
7231120	7239040	I really had to bring this article up just because of something that Bioware Montreal's game designer
7239040	7246280	Munvir Hare was bringing about he actually did a talk at game developers conference called
7246280	7253200	misogyny racism and homophobia where do video games stand basically challenging this whole we
7253200	7259560	only develop male characters because only guys or the majority of our market are guys he said
7259560	7266040	and this is a from here that it's cynical to assume that an audience isn't capable of embracing
7266040	7273680	a gay character in any way and that more exclusive female protagonists that aren't glorified sex
7273680	7278640	objects and have personalities beyond supporting the men in the game that it's a good thing I mean
7278640	7286600	basically is bringing up you know the female Shepherd who you know there's a yeah okay well
7286600	7292400	is it 15% of the players had a female Shepherd but still you got a lot more I think attention
7292400	7299560	with her in the third Mass Effect which was about the best thing about the game and I mean they're
7299560	7305640	basically saying you know the people are arguing that women weren't soldiers in medieval times but
7305640	7312600	there actually is plenty of historical evidence that women were would fight and that in other
7312600	7318300	cultures outside of our typical Eurocentric video game you know focus that there were plenty of
7318300	7324440	female warriors in other cultures so it was really really good you know but the best thing that I
7324440	7328720	think came out of this that he's quoted saying is let's not be scared to ruffle feathers and let's
7328720	7334000	be open and honest about our intentions let's push and engage in a new discourse as a result
7334000	7338920	of these dynamics and let's do all of this because we are current what we are currently doing is
7338920	7346400	absolutely not working it's about damn time I'm trying to see if some of our chatters have some
7346400	7351480	comments on this Seattle in our chat room says everybody loves Samus not counting other M hey
7351480	7356520	you know there's some people that like other M as well you know well I think that it's it's I mean
7356520	7364240	but but I mean he's right it's sad that it needs to be said it's not like females aren't accepted
7364240	7371920	as huge big important video game characters like you have you know Samus like you have Lara Croft
7371920	7377160	like you have I mean heck Princess Peach in a way you know is well I mean you know people were
7377160	7381840	excited to be able to play as her I know that might be a bit of a stretch but femshep and you
7381840	7386760	know so on well and I'm not I'm not like saying it's perfect by any means but I'm just saying
7386760	7392280	that like you know it's not like they can't there shouldn't be that fear to have the female lead
7392280	7397320	because there's plenty of very successful ones well and it's not just the female lead it's having
7397320	7410400	other sexual not just sexualities but having a gender sexuality of race you know even religion
7410400	7415920	I mean we finally have had a few Muslim characters pop up here and there we need more I think you
7415920	7422160	know I'm gonna say Co C's characters of color you know we need more people and we need to actually
7422160	7429560	have where I like being able to make have your character and make the choice but I like having
7429560	7435480	other characters that interact with it also have you know not just oh we're gonna do whatever
7435480	7439480	because you're the main character but I'd like to see other characters that are strictly like like
7439480	7445640	I hate to go back to Mass Effect 3 on this one but how are you had trainer or you had Steve you
7445640	7451760	know they were very firmly in their sexuality you know yet you had plenty of other characters
7451760	7458160	who didn't matter you know but my point is is that it needs to be recognized that you have people
7458160	7463800	coming from all sorts of walks and you know I really hate using the word preference because
7463800	7468160	it's something that's you're born with something that's ingrained and preference to me denotes a
7468160	7475840	choice you know so I've had a lot of people say identity yeah well but I look at identity
7475840	7483400	as yourself and not necessarily what you know organs you like to play with if that makes sense
7483400	7491960	well I like the church organ well you know what I hate organs so you'd like to play the piano
7492960	7510280	exactly anyway anyway now I'm a flautist cuz I flout it uh-huh but let's say they release I
7510280	7518360	don't know Halo 5 with a gay master or you know gay master chief or whatever like good I mean
7518360	7522520	this is what I would say no there's gonna be a lot of people out there that are gonna have
7522520	7526960	something to say it's not that I don't I don't hear me wrong on this I mean I would love something
7526960	7531720	like that but I also am a realist where there's a lot of people that would be like you know here
7531720	7536320	would be my problem with Master Chief as in the character that has existed through these games
7536320	7543560	there's a cannon established and I'm really fine with keeping a character cannon if say that there
7543560	7550320	was a much future Halo game much you know later on in the future and it's a new Master Chief and
7550320	7557280	he happened to light the cock fine I don't care that'd be great I don't really think people need
7557280	7564880	to be judged by you know what bits they like poking in their bits I don't think it should
7564880	7571160	matter and it's no one's fucking business yeah it really is no one's fucking business and I hate the
7571160	7577640	whole concept of closets and in and out of closets because who the fuck cares I don't care what parts
7577640	7582640	people like to play with well unfortunately there's too many people out there that do in
7582640	7593160	this people suck but my whole point is that I don't care if this X person has a wife or if she's got a
7593160	7597680	girlfriend on the side or if it's a big open marriage and there's a bunch of fucking going
7597680	7602040	on under what I don't give a shit don't give a shit and I would like to see more characters
7602040	7606320	or stuff like that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what their sexuality is it doesn't matter
7606320	7612240	who they fuck I'd like to see a whole lot of fucking going on to you would you for no but I
7612240	7616560	think it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter it should matter what their skin color is what
7616560	7622920	matters is that yes this creates who this person is we respect that these are the things that make
7622920	7630000	this person who they are but it should just be a oh okay that's cool that's who you are I don't
7630000	7634960	need I don't care you know if you know what I mean not that it's not a doesn't matter kind of thing
7634960	7641200	but that it's a that's who they are I respect it let's keep moving all right I'm going to some first
7641200	7646840	a question from our chat room from our buddy Shana Lenko Jamie would you consider male Shep being
7646840	7652720	straight cannon since until Mass Effect 3 he never was interested in men just women which would mean
7653160	7659400	they fundamentally changed me I to tell Jason I didn't say what bits with their bits I said what
7659400	7665320	bits in their bits oh because some people like it in the ass and some people like it in the badge
7665320	7672640	okay some people like it in other things I don't care because you all right but what about Shane's
7672640	7679920	question god damn it would you consider male Shep being being straight cannon since until Mass
7679960	7683960	Effect 3 he never was interested in men just women which would mean they fundamentally changed him
7683960	7691520	that's kind of an interesting one because I think that they realized that it shouldn't have been a
7691520	7697920	thing to begin with technically your Shep doesn't have to have sex at all or doesn't have to have
7697920	7703280	your set you can have can be asexual I could totally have an asexual Shepherd except Garris
7703280	7709200	but you know what I mean if you if Rex was available I'd totally go for that if you could
7709200	7713480	resist Garris's temptations you could have a completely asexual Shepherd I tried once Rob I
7713480	7720560	really did try and I tried to play a bro Shep so I could get Caden uh-huh and I couldn't play him
7720560	7728280	because no all right going to s to 100 Matt because I like this day I like what see I'll just said
7728280	7733600	put my bits in your bites as she went under Matt says progress takes time it took a long time for
7733600	7739000	there to be female protagonists and film movies books etc video games with the in-depth storylines
7739040	7743160	are somewhat of a new media but what does what does bother me is that given how much we've
7743160	7748760	progressed as a society that it would be quicker but again progress takes time and I actually kind
7748760	7753560	of agree with us Joe and under Matt I think I think we'll get there and I I still I think the
7753560	7757960	only way we're going to get there is if we keep hooping and hollering and talking about it and
7757960	7763760	having this dialogue that's how we're going to get there but I just wish it wasn't necessary I have
7763760	7769040	faith that we will get there I mean but look at look at what the indie gaming scene is already I
7769040	7774080	mean you have things like gone home you have you say was here pitching Dominique Pamplemousse which
7774080	7780000	you know to tackle some very some issues you you don't really see in games otherwise you know and
7780000	7788880	so on so it's starting in the indie scene for the record by the way to add another thing to what
7788960	7796160	Shane asked in my own headcanon as far as I could get away with playing a broshep he was totally
7796160	7803600	whacking off to Caden it's a picture totally whacking it because honestly I like the Caden
7803600	7808520	romance with a broshep a lot more than I do with a female Shepherd Tiger Claw in chat says what
7808520	7816440	would Shepherd be like if he or she was transgender the same be Shepherd Shepherd with bits that don't
7816480	7820760	quite fit of course in the future hopefully they would have much better corrective surgery for that
7820760	7828640	I I'm wondering if maybe Tiger Claw means there could be a because you know how some folks prefer
7828640	7836000	to use gender-neutral language like neither he nor she you you they or Z you know a different term
7836000	7840880	but that's not really possible in Mass Effect but I think I think we also have to look at you know
7840880	7846560	like say on Facebook there's what 50 different ways you can identify your gender it might be a
7846560	7851000	bit much for a video game to have 50 different branching options I mean you know yeah you do
7851000	7856720	have to kind of and not that I'm saying that we shouldn't you know have transgender representation
7856720	7862080	I absolutely think that would be a great thing but as the designer does kind of have to choose
7862080	7867320	at some point you know what are the possible branches for these characters and I think down
7867320	7872440	the line we're definitely especially as technology catches up but for the most part and this is
7872440	7877760	another sad thing too I think that while the developers were trying really trying to be more
7877760	7884720	open and basically throw more of a bone to you know I really think trying to push some limits
7884720	7891400	they're trying to be a lot more respectful of people in their lives we still have a very binary
7891640	7898560	viewpoint when it comes to gender you know just in general it's hard to change you know having
7898560	7904200	centuries of that beaten into your culture and then have it turn around it's still pretty you
7904200	7910920	know instinctive to say he or she instead of realize that that what you see may not be what
7910920	7919800	you get so it's another thing that just has to be tackled but I'm saying that for now it's to be
7919800	7926160	expected but I don't think it should be expected much later on if that makes sense sure all right
7926160	7929920	well I'm sure there's plenty more comments on this but I would have to direct those to our email bag
7929920	7934480	which is participate at orange laundry calm if you'd like to participate further in the discussion
7934480	7938320	but in the meantime in the interest of time we're going to tackle some other news stories so going
7938320	7945520	over to Loki all right so this is kind of interesting kind of all part of the I guess
7945520	7953240	evolution to the steam service but they're adding a virtual reality mode to I guess the latest steam
7953240	7961680	beta and what that's gonna do originally you would have to add a command line dash VR to enable it
7961680	7966600	but now they actually have a button for it and it's I guess meant for head mounted displays like
7966600	7972760	the oculus rift and so it has an ear face I think is from what I hear is similar to like the big
7972800	7980440	picture mode but you know it's meant for VR displays so it's interesting I don't know I
7980440	7984600	guess obviously it's something they're gonna need you know if they're gonna be you know forward
7984600	7994840	thinking so be kind of curious to see what that looks like I don't know hmm well I guess this is
7994840	8001000	just in time for this headset craze that's growing right yeah well if I remember correctly I think
8001240	8007240	the valve was kind of working with you know oculus maybe a little bit and you know just some of their
8007240	8013320	ideas with I remember I read a comment about like they're saying increasing like the frame rate or
8013320	8020280	something or doing something with the it was some sort of different method for displaying pixels
8020280	8028120	that allowed you to get a lot less motion blur and basically involve them displaying an image
8028120	8033680	and then flashing to black almost so that you don't have that kind of streaking effect with
8033680	8037960	you know pixels being left on the screen or something of course I'm just talking out of my
8037960	8042600	ass right now but that I remember reading but Bobby says that there in in chat he's saying
8042600	8049800	that all these news sites that are running this story are getting it from a reddit post and so he
8049800	8062080	actually links us to the reddit post how funny it's his own it's his own post so Bobby Bobby's
8062080	8069880	the one that posted this to read it and yeah I said FYI steam beta now has a VR mode in view
8069880	8075160	menu no command-line argument needed how fight good job Bobby why didn't you break that news
8075160	8079800	over a vog network like oh I'd you have to give that one to read it it's fine it's funny though
8079800	8086320	but they didn't source them and they never source read it but my god now half of half of what
8086320	8092840	Facebook has on it like comes from like BuzzFeed they owe read it a lot of money let's be real it's
8092840	8097640	ridiculous what sites run I mean shit sometimes they run stories based on like random people's
8097640	8104720	Twitter posts I just don't understand it sometimes that's hilarious yeah well let me let me read the
8104760	8110480	rest of what Bobby submitted to the or the reddit here which he submitted oculus is reddit it's
8110480	8114760	still just big picture mode on a curved screen but it works pretty well for what it is when I
8114760	8119280	first tried it it required me to do some monitor trickery with the rift on an extended monitor and
8119280	8123840	it was very flaky now it works with my normal setup and works immediately for those that never
8123840	8128560	tried it you'll need to opt into the steam client beta and have steam VR installed from tools I'm
8128560	8132960	also opted into the beta branch of steam VR but I'm not positive if that's required for the new
8132960	8141880	version or not so hmm good job body he's going viral and not even he says is it says the logo
8141880	8145440	is that's true you do have the little vog logo next to your submission there that's pretty cool
8145440	8151200	all right well moving on to some other news this this I am NOT getting from reddit but directly
8151200	8158320	from the website of the creators of the game this kind of goes back to one of those the dangers of
8158320	8164800	kickstarters stories again the game was called super action squad that at one point was super
8164800	8171080	retro squad and coming from the website here exploding rabbit.com it says quote super action
8171080	8175160	squad is too big of a project for us to handle right now so we're putting it on hold to make
8175160	8182280	some smaller games first we will resume development on SAS or sass once we are in a better position to
8182280	8187200	make it the reasons for this decision including why the original Kickstarter was a bad idea in
8187200	8192760	the first place are explained in detail below not going to read the entire post but I'll read some
8192760	8198480	of the bullet points here it boiled down to inexperience lack of understanding and scope
8198480	8204320	unrealistic estimate of cost being part of an ineffective team which I thought was a pretty
8204320	8211320	ballsy thing to write about unity is not a good tool for 2d platformers which I don't know if I
8211320	8214480	agree with that I don't yeah I don't either because it's kind of one of those things where
8214480	8219440	it's like well you shouldn't have kickstarted a game that you didn't know that you should have
8219440	8224440	tested the system first I don't know if I buy that either well here's the thing it's like I think a
8224440	8230560	lot of it his main excuse was like he's used to programming in flash and then going to unity was
8230560	8235920	completely different but I think aside from creating the engine I wouldn't think it would
8235920	8242160	be that difficult to be able to port everything else so obviously it is I mean just because you
8242160	8249040	I don't know they had but yeah I mean going from taking you know creating was it Super Mario
8249040	8254800	crossover and just basically grabbing pre-made levels and pre-made assets and all that stuff to
8254800	8260040	creating your own stuff which let's be honest it's just kind of slight changes to the sprites of you
8260040	8265440	know Super Mario crossover it's Super Mario crossover retail version minus all the Mario
8265440	8271960	and Nintendo stuff because we'll get sued well there's also a section in the post called what
8272400	8277440	do differently and I think this is interesting just a little quote from this section quote the
8277440	8282040	thing is though knowing what I know now I would have never launched a Kickstarter for the game
8282040	8286960	as my first project it makes little sense for a team with little to no experience that has never
8286960	8291920	worked together to try and make a big game it would be much better to focus on something small
8291920	8296680	and simple after getting experience releasing small projects we would be able to work our way
8296680	8302560	up to bigger ones so they you know and no real word on what's gonna happen all those people that
8302560	8306960	gave money although they are saying you know they kind of say a little bit vaguely in the post you
8306960	8312880	know if you were a big donator contact us we'll work something out we're not unreasonable but
8312880	8316200	they're talking about they can't really do refunds right now probably because the money's already
8316200	8321560	been spent you know people in the Kickstarter comments are pretty bad yeah I will of course
8321560	8326480	but this is this is part of the dangers of Kickstarter this is why I've always been very
8326480	8330760	nervous to get in on that craze and there's still really only a hand for you to think
8330760	8336880	him I can probably count on one hand the number of projects I've given to so all right anyway I
8336880	8342440	could probably also count on one hand the number of emails we received this week but that's okay
8342440	8345880	we love hearing from our listeners even when it's only a couple of them I know when they're
8345880	8351840	wrong you can you cannot you oh you can email us anytime you like participate at orange lounge
8351840	8359520	radio.com oh what's coming up tonight our saga nothing all right hello LR I've listened to the
8359520	8363880	to the shortened episode this weekend I must say I appreciate you guys taking the time to record
8363880	8368200	something during your busy schedule I very much enjoyed listening to it and I think it's great
8368200	8373280	that snake was mentioned as it truly is a classic game I also very much appreciate you guys
8373280	8379080	mentioning snake 360 and it's still in development as you read this sequel however there was a yyr
8379080	8383840	however there was one big inaccuracy in what was said during the episode that simply cannot let
8383840	8388280	pass Oh cinnamon toast crust cereal is a hundred percent naturally flavored and does not contain
8388280	8394760	any fake cinnamon yes big red gum and other things containing fake cinnamon aren't the truly gross
8394760	8399000	gum in general is gross anyway but but only a hundred percent cinnamon and sugar present every
8399000	8404880	bite along with 15 essential vitamins and minerals it's true that some people who shower name
8404880	8410840	mainly seen as me are fully entitled to their incorrect to keep the fuck but let it be placed
8410840	8414960	on record that cinnamon toast crunch cereal is officially yummy and delicious keeping it real
8414960	8420560	yyr and you know what I still think it tastes like balls so I agree with the statement until
8420560	8424240	you put it in milk and then it just kind of dissolves and it just because yeah I think
8424240	8428200	it's the in milk part that really just made it very much with cinnamon and milk I mean it's
8428200	8432960	here's what I do a cinnamon toast I don't eat any cereal with milk I'm weird I I have one cup
8432960	8438740	like a giant cup we're talking like 40 ounce cup full of cinnamon toast crunch a second cup with
8438740	8444280	milk you just eat them separate it's still good but it's a way better than if it was soaking in
8444280	8449720	milk yyr I would you know I don't do this very often on the show but I would like to apologize
8449720	8455920	for dark soccer's behavior unless I would like you to sit and spin and golden grams golden
8456400	8464160	shit it is shit it is not shit it is the shit I I will I will not allow the woman to comment
8464160	8470720	on breakfast cereal again you know what okay but mind you mind you what did I say my favorite
8470720	8476600	breakfast cereals were as a child you liked great great night like weird total and crackling oat
8476600	8482960	bran but at least you pooped regularly I did poop regularly okay granted okay there were two kids
8483280	8490520	we know she's not full of shit see okay and by the way there were two shut up oh my god
8490520	8500600	yeah Rob but there were two kids cereals that I did like one was Apple Jack's which tasted
8500600	8505920	nothing like fucking apples Apple Jack's is kind of dumb I don't like it oh god you're a horrible
8505920	8510480	person who would eat like kicks I never understood that it's like eating packing peanuts I mean it's
8510520	8515680	seriously gross kicks is gross but what I'll agree with you there honeycomb fuck that shit
8515680	8522480	all right the other one was I really liked Rice Krispies I felt when they made Rice Krispies
8522480	8528920	treats a cereal okay but I would have to eat my Rice Krispies like super fast because I hated
8528920	8535800	that soggy shit at the bottom oh my god why are we talking about fucking sir I'm hungry now thanks
8535800	8542440	Rob I'm hungry you know what I saw at the store I couldn't free pizza today and it was great we

8546320	8551360	change right and one of the one of the things we were looking at getting was you know Ritz crackers
8551360	8557560	or one of my favorite snacks right do you know they have bacon flavored Ritz cracker what it's
8557560	8565360	probably not very good you know what I found huh when I was at a total wine looking for I was going

8923160	8928600	guess not well we'll talk to Exeter for about you know ass bleaching and stuff like that but it'd
8928600	8942400	be like be jazzled you don't say and this is your first time listening to orange does radio I'm
8942400	8947960	fucking sorry I'm sorry that you've had to put up with this shit it is so good for Loki to be back
8947960	8954480	in the studio I feel like this is I mean yes Skype works but it doesn't work the same I'm just saying
8954480	8961400	all right anyhow getting back into some gaming news Loki so speaking about Kickstarter and how
8961400	8971240	it's a terrible idea to back game projects you you Suzuki is researching the idea but not yet
8971240	8977160	decided if he's going to kickstart Shenmue 3 which I can tell you right now if that were to
8977160	8984400	be put on the Kickstarter would probably be approved immediately so research a little quicker
8984400	8991720	but yeah so I don't know that would be kind of neat to see him put you know Shenmue 3 on there
8991720	8998040	does he own the rights to that or is it still Sega I I don't know I think the license yeah I thought
8998040	9002720	we had a story just a couple that yeah we just had a story a couple weeks ago the the licensing
9002720	9012240	expired the trademark I don't know that so it is open season now all right moving on to one more
9012240	9016760	story about a game a lot of people are looking forward to in fact if this game doesn't show up
9016760	9023040	at e3 this year I don't know what Nintendo's gonna do it will be cut bitches III think so but it has
9023040	9031800	to do with the Wii U version version the Wii U version in order to save this system I'm gonna
9031800	9040680	need to sacrifice three virgins all right now the Wii U version of the Legend of Zelda and the
9040680	9046160	producer eg Anuma has made some interesting comments about the Wii U version of the Legend
9046160	9053000	of Zelda and that could be that there may be a top-down view in these future Zelda games because
9053000	9057680	you know top-down was the way the old Zelda game with at least the very first Zelda game was then
9057680	9062240	of course linked to the past and you know link between worlds is kind of brought that back a
9062240	9068920	little bit but we haven't I mean the console ones involved in 3d ever since you know ocarina so could
9068920	9074800	the top-down view return and let's see the official Nintendo magazine had an interview and the
9074800	9079120	question the interviewer asked what did you learn from making this game can you use any of these
9079120	9084400	ideas in future titles for example the merge with walls ability and is amazing and it would be a
9084400	9089600	shame if it was never used again and he says I think the top-down view made the ability to enter
9089600	9094560	the wall really interesting also in this game I feel we found a new direction in regards to the
9094560	9099600	potential use of the good old top-down view for Zelda it's the kind of point we will take in good
9099600	9104400	consideration when thinking about the next Zelda game I think people might be reading into that
9104400	9109440	quote a little too much but when you consider that there's a second screen I could definitely
9109440	9114880	see some sort of like maybe like top-down map view in addition to what you're seeing on the screen I
9114880	9120640	think would be a very logical extension or dungeon maps certainly on your or your Wii U screen I
9120640	9127160	think there's certainly potential for top-down things to come into that that map or in the the
9127800	9136120	second screen if nothing else so all right my game guru and Chad at live dot vog network
9136120	9142360	dot-com says oh god they're making a new four swords game aren't they hey you never know you
9142360	9147120	never know what you're pretty popular though weren't they yeah yeah I think so they're giving
9147120	9151760	it away for free on 3ds for a little bit twice oh my god I know we had another unicorn in chat
9151760	9157920	mmm Zuck is actually in chat he's in chat good times live that you should be in chat to live
9157920	9162320	dot vog network yeah everyone why aren't you there all right because they're listening during the
9162320	9166360	week while they're at work or on their commute or what have you which is fine but you know come join

9192920	9200080	can also go to our Twitter as well at twitter.com slash olr Loki not really much there's a rumor
9200080	9205800	that Rainbow Six Patriots isn't redesigned from the ground up three times so that doesn't mean
9205800	9213720	it's coming out anytime soon that I don't really have it's slow slow news week which is weird
9213720	9217560	because game developers conference was this week but then again that means that's that's because
9217560	9223320	you know again it's not a news conference so nobody's developing right now cuz they're all
9223320	9228800	at the conference not all of them I know seriously like one of the shows I watch cooking with unity
9228800	9234320	they've been off this week because he's at gay only I was about to like where are you guys you'd
9234320	9237320	be off a game developers conference if you give you do anyway we have a call hi you're on orange
9237320	9244920	launch radio who's this it is jammer Jay you guys hear me yeah hey jammer Jay what's up but nothing
9244920	9249800	nothing much I just actually I'm listening to the song I'm the show live it's been quite a
9249800	9257800	while listening to it live well welcome back thanks for being here hello well the darks occur
9257800	9262320	it's like what you want to share with our listeners tonight do you have a question or a statement or
9262320	9268040	what oh yeah it was like so here's a question I've been going over it cuz this happened to me
9268040	9273160	the other week so what happens when your backlog like you have something that's on your backlog
9273160	9279880	like basically I had like Final Fantasy x2 it was all my backlog for these two so long that they
9279880	9286320	didn't HD they did each HD remake I still haven't got to it but it's been like 14 years so when you
9286320	9291400	have all these games in your backlog does it just become like a collection or a vault it's like yeah
9291400	9298840	hi yeah I I have had games and I hate to admit this cuz I'm so gonna get judged for it I have
9298840	9306000	games that I bought the day they came out and they're still sealed because that's how bad my
9306000	9310760	gamer a DD is okay so that's what it takes I have the same thing too it's like I have games still
9310760	9316080	shrink wrapped and they're like from previous like there's stuff on ps2 that I think I would
9316080	9322280	get to one day but that one day hasn't happened like in ten years it's like wow yeah no you're
9322280	9326440	not alone I can tell you that I do it too I don't know if any of our chatters want to admit to that
9326440	9331080	as well over at live that vog network calm but dark soccer you're the most ultimate collector
9331080	9336120	of them all do you have games that you like you played once or like you've like never even played
9336120	9341960	but you just like hey I gotta have this remember the games I have that are still in shrink wrap so
9341960	9348680	yes yes do you remember any up top of your head um I don't think I've opened my copy of death
9348680	9358720	smiles and I have the special edition um feel my Saturn RPGs a couple PlayStation games I don't
9358720	9363600	actually I think that one of my copies of Space Channel five part two is still shrink wrapped
9363600	9371360	because I had the Japanese one and I haven't played my copy of Bayonetta yet so you're not
9371400	9378680	alone jammer Jay there's plenty of us that have the same problem now let me ask you this are you
9378680	9383600	gonna finally check out tend to and are you gonna check out your original PlayStation 2 version or
9383600	9389960	if you just said I forget it at this point I'll just play the the new HD remake I I think I'm
9389960	9395960	just gonna play the new HD remake because my actual x2 is like the international version but
9395960	9400640	I never got past the intro to see if the rest of the game was in English or not I think I do have
9400640	9414200	another x2 copy of 10 to Jamie bonkers over here it's not to give up too much information I am one
9414200	9420440	of dark sikora's now I'm one of her co-workers in the land of cubicles so land of cubes low cat in
9420440	9429920	the house yeah okay does it drive you then crazy when people say I asked I don't think if I could
9429920	9434760	I I hear people say it but that's not what it is and people drive me crazy when they do anything
9434760	9441520	X when it's supposed to be 10 I've gotten like and I blame Bobby for this now actually because
9441520	9449400	of this whole gif thing but I still call it gif because I can pronounce things properly yes but
9449400	9455640	now I hit stun says Mega Man x2 was a great game that one actually is an X because that's a legit
9455640	9461480	X yeah because it's a prototype yeah but like what gets nevermind I'm just not gonna say anything
9461480	9466840	else you almost had her going all right the jammer Jay is there anything else you want to share

9576840	9581360	show's going on the harder time I'm having with my voice so I may have to call it a little a little
9581360	9586040	earlier tonight but we'll see here moving on let's go to another call because it is lighting up here
9586040	9591880	hi you're on orange launch radio who's this yeah this is raging leader no if it isn't our newest
9591880	9599840	intern intern rage inator how you liking the new joke book loving it what's up buddy uh just two
9599840	9605520	questions but I'm willing to bet that the answers are gonna be kind of long-winded if my guess is
9605520	9615840	right um you know the first one have you ever been have you ever known you know people not to
9615840	9625680	basically we're like a better work petition three companies to get certain games onto steam and be
9625680	9635840	successful about it oh to get a game on steam and be successful about it um not not like green light
9635840	9643160	word you know where copies is basically say hey we're thinking about bring this game I would you
9643160	9650960	buy it whereas we we the consumer folks down well I think are you're talking probably about like
9650960	9654680	these Sega games they have a bunch of positions going on try to get a bunch of different Sega
9654720	9662320	games ported the PC and I think on steam but I think for most companies nowadays that aside
9662320	9669200	from EA but they probably want their game on steam and so it's not really an issue of oh I have to
9669200	9676320	convince you to put your already you know available PC game on steam usually they want to be on steam
9676320	9682680	with the exceptions of you know some of them are there on EA's origin service or you know like in
9682680	9686560	the case of like Mojang and stuff that has you know he's doing well enough by himself he doesn't
9686560	9694520	need steam oh all right yeah you know the reason I bring it up is because I was commenting to dr.
9694520	9700640	her the other day you know speech at that it's kind of a crying shame that aside from metal
9700640	9707320	gelt metal slug three there's not really anything by SNK on service so I thought there was a king of
9707320	9713320	fighters one of the recent king of fighters game oh oh yeah you're absolutely right you're
9713320	9717920	absolutely right I completely forgot about that that's all right it's a big store it's easy to
9717920	9725560	get lost in yeah really now as far as my second question you know it goes it's probably more
9725560	9734640	geared towards a Loki because he's more of the builder expert in some group now when you were
9734640	9741640	building your cabinets you know be your main campus or what have you what god you know like
9741640	9752120	joysticks and monitors aside what kind of materials did you use did you use like parker board or well
9752120	9758760	it's mainly MDF for it I mean depends on the size you know I my first main cabinet which was
9758800	9765680	an ultimate arcade to cabinet it was made with three quarters at MDF it was actually supposed
9765680	9773880	to have been I think 5 8 or something which made it a lot heavier than it needed to be so
9773880	9783320	is is basically MDF but I mean I don't know it all depends on how you're trying to you know what
9783320	9787960	you're doing with it like if you're painting it or if you're gonna you know put a laminate on it
9787960	9795480	or you know whatever but usually they're out of MDF or some sort of plywood just because you know
9795480	9802040	MDF does tend to be a little bit weak sometimes especially if you have really heavy the other
9802040	9807040	thing too is like you know if I were to go back and do it again I wouldn't have done like kind of
9807040	9812440	a classic arcade cabinet I would have wanted it more like you know the view Lex cabinets and stuff
9812440	9818640	where it's just control panel and HDTV because honestly trying to get stuff you know running on
9818640	9823440	low enough resolution though you know work with a TV or you know a monitor or something like that
9823440	9827800	it's just a pain in the ass it's a lot easier just to have a nice HD screen because then you can do a
9827800	9833680	lot more with it you can you play indie games on it or whatever and you know may not be as classic
9833680	9838600	as you you know you have it a main cabinet but it's a hell a lot cheaper and probably a hell a
9838640	9844600	lot easier to make I want to say I spent three grand on that first cabinet really wish I hadn't
9844600	9850240	built it yeah honestly no I've been kind of sort of toying with the idea of building y'all a
9850240	9858120	candidate but it you know if I do build ones could be like big the basic shell of the cabinet they
9858120	9866480	would look like basically like y'all your classic arcade candidate from the 80s or early 90s yeah
9866480	9873680	probably make it out so I kind of went for lemon on the sides and what that in for like a martyr I
9873680	9883840	would probably use like a flat screen LCD monitor or TV yeah off the shelf Bob you know fight stick
9883840	9891800	and then just so I don't like I get my computer to overheat because lack of circulation ever off
9891800	9899880	the side yeah no that way I can't really skip y'all play our key game especially if I were
9899880	9904880	played like something like Street Fighter 4 or what have you well the other thing you can do
9904880	9909880	too is actually just get an old arcade cabinet and just convert that over it might even be cheaper
9909880	9914560	and it's already been built up nice and there's a lot of people on you know not even necessarily
9914560	9918640	eBay bond Craigslist they're willing to get rid of those things for like a hundred bucks or less
9918640	9922480	or even you know a couple hundred dollars to pay on the condition dark soccer you guys had like a
9922480	9926080	pole position machine in your house at one point it was like a converted thing like that right we
9926080	9930800	did yeah we um made our yeah our main was built out of the pole position which for a while doubled
9930800	9936720	as Shermie's house that's awesome an arcade cabinet is a cat house it's actually kind of
9936720	9941760	because okay the stand-up one had the pedal so sure me would just walk in with where we had no
9941760	9948640	pedal yeah and that was just her house it's like I live in an arcade cabinet now you go Shermie
9948640	9953440	that is amazing all right and the rage inator by the way since we see him on video he's petting
9953440	9963080	his kitty right now is in the background there hi Anakin all right oh he looked all right
9963080	9967320	rage nader I'm gonna let you go buddy so we can wrap up the show but thanks for the call
9967320	9973960	yeah take care of you too bye I am actually gonna close up the Skype line I'm sorry I didn't end up
9973960	9978640	taking more calls tonight but I do kind of need to take a little break because I'm finding the
9978640	9983200	longer we're going on I'm like more sinus pressure that's not good I think it's time for pills so I
9983200	9988000	want to quickly shout out some of these tweets we got here at twitter.com slash olr by the way
9988000	9991320	if you didn't get through and you do have something to say please do email us we'd love to hear from
9991320	9995120	you I mean dark soccer only had like two emails to read tonight and one of them was like a line
9995160	10005440	long so give her work next week y'all participate whatever what let it go stop I'm gonna throw this
10005440	10010160	cell phone at you I don't even care all right just a few tweets here that I want to read a
10010160	10016480	few stories that were submitted s2100 Matt sent us a tweet about the ET 2600 game landfill site
10016480	10022680	dig documentary is put on hold by New Mexico authorities really oh the Popo is shutting it
10022680	10028480	down I guess they didn't like the idea of people going out there digging it all up hmm I think we
10028480	10033320	referenced this early in the show but Tiger Claw says this link to a story about how Nintendo has
10033320	10040840	50 unity games on their way to Wii U but can they can they sell well alongside Mario I mean is the
10040840	10045760	question absolutely can I think that I think they can too because what I buy Mario what else you're
10045760	10050520	gonna buy well well but I hear the games are doing really well on Wii U too because of the fact that
10050560	10055280	they don't get lost in the marketplace like they kind of do on the other systems so I mean there
10055280	10064040	is that and lastly Tiger Claw says this is a link Microsoft saying DirectX 12 will improve Xbox one
10064040	10071120	performance um that's that's not too surprising I mean you know sometimes these firmware updates
10071120	10075400	and things will help the systems run better right and so when we're talking about something like
10075400	10080360	DirectX which is basically you know Xbox that whole name Xbox comes from DirectX something
10081240	10086080	I mean that's no surprise that should help things but wouldn't that be akin to like a graphics
10086080	10090840	driver update or something like it might it might make a few things better here and there but it's
10090840	10094840	not gonna like radically change your experience um it's actually supposed to improve frame rate
10094840	10102240	is better and you know they're talking about fours of five and stuff and saying it was like 60 I
10102240	10106640	thought fours of five is already 60 frames per second but I guess they're talking about how you
10106640	10111200	know they use it to improve fours of fives performance and stuff and how it's supposed to
10111200	10116320	have a lot less overhead so you know a lot less processing power is required to do the same stuff
10116320	10122360	so that will help because you know a lot of these you know Xbox one games are having trouble hitting
10122360	10127520	1080p I mean it's a lot of the 720 you know upscale and they're having trouble hitting 60
10127520	10133560	frames per second so anything can help and hopefully DirectX you know 12 will get you
10133560	10139160	where it needs to be on par with like the PlayStation 4 all right sounds good well that
10139160	10144600	is going to wrap up another edition of orange lounge radio our first from the brand new studio
10144600	10150680	and seven and hopefully first of many many more episodes to come as we lead into probably our
