7000	14000	Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week, one beta ends as another one begins as Valve releases family sharing as the Steam Music Beta begins.
19000	24000	News from South Park and Stick of Truth continues with outrage from policy makers and gamers alike over censorship in much of the world.
24000	27000	We'll take your comments on these events on the show wherever Gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 542 of our show for this March the 2nd of 2014.
45000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts and over the next few hours we'll be talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
52000	54000	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Hi.
55000	56000	How you doing?
56000	58000	I'm happy.
58000	62000	You're happy? Good. That's good. If you're happy and you know what, clap your hands.
62000	64000	May I have a little more please?
64000	66000	Yes. Just as long as you're going to be okay to drive.
66000	68000	This is me.
68000	73000	We decided to crack open a bottle of wine here in the studio so you know, that's how things go.
73000	76000	That's how we roll here at OLR. But drink responsibly kids.
76000	77000	Yes.
77000	78000	It's a three hour show so we've got a lot of time.
78000	80000	I just made the heart fingers at Rob.
81000	87000	Alright, and joining us via the Skype line, say hello everybody to Loki Oler. How you doing Loki?
87000	89000	I'm doing good.
89000	91000	Good, good. What's new?
91000	93000	Not much.
93000	94000	Yeah?
94000	96000	Just put in a cat door today.
96000	97000	Put in a what?
97000	98000	A cat door.
98000	103000	A cat door. Oh, you're being quite homely while you're around. Being the man of the house.
103000	110000	Yeah, I guess. So, yeah. Because the cat was annoying me and kept whining at the door.
110000	115000	And sure enough, I put the door in, she didn't give a shit. She's like not even bothering with the door anymore.
115000	121000	So you should have made the cat door so the cat can go out but the cat can't get back in.
121000	126000	Actually, funny you should say that, there's actually an option on there to do that.
126000	131000	Or you can have her come in only. You can lock it one way so it's kind of funny.
131000	135000	Awesome. Well, there you go. Well, I do want to say hi to everybody.
135000	141000	And I try to do this once in a while every few months or so but sort of reintroduce ourselves.
141000	144000	So if it is your first time listening to this show, welcome.
144000	148000	And just a quick reintroduction, my name is Rob, that's Jamie.
148000	151000	And joining us on the Skype line tonight is Loki, or Matt.
151000	157000	And he's on the Skype line because him and Mrs. Loki just had a baby about, where are we at now?
157000	160000	Over a month ago now at this point, right? Or just about a month ago?
160000	162000	It's like six weeks.
162000	165000	Wow, time flies. But he's still on baby leave.
165000	171000	Usually we're all in the same studio but obviously we want Loki to take time while the wife is healing and all that stuff.
171000	178000	So usually though we're all in the same room and about ten years ago we all met at a local arcade playing a music-based video game.
178000	181000	Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, those types of things.
181000	188000	We would meet up once a week or so at the arcade just like you would with a fighting game community or racing game community.
188000	195000	And afterwards we go to the diner across the street, sit around the table, and just talk about gaming because we're all gaming nerds.
195000	198000	So here we are 12 years later, we're doing that same thing virtually.
198000	204000	And thanks to the internet we have the world's biggest diner table via our Skype line, our Twitter, and the chat room.
204000	207000	Live.vognetwork.com.
207000	209000	Because after all we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
209000	215000	We are live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern every Sunday right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network.
215000	217000	vognetwork.com.
217000	219000	By the way Rob, since someone complained.
219000	221000	Sup bitches.
221000	224000	Someone complained that you weren't using your usual tagline.
224000	226000	It's not really my usual, I've done it twice.
226000	228000	Well you said a couple weeks ago it was going to be your new tagline.
228000	230000	Okay now it's my, okay, sup bitches.
230000	232000	Stop disappointing the people out there.
232000	234000	Rob, you know what?
234000	236000	Stop being a false icon.
236000	238000	I reject that statement.
238000	240000	Thank you guys so much.
240000	245000	Whether you're listening to us on the podcast feed or via Stitcher or whatever, or listening to us live.
245000	250000	We're up against, you know, the Oscars as being a live Sunday night show.
250000	254000	We typically seem to go up against like every big American thing.
254000	260000	You know, every award show, every Super Bowl, sports-a-thon thing seems to be on a Sunday night.
260000	262000	But you guys are loyal listeners, you're here with us.
262000	267000	So hoping we can include you guys as much as possible as we go through tonight's show.
267000	270000	Let's talk about our kickoff topic real quick.
270000	276000	Since the Oscars are going on after all, I mean I'm going to acknowledge that it's a big movie night.
276000	280000	Although I'm going to be honest, I didn't see a single one of the movies nominated.
280000	282000	I saw maybe like three movies last year.
282000	283000	What was nominated?
283000	284000	I've just become that.
284000	289000	I don't know, everybody's talking about Gravity and 12 Years a Slave is the other one.
289000	293000	And American Hustle, which I should have seen because I do love Jennifer Lawrence.
293000	294000	She's perfect.
294000	297000	I am pissed off though that Saving Mr. Banks didn't show up.
297000	298000	Because it was really good.
298000	299000	I don't even know what that is.
299000	300000	Is that the Disney one?
300000	301000	That was the Disney one.
301000	302000	Okay, I didn't see that.
302000	306000	Tom Hanks should have freaking won everything for being Walt Disney, sorry.
306000	309000	I used to watch the Oscars every year, then I got this show.
309000	312000	Oh well, it's fine. I prefer doing this.
312000	314000	So the Oscars are the Oscars.
314000	321000	But it does beg the question, since we are a video game show, this is usually the time of year where we talk about video game movies.
321000	327000	And the question I want to ask everybody is, you know, and this goes to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
327000	338000	What's it going to take, or is it ever going to happen, where a movie based on a video game can actually be a contender for an Oscar?
338000	342000	Because let's be real, most of the video game movies they've put out have been stinkers.
342000	345000	There's only been a few good ones, passable ones.
345000	348000	The original Mortal Kombat I think most people agree, it wasn't bad.
348000	352000	Resident Evil, depending on what you're into, seems like most people.
352000	354000	And they're not quite game canon anyway.
354000	355000	Yeah, they're really not.
355000	357000	First Silent Hill, I really like that.
357000	359000	I didn't even mind the second one.
359000	361000	It wasn't really for everybody.
361000	366000	But let's be real, that game was never going to get, it's not really an Oscar flick, it's a popcorn flick.
366000	372000	But we do see that the caliber of writing in some games these days is really, really good.
372000	378000	Of course, I would be a bad fan boy if I didn't throw out the fact that Mass Effect has some really great writing.
378000	384000	If we kind of overlook that ending thing with number three, I mean they did go back and fix it and then the Citadel DLC.
384000	386000	Clituring some of the characterizations.
386000	390000	Yeah, so we'll overlook the imperfections and say, you know, overall Mass Effect had some great writing.
390000	392000	And who goes to bed in their armor, really?
392000	395000	A lot of people loving Dragon Age as well.
395000	400000	Not to put all the focus on BioWare, because certainly tons of people are really enjoying The Last of Us.
400000	404000	Even Beyond Two Souls, you know, is kind of like a playable type of game.
404000	407000	Or is it a playable type of movie that is a game.
408000	414000	So my question is, do we think we'll ever see the type of movie that actually gets nominated for Oscars?
414000	418000	I'm not talking about just necessarily like special effects Oscars, that's one thing.
418000	423000	I'm talking about like writing, heaven forbid acting, or even a picture nomination.
423000	428000	Could we ever get that type of caliber movie out of a video game?
428000	434000	Or are movies based on video games forever pigeonholed into, well they're gonna suck.
435000	443000	I think it would really just take having the right director behind it, and having the right people in it.
443000	446000	And I think that would turn a lot of it around.
446000	450000	Because I mean, if you actually, going back to the Silent Hill one.
450000	455000	Despite, you know, it being really following more of the game formula with the movie.
455000	458000	The acting in it was really freaking top notch.
458000	460000	It really was good. I mean look who was in it.
460000	469000	Had some of the best, you know, actors, especially, what's her face, that played the big bad lady.
469000	473000	Not that played Dahlia, but played Alice Krieg the bored queen.
473000	477000	Oh my god I love her. She is perfectly creepy.
477000	481000	I wanted all of those performances to be nominated because they were really good.
481000	485000	Well I think they got nominated in like science fiction awards and things that are a little more niche.
485000	487000	So we can't say that the movie was completely ignored.
487000	489000	But obviously there were a lot of people that didn't like the movie.
490000	493000	Well I understand. Some of it was a little cheesy.
493000	495000	The little girl was a little bit cheesy.
495000	498000	Silent Hill! Silent Hill!
498000	500000	Okay that part was...
500000	503000	It had its imperfections.
503000	505000	But the rest of it was awesome.
505000	507000	Loki, what do you think?
507000	514000	The only chance I think that they have is like, you know, maybe if that Minecraft movie comes out later on.
514000	518000	Because it's being done by like, was it the guys that did the Lego movie?
518000	521000	I think that could win like the best animated movie or something.
521000	525000	But I don't know.
525000	530000	A lot of the people that bring on video game properties, they don't really take it seriously.
530000	537000	So I just, I don't know if you would really see like Oscar winning performances out of that stuff.
537000	542000	Let's go over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and some of the responses.
542000	546000	First we have some other people naming movies that really weren't bad that were based on video games.
546000	550000	AkumaJP says, the first Tomb Raider movie, which actually might have gotten...
550000	553000	Somebody would have to look that up, but I think it might have gotten Oscar nods,
553000	555000	but in like the special effects type of categories.
555000	557000	Like, you know, Angelina Jolie wasn't nominated.
557000	561000	Neither was her leg.
561000	564000	Dungeonbuster says, Prince of Persia wasn't too bad either.
564000	567000	I forgot about that one. I think that's the problem.
567000	571000	Raginator brings up Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.
571000	573000	And some other comments on this topic.
574000	577000	A good video game movie doesn't take the source material as gospel.
577000	580000	They need to tweak it to work as an actual movie.
580000	585000	And we do see, I mean it's not like there isn't movies based on other material.
585000	588000	They have a whole category at the Oscars for that.
588000	594000	Because they have the best screenplay original and best screenplay based on some type of source.
594000	596000	And almost always it's a book.
596000	599000	Either a memoir or a fiction book or what have you.
599000	602000	Once in a while it might even be like a newspaper article.
602000	604000	You know, there might be some other type of inspiration.
604000	612000	But it's not like there isn't a category where a, putting my fanboy hat on, Mass Effect movie couldn't fit into.
612000	616000	But the question is, are we ever going to see something of that caliber? I don't know.
616000	622000	Brad from Pod Culture suggests Bioshock would be a great candidate, I think, for that type of movie.
622000	629000	Even though I'm not into fandom, I think that of all of them, Assassin's Creed II would actually make a good story.
629000	636000	Because it would be historical fiction having to deal with some of the most fucked up politics ever in Renaissance Europe.
636000	641000	Speaking of fandoms, I've always been surprised you're not really into Bioshock.
641000	644000	Like I know you downloaded games, checked them out, but I'm kind of surprised.
644000	647000	I haven't had time to, I started Infinite, remember, right before I started.
647000	649000	And I know you're a big fan of like art direction in games.
649000	654000	And like when I think of games with like A plus art direction, Bioshock Infinite's like up there.
654000	656000	I have the game. I've started playing it.
656000	659000	It's just, you know, with me working at, you know, Locat.
659000	660000	I understand.
660000	662000	I haven't been able to...
662000	663000	I understand.
663000	666000	Degenerate Johnny in chat is placing his bets.
666000	675000	Degenerate Johnny says, the first video game movie that will win an Oscar will be the Warcraft movie because Blizzard never settles less than the best.
675000	679000	I could definitely see Warcraft, I mean, depending on where they're going with it.
679000	684000	I could see Warcraft be one of those special effects, those types of contenders.
685000	687000	Will the writing be good?
687000	689000	There's a lot riding on that movie, isn't there?
689000	691000	We'll see. We will sure see.
691000	695000	I would actually see a movie based off of Assassin's Creed 2.
695000	701000	Just because seeing those Medicis killing each other and busy being Pope, that would be awesome.
701000	705000	Ragenator brings up, if you keep Ue Bull the fuck away from the movies.
705000	709000	You know, I kind of feel like he's a joke that died out several years ago.
709000	712000	I mean, isn't, like, has he been allowed to make a movie?
712000	714000	Loki, you've followed him more than any of us.
714000	719000	Not that you should be proud of that, but has he made any movies lately?
719000	726000	I think he has some new movie coming out soon, but he hasn't really made a whole ton of stuff lately.
726000	733000	I think he's been trying to do his own properties, and he even made, like, was it Tunnel Rats that he wanted to spin off into a game?
733000	736000	I think that happened, but no one cared.
736000	739000	He should make Showgirls 2, honestly.
739000	742000	No. You do not want him touching our beloved Showgirls.
742000	748000	I think he's doing another, remember, the last thing he did was try to kickstart another Postal movie.
748000	749000	He went to Kickstarter?
749000	751000	Yeah, he went to Kickstarter.
751000	752000	People gave that man money?
752000	756000	No, I don't think it, it failed, so he didn't.
756000	759000	What a shock. What a shock.
759000	765000	Didn't he do, now, there was a Dungeon Siege movie with Burt Reynolds in it, am I correct?
765000	768000	There was several Dungeon Siege movies.
768000	771000	Wait, no, I'm sorry, I'm not thinking Dungeon Siege.
771000	777000	There was several, what was the vampire one that he used to do a lot of?
777000	781000	Blood Rain. Several Blood Rain movies.
781000	783000	They were all terrible.
783000	791000	I think we're all kind of over him, and certainly he's the guy that needs to stop giving video game movies a bad name because he's ruining it for all of us.
791000	795000	They had a Blood Rain movie that was a spaghetti western with zombies in it.
795000	797000	What the hell?
797000	802000	I'm sorry, last good zombie movie was that one that I still have of yours?
802000	804000	28 Days Later, although those weren't really zombies?
804000	805000	No, Wild Zero.
805000	807000	Oh, okay.
807000	808000	I need to give that back to you.
808000	816000	Anyway, so we'll see, so some of the chatters predicting Warcraft, my fandom predicts Mass Effect if they could ever make a movie out of that.
816000	822000	Any predictions on what video game would make great source material for an Academy Award winning movie?
822000	829000	I would have a really hard time watching a Mass Effect movie because you know they put some dude, I can't, my head cannon doesn't accept a male Shepard.
829000	836000	I really think they could convince people better that FemShep works than male Shep.
836000	843000	I stan male Shep obviously because of some of the choices I made in the game, but I would accept FemShep in the movie.
843000	844000	Heck yeah.
845000	854000	Especially if they got somebody like, I don't know why but I just keep thinking, I think this is a really easy choice so I apologize to the FemShep fans out there, but for some reason I really picture Scarlett Johansson.
854000	856000	Just because she kicks so much ass as Black Widow.
856000	858000	Yeah, I can see that.
860000	863000	She'd have to, I think, work out a bit more.
863000	864000	Sure.
864000	871000	I mean seriously, you know I actually installed a mod for my Mass Effect 3 that's called the Buff FemShep mod.
871000	876000	That actually makes her look less way fish and more like a career soldier.
876000	878000	It's actually really cool.
878000	887000	As far as like a game, I could see, if you were going to do something animated, I would say Journey.
887000	889000	Oooh.
889000	894000	Have you ever seen any of those different animations where there's no dialogue, it's all set to music?
894000	895000	Oooh.
895000	898000	Or for example like the interstellar 5555.
898000	902000	So you're kind of almost going with a short film almost.
902000	911000	You know what's funny is I was going to make a joke here because Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com suggests Gone Home as a movie and I was going to joke, oh that would be a short film wouldn't it?
911000	913000	Because the game wasn't really that long.
913000	917000	But, you know, actually that's the type of medium that really could work.
917000	919000	It's not like, it's unheard of.
919000	925000	Mortal Kombat now exists in short films on YouTube, the little episodic things they're doing.
925000	929000	But I think that Journey would make like a really neat art film.
929000	934000	You know, I mean it's an art game if you want to be...
934000	938000	And Blackwolf does remind us, Journey's soundtrack already ran a Grammy.
938000	942000	So, it's already on its way to that.
942000	947000	Anyway, alright, we could sit here and fan wank about movies and video games and all this for a very long time.
947000	951000	But we want to get into the gaming news, but we can't get there until we talk about...
951000	954000	Wank Rob, wank as far as the eye can see.
954000	960000	We can't get there to gaming news until we talk about our frame of references and that's why we always do at the top of the show.
960000	964000	How was your gaming week and what were the video games that you were playing this week?
964000	965000	Dark Sakura.
965000	969000	This is actually the first time I've been influenced by a fanfic.
969000	973000	But I started playing Dragon Age 2 again so I could play a mage.
973000	975000	I love your shirt.
975000	979000	Actually, my shirt, since, thank you for...
979000	981000	My shirt actually says Realm Maintenance.
981000	987000	It's actually another podcast that's out there and the host of Realm Maintenance, Ro, was kind enough to give me this shirt at BlizzCon.
987000	994000	So, shout out to Ro and his fantastic podcast, Realm Maintenance, which is great in the Warcraft podcast community.
994000	998000	I really wish we had something like it in the general gaming community. Anyhow, sorry, go ahead.
998000	1004000	Well, I did start Dragon Age 2 again, except I'm not too happy with how my Hawk looks.
1004000	1008000	So I'm going to redo her because I have a crap ton of mods.
1008000	1012000	And unfortunately, some of the mods that I put in made Aveline's face turn black.
1012000	1017000	So I ended up installing this mod that makes Aveline look like the default Hawk, except blonde or something.
1017000	1020000	So I was like, okay, whatever, I can deal with Aveline being pretty.
1020000	1029000	But I started Dragon Age 2 again, playing some more Mass Effect 3, just because I want to...
1029000	1035000	I put my retagon game on hold for the longest time, so now I'm just trying to finish it.
1035000	1038000	And we just cured the genophage.
1038000	1042000	Ooh, I had cries again because...
1042000	1044000	Crying.
1044000	1049000	Still playing Animal Crossing because what the fuck else?
1050000	1053000	Because those animals need Aaron's Run stat.
1053000	1055000	Hey, I have no more Ed, so it's glorious.
1055000	1060000	That dresser ain't going to run its way over to whatever's house by itself.
1060000	1062000	I'm like, hey, can you give this to Eric?
1062000	1064000	Eric walks right by.
1064000	1066000	Sure?
1066000	1068000	My townsfolk are stupid.
1068000	1075000	So yeah, I played something else. I'm trying to remember what it was.
1075000	1081000	Oh yeah, I did actually play Govellius on iOS, and it sucks. So I deleted it.
1081000	1085000	I also did play the candy... what was the original?
1085000	1087000	Candy swipe?
1087000	1090000	Candy swipe? It's not fun.
1090000	1096000	I mean, no offense to the guy, because it's not that the game isn't fun, it's that the music sucks.
1096000	1100000	Get better music for it, and I'll play it more often.
1100000	1103000	That poor guy probably did it all himself on a Casio keyboard.
1103000	1107000	It sounds like something, just, no, I could do better.
1107000	1110000	Even if you hire me, I will do better.
1110000	1116000	But I still bought the game, I still supported it, and I'm still telling people not to buy Candy Suck.
1116000	1121000	I mean, Candy Crush or whatever the fuck they stupid shits call it.
1121000	1125000	And I've had some wine, so I feel great.
1125000	1127000	I played something else, but...
1127000	1130000	If Dark Soccer and I are a bit all over the place tonight, you'll know who to thank.
1130000	1134000	It took me drinking half a bottle last night to be slightly tipsy.
1134000	1136000	You can ask Becky, because she was there.
1136000	1139000	Oh yeah, I played Final Fantasy XIV.
1139000	1142000	And thank you to everybody who helped me finish Braeflop.
1142000	1145000	I mean, Braeflox is whatever the crap is called.
1145000	1150000	But I still think it's funny to call it Braeflop, even though that's the best dungeon so far.
1150000	1153000	Because you're outside, and there's crap going on.
1153000	1156000	And you get to shoot fireflies. That's kind of cool.
1156000	1163000	So yeah, I had a really good time playing Final Fantasy XIV, and I will get to play much more of it, and back to other games.
1163000	1164000	Alright.
1164000	1166000	So, stuff and things.
1166000	1170000	I almost felt like I was going to throw up watching Dan play Forza.
1170000	1173000	That good, huh? Is that the new one on Xbox One or one of the other ones?
1173000	1178000	No, it's not Forza. It was some other racing sim he has on his triple screen.
1178000	1183000	What was that one? It's like an actual rally racing sim.
1183000	1184000	Dirt?
1184000	1191000	No, it's got some sort of interesting European sounding name, and whatever.
1191000	1192000	One of them.
1192000	1193000	Some game, some game.
1193000	1195000	Probably Toca?
1195000	1199000	No, it was two words, but I forget.
1199000	1202000	Anyway, Dan's doing his big sim racing thing again.
1202000	1207000	They had it running all day, so I got really tired of hearing...
1207000	1211000	You know, so I was like, I'm going to hide in the back room.
1211000	1212000	Alright.
1212000	1213000	Let's move on.
1213000	1215000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1215000	1216000	It was okay.
1216000	1219000	I didn't play a ton of stuff, because, you know, time and everything,
1219000	1221000	but I did manage to play a few things.
1221000	1226000	Sadly, not a lot of it I can really talk about, just because one of...
1226000	1231000	Well, I can mention that I played Chroma, because I got into the alpha for that.
1231000	1234000	I just can't mention what I thought about it.
1234000	1237000	I mean, other than it was good, I guess.
1237000	1241000	I played a little bit of South Park, the Stick of Truth.
1241000	1243000	My God, is that game amazing.
1243000	1245000	It is just fantastic.
1245000	1251000	The humor in it is spot on, and it literally looks like you're watching the show.
1251000	1253000	It's just awesome.
1253000	1256000	Wait, hold on, because a lot of people are kind of worried,
1256000	1259000	because there's, you know, tight embargoes on South Park,
1259000	1263000	and I guess the reviews aren't going to pop up until right when the game comes out,
1263000	1266000	but knowing, you know, that you have your connections and things,
1266000	1269000	not piracy, we're talking about other connections that Loki has,
1269000	1273000	you sometimes get things early, so you've actually had a chance to play it?
1273000	1276000	Yeah, just a little bit, like 30 minutes.
1276000	1280000	Oh, because one of the big questions out there is that the rumor is the game is really short.
1280000	1282000	Like seven to eight hours.
1282000	1283000	I don't know about that.
1283000	1286000	Okay, well, I'm just throwing it out there, for better or worse.
1286000	1288000	The rumor is that the game is only like seven to eight hours,
1288000	1291000	which for an RPG is really short.
1291000	1294000	But, I mean, if it can deliver the funny for seven to eight hours,
1294000	1297000	I still, I like, I don't know, I kind of,
1297000	1300000	like the South Park movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my entire life,
1300000	1303000	so if this game can deliver that for seven to eight hours,
1303000	1307000	I do kind of think it's worth the $60, honestly, but we'll see, we'll see.
1307000	1311000	It's pretty funny, there's a part in the very beginning of the game where you go to Cartman's house,
1311000	1315000	and then you're standing there, and you're walking through the living room,
1315000	1317000	and his mom's there, oh, you're a friend.
1317000	1319000	And so, one of the options is to talk to her,
1319000	1321000	and you try to talk to her, and Cartman's like,
1321000	1323000	she's not part of the game.
1323000	1325000	And so I just thought that was hilarious.
1325000	1329000	Where they have like, you know, you can take a shit in your toilet
1329000	1331000	and pick up the shit so you can throw it at people.
1331000	1336000	You know, it's just, I don't know, it's just really South Park humor.
1336000	1337000	Classy.
1337000	1339000	Yeah.
1339000	1345000	And then I think I'm pretty sure from what I read in the beta stuff
1345000	1347000	that it's okay to talk about,
1347000	1351000	the latest beta was for Elder Scrolls Online.
1351000	1354000	I played a few minutes of that.
1354000	1358000	I wasn't a big fan of the game,
1358000	1360000	well, I mean, when it first was down,
1360000	1362000	so I was like, oh my god, this game looks awesome.
1362000	1364000	And every little bit of news that I heard after that,
1364000	1367000	it's just been kind of going downhill.
1367000	1371000	And I played it, and it didn't change my mind.
1371000	1373000	I mean, it looks like an Elder Scrolls game,
1373000	1376000	but it's just kind of, I don't know,
1376000	1379000	missing something, like charm, I guess.
1379000	1381000	But I mean, it's a beta still,
1381000	1384000	so obviously the opening cutscene stuff's gone,
1384000	1385000	and they don't have that there.
1385000	1389000	They have a little text thing explaining what the cutscene was going to look like.
1389000	1391000	And the combat's kind of okay.
1391000	1394000	I was a little pissed off that it didn't support controllers,
1394000	1396000	because that's what I normally play stuff on,
1396000	1399000	and so I had to do kind of keyboard, mouse,
1399000	1400000	and it worked all right.
1400000	1404000	But it's just, I don't know, I would definitely not pay for it.
1404000	1408000	But I don't know, people will be excited about it, I guess.
1408000	1409000	Coming out in a couple months.
1409000	1412000	We've been talking about that game pretty extensively over on Hoard House,
1412000	1416000	where we talk about a lot of the multiplayer and online games,
1416000	1421000	and I have to admit, I wasn't even drinking on the show this weekend.
1421000	1424000	I kind of became a little unhinged at the whole Elder Scrolls thing,
1424000	1429000	because I'm just really shocked that they're going to charge a monthly fee for it,
1429000	1432000	and every sign points to it's not going to work for them,
1432000	1434000	and they're going to reverse on that mighty quick.
1434000	1437000	I mean, we might be wrong, but we'll see, we'll see.
1437000	1441000	The initial buzz doesn't look too great.
1442000	1445000	Yeah, I don't know. It just seems very basic to me.
1445000	1449000	But, like I said, I didn't give it that much time.
1449000	1453000	But I was short on time, I was like, okay, well, I can play more Elder Scrolls,
1453000	1455000	or I could play South Park.
1455000	1456000	I'll play South Park.
1456000	1457000	There you go.
1458000	1459000	All right.
1459000	1460000	That's pretty much it.
1460000	1461000	That's it.
1461000	1462000	Well, my gaming week.
1462000	1463000	I've got to admit, I didn't play a lot of new stuff,
1463000	1466000	because I'm still trucking along in Final Fantasy XIV.
1466000	1470000	But, again, I've been focusing on a game that I kind of went back to
1470000	1473000	after a little while away.
1473000	1476000	I've been talking about the past couple weeks on the show Diablo III
1476000	1478000	on the PlayStation 3, which I was playing,
1478000	1481000	and I was talking about how it kind of controls weird,
1481000	1484000	but, gosh, it makes me really curious to go back and check out the PC version.
1484000	1489000	Well, like Clockwork, the PC version got a huge patch this last week,
1489000	1492000	the 2.0 patch, because they've got that expansion coming
1492000	1494000	that they want to get sold copies of
1494000	1496000	and convince people they need to go to level 70
1496000	1497000	and play as a Crusader and so forth.
1497000	1500000	So there's a huge patch that went out for Diablo this weekend.
1500000	1502000	It added clans into the game.
1502000	1507000	But most importantly, it changed the loot system completely.
1507000	1510000	And now the loot you get, the vast majority of it,
1510000	1513000	like 90% of it is something your class can actually use,
1513000	1516000	with the minority being stuff that you might want to put in your stash
1516000	1518000	to give to other characters.
1518000	1521000	And the other huge change they made was the difficulty settings.
1521000	1525000	They completely eliminated the fact that there are four difficulty levels.
1525000	1528000	There was, what, Normal and Hell and Inferno.
1528000	1530000	I don't remember what they were all called.
1530000	1532000	But there was the four different difficulty levels.
1532000	1533000	They eliminated that completely.
1533000	1537000	And now all of the characters scale to your level,
1537000	1541000	and you choose, do you want it to be Normal, where it's kind of easy?
1541000	1543000	Do you want it to be Hard, where it's a little more difficult,
1543000	1545000	but you get increased experience and gold drops?
1545000	1547000	Do you want it to be Terror, where it's even hard?
1547000	1548000	And so on.
1548000	1551000	So they changed it so that you have a little more tweak
1551000	1554000	over how difficult the game is, as opposed to,
1554000	1557000	you've got this track, this track, this track, and this track.
1557000	1559000	And I've got to tell you, when I first read that,
1559000	1561000	I was a little bit like, oh, level scaling?
1561000	1562000	I don't know.
1562000	1563000	That doesn't work so well in Final Fantasy.
1563000	1566000	But it really does work in Diablo III.
1566000	1569000	Because Normal, yeah, you can kind of steamroll it.
1569000	1573000	And even Hard, if you have the right gear, is not really...
1573000	1576000	I've been playing mostly in Hard, and it's really not that hard.
1576000	1580000	But as you get into other difficulties, I imagine things get a lot more difficult,
1580000	1582000	especially as you bring more players in the mix.
1582000	1584000	So it really does feel like you have way more control
1584000	1587000	over how difficult the game is, as opposed to,
1587000	1589000	you've got these four vanilla tracks.
1589000	1592000	So I think in some regards, that has really changed the game.
1592000	1595000	And most people I know that have gone back and played the game say,
1595000	1598000	wow, Diablo III is really fun.
1598000	1602000	And it's not like they didn't go back and add really a lot of story,
1602000	1604000	or they didn't really change the game in that regard.
1604000	1608000	It's just they made a few key design changes
1608000	1611000	that have really flipped the game upside down for some people in a good way.
1611000	1617000	The Auction House is still there, but that will be eliminated in about two weeks, I think.
1617000	1619000	And it's really a footnote now.
1619000	1621000	You kind of have to really search for it to find it.
1621000	1625000	Because obviously they want to make it so you can just strip it out really easy
1625000	1626000	and you're not even going to be able to notice.
1626000	1628000	I couldn't even find the Real Money Auction House.
1628000	1631000	I think that's already gone.
1631000	1633000	Or that is so well hidden, I couldn't even find that.
1633000	1638000	So, yeah, if you were not wanting to play Diablo III
1638000	1641000	because of some of the Auction House fuckery and all that,
1641000	1643000	it's different now.
1643000	1645000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,
1645000	1649000	Does it have BBF mode or Bobby Black Wolf Forever mode?
1649000	1651000	So we sometimes call it.
1651000	1653000	Yes and no.
1653000	1656000	I mean, no, there's no super easy mode.
1656000	1662000	But if you play on normal and you're just staying on top of your gear drops
1662000	1665000	and replacing it, you will not have a problem.
1665000	1667000	I really can't see that you're going to die an awful lot.
1667000	1669000	And if you die, oh well.
1669000	1671000	You run back to your corpse and you come back without penalty.
1671000	1674000	It's hardcore mode where you have to worry about that.
1674000	1678000	Because in hardcore mode is the whole die once, die forever.
1678000	1682000	I always kind of preferred the way Path of Exile handled that,
1682000	1684000	where if you die in hardcore mode,
1684000	1687000	your character is bumped down to the normal bracket
1687000	1690000	and you can't play hardcore again on that character.
1690000	1692000	I kind of like that a little better.
1692000	1694000	It doesn't make the loss feel as severe,
1694000	1698000	but the stakes are high when you decide to be a hardcore player.
1698000	1702000	And it's so funny, because I actually did start a hardcore barbarian this week
1702000	1704000	and I did not think I would like playing a barbarian,
1704000	1706000	but they're actually a lot of fun.
1706000	1709000	But anyway, when you start a hardcore character,
1709000	1712000	you basically have to sign a waiver, so to speak, with your mouse.
1712000	1716000	It's like, this character will be gone forever if you die.
1716000	1719000	Customer support will not bring these back for any reason.
1719000	1721000	You have to accept this before you play.
1721000	1723000	So it's pretty awesome.
1724000	1727000	Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people got their free copy of Diablo 3
1727000	1732000	with the whole blood pact that Blizzard did with World of Warcraft some time ago.
1732000	1735000	And even if you didn't, it's pretty cheap now, I think,
1735000	1737000	because they have that expansion.
1737000	1739000	They're going to try to make their money on the expansion.
1739000	1741000	And they really...
1741000	1743000	When you go to select a character,
1743000	1745000	Crusader is just one of the options right there.
1745000	1747000	You can pick just a witch doctor or barbarian
1747000	1748000	or something that's in the game normally.
1748000	1750000	But of course, if you try to click OK, it'll say,
1750000	1753000	oh, Crusader is only available in Reaper of Souls.
1753000	1754000	Give us your credit card now.
1754000	1756000	You know, that whole type of thing.
1756000	1760000	But yeah, Diablo 3, it's changed for the better.
1760000	1762000	And if you had the game already,
1762000	1764000	you didn't have to pay a monthly fee for it or anything.
1764000	1768000	So reinstall it and check it out and see what you missed out on.
1768000	1770000	Or not so much what you missed out on,
1770000	1773000	but see what's new because it is worth checking out again.
1773000	1775000	That oddly enough reminded me of what the other thing was, by the way.
1775000	1777000	League of Legends.
1777000	1779000	Oh, that's right. You started randomly getting into that, huh?
1779000	1782000	I installed it just to see what it's like, but I haven't tried it yet.
1782000	1784000	Well, that's nothing. You didn't play it then.
1784000	1785000	Just saying.
1785000	1786000	It doesn't count.
1786000	1787000	It's on my computer.
1787000	1788000	Next. Well, big deal.
1788000	1790000	I got a lot of stuff on my computer I've never touched either.
1790000	1792000	You want to look at my Steam library?
1794000	1795000	All right.
1795000	1797000	After I get through going through mine.
1797000	1800000	Well, as we get into the news a little later on tonight,
1800000	1802000	we can go through each other's.
1802000	1803000	Ooh.
1803000	1804000	All right.
1804000	1806000	Some housekeeping first before we get there.
1806000	1809000	As a reminder, there will be no show on March 16th.
1809000	1811000	Or I should say no live show.
1811000	1814000	I need to talk to Dark Soccer and Loki because I want to put something together
1814000	1817000	that may be pre, you know, done in advance or whatever.
1817000	1819000	So we'll try to do that.
1819000	1822000	That way you podcast folks don't have to go a week with no show.
1822000	1824000	But we will not be here live on March 16th.
1824000	1827000	That is because the studio is moving.
1827000	1828000	Because I am moving.
1828000	1829000	Much more space.
1829000	1831000	They're growing legs and they're walking.
1831000	1832000	Well, there's going to be space.
1832000	1835000	And with space means we can consider the webcam.
1835000	1836000	That's all I'm going to say.
1836000	1837000	That's all I'm going to say.
1837000	1838000	I'm not going to promise nothing.
1838000	1839000	So.
1839000	1840000	I'll be wearing a sheet.
1840000	1841000	We can put you in a box.
1841000	1843000	I'm going to become the Berka Avenger.
1843000	1844000	We can put you in a box.
1844000	1846000	I'll be cosplaying her every week.
1846000	1849000	So no show, no live show on March 16th.
1849000	1851000	And of course you can follow us on Twitter.
1851000	1853000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1853000	1854000	We're also on Facebook.
1854000	1856000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1856000	1858000	And one other important piece of housekeeping.
1858000	1862000	For the past couple weeks we've been talking about a fun little free game,
1862000	1865000	a parody game that's available over at VoG network dot com.
1865000	1867000	It is Flappy VoG.
1867000	1868000	And Flappy VoG.
1868000	1872000	Flappy VoG did get its second character pack tonight.
1872000	1874000	It is character pack two, the final.
1874000	1878000	And the sole star of character pack two is Loki.
1878000	1880000	So if you've.
1880000	1882000	And I got to say though, Loki's lines are pretty hilarious.
1882000	1883000	I won't spoil it here.
1883000	1885000	But well done sir.
1885000	1886000	I laughed.
1886000	1887000	I laughed a lot.
1887000	1890000	I played it for a little bit and I'm already getting tired of hearing my voice.
1890000	1891000	Yeah.
1892000	1895000	So you can check that out over at Flappy dot VoG network dot com.
1895000	1898000	But as we talked about earlier on the Bobby Black Wolf show.
1898000	1899000	Part of joke.
1899000	1900000	Part of parody.
1900000	1902000	Part of satire is that you got to know when to walk away.
1902000	1904000	And the joke's already starting to get a little stale.
1904000	1907000	Loki doing it has breathed some life into it.
1907000	1909000	But after this it is for sure done.
1909000	1911000	We're not going to really talk about it anymore.
1911000	1913000	You got that song stuck in my head now.
1913000	1914000	What song?
1914000	1915000	The Gambler.
1915000	1916000	I'm a joker.
1916000	1917000	I'm a smoker.
1917000	1919000	You got to know when to hold it.
1919000	1920000	Alright.
1920000	1921000	Walk away.
1921000	1923000	Are you going to serenade us with some karaoke revolution tonight?
1923000	1924000	No.
1924000	1925000	Some Sing Star?
1925000	1926000	No.
1926000	1927000	You're already singing the Joker when I was talking about The Gambler.
1927000	1929000	I have Sing Star Abba and Sing Star Queen.
1929000	1932000	I need to borrow by the way Sing Star Abba.
1932000	1933000	In hell.
1933000	1934000	Alright.
1934000	1935000	Bitch.
1935000	1937000	Let's see if I bring you anyone.
1937000	1938000	Let's get to.
1938000	1939000	Although I think it was already here.
1939000	1941000	Let's get to some gaming news.
1941000	1944000	Loki will start us off while Dark Soccer and I fight over my copy of Sing Star Abba.
1944000	1945000	Loki.
1946000	1953000	Well, with the phasing out of a lot of the Wii stuff, they are now pulling the plug on
1953000	1956000	online play for the Wii and the DS.
1956000	1957000	Because hey!
1957000	1960000	They have a Wii U and a 3DS that they want you to buy.
1960000	1966000	So if you want to play online with people, you can buy a new system.
1966000	1969000	And that is happening May 20th.
1969000	1975000	And of course, that shuts down such things as just online play.
1975000	1979000	Also, some of the stuff that will not be affected.
1979000	1982000	Of course, anything that involves you paying them money.
1982000	1985000	So the DSi shop or the Wii.
1985000	1986000	What was it?
1986000	1987000	The Wii shop.
1987000	1990000	Those are staying open.
1990000	1995000	Of course, the browsers and Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc.
1995000	1997000	That's all going to still work.
1997000	2003000	But remember, they took away the weather and news channel.
2003000	2006000	Well, now they are taking away online as well.
2006000	2007000	That does kind of suck.
2007000	2011000	I love to spin the globe and the weather channel and check out what the weather is going to
2011000	2013000	be like in Antarctica.
2013000	2016000	I mean, I guess I could do that online.
2016000	2019000	It's cold.
2019000	2024000	Yeah, it is kind of disappointing that they have removed online for their games.
2024000	2028000	Especially when you consider that a lot of other systems out there, their games are still
2028000	2030000	alive and kicking.
2030000	2036000	Some of the thought might have been that this was due to the fact that they are releasing
2036000	2041000	their servers through GameFly or GameSpy.
2041000	2045000	And because of that, and I think that they went under new ownership that the fees are
2045000	2046000	a lot higher.
2046000	2052000	So now they're just kind of cutting their losses and hopefully trying to drive people
2052000	2054000	to play stuff on the Wii U.
2054000	2059000	Also, considering I think one of the more popular games on there was Mario Kart Wii,
2059000	2064000	and it literally shuts down 10 days before Mario Kart 8 comes out.
2064000	2067000	So that could be something.
2067000	2068000	Hmm.
2068000	2072000	A little bit aptly timed there.
2072000	2078000	By the way, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, VX JasonXV is in chat and talks about how he
2078000	2082000	likes to spin the globe and the Weather Channel and comes across Cockburn Town.
2082000	2084000	There's a place called Cockburn Town.
2084000	2085000	I had no idea.
2085000	2086000	There's a Cockburn Town.
2086000	2087000	Probably.
2087000	2088000	I knew there was a Fuck Austria.
2088000	2089000	I knew about that.
2089000	2090000	Is it Fucking or Fuck?
2090000	2091000	One of the two.
2091000	2093000	I think it's Fucking or something, Austria.
2093000	2097000	But I did not know there was a Cockburn Town, but apparently, yes, it is the capital of
2097000	2099000	the Turks and Caicos Islands.
2099000	2100000	Who knew?
2100000	2101000	Fun.
2101000	2102000	Go visit Cockburn Town, everybody.
2102000	2104000	There's also stuff called Cockaleaky Soup, which I just think is funny.
2104000	2108000	It's basically Chicken and Leek Soup, but it's called Cockaleaky.
2108000	2110000	No comment.
2110000	2111000	Hello all of our friends in Scotland.
2111000	2117000	And it's not like you can't do this on theweatherchannel.com or maps.google or whatever, but I don't
2117000	2118000	know.
2118000	2119000	There was something very therapeutic.
2119000	2120000	Just roll with me here.
2120000	2121000	Surely I can't be the only one.
2121000	2123000	I know Jason just admitted to doing this too.
2123000	2127000	There was something very therapeutic to that little music in the Wii Weather Channel, the
2127000	2129000	doo doo doo.
2129000	2132000	Little ambient Philip Glass shit that they would play in the background.
2132000	2133000	I love Philip Glass.
2133000	2136000	He would just like spin the globe, spin the globe, spin the globe, spin the globe.
2136000	2138000	And then like, Ooh, what's the weather going to be like here?
2138000	2139000	Stop.
2139000	2140000	No way.
2140000	2141000	He's fucking Austria.
2141000	2142000	All right.
2142000	2149000	Anyway, but, but, but, but, but there's also hell and there's um, the crap else I was thinking
2149000	2150000	of.
2150000	2152000	Um, there's a cool California.
2152000	2153000	Yeah.
2153000	2154000	There's weed California.
2154000	2155000	That's right.
2155000	2157000	They, they make a killing off shirts.
2157000	2158000	Yes, they do merchandise.
2158000	2161000	I went to weed and all I got was this shirt.
2161000	2162000	All right.
2162000	2164000	So what do you mean to derail what you were saying?
2164000	2165000	Was there anything?
2165000	2166000	No, no, that, that's pretty much it.
2166000	2170480	I mean, it's just kind of sucks that they're, you know, shutting down the online, but they've
2170480	2173720	already kind of written that console off and to be honest, there's not really any games
2173720	2175160	coming out for it anymore.
2175160	2177400	There's some of these really small third party guys.
2177400	2183000	They're still releasing things, but no major companies supporting that system anymore.
2183000	2190000	Ironically, same with the Wii U, but you know, Hey, uh, I don't know.
2190000	2196000	It's, I don't, if they're thinking that turning off online is going to get people to, you
2196000	2199000	know, force them into buying a Wii U, then I don't think that's going to happen.
2199000	2201600	I think if anything, it's just a kind of save some money.
2201600	2205200	I'm not, I know there's a lot of people that want to shout conspiracy theory and all this
2205200	2206200	stuff.
2206200	2208480	I'm not necessarily convinced that's the case.
2208480	2213120	I kind of think that was already the case when Nintendo started releasing these consoles
2213120	2216720	because the last two skews of the Wii didn't even have online in it.
2216720	2217720	Right.
2217720	2221520	The Wii U friendly mini Wiis or whatever that didn't, that was just the Wii mini and it
2221520	2222960	didn't even sell that well.
2222960	2226280	They, they released that very limited and that was it.
2226280	2230200	Um, I still think the Wii has online.
2230200	2233680	It's just that doesn't have backwards compatibility at the GameCube anymore.
2233680	2238400	I think the reality is people aren't playing these games online anymore because they've
2238400	2243580	all moved on to either Wii U or let's be real PlayStation and Xbox games.
2243580	2247160	You know, I don't, I just, and I think anybody that's still playing these games probably
2247160	2249040	is playing them in the same room or whatever.
2249040	2253600	You know, what's going to sadly happen with a lot of this stuff and I think this might
2253600	2260920	be the case is, you know, um, there are pretty capable Wii emulators out there that have
2260920	2265560	online, I think support or for multiplayer or something.
2265560	2268720	That might be the option is that they do it that way.
2268720	2269720	Some sort of tunneling.
2269720	2278400	Um, I had mentioned before like, uh, for the Xbox and Xbox 360, I think PSP and GameCube,
2278400	2284360	they have options there called tunneling programs and basically it tricks the system into thinking
2284360	2289340	that it's doing like a system linker land game, but instead it's going over the internet.
2289340	2294000	And so you kind of peer with other people that way, but it connects via land.
2294000	2296920	See they, cause they have that with the GameCube, although it wasn't a feature that a lot of
2296920	2302240	people use, like for example, with Double Dash, but you know, the Wii never had that.
2302240	2304320	There was no land games on the Wii.
2304320	2305320	Right.
2305320	2308640	Um, well, and that's, that's the only bummer of this to me.
2308640	2313060	I mean, I can accept the fact that really nobody's playing these games online anymore,
2313060	2314520	so it's time for them to come down.
2314520	2318000	And if I really wanted to play Mario Kart Wii online, then I probably should have been
2318000	2319640	doing that the past three years.
2319640	2323380	I'm sure Nintendo is looking at reports and there's, there's so few people that are playing
2323380	2326680	these games online, it's not cost effective to keep the servers going.
2326680	2327760	I get that.
2327760	2332040	But the part of me that loves classic games, as we talk about a lot here on Orange Launch
2332040	2336840	Radio, classic gaming, the part of me that loves classic games is a little bit disappointed
2336840	2342020	that nobody will ever be able to play a game of Mario Kart, I mean, after May, will be
2342020	2347060	able to play a game of Mario Kart Wii over the internet, at least through any type of
2347060	2348060	official means.
2348060	2352240	I mean, you're going to have to hack a system like you're talking about or, or do emulators
2352240	2355800	or some type of, you know, underground things in order to do that.
2355800	2358400	That's, that's the only part of it that's a little bit disappointing to me.
2358400	2364320	I mean, I'll get over that, but that's the only bummer is that, you know, in 10, 15 years
2364320	2368440	when we want to look back on gaming's history, the way we look back fondly on a lot of our
2368440	2372960	NES games and, and, you know, Genesis games, Atari games of the past, we're not going to
2372960	2375960	be able to do that completely with these internet enabled games.
2375960	2380000	But, I mean, this is, this is a complaint that isn't limited in Nintendo.
2380000	2383680	It's something, I mean, obviously EA pulls servers down all the time and so on and so
2383680	2384680	on.
2384680	2385680	So.
2385680	2386680	Yeah.
2386680	2392000	So, uh, yeah, I guess Nintendo's just following the trend in that regard, but, uh, yeah, I
2392000	2397120	mean, there are some games though on the DS that, you know, haven't really seen any type
2397120	2398120	of re-imagining.
2398120	2401120	I know Bobby was talking a lot about clubhouse games tonight.
2401120	2406640	Um, Allen had brought up, was it Pokemon puzzle league or was it, no, that was a Nintendo
2406640	2411400	64 game, that puzzle planet puzzle league or same type of thing, but it was on the DS,
2411400	2415600	you know, those types of games don't really exist on the 3DS, at least yet.
2416520	2420280	Ooh, Loki, here's a tinfoil hat thought.
2420280	2422040	Tell me what you think.
2422040	2425280	Aren't DS games supposed to be coming to the Wii U virtual console?
2425280	2426280	That is true.
2426280	2428000	Do you see where I'm going with this?
2428000	2431000	Do you think they will have online enabled?
2431000	2440200	Uh, if, uh, probably, um, if, you know, I don't know, probably, um, but once again with
2440200	2444480	the DS though, although they don't have a tunneling program available, anything that
2444480	2450360	can play, you can play locally, should be able to connect over, um, the internet if
2450360	2453160	someone finishes the tunneling program for that.
2453160	2457120	But yeah, I see what you're saying is that, you know, maybe they're going to add, uh,
2457120	2460820	you know, multi- online multiplayer to DS games.
2460820	2464280	I would like to hope that that's going to be something that they do, although they tend
2464280	2468680	to go the lazy route with a lot of these things and not add features like that.
2468680	2472480	They just kind of put the bare minimum, okay, games on, you know, virtual console.
2472480	2473480	That's it.
2473480	2477320	Still, it's, it's one of those questions you got to wonder about, and Bobby Blackwolf
2477320	2480040	and Chad says, I don't think they'll have online enabled because they're shutting off
2480040	2485440	the servers, but what if, what if they decide to release Metroid Prime Hunters?
2485440	2488920	I really think they should bring back online for something like that.
2488920	2492360	Like I, I, you can't sell an emulated copy of the game without really giving you the
2492360	2493360	full experience, right?
2493360	2498260	Because, you know, it will have been at that point, what, a good five, six, seven years
2498260	2501020	since that game originally first came out by the time they released this on virtual
2501020	2502020	console.
2502060	2505660	I don't know, just throwing it out there, throwing it out there.
2505660	2510260	Tigerclaw wants to say, don't worry, Mario Kart 7 has race courses from Mario Kart Wii.
2510260	2513980	Then soon, Mario Kart 8 will have race courses from the Wii and 3DS version.
2513980	2517140	Nintendo likes to recycle the old tracks in each iteration.
2517140	2523580	That is a true point, Tigerclaw, but it is selections, and of course, your favorite track
2523580	2526060	never seems to make the cut, now does it?
2526060	2529020	Maybe it does, but for a lot of people, they always go, well, they should have had this
2529020	2530020	track in the game.
2530060	2532380	Of course, it would be very interesting if they decide to do DLC.
2532380	2537820	I mean, think about it, couldn't Mario Kart 8 feasibly have every Mario Kart course ever
2537820	2538820	made?
2538820	2539820	They could just do it through DLC?
2539820	2542460	They won't do that, because they're remaking all the tracks.
2542460	2546260	Like even they have one from the Game Boy Advance or whatever, and it looks completely
2546260	2549460	different now, because they've completely changed it up.
2549460	2553460	So I don't think they're going to go back and remake all the tracks.
2553460	2557060	The problem, they may have like a DLC pack, but that's it.
2557100	2560620	Maybe that's even just more characters, they might not even go the route of making more
2560620	2561620	courses.
2561620	2565500	Alright, well I'm going to move on to another story here that has to do with Nintendo and
2565500	2568860	some of the things that they should or they shouldn't be doing.
2568860	2572580	This is a comment that really spread around the internet this week from Seth Fisher, who's
2572580	2575500	a big hedge fund manager in Asia.
2575500	2580900	So he's of the investor sort, and investors haven't been making a lot of great comments
2580900	2585380	about Nintendo lately, but this one is one of the ones that takes the cake.
2585380	2588740	Because they say Nintendo has a huge library of casual games, and so they should get to
2588740	2590820	smartphone and tablet-based gaming, right?
2590820	2592820	So we've heard this one before, right?
2592820	2593820	But here's the quote.
2593820	2598820	Quote, Nintendo needs to embrace this thematic change in consumer demand, behavior, and expectations
2598820	2599820	to stay relevant.
2599820	2604700	It is readily apparent that the standard elasticity of demand principle no longer applies in the
2604700	2608980	consumer entertainment market when access requires the purchase of a physical project.
2608980	2612380	As the holder of what is arguably the largest library of casual games, Nintendo is well
2612380	2614540	placed to make an immediate entry into mobile.
2614540	2619900	Okay, well, that's fine, but then this led into talk about, well, you know, because you
2619900	2625180	see in Candy Crush Saga, they get billions of dollars, what was it, $1.9 billion in revenue
2625180	2626740	or whatever it was they made.
2626740	2634980	What if we just had it where you could pay 99 cents to make Mario jump a little higher?
2634980	2639740	And like my head exploded hearing that, especially with all this talk of Donkey Kong Country
2639740	2642900	this week and how insanely difficult it is on the Wii U.
2642940	2645540	I mean, that's part of the experience.
2645540	2651460	I mean, Nintendo makes A plus platformers and for a reason and suddenly changing that
2651460	2656660	formula where, oh, Mario can jump just a little bit higher for 99 cents is really gonna, that's
2656660	2657660	shitty.
2657660	2659420	That's somebody who does not get it.
2659420	2660420	Yeah, right.
2660420	2664180	Who's not, who does not get the point of having a game.
2664180	2666860	People like this tend to loop video games.
2666860	2669740	See, there's a key in here.
2669780	2673020	He just wants to exploit a market and not make a good product.
2673020	2676820	Well, the problem is these folks that are tunnel visioned here, which I understand the
2676820	2678340	goal is to make money.
2678340	2679340	That's what investment is.
2679340	2680340	He wants your company to make money.
2680340	2681340	I get that.
2681340	2686700	But when we get really tunnel visioned, we, we start to think that, oh, Mario, Candy Crush,
2686700	2688700	the same thing.
2688700	2694060	No, not even close.
2694060	2699380	I mean, for better or worse, at least Nintendo has got way better clout amongst gamers and
2699420	2706500	there's a certain expectation from a Nintendo product than there is, you know, King.
2706500	2710740	You have something that's only looking on the money making aspect of it.
2710740	2715100	You're going to eventually get too many jaded consumers who aren't going to put their investment
2715100	2716200	in the product.
2716200	2720700	They want something that's going to be fun, that is a game to enjoy, then they're going
2720700	2722700	to spend the money on it.
2722700	2727380	You know, how many of these different clones out there that are just, you know, revenue
2727380	2733020	monsters really get as successful as some of these little single ones do and then people
2733020	2734020	forget about it.
2734020	2735020	Move on to the next one.
2735020	2738940	I think another thing these investors tend to forget is that Candy Crush Saga is a flash
2738940	2740440	in the fucking pan.
2740440	2745500	It's a flash in the pan, just like Farmville and you notice how quickly Zynga went up and
2745500	2746500	now they fell.
2746500	2750620	I mean, they're not out of business per se, but Zynga has come down from their peak.
2750620	2754340	We know that the same, the bubble is going to burst on Candy Crush Saga as well.
2754340	2758900	In fact, I would argue it's already beginning to burst because of all that negative publicity
2758900	2759900	they got.
2759900	2763140	We'll get into that a little later in the show, but my point is that bubble is going
2763140	2764860	to burst.
2764860	2768280	Now maybe for an investor, that's not such a bad thing because it's like you're trying
2768280	2769780	to ride the waves of the ocean.
2769780	2771220	You try to catch a company, right?
2771220	2774580	It's going to go up and then you sell, sell, sell, sell, sell right before it's going to
2774580	2775580	go down.
2775580	2777140	You get onto the next big flash in the pan.
2777140	2781660	That's how, you know, a lot of the stock market works, but that's not what we expect.
2781660	2784020	Nintendo is not a flash in the pan.
2784020	2787140	I really don't, even if you're the biggest Nintendo critic in the world and you hate
2787140	2791620	the Wii U, you've got to admit, Nintendo is not a flash in the pan.
2791620	2792620	There's a certain expectation.
2792620	2795660	There's a certain expectation you have out of Nintendo and I think that's why people
2795660	2796900	are disappointed in the Wii U.
2796900	2802660	Loki, any thoughts before we move on?
2802660	2808380	This is why, you know, companies tend not to listen to, you know, each investor because
2808380	2811660	you put money down in the company and all of a sudden you think that you run it.
2811660	2813780	I mean, it's just, I don't know.
2813780	2815260	I think it's, it's a dumb idea.
2815260	2817660	They already own the handheld console market.
2817660	2820220	I don't think that they need to really change what they're doing.
2820220	2821220	All right.
2821220	2822220	Fair enough.
2822220	2824540	Let's move on to something else besides Nintendo.
2824540	2825540	Dark Soccer.
2825540	2827540	What do you have for us?
2827540	2832420	Well, um, the, uh, we've brought this up before about Steam, uh, starting their, uh, family
2832420	2837900	op, the Steam Family Sharing and, uh, well, it's now out of beta.
2837900	2838900	It's official.
2838900	2839900	You can do the Steam Family Sharing.
2839900	2845980	So basically, it lets for, uh, anyone who, you know, is family or trusted friend or something
2845980	2853700	like that, that has, uh, access to the different games, um, be it PC, be it Mac or Linux, um,
2853700	2859700	via Steam, they can share their libraries with each other, um, and so they can basically
2859700	2863820	share their progress over the Steam Cloud, which, I mean, like for me and Dan, we have
2863820	2864820	a few overlapping games.
2864820	2867820	This would actually be great because then we can, you know, share our games with each
2867820	2872420	other, um, instead of each of us both having to buy five different versions of Strider
2872420	2876740	like we did, and I haven't played it yet, um, but it's pretty neat.
2876740	2880340	I mean, they've got all the details on it on their website, and I'm thinking that he
2880340	2882940	and I should give it a try this week.
2882940	2886500	Something really fascinating about this feature that I find, and maybe this is just my own
2886500	2892260	experiences, but it's, it's horrifically underused, like, I, I, I've been in the beta for a while,
2892260	2894780	and I was even telling friends of mine, like, yeah, you want to check out that game?
2894780	2898460	Because I, I'll get the Steam thing set up on your computer at some point, but they never,
2898460	2899460	we never do it.
2899460	2902620	Like, they never really want to play it that bad enough, and even Alan and I are still
2902620	2906300	buying, like, two copies of the same game, maybe not as bad as we used to, but, like,
2906300	2908020	you know, he has access to my Steam library.
2908020	2911620	I don't think he really uses it, like, and not, you know, I'm just saying, I think it's
2911620	2913300	an underused feature right now.
2913300	2917340	It's really weird because I think there was that perception out there that, oh, people
2917340	2921420	are gonna share their library with 10 different people, and, you know, that's why Steam has
2921420	2925420	to lock them out, but, like, that, at least in my experience, that isn't happening.
2925420	2929460	I have, like, offered up my library, and no, I'm not gonna give it to any random listener,
2929460	2932300	but trusted friends of mine that kind of don't seem to care.
2932300	2936700	It's because we all have 200-some games that we haven't played yet.
2936700	2939340	And maybe that's, maybe that's really it, Loki.
2939340	2941620	I wouldn't doubt that that's an issue.
2941620	2946580	Well, I'm, I'm just gonna enable mine for Dan anyway, you know, because he, I've had
2946580	2950060	some games that I've told him to check out, and he just said, oh, well, I don't want to
2950060	2953780	buy it, so now you can check him out.
2953780	2958020	Yeah, and, and, and Alan and I really need to set a rule, quote-unquote, that we don't
2958020	2960020	buy two of the same game anymore with this.
2960020	2962180	Unless you've got multiplayer and you both want to play together.
2962180	2963180	Yeah, exactly.
2963180	2964180	Exactly.
2964180	2966300	Something like that the case, or whatever, but, you know.
2966300	2967300	Yeah.
2967300	2971940	But, I mean, it's, it's still, regardless of how utilized it's gonna be, I still think
2971940	2974340	it's a good, it's a good thing to have.
2974340	2982780	It gives more value to individual purchases, and it will make, um, honestly, I think it
2982780	2988460	might alleviate the need to have so many consistent sales, at least for big titles.
2988460	2992560	It make it, uh, you get, you get more value out of the game, so the bigger titles will
2992560	2994860	sell while they're still closer to full price.
2994860	2996980	All right.
2996980	3000900	I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask the chatters about this in a minute, but I'll move on, because
3000900	3004300	I know we have more Steam news, and I want to come back and ask the chatters a question.
3004300	3006460	So let's go to Loki.
3006460	3011100	So I'm surprised that this wasn't a thing in the first place, but apparently there was
3011100	3017640	a big elaborate process in order to, you know, put your titles on sale if you were someone
3017640	3020580	selling a game on Steam.
3020580	3026260	Well now they have some sort of modifications to that with the new Steam Work tools that
3026260	3032260	allows you to configure discounts for custom sale periods, or opt-in to take part in an
3032260	3034900	upcoming week-long sale.
3034900	3039980	And you can also configure when the discounts will start, or if they start at a specific
3039980	3043500	time, or how long to run, and that kind of thing.
3043500	3048800	That seems like something that should have been there in the first place, but now I like
3048800	3054080	the idea of it because now it gets people, you know, on Steam checking it, you know,
3054080	3059460	all the time instead of just waiting for, you know, a holiday sale or something.
3059660	3064220	Yeah, I kind of thought this was already a thing, like, I kind of didn't realize that
3064220	3067860	publishers didn't really have control over that, although it does seem like every sale
3067860	3070120	that we see on Steam is very timed.
3070120	3074780	Like there's always the week sale, the weekend sale, the holiday sales, you know, and so
3074780	3075780	on and so on.
3075780	3078780	There's not really, like, random sales, and that's what you're going to start seeing now,
3078780	3079780	right?
3079780	3080780	I guess, yeah.
3080780	3085020	So, I don't know, that was just kind of interesting.
3085580	3090420	Hold on, before you get to the next Steam story, I've got one thing here I want to ask
3090420	3095380	our folks, and I'm actually going to make this a live poll, because, you know, I love
3095380	3096380	my live polls.
3096380	3101540	So, we're going to ask the audience over at live.vognetwork.com a question right now,
3101540	3103660	and that question is quite simple.
3103660	3106700	Have you used Steam Family Sharing?
3106700	3110180	And I try to really limit the number of answers here because I want a clear picture.
3110180	3112380	Yes, I use it regularly.
3112460	3114140	I used it once.
3114140	3115140	Or nope.
3115140	3119500	Answer now, live listeners, you've got to be logged in over at live.vognetwork.com and
3119500	3121220	it'll show up at the bottom of the screen.
3121220	3125980	I'm only going to leave this open for a couple minutes, so hurry up and vote over at live.vognetwork.com.
3127980	3129980	Loki, back to you.
3129980	3137500	Alright, and then the other thing is, finally, the Steam music is going into beta, and so
3137500	3143820	they've, I guess, put out the first round of invites, and I guess for a limited time
3143820	3152780	you'll be able to stream some MP3s, I guess, currently only MP3s, and then later they're
3152780	3160780	going to add more formats, and I guess users can purchase game soundtracks or other things
3160780	3161780	like that.
3161780	3162780	So that's kind of neat.
3162780	3169100	I guess you're going to start selling music as well, and then allow you to, you know,
3169100	3170100	I don't know.
3170100	3174860	For me, I don't think this would be a big, like, something I would want to use just because,
3174860	3180420	you know, I'm playing on PC, I can just play music in the background.
3180420	3184180	But I guess with this being tied in, you know, it would like maybe shut off the music in
3184180	3186900	the game or something to that effect.
3186900	3187900	I don't know.
3187900	3194660	I just don't know what the advantage would be going this route versus, you know, just
3194660	3199740	playing music on my computer.
3199740	3202180	Is it something maybe for the Steam Box?
3202180	3203940	Like kind of like a long-term vision type of thing?
3203940	3211620	Well, it is something that's limited to SteamOS and big picture mode, but I don't know.
3211620	3217000	Apparently they're going to have an interface also that's going to be for just the regular
3217000	3222360	desktop version, but right now it's just for those two versions, so.
3222360	3223360	I don't know.
3223360	3228200	Once again, you know, not a feature I even really use on consoles either, so.
3228200	3229200	I don't know.
3229200	3230200	I don't know what the big deal is.
3230200	3233680	I guess it's just, you know, it allows them to sell more things.
3233680	3235840	Jason in our chat has a perspective.
3235840	3240000	Our buddy VXJ6V says, Steam music exists for one reason.
3240000	3242700	Valve needed a player in SteamOS.
3242700	3247260	Steam music as it stands is kind of bunk, in my opinion.
3247260	3248260	I guess that makes sense.
3248260	3253700	Yeah, I mean, when these Steam Boxes come out, my assumption is they need to be able
3253700	3256900	to play media as a part of it, right?
3256900	3262540	Because a lot of people razz the fact that the PS4 won't play an audio CD, I think.
3262540	3263540	So.
3263540	3264540	Anyhow.
3264540	3270180	All right, we'll do one more story and then we'll go to the results of the poll here.
3270180	3272600	So we've been talking about Steam.
3272600	3276560	Let's talk about sharing of a different nature because some big news came out this week about
3276560	3280200	Twitch TV and how they're going to integrate with the Xbox One.
3280200	3283160	Now, a lot of folks have been anticipating when this is going to happen, when this is
3283160	3288200	going to happen, and some folks thinking that Microsoft may wait until E3, but it looks
3288200	3290560	like we are going to get it a little bit sooner.
3290560	3295520	We're going to get Twitch streaming on the Xbox One on March 11th, and this is kind of
3295520	3300120	timed a little bit key because that is when Titanfall is supposed to come out.
3300120	3301120	So make no mistake.
3301160	3304600	I'm sure the rush was, hey, if we can get this enabled in time for Titanfall, that'll
3304600	3309840	be a lot of free publicity for that game through the Xbox One Twitch integration.
3309840	3311360	So they are working on that.
3311360	3317560	Now, the nice thing about Twitch on the Xbox One versus the PlayStation 4, on the PlayStation
3317560	3319880	4, those cameras are still impossible to find.
3319880	3320880	Let me tell you.
3320880	3322460	I don't know what the hell's going on there.
3322460	3325700	I thought after the Japanese launch it might get easier, but no, it seems like they stopped
3325700	3327280	making them or something.
3327280	3330240	But with the Xbox One, that ain't going to be an issue because everybody's got a camera
3330240	3331240	in their house.
3331240	3335240	Also, it seems like they've kind of taken the Twitch integration to the next level than
3335240	3338560	what you see on PlayStation 4 because you're going to have that chat room on the side that
3338560	3343040	looks a little more like it does on Twitch TV where you have the emote icons, the different
3343040	3345120	colors by people's names.
3345120	3349120	I don't know if this is to maybe enable some of the subscription things where subscribed
3349120	3353320	users get their own emote icons or what, but there's that.
3353320	3358320	The CEO of Twitch, Emmet Shear, told the Associated Press, it is a complete integration.
3358320	3361260	It's exciting because we've never had the ability to broadcast from a console like this
3361260	3363440	with such a deep level of integration.
3363440	3368000	The concept of being able to join a broadcaster's party is really cool, and it's another step
3368000	3373920	in the direction of interacting more closely with broadcasters.
3373920	3378720	No word yet if PlayStation 4's version will be patched or updated to try and compete with
3378720	3379720	this a little bit.
3379720	3382640	We will see.
3382640	3387480	There will also be, and this is kind of a big deal, they're also going to be able to
3387480	3391040	archive the streams on the Xbox One, which is something you can do with Twitch on the
3391040	3392040	PC.
3392040	3397280	For whatever reason, PlayStation 4 streaming will not archive broadcasts right now, and
3397280	3401740	when pressed for comments, Sony wouldn't make a comment on if this is going to change.
3401740	3404880	I sort of think they're going to have to be pressured into it, but my thought was, I thought
3404880	3409440	that was all on Twitch's side, but maybe there's something where Sony's providing some of the
3409440	3410440	oomph?
3410440	3413040	I really don't know.
3413040	3417680	To start streaming to Twitch, apparently all you have to do is say Xbox broadcast, which
3417680	3423940	I'm sure will open up the Xbox Ones to all sorts of trolling, but we'll see.
3423940	3425960	So there you go.
3425960	3430100	I know you don't own an Xbox One Loki, but let's say hypothetically you did.
3430100	3432080	Would you be excited about this Twitch sharing?
3432080	3433960	Would you be using this, or?
3433960	3436420	I don't know if I'd be using it.
3436420	3439240	Even if I had a PlayStation 4, I don't know if I'd be using it.
3439240	3440240	Maybe.
3440240	3441240	I don't know.
3441240	3442240	This is a good time.
3442240	3444120	I've done a limited streaming on the PlayStation 4.
3444120	3445280	It works really well.
3445280	3449560	Like streaming Final Fantasy XIV from my PlayStation 4 is better than the PC, but that just might
3449560	3452040	be the fact that my PC's five years old as well.
3452040	3457360	I guess if someone really wants to watch me play games, I mean, sure, why not?
3457360	3461640	Alright, well before we get to the next story, let's get to the results of the live poll.
3461640	3466040	We asked our live listeners, have you used Steam Family Sharing?
3466040	3470160	That was the question, and the three options were, yes, I use it regularly.
3470200	3472960	I used it once, or nope.
3472960	3474320	Get this, guys.
3474320	3477720	Eighty-two percent, no.
3477720	3479080	Never used it.
3479080	3482080	Fourteen percent, I used it once.
3482080	3486680	And only single digits, probably like one or two people saying, yes, I use it regularly.
3486680	3488040	Fascinating.
3488040	3489920	So there you go.
3489920	3490920	Interesting.
3490920	3495360	So much hype for such a feature that people really don't seem to be using at all.
3495360	3496360	Very interesting.
3496360	3497360	Just pointing that out.
3497560	3501080	Anyhow, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
3501080	3507000	Well this was actually a big rumor going that Blockbuster had been licensed out, that Dish
3507000	3511440	Network licensed Blockbuster brand to Crash Entertainment.
3511440	3517640	This has actually been determined to be incorrect.
3517640	3523280	The story actually came out, it was a few days ago, and then it was updated to say that
3523280	3527200	Dish said, no, we haven't done this.
3527200	3531440	Dish Network and Blockbuster have not entered any sort of licensing agreement.
3531440	3534400	This is for Blockbuster in the UK, by the way.
3534400	3541520	And that Crash Entertainment said that it had a claim that it licensed Blockbuster,
3541520	3545000	and then it looked like it was actually not true either.
3545000	3551660	However, they said they wanted to open ten new Blockbuster stores in 2014.
3551660	3555480	It was on their website, and it has been removed from their website.
3555480	3559440	So no Blockbuster, sorry.
3559440	3562880	So Blockbuster was going to be a thing, and now it's not a thing anymore.
3562880	3563880	Yeah.
3563880	3566960	Subtle would interest some people, you know, in case you wanted to get a, you know...
3566960	3569240	Aren't there still stores here and there?
3569240	3570240	No?
3570240	3571240	No, God, yeah.
3571240	3573680	I guess I was thinking the one that I used to see over on, I know this is going to be
3573680	3577160	lost on non-local people, but there was one over on Greenback and Hazel for the longest
3577160	3578160	time.
3578160	3579160	No, not anymore.
3579160	3580160	It's not there anymore, huh?
3580160	3581160	Yeah, it's closed.
3581160	3582160	Wow.
3582160	3583160	That one that was near my house is gone too.
3583160	3587560	And I mean, we had a friend who was a manager at one, and yeah, they're gone.
3587560	3588560	Interesting.
3588560	3589560	I didn't realize they were all gone.
3589560	3591040	I mean, it makes sense, sadly.
3591040	3592760	Yeah, that ship sank.
3592760	3596760	My first minimum wage job was at a video store, not Blockbuster, but a local chain, which
3596760	3601240	is Blockbuster and Hollywood put that chain under that I used to work for.
3601240	3605000	And then, you know, now it's kind of interesting that Hollywood went under and now Blockbuster
3605000	3606000	went under.
3606000	3609800	So it's just, that's how technology can really change the commerce in our world.
3609800	3610800	So interesting.
3610800	3616280	Alrighty, we have some more stories for you guys, but first we're going to travel around
3616280	3619760	the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming out in a game store
3619760	3620760	near you.
3620760	3621760	And, Logie?
3621760	3623220	Not a whole ton this week.
3623220	3628320	It's pretty much just South Park, The Stick of Truth on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3628320	3636240	Zoo Tycoon, I think, is getting a disc release this week on Xbox One, and they have an XCOM
3636240	3641560	Enemy Unknown Complete Edition coming out on PC, kind of a re-release for that.
3641560	3642560	That is it.
3642560	3646200	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases there.
3646200	3649080	PlayStation 4 is still laying on their launch lineup.
3649080	3652840	There's no new games, really, until mid-March, so we've got a few weeks before we start seeing
3652840	3657220	more on the PlayStation 4, but as a reminder, it is out in Japan, so they are eating up
3657220	3659340	their launch content right now.
3659340	3662780	On the PlayStation 3, however, a little different because we do have some releases, a lot of
3662780	3664340	price reductions, actually.
3664340	3670740	Injustice price reduction, Lord of the Rings, War in the North, F.E.A.R. 3, Biohazard 6,
3670740	3674520	which of course is Resident Evil 6, lots and lots of price reductions, but we do have some
3674520	3675520	new games.
3675520	3681800	Yaeiba, Ninja Gaiden Z, regular, special Ninja, and special Zombie is all coming out.
3681800	3687500	I do not believe this is the same as, like, this isn't canon Ninja Gaiden series, is it?
3687500	3688900	It looks like the art...
3688900	3690180	It's a spinoff.
3690180	3693360	It's like, um, it's done by the guy that did Resident Evil.
3693360	3697740	Because it looks very cel-shaded manga style, so it's not like a part of the main Ninja
3697740	3702300	Gaiden series, it's like a spinoff, cartoony, ultra-violent, it looks like blood everywhere
3702300	3706580	from these pictures, and there's one picture where, I'm assuming this is Ryu or some type
3706580	3711540	of relative, it's basically holding a decapitated cyborg head, yet there's red blood everywhere
3711540	3712540	anyway.
3712540	3713540	Anyway.
3713540	3714540	Hey Rob, it's oil, it's machine oil.
3714540	3716980	Oh, of course, of course, of course.
3716980	3717980	Sure.
3717980	3722220	For those of you guys that like to slash Zombie's Ninja Gaiden style, there you go, that is
3722220	3724980	in Japan this week on March the 6th.
3724980	3729440	Over on the Xbox 360, same thing, Yaeiba, Ninja Gaiden Z seems to be the big release
3729440	3733460	this week, but Biohazard 6 also getting a price reduction there if you missed that for
3733460	3734520	whatever reason.
3734520	3738680	On the PlayStation Vita, Luminous Electronic Symphony gets a price reduction, that of course
3738680	3740180	was one of the launch titles.
3740180	3745180	There's some new SKU coming out, the new slim model welcome box, I'm not sure what all that
3745180	3746180	entails.
3746180	3749380	I'm assuming it must have some different pack-in games, but that is something that is coming
3749380	3754660	out in Japan, or that's like a PlayStation Plus, it looks like it comes with God Eater
3754660	3760100	2, Terraria looks like it's in there, I'm trying to look for this really tiny box art,
3760100	3764380	some type of baseball, one of the baseball simulators, it's just basically, you know,
3764380	3767580	do they have PlayStation Plus in Japan, like we have it here, where they give all the free
3767580	3768580	games?
3768580	3770300	Yeah, I think they have it in Japan.
3770300	3775420	I bet that's part of it, but anyhow, if you've been sitting on a Vita and you're waiting
3775420	3777460	for some extra games, there you go.
3777460	3778460	Waiting for it to hatch?
3778460	3779460	I guess.
3779460	3780460	Sitting on a Vita?
3780460	3781460	You need there to be tons of games out.
3781460	3782460	There you go.
3782460	3786580	Soul Sacrifice Delta also out this week in Japan, and let me check out the other handheld
3786580	3793460	real quick, that would be the 3DS, the 3DS gets Doraemon, Shindobita no Damaekyuu Pekkon
3793460	3800300	no, or excuse me, Pekkoto 5 Nin no Tankinatai comes out this week, cause you know, you love
3800300	3802300	your Doraemon, right?
3802300	3803300	Doraemon!
3803300	3805220	Doraemon is that, if you didn't know, is that-
3805220	3806580	It's the little cat with no ears.
3806580	3809580	Yeah, that blue cat you sometimes see.
3809580	3812100	So Doraemon is so cute.
3812100	3815760	So he gets a new game there on the 3DS this week.
3815760	3819380	Also Anpanman Toa- What?
3819380	3820620	I want this.
3820620	3821620	I do not know what this is.
3821620	3822620	It's Anpanman.
3822620	3823620	No, you don't get it.
3823620	3824620	It's Anpanman.
3824620	3825620	Oh, excuse me.
3825620	3826620	I don't get it.
3826620	3827620	Please.
3827620	3828620	I have a special love of Anpanman.
3828620	3829620	Anpaneducate me, lady.
3829620	3835340	It's a superhero made out of Anpan, which is a delicious, yeasty bread filled with red
3835340	3837580	bean paste.
3837580	3843300	I have a stuffed Anpanman in my art studio room.
3843300	3845580	Okay, so what the hell is this game then?
3845580	3846580	I don't see screenshots.
3846580	3847580	He's a superhero.
3847580	3848580	He's holding a pencil.
3848580	3849580	Does he draw?
3849580	3850580	I don't know what this one is.
3850580	3855100	I don't care cause it's Anpanman and I want it, but I don't have a Japanese 3DS.
3855100	3858380	And the 3DS is region lonk to womp womp.
3859380	3860380	Yeah.
3860380	3861380	No, I love Anpanman.
3861380	3862380	He's so cute.
3862380	3863380	All right.
3863380	3864380	Well, there you go.
3864380	3865380	Those are your Japanese releases.
3865380	3871860	So I guess Dark Saga is going to try to convince Akuma JP to come over.
3871860	3872860	Let me see your 3DS.
3872860	3876300	I like a 3DS and some Anpanman.
3876300	3880220	To be perfectly honest, we actually have a good place in Sacramento that makes fantastic
3880220	3881220	Anpan.
3881220	3887620	And then they also make little chocolate choco-pan in the shape of Anpanman's face, which I
3887860	3890620	think is even more hilarious because they should actually make the Anpan in the shape
3890620	3894260	of Anpanman's face, but nevermind.
3894260	3895860	Meanwhile in the UK, Dark Sagra.
3895860	3897260	Oh yeah, some stuff.
3897260	3901780	On the 5th, we have Dead Nation Apocalypse Edition for PS4.
3901780	3907260	And then on the 7th is Atelier, Escha, and Loggie.
3907260	3911600	South Park, The Stick of Truth on Damned Near Everything Else, and The Dead Rising Collection
3911600	3913460	on Xbox 360.
3913460	3914460	And that's it.
3914460	3915460	All right.
3915500	3918580	All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of
3918580	3919580	the week.
3919580	3920580	Logie.
3920580	3927260	So, real quick, King, the company behind Candy Crush Saga, they've withdrawn their trademark
3927260	3931040	application for candy in the US.
3931040	3933900	They do have Saga, though.
3933900	3934900	That is all.
3934900	3935900	They suck.
3935900	3940580	So in other words, that bad publicity with the whole candy swipe thing really did them
3940580	3941580	in?
3941580	3943180	Because I kind of think that's what it was, but...
3943180	3945180	Yeah, pretty much.
3945900	3948940	Well, is this a good thing or a bad thing?
3948940	3950980	I think it's kind of a loaded question.
3950980	3955300	I don't see how you could say it's a bad thing, but humor me here.
3955300	3958820	Is this a good thing or a bad thing that they lost that trademark over candy?
3958820	3965220	I think it's a no one gives a shit anymore because they suck.
3965220	3966220	I guess that's fair enough.
3966220	3969220	The king is dead.
3969220	3970220	Long live the king?
3970220	3971220	No, no, wait, that's not how it works.
3971220	3974540	No, no, long live the queen.
3974900	3977900	Why wouldn't you dare?
3977900	3978900	No.
3978900	3979900	No.
3979900	3980900	They just need to go away.
3980900	3981900	Okay.
3981900	3982900	Fair enough.
3982900	3983900	All right.
3983900	3984900	Moving on.
3984900	3985900	One more story for you guys.
3985900	3988140	Actually, it's a couple of stories because it's updates.
3988140	3991500	We've been talking about Nintendo systems a little bit tonight, and there are some updates
3991500	3994940	to consider when it comes to the Wii U and the 3DS.
3994940	3996700	A new update for the Wii U went out this week.
3996700	3999700	It's version 4.0.3.
3999700	4004260	Not a whole lot of features, but they do say overall system stability, minor adjustments
4004260	4007700	to enhance the user experience.
4007700	4008700	That's it.
4008700	4012060	No word on was it maybe trying to patch out some type of exploit.
4012060	4014260	I can't remember if we had an exploit article on the Wii U recently.
4014260	4019300	I feel like we did or what they're really trying to do with this, but that is out now.
4019300	4020300	Check that out, I guess.
4020300	4023820	Otherwise, on the 3DS, same deal.
4023820	4030060	Improvements to overall system stability and those same adjustments, so it's very curious
4030060	4033660	what they could really be trying to do there unless they're prepping for something coming
4033660	4037660	in the future, maybe to deliver these virtual console games or who knows, but a lot going
4037660	4038660	on behind the scenes.
4038660	4043060	Of course, the last big upgrade we got on the 3DS bridged the gap between the two, so
4043060	4048140	maybe these firmware updates are to really fix all this with the homogenization of the
4048140	4053340	Nintendo network IDs, and then Miiverse came to the 3DS in the last patch as well, so these
4053340	4057660	seem to be tweaks to probably get the two to play nicely.
4057660	4059380	It sounds likely.
4059380	4063900	Although I didn't notice a problem, but you know, I'm sure somebody figured out a way
4063900	4064900	to do that.
4064900	4065900	There's always problems.
4065900	4066900	People can fix that.
4066900	4067900	Yeah.
4067900	4068900	All right.
4068900	4075380	Well, it is about that time where we go down a trip of memory lane, and there was a time
4075380	4078260	back in the day you didn't get firmware upgrades to your system.
4078260	4081580	When things broke, you blew on the cartridge and prayed.
4081580	4082740	That was a firmware update.
4082740	4086440	It's the classic game of the week.
4086440	4090680	Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,
4090680	4095240	you kids, you totally ignored this flipping game, now go play it.
4095240	4100400	Put down your freaking Call of Duty games and go play a real classic.
4100400	4102520	Dark Soccer is the classic game of the week.
4102520	4111440	The game is Rad Racer, which came out in Japan as Highway Star, and it was done by Square
4111440	4114160	for the Famicom in 1987.
4114160	4121200	And you drive a Ferrari 328 or an F1 racing machine through a different race course.
4121200	4127440	And the music for this game was done by Uematsu, so tune up a little bit.
4127440	4135440	It's just not familiar also to people who've been struck by anything else.
4135440	4136440	It's not familiar?
4136440	4137440	Anyway.
4137440	4139880	I did not realize those two tied together.
4139880	4140880	Really?
4141320	4145000	The 20XD6 thing when he does the anime thing, and he picks the Rad Racer theme as his ending
4145000	4147120	song for his little Strong Bad anime.
4147120	4148600	It's been so long.
4148600	4149600	20XD6.
4149600	4150600	Oh my gosh.
4150600	4153680	Hey, Stickley Man, what are you doing?
4153680	4158080	Hey, Strong Bad, I want to be the guy.
4158080	4159080	No.
4159080	4165920	Anyway, so basically, you just go through driving the game, kind of pole position-like.
4165920	4171920	You can get side swipes, you can crash into stuff, and you can actually crash by hitting
4171920	4174600	other cars too at higher levels.
4174600	4178920	And you also can have your time run out.
4178920	4183760	So basically, it's just still going through, just trying to get from one end of the course
4183760	4184760	to the other.
4184760	4190680	And in Japan, it had a 3D mode that you could use the 3D glasses that came out over there.
4190680	4198160	And also, Square had used that same type of 3D technology with 3D World Runner.
4198160	4205560	And so, the F1 car, by the way, is supposed to look like the Lotus 99T Formula 1 car,
4205560	4211320	but everyone plays the Ferrari, I mean, hello.
4211320	4216720	So yeah, this was, I mean, pretty much one of the most popular racing games by the time
4216720	4217720	it came out.
4217720	4220720	There's been other ones that's been out since.
4220720	4225680	It was also designed by Sakaguchi, I'm just saying, yeah.
4225680	4227920	It was also, you know, with...
4227920	4232000	I didn't realize how much ties to Final Fantasy this game had, but I guess it makes sense.
4232000	4233000	Yep.
4233000	4237240	Well, let's see, like I said, this was one of the few titles that used the Famicom 3D
4237240	4240240	system that had the glasses.
4240240	4248240	And this was actually the game that, at the time, the Square owner, who was Masafumi Miyamoto,
4248240	4255960	used to demonstrate how the 3D programming that was done by Nasser Gabelli, who was the
4255960	4258080	programmer for the game.
4258080	4264840	And there was a North American exclusive sequel, Rad Racer 2, that had...
4264840	4268720	It wasn't really as good as the first Rad Racer, I mean, there's really only one Rad
4268720	4269720	Racer.
4269720	4272720	Which, I actually like the Japanese name better, because Highway Star, you know, there was
4272720	4277240	the song Highway Star, and anyway.
4277240	4283680	This was ranked number 8 on Nintendo Power's Top 30 poll.
4283680	4287600	It's just one of the better racing games that's been out.
4287600	4291700	Like I said, Rad Racer 2, it came out in 1990, it was kind of crap.
4291700	4294000	It played a lot the same, but it really was not as good.
4294000	4299240	It had like a different preview indicator and a turbo boost, no, not good.
4299240	4302780	So yeah, now the 3D that came out in this game, as I mentioned in another one, it was
4302780	4310800	used by 3D Worldrunner, but 3D Worldrunner was not as great of a sale as a seller, and
4310800	4316960	so this is actually what led up to Final Fantasy coming out, done by, you know, again, we had
4316960	4321520	Sakaguchi and Uematsu behind this.
4321520	4323400	So it was their final attempt, right?
4323800	4328360	There was a scene also from this movie that showed up in The Wizard, and that was a scene
4328360	4331840	where Lucas uses the Power Glove to play through the first stage of the game.
4331840	4335760	Did you ever actually get to play these games with the 3D glasses?
4335760	4339640	Because I don't know how many of you got to actually experience these games with 3D glasses,
4339640	4344640	but I actually, a friend of mine had Rad Racer with the 3D glasses, so I remember playing
4344640	4347680	it, and I gotta say, the 3D in Rad Racer actually wasn't very good.
4347680	4351080	I mean, the game, it kind of doesn't lend itself very well to 3D, which I know sounds
4351080	4353760	weird because it's a racing game, but you already kind of have that perspective.
4353760	4358040	Now, 3D Worldrunner, on the other hand, which hopefully you'll cover in another week, because
4358040	4362120	that was a pretty fun game, the 3D in that game was much better, I thought.
4362120	4364680	That's just, that's my personal opinion.
4364680	4372680	Well, just a little bit more about this too.
4372680	4376240	And I like what the article says, that using the Power Glove to play the game was actually
4376240	4381320	considered a feat because of how unreliable the Power Glove was.
4381320	4387320	And Rad Racer is Uematsu's 11th work in video game music composition, and that song was
4387320	4394560	used with vocals for Stinkoman, which was the anime parody that Strong Bad did for Homestar
4394560	4395560	Runner.
4395560	4398520	It was a Strong Bad email.
4398520	4403480	And then there was actually a song released by a group called Workdrugs, a selectropop
4403480	4407840	group called Rad Racer, and it has footage from Rad Racer 2 used in it.
4407840	4410240	So there we go, Rad Racer.
4410240	4413720	You know, I'll thank Dan for this one because I had forgotten about it.
4413720	4416920	Not forgotten about it, but just like, I thought I had done it, and every time he suggested
4416920	4418920	it, I was like, oh, I've done Rad Racer, I've done Rad Racer.
4418920	4423080	No, I haven't done Rad Racer, now I have, so he can hush.
4423080	4424080	There it is.
4424080	4426040	It is rad, it's so rad.
4426040	4430080	Your classic video game of the week, Rad Racer.
4430080	4436520	But the 3D, totally overrated in this game, that was one thing that, no, it sounds a lot
4436520	4439000	cooler than it really was in execution, just saying.
4439000	4443200	Hey, Stinkoman, I hear you're the guy, but I want to be the guy too.
4443200	4444200	Uh, okay.
4444200	4446800	No way, you're just a kid.
4446800	4450320	How old is Strong Bad, aren't those things like 10 years old now at this point?
4450320	4451320	Something like that.
4451320	4452320	So sad.
4452320	4455680	I can't believe I still, actually I'll tell you how I remember it because I just watched
4455680	4456680	it before.
4457480	4461840	Which I'm not, I'm not knocking, that shit was hilarious and like, you know, to find
4461840	4464280	the internet a few years ago, but it's kind of sad.
4464280	4467480	I was raised by a cup of coffee.
4467480	4472120	Remember the Homestar Runner game that was out on, like it was on the Wii and I think
4472120	4473120	PC?
4473120	4474120	Yeah.
4474120	4477000	It's the same company that brought us The Walking Dead years later.
4477000	4478000	Yeah.
4478000	4479000	Funny, funny, funny.
4479000	4481320	All right, anyhow, we are going to take a break guys, when we come back there is plenty
4481320	4486120	more show to come, including your live phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype,
4486120	4488280	Orange Lounge Radio.
4488280	4493400	Also some more stories coming up in part B, including some surprise layoffs.
4493400	4496920	That's never any fun news to talk about, but you know, we got to talk about that because
4496920	4499180	it was, it was a real shocker.
4499180	4503480	In better news, we'll talk about, how about a big media expansion for a free to play game?
4503480	4505000	I think that's a little bit happier news.
4505000	4508200	We'll talk about that when Orange Auditorino comes back right after this.
4508200	4522040	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on March the 2nd of 2014 with the 542nd
4522040	4528280	episode of our program and lots of fun stuff in part A. We had a really kind of Nintendo
4528280	4532040	heavy first half of the show, but it seemed like they had a lot of news going on and some
4532040	4535360	updates on Steam as well with a fun live poll and so forth.
4535360	4539720	If you're just joining us because you gave up on that award show that's on TV, maybe
4539720	4544560	you're pissed off that Miyazaki did not win best animated film as some people on my Facebook
4544560	4549280	friends list seemed to be, but I kind of, kind of, usually those Disney movies tend
4549280	4550280	to win everything, right?
4550280	4554720	Frozen won of course and no surprise there, but you know, sure there's a lot of nerds
4554720	4557200	little pissed off that Miyazaki didn't win, although I do want to see his movie.
4557200	4560520	I don't get out to see a lot of movies, but all the stuff they put out of his is really
4560520	4561520	good.
4561520	4562520	So I want to go out and see that.
4562520	4563520	So we'll see.
4563560	4567840	Anyway, we are going to get into some rapid fire news and of course your calls a little
4567840	4572080	later in the program as well as your emails to our new mailbag over at participate at
4572080	4573080	orangelawnsradio.com.
4573080	4578240	We'll get to the very first email in our new mailbag in just a little bit and joining us
4578240	4580240	over the Skyfline, Loki.
4580240	4581240	Sorry.
4581240	4582240	It's okay.
4582240	4583240	Background noise.
4583240	4586240	If you guys hear random background noise, that's what's going on.
4586240	4587600	Loki won't be on Skype forever.
4587600	4592520	He will come back to the studio soon, probably around the time we move, but obviously baby
4592520	4594200	and family take priority.
4594200	4600000	So we are having him, having him work from home and he's going to work with some rapid
4600000	4601480	fire news right now.
4601480	4604560	Yes, I am.
4604560	4609560	So March PlayStation Plus, they have some more free stuff, of course, for instant game
4609560	4612520	collection, including Tomb Raider.
4612520	4613520	So that's pretty cool.
4613520	4617320	And then a lot of other PlayStation Network games included with that.
4617320	4622480	Thomas Was Alone, Lone Survivor, The Director's Cut, and that's on PlayStation 3.
4622480	4627880	Vita is getting Unit 13 and Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.
4627880	4633600	And then also, I guess, they're operating some sales, I guess, on Hotline, Miami Escape
4633600	4639800	Plan, Flower, Killzone, Mercenary Tales, Mozilla, Dragon's Crown, and Ni No Kuni, as well as
4639800	4640960	other things.
4640960	4644840	No PlayStation 4 stuff, though.
4644840	4649040	I am sorry, Dead Nation Apocalypse Edition is going to be PlayStation 4.
4649040	4650440	I almost missed that there.
4650440	4652960	Yay, two zombie games back to back.
4652960	4655680	There you go, yeah.
4655680	4661560	Atlus has confirmed four new Persona games for North America.
4661560	4665880	So that's kind of cool.
4665880	4668760	They're going to be getting, let's see, I wonder if those are the same ones that they
4668760	4670480	announced not too long ago.
4670480	4675240	Persona Q Shadow Labyrinth for 3DS, which is supposed to be Fall 2014.
4675240	4681440	Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, which is going to be, I guess, a re-release of Persona 4 Arena
4681440	4685840	that's enhanced, that's going to be coming out in 2014 as well, towards the end of the
4685840	4686840	year.
4686840	4692540	2015, they've got Persona 4 Dancing All Night, which I guess is a music game.
4692540	4699160	And Persona 5, which would be coming sometime into PlayStation 3 in 2015.
4699160	4705040	Also not to be left out, Xbox, the games with gold, are going to be getting two games
4705040	4710280	for the month of March, starting off with Civ Revolution.
4710280	4716040	So that's going to be pretty cool, and Dungeon Defenders, which is the Xbox Live Arcade game.
4716040	4720040	Civilization Revolution is going to be free through March 16th, and of course, Dungeon
4720040	4723560	Defenders is going to be after that for the remainder of the month.
4723560	4728280	So Rob, Civ Rev, is that a good one to start off with, because I actually haven't played
4728280	4729640	any Civ games at all.
4729640	4732520	I think Civ Rev is a great one to start out with.
4732520	4736000	I know some people had its issues with it because of the way it translates to controller
4736000	4740560	play, but to me, Civilization Revolution has a lot in common with the very, very first
4740560	4742840	Civilization game, which is still one of my favorites.
4742840	4747600	I think a dumbed down, using my quoting fingers, a dumbed down Civilization game is not necessarily
4747600	4748960	a bad thing.
4748960	4753020	It kind of gets you, you know, kind of into the series and what it's all about.
4753020	4757400	And if you like it, then you can step up and play, you know, Civ 4, Civ 5, or one of the
4757400	4760000	newer ones, which Civ 5 is still great.
4760000	4763360	If you didn't grab it during that Sid Meier Humble Bundle, though, I don't know what to
4763360	4767120	tell you, because that was your chance and you blew it, if you didn't get the Sid Meier
4767120	4768120	Bundle.
4768120	4769120	I did not.
4769120	4770120	Well, you blew it.
4770120	4771120	That's alright.
4771120	4772120	It'll be on sale.
4772120	4774960	The only one I wanted to play was Civ 5, out of the whole bunch.
4774960	4780600	So I didn't really feel the need to spend more than $10 on it.
4780600	4783720	I understand, I understand.
4783720	4788160	And last but not least, you had another game getting Zombie DLC, but this one's a little
4788160	4789160	strange.
4789160	4790640	Warehouse and Logistics Simulator.
4790640	4791940	It's a sim game.
4791940	4794560	It's getting Zombie DLC.
4794560	4796240	And that's just kind of silly.
4796240	4797440	Wait, that's a real game.
4797440	4799560	There's a game called Warehouse and Logistics Simulator?
4799560	4800560	I've never heard of this.
4800560	4801560	Yes, there is.
4801560	4803960	These are some of the games that are more popular on Steam.
4803960	4807480	You may not realize it, like Farming Sim and stuff like that, just because it's kind of
4807480	4808480	strange.
4808480	4813420	Or what about the Euro Truck Driver Simulator 2 or that crazy shit.
4813420	4816500	And this is not the only game that I know that's in the Simulator series that's actually
4816500	4817500	gotten Zombie DLC.
4817500	4820180	If I remember correctly, I want to see one of the Train Sim games.
4820180	4827020	Either it was a mod or DLC that did get Zombie DLC or something for it.
4827020	4828020	It was kind of silly.
4828020	4833500	But yeah, it has you driving through a warehouse in a forklift trying to escape zombies.
4833500	4836380	I don't know, it's just strange.
4836380	4842900	But I guess you mow down the undead, they say they can get bombs, mines, and other weapons
4842940	4845140	to help you clear out the zombies.
4845140	4848860	Hey, you gotta know your audience, or at least maybe that might get a few more people to
4848860	4854100	try Warehouse and Logistics Simulator, which, that's gotta be a pretty niche audience right
4854100	4855620	there.
4855620	4861300	Over at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Hitstun says Euro Truck 2 is great, Honk!
4861300	4862300	Is that a...
4862300	4864340	I'll have to check out the game at some point.
4864340	4867940	And SSJ100Matt referring, I think, to the background noise, SSJ100Matt wants to know
4867940	4871940	what's for dinner, and did you bring enough for the class, Loki?
4871980	4874980	That was my wife cooking dinner, so I don't know.
4874980	4875980	Alright, fair enough.
4875980	4879500	Alright, I got some news for you guys, moving on.
4879500	4883740	This was a little bit controversial last week, some talk about Metal Gear Solid V Ground
4883740	4888380	Zeroes, which again, was supposed to be kind of like that, I don't want to call it like
4888380	4892300	the starter chapter, but I guess that's really what it is, it was supposed to be a short
4892300	4896620	kind of Metal Gear Solid game, very short Metal Gear Solid game, that was gonna kind
4896620	4900500	of tide us over until Phantom Pain was released, and it was only supposed to be a couple hours.
4900540	4905380	Well, they were gonna release the game for $40, however, the physical PlayStation 4 and
4905380	4911060	Xbox One versions had their price cut this week, down to $30, and in a statement the
4911060	4915780	company said they wanted to, quote, provide as many people as possible an opportunity
4915780	4918040	to play the game.
4918040	4921820	In other words, you guys weren't having that shit.
4921820	4927220	It's really fascinating how the internet kind of turned the price of that game around, that's
4927220	4931880	pretty awesome there, so, well, I mean, I don't know, I say it's awesome, but maybe,
4931880	4935780	you know, if the game is to make a profit for Konami, maybe it's not so awesome, I don't
4935780	4936780	know.
4936780	4941780	But we'll see, a lot of people seem to be happy with the news nonetheless.
4941780	4946860	The 3DS over at Nintendo is gonna be having a promotion that will allow you a free download
4946860	4949420	of Pokemon X or Y.
4949420	4955860	That's right, when you get a new Nintendo 3DS or 3DS XL or even a 2DS system, as well
4955860	4961940	as one of six select games to a club Nintendo account, you get a free download code for
4961940	4963700	Pokemon X or Y.
4963700	4968140	This is only between March 1st and 31st, and the eligible games are Mario Kart 7, Super
4968140	4972540	Mario 3D Land, Animal Crossing, if you want to experience Ed in your town, just like Dark
4972540	4973540	Soccer did.
4973540	4974740	I would not wish that on anyone.
4974740	4978860	Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Lego City Undercover, and Yoshi's New Island.
4978860	4983380	If you get one of those six games and a new 3DS, you tie them to your club Nintendo account,
4983380	4986820	Nintendo's gonna give you a download code for Pokemon X or Y, and you gotta use it by
4986820	4989620	May 31st, 2014.
4989620	4995980	I guess, who isn't a fan of free games, but my thought is, I thought everybody who wanted
4995980	5001580	Pokemon X or Y, they fucking got their 3DS by now so they could experience this.
5001580	5007300	I guess maybe there's some holdouts, and if you were one of the holdouts, congrats.
5007300	5009260	Free game for you.
5009260	5011480	So there you go, that promotion throughout March.
5013660	5017380	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com,
5017380	5019420	use the passphrase, turkey.
5019420	5023420	And lastly, from me, new Tony Hawk game.
5023420	5026860	When was the last time you heard about us talking about a new Tony Hawk game?
5026860	5027860	It's been a little while.
5027860	5028860	Isn't he like 50?
5028860	5034100	Probably, hey, you're never too old to skate, I don't know, I gotta know.
5034100	5036780	Well they just have the HD one came out.
5036780	5040540	Yeah, I thought there was like one not that long ago, but wasn't the beginning of the
5040540	5045620	end when they put out that like $100 skateboard thing, because they thought since Guitar
5045620	5049860	Hero worked and people bought that peripheral, people would buy the, yeah, it didn't quite
5049860	5050860	work out for him.
5050860	5057860	Well, Tony Hawk is returning, but get this, it's a mobile phone game, womp womp.
5057860	5061820	Tony Hawk talking to Bloomberg said, we're working on a game for mobile devices this
5061820	5062820	year.
5062820	5065820	We've never gone exclusively in that direction, so I'm excited because with the amount of
5065820	5069460	time people are spending on their phones and their tablets playing games, we've never had
5069460	5070620	our own game in that space.
5070620	5072740	I'm excited to provide one finally.
5072740	5077460	Well, that ought to get all two of you who care about that, a Tony Hawk game on your
5077460	5078460	mobile phone.
5078460	5079580	Look, I'm not shading the Tony Hawk series.
5079580	5082220	They were great games, but they're just, they're going to suck on a mobile phone.
5082220	5083220	Let's just keep it real.
5083220	5084660	It's going to suck.
5084660	5085660	Sorry.
5085660	5087100	Not in the fun kind of way.
5087100	5088180	That's right.
5088180	5091260	Well, how about some different gaming news?
5091260	5092660	How about it?
5093060	5100020	Well, there's something coming out about a potential Minecraft movie done by the Lego
5100020	5108140	movie producer, and I don't know how I feel about that, but Notch basically said that
5108140	5110180	there was a talk going on about it.
5110180	5116860	They're working with Warner Brothers about a potential Minecraft movie, so whatever.
5117260	5125100	Also, Retro Studios is saying that the Wii U is a powerhouse and is confirming that they're
5125100	5129940	developing a game for it, but they haven't really said what exactly, but they're able
5129940	5136060	to use, they're learning new HD techniques like pixel shading and stuff and things and
5136060	5138860	that they loved working with Donkey Kong.
5138860	5141380	So maybe that will be cool.
5141380	5145020	Now I want to say that the reason why you're on the fence with the whole Minecraft movie
5145020	5151620	thing is because you probably haven't gone to see the Lego movie yet, which is a travesty.
5151620	5152620	At some point I'll get out.
5152620	5153620	I kind of don't care about the Lego movie.
5153620	5156020	Weren't we supposed to have a friend date?
5156020	5160020	We were, and it just didn't happen because, you know, move and busyness and stuff.
5160020	5162020	Aww, hi kitty.
5162020	5163020	Sorry.
5163020	5164020	Simbio came out.
5164020	5166020	You got distracted by cats?
5166020	5167020	Kitty.
5167020	5168020	Fair enough.
5168020	5171620	I just heard meh, meh, meh, meh.
5171620	5177180	And then the Konami code works in Bravely Default.
5177180	5183500	It's basically supposed to work once you've completed the game, but there's a clip about
5183500	5184780	what happens.
5184780	5190220	It's online somewhere, so that's kind of cool.
5190220	5192900	And for those who don't know, I'm not going to tell you because you should fucking know
5192900	5193900	this.
5193900	5194900	I'm kidding.
5194900	5196780	It's up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.
5196780	5197780	On the main menu.
5197780	5198780	No, you should know that.
5198780	5199780	Don't tell them that.
5199780	5202420	Unless you're playing Parodius, then you do it backwards.
5202420	5203420	Okay.
5203420	5206320	Or if you're playing, which one was it where you had to use the L, R on top of the Super
5206320	5208020	Nintendo controller, it blew up your ship?
5208020	5209020	Was that Gradius III maybe?
5209020	5210020	Maybe Gradius III?
5210020	5211020	Yeah.
5211020	5213020	Yeah, something like that.
5213020	5214020	Alright.
5214020	5219740	Well, if that's it for our rapid fire news, then we shall take a trip over to Facebook
5219740	5228180	and Google Plus, so when you slam those words together, you get FUGL.
5230780	5232620	It's the FUGL question of the week, everybody.
5232620	5237700	We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we get answers, your
5237700	5243420	answers over on those various sites, and we're going to start off tonight with some of the
5243420	5248400	answers from Google Plus to our question, and I got to say, things got a little weird
5248400	5258420	on Google Plus this week, and I'm seeing people answer who I never see answer, and some of
5258460	5263220	it was getting a little heated, which I'm kind of not okay with, so just remember, everybody,
5263220	5267220	treat each other with respect over on Google Plus, and now for some reason I can't get
5267220	5268220	the post to come up.
5268220	5269220	That's not good.
5269220	5271220	That's a little embarrassing when we're doing live radio.
5271220	5272220	Where is it?
5272220	5273220	There it is.
5273220	5274220	Phew.
5274220	5278820	Yeah, see, just to put it out there, we have 16 responses on Google Plus, and I think that's
5278820	5281500	more than we have on Facebook.
5281500	5283760	That's not normal.
5283760	5284760	Something happened there.
5284760	5285760	This is not expected behavior.
5285760	5287220	This is not expected behavior.
5287220	5291860	I don't know what's up with that, but regardless, strangers were jumping in there telling each
5291860	5294500	other that opinions were wrong and stuff, and I'm not okay with that.
5294500	5296460	This is where every gamer has a voice.
5296460	5298020	Let them be heard.
5298020	5299900	Act Def starts us off with a haiku.
5299900	5303220	Well, I'll read his full response since he took the time to give a haiku as well.
5303220	5305220	Oh, I didn't even read the damn question.
5305220	5306220	Sorry, guys.
5306220	5310980	How do you feel about the news that Nintendo is pulling online support for DS and Wii games
5310980	5312100	in a couple months?
5312100	5315220	Will you misplay Mario Kart Wii online, or do you think it's best that these servers
5315220	5316940	come down to make way for the future?
5317500	5320900	An Act Def over on Google Plus said, well, with these games getting old, it was so little
5320900	5324940	people playing them, it was only a matter of time for the servers to be shut down, specifically
5324940	5328500	since Nintendo probably wants to save money rather than lose it right now.
5328500	5332300	It's sad, but I think it's time to move on, people, and here's the haiku.
5332300	5333700	Servers are shut down.
5333700	5336060	New games are coming soon now.
5336060	5338500	Nintendo needs cash.
5338500	5342660	Jake F. replied on Google Plus, and he's a little mad about this situation.
5342660	5343660	He's upset.
5343660	5344660	Sounds a little upset.
5344700	5347460	Jake says, I have no purpose for playing Smash Brothers now.
5347460	5348460	Thanks a ton, Nintendo.
5348460	5349780	Nintendo, I support you.
5349780	5351300	I swim against the current for you.
5351300	5353060	I get made fun of because of you.
5353060	5356820	I'm among the few to fend you in front of the masses of PlayStation and Microsoft fanboys,
5356820	5358540	and this is what I get?
5358540	5361180	Guess it really is time for a PlayStation 3.
5361180	5368020	Okay, overdramatization added by me, but it is Oscar night, everybody, for your consideration.
5368020	5369900	Did you never learn to read?
5369900	5372500	I'm thinking Jake was playing Smash Bros.
5372500	5373940	We ask, who's still playing online?
5373940	5376860	Well, Jake is apparently playing Smash Bros. online.
5376860	5379900	He's a little heated, so there you go.
5379900	5382540	He might jump ship over to PlayStation 3.
5382540	5385700	Redertainment says, online foreign to Big N.
5385700	5388740	I don't care about Big N's shut down plans.
5388740	5390060	Yet another haiku answer.
5390060	5392860	I'm loving this, you guys, loving it.
5392860	5394940	Let's see, some other answers here.
5394940	5399940	Matt D. replied and said, it stinks, but they need the server space for their other newer
5399940	5400940	games.
5400940	5406340	Maintaining the old ones along with the new ones would cost a ton of money.
5406340	5411700	Zordrac Shadowfang, and I'm sure that's his real name, said, it's the price of online
5411700	5413540	servers to handle multiplayer.
5413540	5415340	Eventually, they get shut down.
5415340	5420940	At least these games otherwise still work offline in both single player and local multiplayer.
5420940	5425380	And lastly, AJ Twist replies and said, eh, it's more proof than Nintendo doesn't understand
5425380	5426380	online.
5426380	5428220	But maybe something good will come of this?
5428220	5429220	We'll see.
5429220	5431340	There's some of the answers over from Google Plus.
5431340	5435380	I was not going to read answers from people that were like, you know, thank you for your
5435380	5437980	insightful commentary and just kind of weird stuff.
5437980	5440500	So I wonder how that happened.
5440500	5444580	Is that because Google Plus like automatically tags things so it went out to a more public
5444580	5445580	audience?
5445580	5446580	I don't even know.
5446580	5447580	Whatevers.
5447580	5452780	Moving on to some of our answers over on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5452780	5453780	We had quite a few answers.
5453780	5457700	I'm only going to read a handful of these, so I apologize in advance, but I encourage
5457700	5461340	you to check out all the answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5461340	5466020	Monty Boggs says, I won't miss them, but it does seem like convenient timing considering
5466020	5469000	Mario Kart 8 comes out a week or so after that.
5469000	5472560	Something we had brought up on the show earlier.
5472560	5476800	Our friend Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network says, the fact that Nintendo is ending their
5476800	5480260	online services for Wii and DS isn't surprising.
5480260	5484160	Most games and services tend to sever servers after some years, especially when the newest
5484160	5485580	iteration releases.
5485580	5489460	What is surprising is the sudden urgency that's being done.
5489460	5493420	On May 20th, the 3DS will have been out for three years and the Wii U only a year and
5493420	5494420	a half.
5494420	5498060	I know that seems like a decent grace period, but if the sales numbers are correct, I doubt
5498060	5503820	the Wii's 101 million owners have all upgraded, given the Wii U's almost 6 million sold.
5503820	5507040	I'm not saying they should keep the Wii servers on forever, but I think they should keep them
5507040	5511300	up a little bit longer, at least until the chasm-like gap has closed up a bit more.
5511300	5513780	But you know what's interesting about it, I mean it's not that I disagree with what
5513780	5517900	we could say in here, but, and it's kind of a question we ask ourselves in general,
5517900	5522660	are these gaming companies under any liability to keep these servers up a certain time?
5522660	5523660	They're really not.
5523660	5524660	I don't think so.
5524660	5525660	We're at their mercy.
5525660	5528340	Which, as a consumer, kind of sucks.
5528340	5531140	That isn't unexpected.
5531140	5536020	It's not, but I mean at what point do we say, god damn it, this is what I paid for and it
5536020	5537560	ought to work.
5537560	5540420	This is what I paid for eight years ago, and it ought to work.
5540420	5541420	No?
5541420	5542420	No.
5542940	5547720	This mixing board we bought eight years ago, and if it broke tomorrow, I'm not just going
5547720	5551540	to be like, oh well, you know, well Radio Shack took it offline.
5551540	5554140	Well we didn't get it at Radio Shack, we ordered it from the manufacturer.
5554140	5555140	You know what I mean!
5555140	5557140	Yeah, I know.
5557140	5558140	Anyway.
5558140	5564760	Uh, let's see, and uh, let's see, our power in A says, this move was inevitable, I think,
5564760	5566880	and telling of what's to come for Nintendo.
5566880	5570660	Dropping the Wi-Fi connection for the DS and Wii really is the sign that Nintendo is moving
5570660	5575140	forward and will soon discontinue manufacturing and support for those two systems.
5575140	5576140	Who knows?
5576140	5579500	Maybe this means Nintendo is at least thinking of their next console system?
5579500	5582260	Well, Rene, they're definitely thinking about it.
5582260	5585020	They plan that stuff years and years in advance.
5585020	5586800	There's probably already early prototypes.
5586800	5588900	That's how long these things take to develop, honestly.
5588900	5593060	We had those rumors a couple weeks ago, for better or for worse, about the more homogenized
5593060	5599860	Nintendo experience, but again, it's weird to me that they're dropping DS when they're
5599860	5602420	just gonna bring it out again over on the virtual consoles.
5602420	5603420	Little weird.
5603420	5604420	Little weird.
5604420	5609100	Uh, lastly, Giove Dea says, it's not expected, and as long as I can still play the DLC content
5609100	5613660	without Wi-Fi, I'm okay, mainly because I haven't used it, even with owning the games.
5613660	5616900	At least with the DS, there's still the option of local play, right?
5616900	5620780	Yep, that is true, and that's gonna have to suffice for those of you guys that decide
5620780	5622860	to spend the money on the games.
5622860	5626100	Alright, that's gonna do it for now for the FUCL Question of the Week.
5626100	5629500	And please read all the responses, because they're really good, over at Facebook.com
5629500	5631620	slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5631620	5634460	Let's get back into some gaming news with Loki.
5634460	5641580	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, eh, Zynga.
5641580	5648940	They had a lawsuit, or I guess, a fraud lawsuit, which unfortunately was dismissed, and because
5648940	5655340	of this, now the plaintiffs plan to change their complaint.
5655580	5663060	Basically, the original complaint, which was 110 pages long, failed to offer relevant basic
5663060	5671580	factual details, which I'd say is kind of an important part of any sort of lawsuit.
5671580	5678540	They're also saying that because of that, they're going to, I guess, resubmit with some
5678540	5680700	further evidence and that kind of stuff.
5680700	5686340	My thing this has to do with, I want to say, they were talking about maybe their initial
5686340	5689660	stock offering and stuff like that.
5689660	5694740	Don't know if it's necessarily, you know, nothing to do with, of course, their cloning
5694740	5699780	of games or anything like that, but maybe some insider trading.
5699780	5700780	I don't know.
5700780	5706660	Sounds all very complicated, if I don't like Zynga.
5706660	5707660	It is a little bit.
5707700	5712980	Well, I think the IPO fraud thing is, basically, long story short, they said the company was
5712980	5715060	worth more than it really was.
5715060	5718980	And again, that kind of goes back to the whole flash in the pan thing, is that Zynga was
5718980	5723620	riding a huge high when they went for the IPO and the bubble burst, and maybe some people
5723620	5726420	believe that they kind of should have seen that coming.
5726420	5728540	Well, look at it this way.
5728540	5736060	They're trying to do, it's almost like King is following Zynga's game plan almost.
5736140	5742140	They had a flash in the pan game come out, and now they have all these games with Saga
5742140	5743300	at the end.
5743300	5747780	They're kind of using Saga as almost their vill, if you will.
5747780	5753860	And that's the thing with any of these companies, especially nowadays, that yeah, at one time
5753860	5758740	it may be worth X amount of dollars, but it doesn't mean that these games are making that
5758740	5761300	kind of money indefinitely.
5761300	5765980	It's just, people eventually move on to the next big thing.
5765980	5770020	Or even the next just popular thing.
5770020	5773300	We experience a very fickle market.
5773300	5775380	Indeed.
5775380	5778060	It's very casual, no one's really dedicated.
5778060	5784460	Alright, well, speaking of it being a fickle market, this was very surprising.
5784460	5788060	Some layoffs occurring at Sony Santa Monica.
5788100	5792300	These are the guys that develop God of War, and obviously there's going to be another
5792300	5793780	God of War game in the pipeline.
5793780	5794780	That's not a surprise.
5794780	5798180	So it's a little weird to me, especially when PlayStation is kind of riding a high right
5798180	5800060	now, that there are layoffs at the studio.
5800060	5804100	And I want to say, didn't they just have some PR layoffs and things like that a while ago?
5804100	5808740	So this is really weird that this struggle is happening, I guess, at Sony Santa Monica.
5808740	5814420	But yes, Sony did put out a statement, a nice little PC statement that said, Sony Computer
5814420	5818500	Entertainment America can confirm that we have completed a reduction in workforce at
5818500	5819500	Santa Monica Studio.
5819500	5823860	This is the result of a cycle of resource realignment against priority growth areas
5823860	5826560	within SCEWWS.
5826560	5830380	We do not take these decisions lightly, however, sometimes it is necessary to make changes
5830380	5834180	to better serve the future projects of the studio.
5834180	5837960	We have offered outplacement services and severance packages to ease transition for
5837960	5839220	those impacted.
5839220	5843740	So I get the sense from this, and the rumors are definitely out there, that Sony was working
5843740	5845820	on something that got canceled.
5845820	5847640	And this is a result of that.
5847640	5852540	And if you want to further believe rumors, again, huge salt lick of salt.
5852540	5857140	But some rumors that are out there is that it was a project that was very similar to
5857140	5863340	Destiny and didn't look like it was going to compete well with it, I guess, at the end
5863340	5864340	of the day.
5864340	5866300	I don't really know how else to easily put that.
5866300	5870820	But again, rumor, huge rumor, take it with a grain of salt.
5870820	5876220	But regardless, it is really odd to see such a big studio that produces titles like God
5876220	5878780	of War going through these reductions.
5878780	5883260	And even more so when you consider it's coming a week after we just heard about a similar
5883260	5887160	thing from a studio we didn't expect, Irrational Games, right?
5887160	5890740	So this begs the question, what the hell is going on?
5890740	5892780	Loki, any thoughts?
5892780	5894980	What the hell is going on?
5894980	5896260	I don't know.
5896260	5899460	Well, Irrational, we know what the situation was, is that they just wanted to go a different
5899460	5900460	direction.
5900460	5906100	Sony, Santa Monica, maybe they just have a, I don't know, there's downsizing, maybe they
5906100	5912140	have another team that's going to be working on God of War, I don't really know.
5912140	5917500	Well, still sad to hear, and I doubt we have anybody who worked for them that was impacted
5917500	5922540	listening to the show, but just in case we do, and this goes for Irrational or any studio
5922540	5925140	that we report in, our thoughts are with you guys.
5925140	5929380	And it does sound like a lot of people were after those guys at Irrational, so it seems
5929380	5932960	like there are jobs available somewhere, I just hope you can find them in a place that
5932960	5936060	works for you and your family, and best of luck.
5936060	5938260	Sorry to hear about that, it's no fun.
5938260	5939460	That's poopy.
5939460	5944180	So what if the game was similar to Destiny, you know what, we've had similar games coexist
5944180	5946460	for a long time and it works out.
5946460	5950300	Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
5950300	5956720	Well there's some other news that, it could be bad news for some people, it could be decent
5956720	5962480	news for others, but you know how we were talking about how there was the regulation
5962480	5967960	going about those multiple little transactions that happen in games?
5967960	5972600	Now there are meetings going on with representatives from the UK, France, Belgium, Denmark, and
5972600	5980800	other EU members to go about creating rules for about apps that ask for how much and when
5980800	5984520	these apps can ask for payment information.
5984520	5992120	They've also got representatives from multiple different developers including Nintendo, Electronic
5992120	5998800	Arts, Google, a few others, basically trying to make sure that these games are not misleading
5998800	6002000	or exploit the market.
6002000	6005400	So we'll see how that goes.
6005400	6008280	I wonder if we would ever have anything like that here.
6008280	6016120	But it's basically going to be a, you know, this is coming right after the UK group, which
6016120	6023000	is the Office of Fair Trading, was basically saying, you know, hey, get it in order or
6023000	6025560	we're going to enforce it.
6025560	6030200	So don't know how it's going to happen.
6030200	6031780	We'll see, won't we?
6031780	6032780	We will.
6032780	6035920	Or they will, I don't know.
6035920	6039680	And of course, if they have to change something for Europe, it's going to impact everybody
6039680	6040680	else.
6040680	6042400	Well, not necessarily, but it probably will.
6042400	6043400	We'll see.
6043400	6049440	We might actually see them proactively working in the U.S. market to, you know, let's get
6049440	6052200	it done now before we get it forced on us.
6052200	6055460	All right, moving on, Loki.
6055460	6062280	So South Park, the Stick of Truth, unfortunately was censored in certain countries.
6062280	6067800	They basically said that there's five versions of the game, one for North America, South
6067800	6072040	America, Europe, Germany, Australia, and Russia.
6072040	6076160	The North America, South America one is completely uncensored on every platform, the Australia
6076160	6081640	one is censored on all platforms, or the Australia one is censored on all platforms, European
6081640	6086880	one and Russian ones are censored on console only, and the German one is censored on the
6086880	6090360	console for anal probing, et cetera.
6090360	6096720	And so, but the way they got about it is kind of, if you remember the South Park episodes
6096720	6101480	where they were showing, supposed to be showing the image of Mohammed, and it was just kind
6101480	6107520	of like, you know, this thing with a text box saying, you know, we would have shown
6107520	6114480	an image of Mohammed, but oh, well, so they have a, they have this image that pops up
6114480	6115480	as well.
6115480	6119920	You lose again Europe, this scene where you try to disable the force field around Randy,
6119960	6123680	but instead accidentally force the probing machine next to him to probe his ass with
6123680	6126760	a violent force is not meant for your eyes.
6126760	6129920	Randy, in obvious rectal pain, urges you to proceed onward.
6129920	6130920	Wow.
6130920	6137720	So they explain all this stuff in there, but yeah, I mean, unfortunately it's just stuff
6137720	6144320	that they have to do to get around, you know, certain laws for decency and stuff, but yeah,
6145320	6150200	I mean, if it's that much of a bother for you, and you do live in those countries, remember
6150200	6155520	the PlayStation 3 is region free, so import away.
6155520	6161720	Ooh, that's a good thought, that you could just, if you want to get around censorship,
6161720	6162720	just import from another country.
6162720	6165160	Do you think there would be a lot of people that actually do that, now that they know
6165160	6166960	that that's out there?
6166960	6168960	Probably not.
6168960	6170880	Interesting.
6171440	6175440	I know if it was my country, I would, but then again, importing games can be expensive.
6175440	6180440	All right, moving on, we were talking about free-to-play games a minute ago, and one of
6180440	6184040	my favorites that came along last year, which a lot of people were talking about, is Path
6184040	6185040	of Exile.
6185040	6190480	Path of Exile is a Diablo-esque style game that came out from Grinding Gear Games, and
6190480	6193200	apparently it's been doing very well for itself.
6193200	6197840	They've held very strong to the standard that they're going to do ethical free-to-play,
6197840	6204240	meaning that they don't sell experience boosts, they don't sell weapon upgrades, they sell
6204240	6210560	like flashy things, like pets and cosmetic stuff only, and apparently it's been working
6210560	6211560	out for them.
6211560	6215840	This developer who is based in New Zealand, they have over 5 million registered players,
6215840	6219400	hundreds of thousands playing at any given time, and they just announced this week an
6219400	6224280	expansion, the Sacrifice of Vaal, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, V-A-A-L, Vaal, is
6224280	6227600	coming out next week, free!
6227600	6233200	PVP content, a new race of dark magic wielders, and you can charge up super-powered weapons
6233200	6238520	by killing monsters, but no change to the monetization property, excuse me, no change
6238520	6243200	to the monetization policy, and lead designer Chris Wilson says we don't want to compromise
6243200	6247720	the game, we want to make a really good game that people love to play.
6247720	6251380	So it seems like it's working out for them.
6251380	6256440	They do kind of mention that we could make more money if we were to do more of the pay-to-win
6256440	6263080	model, but people apparently are into the cosmetic stuff, they like to show off, and
6263080	6266760	it's because people view this as a bit of a hobby.
6266760	6273280	And they, in the Path of Exile store, they sell a big blue scorpion for $110, and they've
6273280	6275200	actually sold a few hundred of those.
6275200	6276800	You got the money, hey.
6276800	6281080	Yeah, if you got the money and you want to support the game enough, I mean, in a way,
6281080	6285080	it's kind of like, you know, people give thousands of dollars to these Kickstarter projects for
6285080	6289000	games, I think, just for an opportunity to be involved and so forth, so if people have
6289000	6292160	that type of money to give to something they really believe in.
6292160	6294520	How many of us bought charity pets for a while?
6294520	6296240	Yeah, well, because that was charity.
6296240	6302160	Well, yeah, but still, I mean, it's the investing money into something you would support, right?
6302160	6303160	Right.
6303160	6306760	There's people who buy the pets for a while just because, hey pet, not just the charity
6306760	6307760	pets.
6307760	6311680	And to be fair, I mean, $110, I mean, that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, don't
6311680	6317480	get me wrong, but it's also, what, two copies of a new video game?
6317480	6321480	That's the price of two regular video games, and Path of Exile is a game that some people
6321480	6324800	are getting hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours out of, so is that really
6324800	6325860	that much money?
6325860	6326860	Maybe not.
6326860	6331440	A game like World of Warcraft, I mean, over a year's time for a $12 subscription fee,
6331440	6338320	shit, you've paid $144, so is $110 scorpion really that crazy?
6338320	6339320	Maybe not.
6339320	6345760	Anyway, so yeah, if you're into Path of Exile, check that out for the new expansion that's
6345760	6346760	coming out this week.
6346760	6348040	I know I will be checking that out, too.
6348040	6351320	I hope the game doesn't crush under that, all those people wanting to check it out.
6351320	6352320	We'll see.
6352320	6357000	All right, Loki, you've got one more story for us before we get to the mailbag.
6357000	6365400	Yeah, real quick, Apple TV, we've been saying, hey, you know, if Apple adds games to Apple
6365400	6367520	TV, that could be a killer device.
6367520	6371920	Well, another one of these rumors coming out saying, you know, reliable industry sources
6371920	6379400	say that Apple TV will be getting game support in an update likely to come in March or earlier.
6379400	6384600	Well, I'm going to say at this point it's going to be March because, you know, we're
6384600	6385600	in March.
6385600	6392280	But they're saying that apparently developers are working on Bluetooth controller options
6392280	6398120	and, you know, they're saying that could, you know, work directly with Apple TV rather
6398120	6403020	than relying on another iOS device as an intermediary.
6403020	6406480	And basically saying that, you know, game support could be backwards compatible with
6406480	6412440	current generation Apple TV, although, you know, they would expect that, you know, you
6412440	6420760	would want maybe iCloud support because the Apple TVs don't really have much storage space.
6420760	6422720	It'd be interesting if they did that.
6422720	6423720	I don't know.
6423720	6425480	I thought the Apple TVs weren't that powerful.
6425480	6427600	So maybe if they release a new version.
6427600	6434040	Well, but they've got to be about as powerful as Sanuya, let's be real, right?
6434040	6437960	That's true, but I would think that maybe they're going to maybe release a new version
6437960	6441720	or something because, you know, if you want to show off like, you know, HD gaming or something
6441720	6446200	like that, I would think that maybe like a new version of Apple TV or something for maybe
6446200	6448340	200 bucks would be interesting.
6448340	6452480	It does seem about that time of year where Tim Cook ought to get up on the stage and
6452480	6455220	talk about what's happening over at Apple.
6455220	6458940	I know, you know, because we usually have the iPhone thing and that's later in the year
6458940	6462140	or God, then they started kind of flipping the script and it was earlier in the year
6462140	6465060	for a little bit, but iPads were usually early in the year.
6465060	6468340	Like I do feel like, hmm, it's been a good four or five months since we've had a big
6468340	6472940	Apple pump and circumstance, you know, and Apple TV would be a thing that you'd think
6472940	6473940	they would update.
6473940	6477660	Although, I would be very curious, like, what else is Apple working on?
6477660	6483020	There's been buzz for a very long time, you know, because it seems, correct me if I'm
6483020	6488020	wrong, but it seems like ever since Tim Cook took over, we haven't really seen new per
6488020	6489020	se.
6489020	6494220	I mean, we've seen improvements to existing things like iPhone and iPad and so forth,
6494220	6497340	but there's been rumblings forever now that, oh, Apple's going to get into television and
6497340	6499180	Apple's going to get into this or that.
6499180	6500220	And we haven't seen that yet.
6500220	6505820	And I think a lot of us are really waiting for like, what's Apple's next card to play?
6505980	6511660	Well, I think, yeah, they're trying to get into new spaces, basically, instead of, you
6511660	6514900	know, trying to put out something else.
6514900	6520620	I would be very skeptical that they would put out a TV, just because TV technology is
6520620	6525380	changing so much and, you know, the price point of a TV that was, you know, would have
6525380	6527020	some sort of Apple integration on it.
6527020	6530460	I just, I would think that they would go like the Apple TV route because it would be cheaper
6530460	6533260	and just, you know, plug that into a normal, you know, TV.
6533260	6539100	Why would you want, you know, the super high-res TV that I guess you would only get content
6539100	6541540	from Apple with for it.
6541540	6544260	But I don't think they would go that route.
6544260	6548580	But like, I know one of the things that people have been saying for a while now is, you know,
6548580	6554020	a watch that they have, you know, their wonderful, you know, office with the curved glass windows
6554020	6560380	and stuff that maybe they're going to, hey, that's Josh's lunch.
6560380	6562180	Somebody's watch is going off right now.
6562180	6563180	Yeah.
6563180	6567100	You know, they have that office with the curved glass and everything that they're supposed
6567100	6572100	to be using some sort of like curved glass technology or curved display for like a watch
6572100	6573820	type thing.
6573820	6576420	So I wonder if that's, you know, a possibility.
6576420	6578620	That's like straight up Dick Tracy right there.
6578620	6580420	Remember, God, I'm probably dating myself.
6580420	6581420	Remember like Dick Tracy?
6581420	6583780	I mean, the originals were like from the 1930s.
6583780	6587400	I'm not that old y'all, but I know they had a resurgence in the 90s and that movie came
6587400	6591000	out with Warren Beatty and he used to have like the little like TV on a watch where he
6591000	6594880	would talk to people and like, I could fucking see Apple doing that, like FaceTime on the
6594880	6595880	fucking watch.
6595880	6597760	Like it would be here for real.
6597760	6598760	But I don't know.
6598760	6600760	For me, I don't like watches.
6600760	6601760	I don't know.
6601760	6604440	I used to wear them as a kid, but I don't really wear them anymore.
6604440	6605440	I just don't know.
6605440	6609040	Like maybe they would do that as your phone or something because I mean, everyone really
6609040	6611340	has like, most people have a smartphone now.
6611340	6616440	So it would be just kind of weird to have like, oh, this is just an iPod, you know,
6616480	6617480	but it's a watch.
6617480	6618480	I don't know.
6618480	6620480	Watches are the domain of hipsters now.
6620480	6621480	Well.
6621480	6623480	It's a dangerous combination.
6623480	6624480	All right.
6624480	6625480	Well, we'll see.
6625480	6629880	I feel like we've heard this rumor out of Apple before, but we'll see, you know, sometimes
6629880	6634680	where there's smoke, there's fire, but it could just be a big poot too.
6634680	6639520	We'll see what happens next time Tim Cook takes the stage.
6639520	6645200	If they plan something around E3, watch yourself, but otherwise probably no big deal.
6645200	6647640	Didn't they actually do a press conference during E3 one time?
6647640	6651760	I seem to remember like, like not at E3, just coincidentally, it was like the same time.
6651760	6654680	Like I seem to remember Apple was doing a huge press conference, like the exact same
6654680	6656160	time as somebody else.
6656160	6659080	Anyway, random tangent.
6659080	6664580	Speaking of random tangents, why don't we open up our brand new email bag over at participate
6664580	6669920	at orange lounge radio.com where you guys email us every week, your thoughts, your comments,
6669920	6672040	your questions here on the show.
6672040	6681120	And most thankfully this week over in the new email address, no spam, glorious, glorious.
6681120	6682120	So sorry to those.
6682120	6685520	You guys are still trying to use the old email address, but we had to take drastic measures.
6685520	6690000	So again, if you want to email the show, participate at orange on traded.com is the place to do
6690000	6691000	so.
6691000	6692000	Let's get to it.
6692000	6693000	Dark soccer.
6693000	6695240	Who has the honor of being our very first email or in the new mail bag?
6695240	6696240	That would be AZHP.
6696240	6699680	Hey, all our crew is HP here.
6699680	6704120	Rob was wondering last week while people are so interested in Twitch plays Pokemon and
6704120	6708480	also be among the fact that there were so many knockoffs, I'd like to give an explanation
6708480	6713800	for the first question and explanation for why other games don't work.
6713800	6717440	First I think the reason that people are interested in Twitch plays Pokemon is because the community
6717440	6722400	is creating a narrative for all the things good and bad that happen when a normal person
6722400	6723400	plays Pokemon.
6723400	6725200	There isn't much dramatic tension.
6725200	6726200	You're going to level up.
6726200	6727200	You're going to fight.
6727200	6728200	You're going to use your best attacks.
6728200	6731200	And if you don't win, you'll level up some more.
6731200	6737200	With TPP, every time you fight a gym leader, you don't know if Pidgeot is going to use
6737200	6741280	sand attack seven times in a row or if Lapras will sing repeatedly before killing the enemy
6741280	6742280	in one attack.
6742280	6748280	When you're trying to catch Zapdos, you don't worry about whether or not you're going to
6748280	6752240	accidentally toss your master ball or use it on the Pokemon you weren't intending to
6752240	6756280	catch or just straight up running away from Zapdos immediately after finding him.
6756840	6759240	All these things are possibilities in TPP.
6759240	6764200	Add to the fact that you can really feel like you're contributing by coming up with plans
6764200	6768040	and rallying people behind them, you've got a recipe for a fairly interesting time.
6768040	6771840	That's a good point.
6771840	6776000	The people who have tried to start up different types of games with the same principle don't
6776000	6779680	understand the reason why Twitch plays Pokemon is actually engaging to watch.
6779680	6784960	There are several criteria a game must meet in order to be playable via chat with delay.
6784960	6791680	Game must not be turn based with little to no timing involved.
6791680	6794460	Game must not reset your progress when you die.
6794460	6799120	Game must not have an option to exit to main menu or soft reset.
6799120	6802120	You can see that there are very few games that don't meet criteria two, much less all
6802120	6803240	three.
6803240	6807840	For instance, Bioshock doesn't reset your progress when you die, but you can pause and
6807840	6812880	quit the game and controlling Bioshock with a 30 second delay would be incredibly difficult.
6813840	6818640	For those reasons, I can think of no other game besides Pokemon that is interesting when
6818640	6820080	played via crowdsourcing.
6820080	6824680	Additionally, there is such a deep love of Pokemon and there is so much variety to the
6824680	6829560	strategies in Pokemon that nearly everyone can have an opinion on what should be done
6829560	6830560	in the game.
6830560	6834920	I hope I was able to shed some light on Twitch plays Pokemon.
6834920	6838640	As of this writing, February 27th Thursday, Twitch is on the road to the Elite Four, but
6838640	6841760	it seems like they're going to be stuck in Victory Road for a while due to the one way
6841760	6846560	ledges and boulder puzzles which bar their way along with the high level random encounters
6846560	6847560	and trainers.
6847560	6850240	I wonder where they'll be when you guys read this email.
6850240	6853200	Love Always, AZHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient.
6853200	6858800	Well, there you go and now you get the honor of being the first emailer to participate,
6858800	6866280	but a lot of what you say makes sense and certainly the fact that Pokemon will not throw
6866280	6871520	you all the way back to the beginning when you lose or whatever is a key component.
6871520	6877480	But yeah, I still worry that this is the type of thing where it's like it's lightning
6877480	6878480	in the bottle.
6878480	6880600	It's a flash in the pan.
6880600	6881600	Don't take that too offensively.
6881600	6886320	I'm just saying that I kind of don't think this is going to have the longevity people
6886320	6889680	think it does because there's going to be so many knockoffs and things like that.
6889680	6893520	And you do outline what makes this work versus Mario Brothers and so forth.
6893520	6894520	There's no denying that.
6894520	6898560	But I would even suggest if you were to take other RPGs, which would be prime candidates
6898560	6902600	based on the criteria you've outlined there, it's not going to work forever.
6902600	6905720	And once you get too many of them, it's going to dilute a lot.
6905720	6909880	Now what this does bring to the table, because I don't want to make this sound negative because
6909880	6915560	it's not, because obviously people have noticed and developers have noticed and other gamers
6915560	6917960	and the people who make games have noticed.
6917960	6921160	And I think what you're going to see as a result of this is you're going to see more
6921160	6923320	interactivity within games.
6923320	6927600	We're already starting to see that a little bit as we got into last week with Tomb Raider
6927600	6932960	and there's another new one out there that does this too, but that people will be able
6932960	6935640	to interact with the Twitch streams in different ways.
6935640	6939440	And I think that is the door that Twitch Plays Pokemon is opening.
6939440	6944840	But I don't really see Twitch Plays Pokemon as something we're going to be talking about
6944840	6946040	six months from now.
6946040	6948440	Funny enough, I think it's coming up again later in the show because we want to give
6948440	6949800	an update on where it's at.
6949800	6952920	And don't get me wrong, fascinating experiment.
6952920	6956920	Crazy how probably more people have watched Twitch Plays Pokemon than some second tier
6956920	6958200	basic cable channel.
6958200	6961880	Probably more people were watching Twitch Plays Pokemon than were watching G4.
6961880	6968560	Let's be, you know, so that, let's not underestimate what has happened there, but it's all happened
6968560	6974040	very quickly too at a count of two weeks and things like this tend to go as fast as they
6974040	6975040	come.
6975040	6976040	But if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
6976040	6977040	Hey.
6977040	6979800	I'm sorry, I've got a cough drop.
6979800	6980800	That's okay.
6980800	6981800	I got a glass of wine.
6981800	6982800	Yeah, well I had some.
6982800	6983800	Let's mix them.
6983800	6984800	Just kidding.
6984800	6985800	It's gross.
6986680	6989600	I just specifically want to take a moment here and now to give thanks to you guys.
6989600	6993320	Specifically I wanted to thank Rob Roberts, Gimmitt, Captain Spike, and Exifer for giving
6993320	6995200	me advice and strength I didn't think I had.
6995200	6998520	It is with their help that I was finally able to come out to my family and therefore the
6998520	7000560	rest of the world.
7000560	7004640	The support I've received from everyone is amazing despite all my fears and I've yet
7004640	7006880	to encounter a single negative reaction to it.
7006880	7010440	I feel closer to my family now than I've ever felt before with my mom, dad, brothers, and
7010440	7014360	sister all sending me messages and calling me just to tell me how proud they are.
7014920	7018080	I wish I hadn't been afraid to tell them in the first place.
7018080	7021480	I could honestly say that the way I feel now is probably the happiest I've ever felt in
7021480	7022880	my entire life.
7022880	7027200	I needed this release and I have a word of advice to anyone who still isn't out.
7027200	7031040	If you feel that your family and friends will accept you no matter what your sexuality is
7031040	7032300	then just tell them.
7032300	7036480	The support and love that you can get in return is just so worth it.
7036480	7040000	Again, thank you so very much with love, Asfer.
7040000	7043640	I don't know what to say.
7043640	7044640	It's great.
7044640	7045640	It's fantastic.
7045640	7048440	I'm very, very happy to hear it.
7048440	7054600	I'm happy to hear that you had that and that you had that, you know, welcomeness in your
7054600	7060320	family and so forth and that everything went really good for you and congratulations on
7060320	7062360	that big step.
7062360	7067760	I know that has nothing to do with video gaming but I really don't give a shit because as
7067760	7073240	long as we're going to continue to have talks about, you know, everything from why do we
7073240	7079680	need a gay gamer convention, which I've talked to death about before on the show, to not
7079680	7081960	to get too political here but I have to.
7081960	7083480	This is my life we're talking about here.
7083480	7087800	We have to talk about when people want to pass laws where people are going to be able
7087800	7092640	to refuse you service just because of, you know, what you are.
7092640	7097200	Like that shit is like obviously we're cockulous and thank God, you know, somebody came to
7097200	7100220	our senses and said, you know, maybe this is a bad idea.
7100220	7105220	Did you see the restaurants that were putting up signs that says we reserve the right to
7105220	7109060	refuse service to Arizona legislators?
7109060	7110060	Right?
7110060	7111060	How does it feel?
7111060	7112060	How does it feel?
7112060	7116300	But there's also something that one of the things that really, really, really, really
7116300	7121020	bothers me that some people have the perception of gays and lesbians and so forth is that
7121020	7122460	it's a choice.
7122460	7124980	Being a legislator is a choice.
7124980	7128900	Being gay, not a choice.
7128900	7133860	I am happy to tell you firsthand, I did not, I am a gay man and I did not wake up one day
7133860	7136900	and go, you know what, I think I'll be gay.
7136900	7139660	I think, I think from here on out, I'm going to be gay.
7139660	7141860	It's not how it works people.
7141860	7145700	And whoever's telling you is, doesn't know what they're talking about.
7145700	7148260	Ask them when they decided to be straight.
7148260	7149260	Right?
7149260	7153800	Anyhow, I could go on a whole nother tangent here because there's been a lot of chatter
7153800	7159160	this week about when are we ever going to have a AAA video game with a gay lead character
7159160	7164240	and one big developer decided to come out and say, eh, probably never, to, to all this
7164240	7165240	other stuff.
7165240	7169560	And you know, the continued, whenever I see gamer X, there's a great story that's run
7169560	7170640	on them.
7170640	7176280	There's always that first comment, well, I'm going to have straight gamer con.
7176280	7177280	You know what?
7177280	7180220	Every time you say that, it's like, you sound exactly like the people who ask about white
7180220	7181640	history month.
7182080	7185880	It's, it's, it's, you know, it's, that's what it is.
7185880	7192880	It's people not wanting their own ableist and march and marginalizing behavior brought
7192880	7194880	out to the forefront.
7194880	7201880	You know, when you get thrown in a trash can because you're straight, when you get threatened
7201880	7207240	with violence because you're straight, when you get called straight because you're bad
7207240	7211000	at a video game, we'll have a conversation.
7211280	7215000	Until then, knock it off.
7215000	7219760	Don't even get me started on the people who say, well, that's not a sexuality at all.
7219760	7220760	You know?
7220760	7221760	Yeah.
7221760	7224560	I, people just need to stop putting labels on other people.
7224560	7230240	I don't care who fucks who or who can't fuck anybody else or what people do with their
7230240	7233780	bits as long as I don't have to know about it.
7233780	7234780	I don't care.
7234780	7235780	No one else should care.
7235780	7236780	It's no one's business.
7236780	7239880	At the end of the day, isn't love better than hate?
7239880	7242840	At the end of the day, tacos are better.
7242840	7243840	I do love tacos.
7243840	7244840	Okay then.
7244840	7245840	All right.
7245840	7250360	Anyway, I didn't mean to just, just to, I went on a crazy ass tangent from Oscar's email.
7250360	7251760	Congratulations my friend.
7251760	7253320	This, this drinks for you.
7253320	7258480	I already drink on mine or I would, okay.
7258480	7264280	This comes from my good friend Catastrophic Monkey, who I chat with every so often.
7264280	7268720	Not as much as I would like to since we were time zones apart and I have a job now.
7268760	7273160	Farewell mailbag hello participation also and he gives me a link.
7273160	7276160	I hope it gets a year of release and that the second one comes out too.
7276160	7283180	This is Shin Megami Tensei coming to iOS and it's actually, you know, old school Atlas
7283180	7284920	Joy.
7284920	7290360	It's going to be out on the 18th set in Tokyo and you know what, I may just actually get
7290360	7295440	this game because hey, Shin Megami Tensei and I've been meaning to play it so why not?
7295440	7302000	It's going to be $7.99 and it'll be about 40 to 60 hours to beat so maybe I'll eventually
7302000	7305080	finish it this year.
7305080	7308880	Thank you Moggy for sending me the mail.
7308880	7311240	Hey OLR or Hi OLR I should say.
7311240	7312240	It's Raginator.
7312240	7315600	I just have a question regarding PC gaming seeing as I'm still reasonably new to the
7315600	7317360	PC gaming scene.
7317360	7322080	I know that typically people would do their gaming on a desktop if only because with desktops
7322080	7325720	you can upgrade the PC's innards to boost performance.
7325720	7330760	However since I'm doing my gaming on a laptop that isn't a possibility as far as I know
7330760	7335200	outside of upgrading the hard drive or RAM so my question is twofold.
7335200	7339080	Is it possible to tweak a laptop settings to boost its performance even if the increase
7339080	7340300	is only marginal?
7340300	7342320	By the way yes.
7342320	7349160	There are different graphical accelerators and if you've got an Nvidia capable type of
7349160	7355680	card built in they actually do release an optimization thing for Nvidia.
7355680	7357360	Actually AMD has one too.
7357360	7361120	It's got Raptor built in which some people have kind of the mixed feelings on and I'm
7361120	7367000	going to be honest I've gotten some better settings using different things but it will
7367000	7368880	give you a good benchmark.
7368880	7372520	Like I used it for Diablo 3 and Final Fantasy 14 and the games do run really well using
7372520	7378160	the AMD because I have an AMD graphics card and it works well but you can always tweak
7378200	7380560	it and get something a little better maybe.
7380560	7385440	Just be careful if you're on a laptop because laptop cooling is crap.
7385440	7389440	And I would say before you ever really push something to its limits like that please read
7389440	7398880	up on it because it's not always, and I want to put this big disclaimer that if your computer
7398880	7404000	sets on fire because you pushed your graphics card too much to limit your fault not ours.
7404040	7405040	You're probably Loki.
7405040	7406040	Yes you're probably Loki.
7406040	7412560	It is probably me because hey I did everything to help that laptop stay cool and you know
7412560	7415520	I had it a while though.
7415520	7417320	You had it a while.
7417320	7424360	Well it was used so it was old and it was infamous for overheating but I did like all
7424360	7430960	sorts of cooling mods to it increasing the airflow in it, overclocking the fan, put new
7430960	7438840	thermal paste on there but Titanfall was enough to kill it so I don't know it's just
7438840	7440440	you got to be careful.
7440440	7444200	The newer laptops you have better cooling but if you're really looking for like you
7444200	7449160	know like customizing a laptop or something like that they actually do have places you
7449160	7452600	can buy customized laptops.
7452600	7455720	There's like websites that will actually do that.
7455720	7458360	Very rare though especially for laptops.
7458360	7461080	Did our emailer say if they were on a laptop or not?
7461080	7462760	Well I haven't finished the email.
7462760	7463760	Oh sorry.
7463760	7469400	But he did by the way say it was Reaganator and the second question by the way was what
7469400	7472320	are those changes which we've already started answering.
7472320	7479800	As a side note this is what I have an Acer Aspire V5 571 Windows 7 home premium 64-bit
7479800	7487600	4 gigabyte RAM and Intel Pentium CPU 967 at 1.3 gigahertz.
7488320	7489320	Wow that's old.
7489320	7490320	That is old.
7490320	7494320	Yeah and I know we've chatted on the show before Reaganator and I know you have to game
7494320	7498240	on a budget and so forth so I can't exactly just sit here and be all like well go get
7498240	7499880	a new graphics card.
7499880	7504840	I understand why you really want to push the limits of what you have but the reality is
7504840	7507240	technology upgrades fast.
7507240	7512880	That's why we you know our consoles upgrade that's why PCs are going up.
7512880	7517280	If you want to stay on the cutting edge of technology you're going to have to I hate
7517280	7522280	to say this try to squeeze in your already probably stressed budget a little bit.
7522280	7525840	How you're going to maybe upgrade your video card to support as opposed to maybe stretching
7525840	7526840	what you got.
7526840	7527840	And that's in a laptop.
7527840	7528840	That would be damn difficult.
7528840	7530000	Yeah and a laptop that's going to be really hard.
7530000	7534500	If you were working with a desktop I would say in a desktop now here's the good news
7534500	7537300	you might be able to find something really good second hand like on eBay or something
7537300	7538300	like that.
7538300	7542040	I mean I know you're taking your chances and so forth but hear me out here you have a lot
7542040	7547520	of people that are in a financial situation where they can buy the pick of the litter
7547520	7552600	the new newest thing the hot new thing to play the hot new game and they're going to
7552600	7557180	sell off their old cards which really aren't that old that maybe you can benefit from.
7557180	7561200	That's something that might be more appealing to somebody that's that's working on a really
7561200	7565080	extreme budget but pushing what you have.
7565080	7569580	Do you really want to take that risk that you're going to overheat your system and really
7569580	7572860	screw it up because then you're going to really be in a pickle.
7572860	7576160	So I would say if you're at that point where you're saying should I overclock to squeeze
7576160	7580140	out just a little more performance I'm going to I'm going to actually say no.
7580140	7581140	Don't do it.
7581140	7585460	And if you're looking for like a custom laptop look for was it a cleavo.
7585460	7591920	It's this company they do custom laptops and I think they're in Europe but they may have
7591920	7595860	them also in the U.S. as well.
7595860	7601740	Yeah I think they actually do have one in the U.S. a pro star but those would be the
7601740	7603740	ones that you can literally cut.
7603740	7608580	They customize everything and so that's very unusual usually you know when you're like
7608580	7611620	shopping like Dell or something like that you're going to be very limited to a certain
7611620	7616800	skew and you know what you can upgrade and downgrade and that kind of stuff.
7616800	7619140	Also everyone in chat seems to be telling you new egg.
7619140	7623300	I have a better suggestion and that's if you have a fries take it to fries have them price
7623300	7625700	match new egg and you save shipping.
7626580	7630300	There's a little app I'm going to advertise an app right now it's called shop savvy.
7630300	7639340	It will you scan the barcode of any any product and it will pull up online and in store retailers
7639340	7644060	with all of their prices the URLs to the items so that you can take it up to anyone who price
7644060	7648480	matches say this is the item have them search for it and go OK yeah we can give you that
7648480	7650040	that deal.
7650040	7653940	That's how I got when I bought my my mass fix for you remember.
7653940	7658740	That's how I had a price match Amazon because I found it for 36 bucks brand new instead
7658740	7660840	of you know 50 something dollars.
7660840	7664300	And M.M.2K in our chat room brings up a good point that when you when you shop with new
7664300	7668740	egg or fries which now some of our chatters are like oh yeah fries M.M.2K says a better
7668740	7673100	chance is building an eBay quote unquote rig a lot cheaper and the risk is not that high.
7673100	7675340	That's a that's a really good point.
7675340	7678960	I can I can support that and the dungeon buster points out you know what Amazon also has a
7678960	7681520	few good hardware deals from time to time surprisingly.
7681520	7685380	So those comments from our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com again to the
7685380	7688920	email or rage nator don't feel like I mean when you see the price of new cards you're
7688920	7692180	going to be like two hundred dollars you know there's going to be some expensive stuff out
7692180	7696400	there but don't feel like you have to go the tip of the iceberg.
7696400	7699360	Go to the models that are a year a year and a half old you might be able to find something
7699360	7703560	like 50 50 70 bucks who knows maybe even cheaper if you can really find somebody who's on loading
7703560	7706440	a bunch of offloading a bunch of stuff and it's going to be better than what you have
7706440	7707440	now.
7707440	7710720	And you know what check check Craigslist anyway.
7710720	7714920	You know I actually like I was a fool might be giving it away for free.
7714920	7720000	You take chances but I was just you know randomly hunting in to see because I want a MacBook
7720000	7725680	Pro and someone was selling like one from a year ago for five hundred fifty bucks.
7725680	7730760	I mean it's already gone but you know it was like that's a good price.
7730760	7734720	You know you know a lot of people clear them out for maybe nine hundred to a thousand.
7734720	7738080	You know I'm just using that as an example but you can always find people selling off
7738080	7739960	their old graphics cards.
7739960	7741560	Well good luck to you buddy.
7741560	7742560	Was that it for emails.
7742560	7743840	Oh there's one more.

7749320	7750320	Hi.

7786080	7787080	Unless you're.
7787080	7789840	It's like a theme song for our mailbox.
7789840	7794160	Unless you're in Hawaii where it's like part of the culture then spam is okay.
7794160	7795160	All right.
7795160	7797840	That was a great.
7797840	7799760	We should change the mail address every week.
7799760	7802580	We get great email segments when we do that.
7802580	7806600	Not that they're all bad but that was a particularly great segment this week.
7806600	7807600	All right.
7807600	7808600	Anyhow.
7808600	7809600	Let's move on.
7809600	7810600	It's the FUs of the week time.
7810600	7814400	Oh now we're going to spam the airwaves with some angst.
7814400	7839960	Get ready for it.
7839960	7848360	FU to gaming sites taking secondhand knowledge from somebody that heard something else on
7848360	7851680	some social media site.
7851680	7854640	It's not a story.
7854640	7856640	Well said.
7856640	7861880	My FU of the week goes to the stress that comes with moving.
7861880	7863280	Although I'm sure everything will be okay.
7863280	7869200	It's just one of those like oh my god I have to put everything in a box.
7869200	7871040	But it'll be worth it.
7871040	7872520	It'll so be worth it.
7872520	7873520	Can't wait.
7873520	7874520	All right.
7874520	7875520	There it is.
7875520	7877720	The FUs of the week everybody.
7877720	7878720	Moving on.
7878720	7879720	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
7879720	7883520	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange
7883520	7884520	lounge radio.
7884520	7885520	But first Loki.
7885520	7886520	Yeah.
7886520	7892680	So as we were talking about a little bit before Twitch plays Pokemon has concluded.
7892680	7894040	Pokemon Red.
7894040	7903720	They after like I guess two weeks they finally defeated the end of the game there and now
7903720	7908120	they've moved on to Pokemon Crystal.
7908120	7910600	So it's not over.
7910600	7912420	It still goes.
7912420	7921520	So is there like a helix fossil and crystal I mean because it's going to be sad that doesn't
7921520	7922520	move along there.
7922520	7924240	Yeah I don't remember that one at all.
7924240	7930660	I watched a little bit of the feed today just to see like you know how they're doing and
7930660	7931660	you know game over.
7931660	7935880	It was no they were just they were running in and out of a house but now it's game over.
7935880	7936880	No they're on crystal now.
7936880	7938960	Oh I meant I thought you were talking about the other one.
7938960	7939960	No no no no no.
7939960	7941940	I saw all the victory screenshots and so forth.
7941940	7945420	But my favorite thing to come out of this Twitch plays Pokemon thing honestly it's so
7945420	7949280	funny that last week I was so ignorant to a lot of this stuff that we was bringing up
7949280	7950540	but I read up on some of it.
7950540	7954880	And I got to say like the fanfic and the culture that have come out of Twitch plays Pokemon
7954880	7956720	is pretty hilarious.
7956720	7959180	And if anything is going to keep it going it's going to be that.
7959180	7963220	But like seriously there's like comics about bird Jesus.
7963220	7964220	Thank you.
7964220	7965220	You're right.
7965220	7966620	It is kind of Tumblr's fault.
7966620	7974700	My people Tumblr you guys are weird but I say that with love and Lord Helix and yes
7974700	7978460	and what was that Evie is the false prophet or something like that like it was all this
7978460	7979460	crazy shit.
7979660	7980660	It's hilarious.
7983140	7986180	Anyways so some of the stats coming out from that.
7986180	7990580	It ran for 16 days 7 hours 45 minutes and 30 seconds.
7990580	7996260	It at its max it had 121,000 people watching.
7996260	8001940	There was over 122 million commands issued in chat.
8001940	8008620	More than 9 million onlookers and 36 million views and they were saying total minutes watched
8008620	8011780	more than 1 billion.
8011780	8012780	That's ridiculous.
8012780	8013780	Oh my gosh.
8013780	8014780	Hey.
8014780	8015780	Great.
8015780	8016780	Great for them though.
8016780	8021440	That's Twitch TV's just sitting there counting the cash from all the ads and the subscriptions
8021440	8026580	on that although then again that's a bandwidth bill I'm not sure I'd want to have to pay
8026580	8027580	for.
8027580	8032220	They should do that with like a TV show or something where they pick the outcome that
8032220	8033220	way.
8033220	8037100	Well somebody in chat earlier and I apologize I don't know who said this but I just remember
8037100	8042460	reading the comments somebody had said I wish I would watch the Twitch plays Pokemon
8042460	8047100	channel on TV before I'd watch G4 again something to that effect and I was like kind
8047100	8050740	of surprised somebody doesn't try to make like a TV show or something out of this but
8050740	8057900	I mean we live in this age where the internet is making us rethink TV.
8057900	8061260	It is Twitch plays Pokemon is a TV show.
8061260	8069140	It's just not on what you used to think of as TV just like you rent movies now not by
8069140	8072260	going to a blockbuster like you used to.
8072260	8074980	Just interesting.
8074980	8079220	So Jason says I don't think Twitch plays Pokemon had a subscription feature.
8079220	8082940	Actually they do but they make very clear in there about that it's it they're not going
8082940	8087260	to give you special treatment that it's just for you know you support what they're doing
8087260	8088680	and want to help them out.
8088680	8091880	You know again hey if you've got a little extra money and like what we're doing help
8091880	8098480	us you know help motivate me to do the next Pokemon game and program that before the next
8098480	8099480	thing.
8099480	8102200	Tiger Claw in chat says we need a Twitch plays OLR.
8102200	8106360	Hey funny enough go check this out if you haven't already Jason works very hard on posting
8106360	8112380	the shows up to YouTube every week and they run a week behind just because we want everybody
8112380	8116480	to download through the traditional means but for the archive folks if you go look at
8116480	8122000	episode 541 on YouTube Jason did a hilarious intro that does incorporate the Twitch plays
8122000	8127460	Pokemon thing into it so Tiger Claw go check that out it's funny.
8127460	8129640	So there you go.
8129640	8133960	One more story for you guys then I think we'll open up Skype at 1877 game OLR username orange
8133960	8140520	lounge radio but before we get there a rare game goes for over three thousand dollars
8140520	8146060	on eBay and what game are we talking about it is actually an Ultima game yes Ultima as
8146060	8151680	in that classic PC series but it was a rare side story which I have to admit I've never
8151680	8155300	heard of this and I always thought I kind of knew my up and up on the Ultima games but
8155300	8163900	Ultima Escape from Mount Drash it was originally on the Commodore VIC-20 from Sierra Online
8163900	8169860	the company produced no more than five thousand copies the first time it ever showed up since
8169860	8175700	the eighties was in 2000 and Peter O was a collector in 2004 that bought one for three
8175700	8183140	thousand six hundred and five dollars he actually is the one who sold this recent one he was
8183140	8189100	selling the copy it was the VIC-20 cassette in a plastic case the instruction cards in
8189100	8194300	the original box and he lost five hundred bucks on the deal because three thousand fifty
8194300	8200420	dollars is what it sold for so unfortunately the value went down incomplete copies meaning
8200420	8204100	they didn't have the case or the card or things like that they sometimes go for like six hundred
8204100	8209220	seventy five dollars or more so a very rare collector's item there Escape from Mount Drash
8209220	8213700	again I had no idea this was the thing but this was back in the day when Lord British was like
8213700	8218740	programming those games by himself so this must have been something where it was like contracted
8218740	8224180	out to Sierra or maybe it was it even maybe unauthorized I don't know I kind of want to look
8224180	8230620	this up real quick are there any classic classic games Jamie that you would pay a lot of money for
8230620	8235220	like maybe not on this scale but let's let's say you had that type of budget dark soccer is there
8235220	8239620	anything you would pay a shit ton of money for like that probably get well it's not worth that
8239620	8246020	much but I'd get panorama cotton you know it's a $600 game hmm which actually I think what it is
8246020	8253980	is that they literally made like 500 copies of that game so it's super rare not there's not
8253980	8259340	really a whole too many you know I might you know I might want to buy a copy of Emerald Dragon maybe
8259340	8265580	that's a pretty good game I got more information on what this game is all about the Ultima escape
8265580	8269980	from Mount Drash here's the deal it wasn't rich written by Richard Garriott but it was by his
8269980	8275620	friend Keith Zabala we I probably mispronounced that I apologize to Keith for butchering his last
8275620	8282820	name but he wrote this game in 83 now Sierra had just put out Ultima 2 and so what they did they
8282820	8287820	stuck the Ultima prefix on this game hoping it would sell better we've heard of this stuff
8287820	8293980	happening before right one instance that comes to mind is that Konami was a team silent was working
8293980	8298900	on a game called the room and Konami was like let's just call it Silent Hill 4 so they kind of
8298900	8304060	you know had to put it into the Silent Hill canon so you know this happens a little bit in gaming
8304060	8309380	sometimes you get side stories that get the the series name stuck on it there so it's a very old
8309380	8315700	old version of that happening all righty we are gonna open up the skype line guys it's time to
8315700	8321140	call us and I have your say on tonight's topics 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on skype orange lounge

8336060	8341260	the cat door in the garage door here and she does not know how to go through it she thinks it's a
8341260	8346060	window she's kind of like getting all frustrated like why aren't you letting me out she hasn't
8346060	8352100	understand the concept huh she doesn't understand the concept no she doesn't understand the concept
8352100	8358260	yet she doesn't know what it is all right well we are gonna go to the phones and let's go to it
8358260	8363580	right now hi you're on orange launch radio who's this dude with the fastest internet in the entire
8363580	8368060	chat room Rama hey Rama you are very good at getting into the show when you want to what's
8368060	8372740	up buddy not much I'm wondering to see if I actually have to work tomorrow because the big
8372740	8379340	and sudden snowstorm that's coming through do you guys have another freaking epic snowstorm coming
8379340	8386700	your way yes yes here's the funny part that I just said I said on my Facebook earlier today now
8386700	8398260	the fact that frozen has won an Oscar the amount of snow has dropped about 60% swear to God nice
8398260	8409700	you know what I think Rama you just need to let it go let it go Rob you know what fuck it all I
8409700	8416180	just want to remind you Rama I've been drinking a little bit here and there so crazy tonight
8416180	8422340	want me to do a shot for you buddy hell yeah I do do you got something sitting right there you can
8422340	8424860	take a shot at what am I saying of course you have something right there you can take a shot
8424860	8433500	of oh my gosh oh I'm trying to get a picture of it but our skype lines ring it off the hook I
8433500	8439540	can't like the webcam keeps cutting out there damn it I missed it you got to do another screenshot
8439540	8443700	let me taking a shot of sake and I'll send it to you would you feel better about all right fair
8443700	8449500	enough fair enough what's on your mind I just called talking about the whole new way upgrading
8449500	8454780	your older machines and so because this is something I do on occasion and even now yes it's
8454780	8461940	harder to upgrade a laptop for gaming but a desktop it's not that hard I mean not for nothing my last
8461940	8469940	major upgrade was about three years ago I dropped out 300 bucks on a new video card motherboard and
8469940	8475860	processor and it wasn't bad because you can get a pretty good video card for like 50 bucks
8475860	8482380	mm-hmm really expensive ones are for people who really just want to eat sleep drink game that
8482380	8489740	really technical aspect of it right and like it like I said about almost a month ago one of my
8489740	8495220	hard drives crashed I went out and bought a new three terabyte drive micro center had it for 109
8495300	8501900	walked over to Best Buy instant price match done nice that wasn't bad it's just you kind of know
8501900	8506820	where to look and yes even though Amazon does so computer parts just be careful I've been seeing
8506820	8514020	people selling like 80 and 120 gig hard drives for like 99 bucks and stuff like that not like
8514020	8518540	you get a lot of that reseller shit on Amazon so you got to be careful that when you're buying
8518540	8523180	from Amazon you're buying from actual Amazon well I mean sometimes the resellers are okay but do
8523180	8527740	your research a little bit because you get a lot of that make sure if you want it to be you know
8527740	8531600	still like sealed and all that get it from actual Amazon like if I really want to get a PlayStation
8531600	8536100	4 camera not to like throw it back to a topic from a while ago but I am I could get one on Amazon
8536100	8539220	but it's gonna be through a reseller for like seriously they're charging like a hundred and
8539220	8545060	eighty bucks for a camera that's supposed to be $50 buck and what's interesting is that like last
8545060	8551900	week I went I finally got myself um a DualShock 3 Amazon had of a 39 price matching at Best Buy but
8551900	8560860	on the next ad down a third-party reseller was selling it for $35 nice so do your research a
8560860	8567220	little bit people mm-hmm we're in an age of an economic crisis we have to save and pay people
8567220	8573380	we can that's right yeah well anything else on your mind tonight buddy ah no that's it brother
8573380	8578420	all right well thanks so much as always for the call and anime jam session Tuesdays here on the
8578420	8584060	Voice of Geeks Network and Rama also a playable character in flappy vog yes check all that out
8584060	8590220	all right take care of my friend too all right bye all right one eight seven seven game OLR
8590220	8595580	our username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give our show a call and I gotta say
8595580	8598940	though the skype lines ringing off the hook tonight it's gonna be it's gonna be tough for
8598940	8602100	some of you to get through but we do have another call coming in so let's get to it hi on orange
8602100	8607180	lounge radio who's this this is Bobby hey Bobby it's our friend Bobby bachoff how you doing buddy
8607180	8613300	I'm doing good what's on your mind oh I called in because you guys completely glossed over the
8613300	8619700	important part of a story earlier oh we never do that come on completely glossed over and I
8619700	8624340	spent 20 minutes on my show talking about it's because everyone listened to you it's only a
8624340	8628980	three-hour show Bobby yeah yeah we might have glossed over it because it was something that
8628980	8633780	you went and it went into more death we try we try not to Jack your style too often here at our
8634100	8638060	show Bobby but please what do you what do you want to what do you want to go back and refocus on but
8638060	8644540	but it is king.com losing the candy trademark is that a good thing or a bad thing it's misdirection
8644540	8650940	they got rid of it because they don't need it anymore they got that candy crusher trademark
8650940	8655940	from 2004 so they don't need the candy trademark so they can do the good PR thing and have podcasts
8655940	8661060	say oh this is a good thing King is the evil K is backing off and they're not they're just using
8661220	8666260	a different more effective weapon to bludgeon their enemies with so so you don't think this
8666260	8671540	this like they're gonna let the candy swipe thing go without a fight despite all of the negative
8671540	8676420	press it's caused them because my thought was that they were okay so maybe they're relying on
8676420	8680260	this other trademark but maybe they're not just is this another one of the ones that they got from
8680260	8686700	Europe no this was one they got from a US company hmm because I know part of the weird thing about
8686780	8693460	trademark law here is that if you don't in try to defend it you'll lose it so maybe I don't know
8693460	8696820	maybe they're trying to default to something that they don't have to be as aggressive and defending
8696820	8700340	I mean I I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt even though I might be a little foolish in
8700340	8706420	doing so but yeah I mean that that could be it but I mean it is it was harder for them to take
8706420	8711240	on candy swipe with a candy trademark that they're just getting right but the 2004 trademark yeah
8711240	8716880	they can definitely use that to bludgeon their enemies with and even in and you know spoiler
8716880	8720880	alert and you know behind-the-scenes stuff I actually can see all our show role because I
8720880	8726320	run the website so I can see everything you can the finalized one though I don't see the finalized
8726320	8731000	one but I see where you guys put all of it put all the stories and even the article that you guys
8731000	8736180	used as a link has a statement from King stating we're getting rid of the candy trademark cuz we
8736180	8741040	don't need it anymore cuz we got the candy crusher trademark mm-hmm so they've even come out and
8741040	8744840	said oh yeah we're not stopping what we're doing we just have a better way of doing it
8744840	8750440	Jason in our chat room says I dislike black wolves tack on this I didn't even take on this
8750440	8754360	because they have the right to defend their trademark the exception is of course that their
8754360	8759960	game 2012 came out after someone else's 2010 as far as them defending their own game I don't have
8759960	8766520	a problem with it I I don't have a problem with it either when people are making puzzle games
8766520	8772040	involving candy that like literally step on the toes of what candy crush saga is trying to do
8772040	8777160	like with a very similar name but you know we all heard the story about banner saga a couple
8777160	8781040	weeks like that that was that was fuckery right there like there was no reason well I mean there
8781040	8785320	was reason for it but it was it was a ridiculous reason none of us agreed with that and I think if
8785320	8790560	a developer wants to make a game that happens to be about candy that otherwise has nothing to do
8790640	8797240	with like let's say Milton Bradley wants to put out candy land for the Xbox one using connect for
8797240	8801560	you know four and five year olds to play dancing like crazy in front of the connector whatever I
8801560	8807440	think they should be allowed to do that yeah and and that but I mean and even Jason says you know
8807440	8811640	if they use whatever 2004 game take out st. candy swipe that's that that's exactly what they did
8811640	8817520	that's exactly how they got him to take down his game is that he was fighting their candy
8817520	8822000	trademark so they bought candy crusher waved that around and there was nothing he could do about it
8822000	8826160	now they're like oh well we don't need the candy trademark let's abandon it everybody will say this
8826160	8831680	is a good thing and we'll just use candy crusher to do what we wanted to do initially because it
8831680	8837840	predates all these other games that predated us well well fair enough thank you thank you for
8837840	8844040	reminding us why this company is still evil yes and just to be fair we didn't exactly tell
8844040	8849880	everyone it's safe to install candy crush saga again no no and when you were discussing this on
8849880	8855200	your show that's when we were opening the wine sorry yeah but it is safe to install the unity
8855200	8861320	web player and go to flappy dot vog network comm yeah because Firefox had an update I this happened
8861320	8866280	to me yesterday and it's like this did it when I tried to load up the unity player it actually had
8866280	8871000	like this big warning saying this pull of this plug-in is vulnerable so we've disabled it that
8871000	8876480	happened to hmm so just upgrade it and it'll be fine yes we are not trying to read the contents
8876480	8881440	of your computer and what porn sites you may or may not be visiting and all that because I God
8881440	8887480	no I don't want to see that all right Bobby quickly please plug your show for our audience
8887480	8891000	I have a hard time believing there's anybody out there listening to this that doesn't know of your
8891000	8895360	show but just in case give us a quick plug and then we'll let you go it's Bobby Black Wolf show
8895360	8899440	I named it after myself so Jay Leno because he's unemployed right now he doesn't take take over
8899440	8905200	the show it's 8 p.m. Eastern 5 p.m. Pacific right here before olr and I even run long into olr
8905200	8911760	time and they graciously allow me to do that and I do fog and and and flappy fog which is over now
8911760	8916720	jokes over I'm gonna move on now the joke is over step away from the joke but but at least experience
8916720	8920040	character pack to a couple times before you get away from it completely all right that's right
8920040	8924720	all right Bobby the man take care buddy good as always to hear from you take care all right bye
8924720	8931760	bye all right one eight seven seven game olr is the place to give us a call or our username on
8931760	8935560	Skype orange lounge radio all one word and we're there's a lot of calls coming through tonight I'm
8935560	8939320	gonna try to get to them all so I keep keep trying guys sorry if you're not getting through right
8939320	8945760	away but it's it's a race of sorts and the buffer that we have similar to what twitch plays Pokemon
8945760	8953480	has that whole like 45 second buffer makes it a very challenging type of game so once again the
8953480	8963880	phones are open and let's see I could try to go to could try to go to the Twitter's just take a
8963880	8971040	topic but I think nope we got a call coming in let's get to it hi you're on orange launch radio
8971040	8978400	who's this oops sorry try again hi you're on orange launch radio who's this gamer girl hey
8978400	8986120	gamer girl what's on your mind my friend um nothing much just uh plan some lightning returns
8986120	8991160	some lightning returns you know we haven't talked a lot about lightning returns here on the show
8991160	8998680	what's up how is lightning returns it's really frustrating at first but I learned that you could
8998680	9003160	actually um if you don't complete the game like you're supposed to you can actually replay it
9003160	9010080	oh right because isn't it isn't the whole little twist in lightning returns that like you have 13
9010080	9015080	days to do it but if you screw up and you don't get things done you can start back from the
9015080	9021200	beginning but it's like it's like a new game plus type of thing or something yeah yeah you first you
9021200	9028680	start out with like six days on the clock and then with each I think it's called a seed that
9028680	9037520	you add to the tree and heaven it adds more time to the clock mm-hmm like the more more days the
9037520	9045440	clock and I'm already on day four and I just started playing yesterday nice so yeah it's kind
9045440	9051880	of like is it kind of like um Zelda Majora's Mask where it's like you know 72 hours remain and all
9051880	9058600	that kind of that yeah looming doom is there a big is there a big angry face moon in the
9058600	9066080	sky that's about to hit the earth not really but it's a movie much um you pretty much it's it's
9066080	9071800	like the same thing exactly because you have only a certain amount of days like I said and it gets
9071800	9077200	really frustrating at first if you don't know how to do it so for those of you who want to buy the
9077200	9083640	game or if you don't have it yet I highly suggest getting the strategy guide because you're gonna
9083640	9088560	need it you're gonna need it how do you how do you feel about lightning returns compared to other
9088560	9092480	games in the final fantasy 13 series like because I see fifth dream in our chat room over at live
9092480	9096520	dot vog network comm says I'm not sure how I feel about lightning returns at this point where are
9096520	9100720	you at in comparison to the original 13 because I feel so weird saying that the original Final
9100720	9108520	Fantasy 13 and then 13 to how is it for you the only thing I don't like is the fighting system
9108520	9113200	because you only have a certain amount of button presses before you can't you have to wait before
9113400	9119920	your um I don't know what it's called but before it regenerates right and as with the original
9119920	9126520	Final Fantasy 13 the first ones you could just press buttons and there's no there's no penalty
9126520	9133120	for it and also there's a penalty system if you run away from your enemies unless you're playing
9133120	9141080	on easy but if you're playing on like normal then you have a penalty system so that's kind of
9141120	9145960	frustrating I'm like oh well I guess there's gotta be that's that's the challenge in the game if they
9145960	9150560	just handed it to you that wouldn't be much of a game there so yeah fifth dream says you lose an
9150560	9155360	hour if you run so interesting um what else you've been playing lately anything else you want to
9155360	9162560	share with us um minecraft I'm playing a lot of minecraft have you been playing on the vog network
9162560	9168680	server um I don't know what the server is for that one because I mean I'm playing on ps3 so
9168680	9174360	I don't know if you guys are playing it that way oh no we're not on ps3 we're on PC so yeah the
9174360	9178560	piece ps3 one doesn't let you connect to PC servers fingers crossed that maybe the ps4 one
9178560	9183040	will but I don't I don't know for sure if it will or not we don't know much about the ps4 version
9183040	9190520	so mad about ps4 so bad why so mad because one of my favorite games is not gonna be on ps3 so I
9190520	9198080	have to buy a ps4 which is I believe it's Kingdom the next Kingdom Hearts oh yes well it's taken but
9198080	9203680	no you're right to be expected anyway yeah it's gonna happen if it's equals are gonna go to the
9203680	9210080	next system that's that's what happens but just think of it even prettier Disney characters true
9210080	9214160	so I'm gonna end up getting it anyways I just have to wait for a price drop which I'm gonna
9214160	9221320	be waiting for a while cuz I just got a Wii U oh how you liking the Wii U I like it um as far as
9221320	9226360	like having to be able to watch TV and then game at the same time I think that's really cool do you
9226360	9230520	ever use that TV integrated things you can chat along with big events like probably they probably
9230520	9236720	got one going for the Oscars right now um it's not really they don't talk about it at all but it's
9236720	9243160	I do use the chat feature because that's how dark dark Tetsuya and I keep in touch oh okay you know
9243160	9248680	little Wii U video yeah all right well gamer girl thanks so much for sharing your thoughts on

9387120	9391520	for like half a second and I hated the camera like I thought it was the worst thing ever so I quit
9391520	9399880	playing and now I'm going through the ps3 version and I still kind of hate the camera but it's not
9399880	9406120	as bad as it was but man that games not a lot of fun sometimes I'll just say they did fix it up on
9406120	9411760	the PlayStation 3 version I seem to recall so it's is it a little better than what you remember yeah
9411760	9418480	the camera is a little better than what I remember but I still the game is not grabbing me yet I
9418480	9423360	don't know how long it's supposed to take before it does cuz first of all David Boreanaz can't act
9423360	9429480	worth a crap so he needs to not be in any of the other games I hope but that's perfect for squall
9429480	9436440	because squalls kind of I'm squall I mean let's see even your impression of what squall should
9436440	9440840	be is far better than what David Boreanaz is putting out in that game maybe Jamie should
9440840	9445640	release like her own voice thing that people could patch into the game yeah that's fine I
9445640	9453340	would I would use that for that's cool can you give us another squall line Jamie I have a gun
9453340	9460700	blade there you go way more interesting how far are you in the game just out of curiosity I just
9460700	9466580	beat the Wonderland world okay which that boss sucked yeah I literally for three hours last
9466580	9470980	night yeah that guy is kind of a jerk yeah I remember that boss it's like the big it's the
9470980	9475540	big guy like you go back into that room with the eat me drink me stuff and it's like a huge like
9475540	9482540	weird I'm automation chairs and stuff right yeah and then like I was trying to kill him and I was
9482540	9488340	like maybe I could use some fire on him oh wait that turns his batons on fire and it just kills
9488340	9494420	me quicker yeah it was so frustrating but now I'm on the Coliseum world so I'm hoping it gets a
9494420	9499980	little better well it's I I am gonna say this I kind of think Kingdom Hearts 2 is a better game
9499980	9504940	but I still love Kingdom Hearts the Tron level will piss you off at first just doing the light
9504940	9510500	cycle part would piss you off yeah I just want to play Tron legacy but I know that's in the 3ds
9510500	9516100	one is the 3ds one not in any of the ones that I have access to right now so kind of sad about
9516100	9521620	that that's okay well welcome to 2001 Shane thank you and you're playing it oh my god I'm about to
9521620	9525580	graduate high school that's amazing you're playing an MMO from 2001 as well aren't you
9525580	9531580	I actually yeah I am right now playing Final Fantasy 11 because I absolutely love this game
9531580	9539500	and all the changes they've made to it it's fantastic not 14 mind you 11 11 yes now I am
9539500	9543700	a dancer in it it's the best you have been trying and trying and trying to convince it you're
9543700	9547540	trying to use those powers of yours to make me come back and play Final Fantasy 11 so far I'm
9547540	9552540	resisting though I'm no no no you have started to give in because he said maybe after the move
9552540	9558300	I said maybe just to shut you up that's all I needed you're a year too late I I was back in
9558300	9564300	it for like a month you know I was free to play maybe I was in it for like a month earlier too
9564300	9570180	but I Shane is convinced that it's it's all of a sudden so much better than that okay quickly
9570180	9574340	Shane you may not be able to a hundred percent convince me but convince Jamie convinced the
9574340	9581860	listenerships well no I have to pick and choose my targets I'm already two operating systems since
9581860	9585780	the last time I touched that game and I swore I would never go back and I'm a stubborn bitch
9585780	9591380	all right but you got to try for me Shane what why why is Final Fantasy 11 cool now because you
9591380	9596580	don't have to play with anybody you've got this system that's not unlike Guild Wars where you have
9596580	9603180	these NPCs that come fight with you and you make a mini party and I seriously in the past two hours
9603180	9611580	gained like eight levels and that's eight higher levels I went from 42 to I'm just below 50 and if
9611580	9616660	you've ever played Final Fantasy 11 before you know that's not an easy feat yeah I think after
9616660	9623940	like three years I got to like maybe level 54 on one of my classes yeah so it's just it's so
9623940	9628180	accessible that's what's nice about it and you apparently don't really even have to buy gear
9628180	9633620	until you get into the 90s because they raised the level cap to 99 they did they did put higher
9633620	9638660	textures out for Final Fantasy 11 at some point right did they I thought they did I don't think
9638660	9642860	they did yeah I don't think they did I'm I don't want to play it if the textures were much nicer
9642860	9648660	and it looks I just registry edit it that's what I did it looks way better than normal we'll see
9648660	9655860	but again after I move it's already playing Final Fantasy 11 once chroma comes out anyway so that's
9655860	9663340	kind of true I want that game so bad I'm very jealous oh Loki I want you to tell me more but
9663340	9668380	he can want to see it make like a private YouTube all right we should probably talk about this
9668380	9673580	offline but for now Shane anything else before I let you go nope it's just really cold all right
9673580	9681500	well I put a jacket on mm-hmm I have a hoodie okay bye Shane bye one eight seven seven game
9681500	9685940	olr if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype orange lounge radio I'm gonna try to
9685940	9690380	squeeze in one more call because I've seen one more caller coming through I want to make sure
9690380	9694180	I at least get the one another call and then I'll probably shut it off for tonight cuz I usually do
9694180	9698860	about three calls but I have done six but that's because our show was running a little short the
9698860	9705740	news went by quick tonight so um did you have any other last-minute stories you cooked up
9705740	9713380	Logie I still get to get to Twitter now all right oh here's that call we're gonna go to it and take
9713380	9716340	this call and then this will be the last one for tonight hi you're on orange launch radio who's
9716340	9723820	this hey guys Jason hey Jason how you doing unlike everybody else and the polar vortex and snow of
9723860	9730380	doom I made it home you made it home it's good to hear from you in your Colorado studio as opposed
9730380	9734700	to here in the studio with us well to almost I was actually at a con this weekend so I'm actually
9734700	9741100	I'm actually at a hotel and I'm hoping the internet holds up for the call but close enough to home I'm
9741100	9747020	actually you know driving distance with reasonably so nice and you I will have you know that in your
9747020	9752300	chair which was Loki's chair at one point but and he'll be back at some point but tonight hosting
9752300	9758500	the show you know last week was my copy of bravely default tonight tonight is Jamie's glass of wine
9758500	9765340	all right you didn't call us to talk about booze though at least I don't think so what's on your
9765340	9770380	mind Jason I kind of just wanted to point out something when I was doing the video yesterday
9770380	9775020	a friend of mine called me towards the end of the show last week so I missed the discussion on this
9775020	9782260	topic I am NOT and this will probably shock quite a few people but I'm not so sure that the whole
9782260	9788460	Netflix Comcast thing is a net neutrality concern because there were follow-ups that happened over
9788460	9792220	the course of this week so obviously you know additions since we first since you guys first
9792220	9799860	talked about it on the show I'm I'm a Comcast subscriber I use Netflix regularly I never saw
9799860	9805020	these problems and people have been talking about them being problems for the last I don't know year
9805020	9809940	and a half and worsening over that period of time and there was an article that came out this week
9809940	9817220	that even people people that use Netflix on their desktop see these problems people that use a
9817220	9825580	connected device more specifically in Apple TV like I do never saw these problems whatsoever and
9825580	9832140	this article pointed out that Netflix sends for whatever reason they send Apple TV streams via
9832140	9840780	a different pipe the short version of this story is that everybody on the internet has you know it
9840780	9845620	always boils down to one big backbone if people want to look at what I'm talking about real quick
9845620	9854900	go to internet health report calm and you'll see a grid of all of the major cross-network providers
9854900	9861100	in the United States specifically and there's only one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
9861100	9868940	of them if you are talking one network to another you switch across one of these networks these
9868940	9875100	people do you know they don't do gigabytes they don't do terabytes they do petabytes of traffic
9875100	9882860	a day wow that's a lot of bytes well it's not exabytes or yada bytes so we're getting there
9882860	9890460	eventually but it's it's one of those things where like Comcast was painted as the villain
9890540	9897820	because a lot of people like I I I I derive I say bad things about Comcast from time to time too
9897820	9903980	for you know better for worse for I think also in general Jason I think people aren't happy about
9903980	9907540	the large market share they're about to have because I think we sort of see competition as
9907540	9911540	a little bit of a good thing and there's also been a lot of talk lately about is the internet
9911540	9919140	a utility and we saw a case you know many years ago when what was it Bell or whatever was taking
9919140	9922060	over so much of the country when it came to the phone utility the government actually split them
9922060	9926300	up yeah and so we're starting to kind of ask that question shouldn't the internet be considered a
9926300	9930660	utility at this point I I'm actually one of those people it's kind of like I I think it is I think
9930660	9936700	we live in a society that necessitates the internet and I don't like I don't disagree with
9936700	9942860	any of this I don't like the state of broadband in America the fact that we do have one cable choice
9942860	9949580	one DSL choice at best and in like 60% of the country less than that you know by no means am
9949580	9954380	I saying that's a bad thing I'm just I'm just basically I basically just wanted to make the
9954380	9960540	point that Netflix did this for a specific business purpose to better their service for
9960540	9967500	people because the route that they have to take to get to Comcast subscribers for one medium
9967500	9974380	desktops was terrible and they chose not to leverage the other links that they do have except
9974380	9979180	for one source of video like I said the fact that Apple TV's never exhibit exhibited these problems
9979180	9985540	like desktop viewing did so there's there's a lot more to this story than just Comcast constraining
9985540	9990940	and fucking over Netflix you know maybe maybe Netflix made the right decision they didn't want
9990940	9997220	to oversaturate other links but there's a lot more to it this is a this is a really big story
9997260	10003300	that just doesn't distill into well Comcast fucked up again so let's let's deride them for the next
10003300	10008060	five minutes and then move on but that's basically all I wanted to get out as soon as I heard it
10008060	10012500	editing the video you're just saying that there's more to this and a lot of people are kind of
10012500	10017180	jumping to conclusions and I think that's fair because in the gaming world especially I mean I
10017180	10020220	know this is a little more tech you know it's a little higher a little higher on the bubble
10020220	10025060	than than than gaming but we tend to in this industry jump to conclusions all the time I'm
10025060	10030060	guilty of it we're all guilty of it we sometimes jump to conclusions so you're just saying you know
10030060	10034700	what look look beneath the service there's a little more to it yeah there's this is a big
10034700	10041060	incredibly complicated thing not only to the u.s. but the wider internet at large and it's
10041060	10045020	fascinating when you die when you dive into it you just have to find the medium to be able to do so
10045020	10049100	all right fair enough you might want to link that in our chat room that website you just gave to
10049100	10052700	because bonds double-06 says anyone got the site I don't have it I'm assuming that's the one you
10052740	10056980	gave out I don't know but check in on that on chat if you will hey Jason I'm gonna let you go so we
10056980	10061300	can wrap up the show but miss you buddy hope to see you soon oh somebody else was asking what what
10061300	10066140	con are you at it was it was anime land wasabi there it is obviously started on Friday I got in

10104140	10108100	there's somebody else calling who I didn't see their name sorry that you were not able to get
10108100	10113180	through but please send us an email to participate at orange laundry calm or you can send us a tweet

10167220	10173100	main six the original devs and this is the whole thing where they you know they had to end up
10173100	10178220	changing it and the creator of my little pony was gonna help him out anyway no surprise that
10178220	10183580	the internet kind of did its thing and put it out anyway despite the legal wishes and so forth
10183580	10190460	especially in a rabid fan community like my little pony but hope it's fun but I would I would still
10190460	10193900	be looking forward to you know what's the new game gonna be that comes out of this what comes
10193900	10199060	out of the ashes with that so it's like it reminds me of that you know that chrono trigger re remake

10223360	10230080	all right some other tweets we got s2100 Matt tweeting us in a recent homebrew coding competition
10230080	10237000	someone remade Castlevania in zx spectrum graphics that's awesome you know though the original
10237000	10242600	Castlevania was actually on Commodore 64 it might have been was it vampire hunter that they released
10242600	10248240	it because wasn't that the original arcade it was vampire sex or msx so the fact is on zx spectrum
10248240	10253680	not a total reach but still very cool I love the D makes did you see flappy bird on the Commodore
10253680	10260880	64 no hilarious and of course I love love love and bring this up again super hexagon on Commodore
10260880	10269440	64 awesome there was a couple other tweets earlier in the week Eric RPG had sent us a tweet about
10269960	10275400	about a game that's being made that's inspired by f-zero I'm gonna see if I can bring up this link
10275400	10283000	real quick here it's a racing and shoot-em-up hybrid that's being made and it's got f-zero
10283000	10289320	influences and let's see it is a top-down racer with f-zero influences it's called the next
10289320	10295840	Penelope inspired by Ridge Racer type for kind of interesting you can check that out at indie
10295840	10301840	games calm if you want to see more information on that game and Flacco Jones also sent us a tweet
10301840	10308280	saying this might be interesting for your show and oh yeah I remember reading this link this let me
10308280	10313600	read the headline for you from AV Club point one five percent of mobile game players account for
10313600	10322600	half of all in-game revenue in other I don't know this stupid website has an ad on it but anyway so
10322600	10328000	I can't read much more than that headline but yeah point one five percent is generating half
10328000	10333160	of the revenue for these games I'm actually not surprised by that whatsoever there's just there's
10333160	10337320	some people that pump all this money into games you kind of go like is that what you're gonna
10337320	10341200	spend your money on but you know what it's up it's up to somebody how they want to spend the
10341200	10350560	money last but not least tech 2030 wants to give a shout-out to a Kickstarter project called koe
10350560	10356640	koe I hope I didn't mispronounce that but it's a it's an introduction to the Japanese language oh
10356640	10362240	well shit this is a game I probably need to play sounds like it's in the shell of a Japanese RPG
10362240	10368760	but it actually teaches you the Japanese language sign me up that's similar to Final Fantasy and
10368760	10373320	Pokemon hold on I'm trying to see it's actually out of the UK as well it's being raised in pounds
10373320	10379600	but if you have zero experience with the Japanese language or you are well versed and looking for
10379640	10386320	god damn it it is koe by the way because it says there if you are well versed and looking for a
10386320	10391080	supplement for your studies or just want to play a JRPG for old times sakes this is for you well
10391080	10394960	shit sign me up maybe I'll actually pronounce some of the games correctly in future weeks you're
10394960	10400440	getting better I'm getting better I think I think Akuma JP was complimenting me as well which is a
10400440	10403640	very nice compliment at least maybe I'm sounding like a kindergartener at this point remember
10403640	10418440	you a oh I owe you just kidding how about this Baca all right you can search for that over on
10418440	10423800	kickstarter if you want to see if yourself koe or it seems like somebody in chat just linked that so
10423800	10427920	there you go all right that is gonna do it for another episode of orange Australia that's it for
