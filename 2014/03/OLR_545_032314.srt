00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,840
This week, GDC is come and gone and the future is bright for 2014. Microsoft has given a

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,720
date for more of the Xbox One's release and the VR space is growing. Valve added a VR

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,240
mode to Steam and Sony showed off its concept to GDC. All this and more on the show where

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,720
every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,880
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,080
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number

7
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:52,100
545 for March 23, 2014 from our brand new studio N7. That's number 7. My name is Rob

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,860
Roberts and joining me here in our new digs is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Sommers.

9
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,360
It's echoey. It is a little echoey. Hello from space. I'm hoping that doesn't get picked

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,680
up by the mics too much but we might have to dampen the noise in here a little more

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,200
because this is supposed to be like a dining room. I ain't dampening shit. I'm okay because

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,880
people will fuss at me now that I've been doing it like I did it all of twice and then

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,340
fussed out when I didn't do it the third time. So sup bitches. Sup. So do you like

14
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,720
the new digs? I do. I do. I really like this door behind me that no one can see me just

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,260
pointing to. I know because it is Orange Lounge Radio. I fucking love that door and I want

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,160
to steal it. I'm taking that door home. Now by the way Jamie I have to apologize in advance

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,380
tonight because I'm kind of stealing your M.O. I've been getting over a sinus infection

18
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,660
the past few days which I know is usually your thing to be sick. Girl. No. So if I sound

19
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,460
different that's not the new studio's fault. That is the fact that. That's Rob's disease.

20
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,340
Yeah I'm actually getting over like I was really bad like this is I've had this since

21
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,740
Tuesday and I still can't shake it. Well you know I've avoided my annual sinus infection,

22
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,400
my sort of springtime infection because I found that there's a corticosteroid that's

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,180
over the counter and I bought the fuck out of it. And now my face doesn't feel like death

24
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,940
like it normally does right about now. Hooray. So. You stick it up your nose and you squeeze

25
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,820
shit up there. That sounds gross. And then you snort it. That sounds gross. When I put

26
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,140
it that way yeah it does. Alright well joining us not on the Skype line tonight but here

27
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,820
in studio welcome back everybody tech master Loki live in the flesh. I'm I'm sitting here

28
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm trying to find spots on the carpet and the floor that aren't. Wobbly for the. Wobbly

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,300
yes. Oh yeah good luck good luck with that. It's alright I think I figured it out. We

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,060
got to get used to the new digs and break them in a little bit. Well welcome back. Yeah

31
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:49,540
it's nice to actually be out of the kitchen. And in our kitchen. Well yeah it's it's it's

32
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,660
such it's so hard to like like I feel like seriously it's like mute mute mute mute mute

33
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,860
and just yeah yeah with all the kids and stuff in the background. So well I can make some

34
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,300
extra noise or something if it helps. I've been reading about the saga of Screamy. Yep

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,580
he also noticed what Captain Fuzzy Pants. I don't know about according to your lady.

36
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,940
He likes to scream. Well I don't say he likes his colicky so he screams himself to sleep

37
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:27,220
every night for a while which is why hopefully I'll be back next week because you know this

38
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,020
is the first night that the wife's put. Well she has her mom coming over to help but this

39
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,020
is the first time she's gonna be wrangling both kids at the same time you know. And so

40
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,780
tonight's a trial run with. She's not entirely happy with that but I was like it's like well

41
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:49,380
I'm gonna let you make this decision. I'm like I'm going sorry Nellie. But I'm like

42
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,620
it's been four months. Yeah I was just gonna say how did you like Dark Soccer's Christmas

43
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,860
present. You guys think I'm kidding but no he just opened it. Loki got to open his Christmas

44
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,980
present finally. I like it it's great. Share the chocolate with Nellie it sounds like she needs

45
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,020
it. Yeah there you go there you go butter her up with chocolate that always works. But you know

46
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,220
what I have to say I'm glad for people who can do the kid thing. Oh yeah. So glad I don't have any.

47
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:21,620
I have a cat. Yeah that's a you know parents my child is a cat. And Sanrio is finally getting

48
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,300
used to this whole new house you know she hid behind the toilet for a day and I posted. She

49
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,620
was trying to be one with the toilet. Well I posted that picture on Twitter where she was

50
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,780
trying to hide under the litter box. She doesn't like to be around other people at all. But now

51
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,900
she's kind of exploring a little more and actually she likes to jump up on the windowsill which was

52
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,180
something we never had in the apartment. Kitty cats need sunshine. Yeah absolutely absolutely.

53
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,460
Well believe it or not it is a show about video games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle. We

54
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,860
do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby

55
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,420
Blackwell show at the Voice of Geeks Network. Live.vognetwork.com is the place where you can

56
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,620
join us live if you want to chat along with our show tonight. And let's see going to going to

57
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,500
our chat room VX Jason XV says I'm not hearing echo. Well that's a good thing. Jason would know.

58
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,100
And by the way I'm glad Jason said something because this reminds me to acknowledge Jason

59
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,340
because Jason has helped out Studio N7 from afar as well. You guys might remember now I'm not

60
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,100
gonna promise this is gonna fix everything but you guys might remember especially if you're a

61
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,900
live listener the show has a tendency to drop once in a while. Well Jason said I think I have

62
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,940
an idea how to fix that. So he got us a brand new cable modem so we no longer have to rely on a

63
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,660
rental from the cable company. So thank you Jason. Big round of applause for Jay. I mean as if he

64
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,860
doesn't do enough for the show. It helps. That was very kind. I know going from like a rental modem

65
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,500
to a you know my own modem it helps. Now that I said now that I said that we're gonna drop in

66
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,260
five seconds. Dan and I invested in our own about a year ago. It made all the difference. Yeah so

67
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,460
um well either way I appreciate the fact that I don't have to rent another one or the other one

68
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,740
anymore I can just take it back so that'll be great. Tech 2030 in chat says it sounds a little

69
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,580
different than the old studio. Well hopefully in a good way. We tried to rebalance the mics and

70
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,500
everything. There's just not enough fuzzy furniture in the room that's why it's not yet. I think that

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,620
my tablet just doesn't like the connection though because I keep popping in and out. Don't. Well

72
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:27,540
we'll try to we'll try to work. Basted. Um Loki had a great idea though for the studio. We should

73
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,140
get like try to go to a yard sale and get one of those really tacky orange couches and have it here

74
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,780
on the side wall for the guests. Actually that's something that you can do yourself you know. What?

75
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,500
If you can get a couch that's in decent shape all you have to do is buy the right kind of material

76
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,140
and you can just sort of over upholster it. Yeah but like an or just even like put an orange throw

77
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,300
on it or something. Well no I'd say over upholster it and you know make sure it's really good. But

78
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:56,820
yeah I know how to do all that stuff. I'm crafty. There you go. Awesome. All right um let's see.

79
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,740
Tech 2030 clarifies just different. I don't know how to explain it and saying it doesn't sound bad

80
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,340
at all. Well that's good. I'm glad. I'm glad to hear things are in good shape. So listen it's a

81
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:14,340
trade-off. You either get my crappy headset audio or you get a slight reverberation from the kind

82
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,020
of empty room. Which we'll work on. We're gonna add more stuff in here and then. Speaking of which

83
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:25,660
I got like I said I've got a a bar top arcade cabinet that I built that's just sitting collecting

84
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,980
dust and one of the spare desks you know and my work. Also have a signed poster from True Crime

85
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,220
New York signed by the entire voice cast that's framed. They just gave me the frame they're like

86
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,220
I don't want to take that thing out of the frame. It frames yours now. I'm like okay cool. You know

87
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,220
there's a night if we don't get that orange couch there's a nice spot here for either like an arcade

88
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,980
machine or maybe a pinball machine. Maybe I can finally get that baby pac-man machine I've always

89
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,980
wanted my entire life. You want to borrow World Cup? Don't get it. Don't tempt me. Come get it. No

90
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,940
we were sticking with our three. Yeah no I don't blame you. No but we know how to get you into this

91
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,940
but for the record this is not the time to get into pinball. Is it getting really expensive? It's

92
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,220
been getting really expensive for the past two years like my when we got a jackpot we made a

93
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,900
really good trade for it we traded our old what do we have before we traded something for it the

94
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:26,060
the I think it was Black Knight 2000 is one of the things we traded for it but now like the

95
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,660
Twilight Zone that we got the I think we got it for around three grand at the time easily is going

96
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:38,420
for upwards of five and six so it's really really just appreciated since then. Gosh it's almost

97
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:44,620
like the home market the pinball market you know. Try to do trades and work and learn to shop them

98
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,900
and then pick up something light start trading up. Yeah I'm not interested in building up the

99
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,140
massive collection well I mean well you guys don't have the massive collection. We had 13 at

100
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:59,100
one time which is pretty decent. That's pretty we know a guy who has like 30 there's almost all the

101
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,940
new Stearns. There's still a YouTube out there on our YouTube channel over at Orange Launch Radio

102
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,740
on YouTube which by the way you know not only does Jason do the enhanced episodes of the show

103
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,420
over there but if you go back in the archives a little bit we actually did a tour of Jamie's

104
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,700
house a few years ago when she had all of those 13 tables so that was that was a really impressive

105
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,060
site of course you don't live in the house anymore but no and we're probably gonna be moving before

106
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,140
the years out we're gonna be looking for a new house but I guess I'm new today I got some new

107
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:39,140
I got some new. Tell us about your new acquisition today. Well the the vibe my poor old vibe is gone.

108
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,340
I have a Fiat now and it's blue it is very fucking blue and it's little and cute and I may have

109
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,620
ordered an Alliance sticker for it because I didn't think the N7 sticker looked fine on it

110
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,580
so since it's all blue it's gonna be I don't know what's call it either we were gonna call

111
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:03,180
it the Ferrari at because Fiat owns Ferrari but they also in Dodge so then I guess not you can't

112
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:09,900
have it all so I don't know. I'm going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw by

113
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,260
the way linked that video. As long as I'm not in it you can show it. You're in it. You're

114
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,500
definitely in it but I'm looking at chat and the pagan Jew is in chat say who is my new

115
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,220
friend I was gonna say I have not seen that name in chat before but I love I love that I love that

116
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,740
name the pagan Jew says man I what I've always wanted are those table style miss pac-man it's

117
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,420
like the cocktail table machines right yeah what how wouldn't you love that for a little table

118
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:43,220
right here instead of well there is a tutorial out on building one of your own but building a

119
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,860
coffee table size so that you have the middle part is the gaming area and the other you know

120
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,740
places to set your drinks and stuff down on I just need to get a pac-man battle royale those

121
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:02,580
are only what $5,000 you can swing it steam what steam oh just get downloaded on steam and run it

122
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:08,500
on a computer or something yeah yeah yeah I got you I got you or or I'm sure you know I they can't

123
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,340
be that sophisticated I'm sure that they'll dump it eventually for the record because the pagan

124
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:22,020
Jew brought it up I actually did start thinking about calling my my little Fiat the Kodiak because

125
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,100
it's the same color as the yeah too much Mass Effect it's a really pretty color though it

126
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,700
really is it's little though like I think I would have to if like you and Alan were to both come

127
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,340
with me in that car someone would have to sit sideways and backseat yeah Alan and I would not

128
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:47,060
both fit in your car yeah it's little Dan fit in it but our buddy that we actually actually have a

129
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,220
friend that works at car max that's where we got my car from he was like I'm gonna sit behind Jamie

130
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:59,540
cuz Dan pushed the seat all the way and no so yeah all right well okay so we've talked about a

131
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,220
lot of non gaming things we've talked about Loki's coming back to the show we've talked about our new

132
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,500
studio we've talked about dark sacros car let's get back to what the show is all about it's video

133
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,100
games and we're gonna start off talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

134
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,940
have been playing this week so that you got a frame of reference where our heads are at this

135
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,780
week with video games dark Sakura well I am playing through Mass Effect 3 again because and I'm gonna

136
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,740
go ahead and put this out there for everybody if anyone besides me is doing mods and finds after

137
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,900
you update your in video drivers that text mod and you mod are not working it actually is a

138
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:40,220
conflict with the Nvidia drivers and I have put up old Nvidia drivers on Mass Effect thing I did it

139
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,020
like two days ago so you can download run the old drivers and your mods will work again and text mod

140
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:55,580
and you mod but I was I'm playing more Mass Effect 3 I'm trying to finish out run number 17 so that I

141
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,580
can finish run number 18 I might actually just completely start over and make a completely

142
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:07,100
different character I haven't decided yet I might actually finish the game with not with my weirdo

143
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:15,500
albino Shepherd I don't know anyway so um I am also I started doing hunting logs on Final Fantasy

144
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:23,740
17 17 fuck the fuck Wow 14 travel to the few yes I time child avatars no fort what the fuck is seven

145
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:30,140
is all well I mean if you think about it 11 was an MMO 11 teen there was 12 13 and 14 is an MMO so

146
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,540
15 16 17 will be the next MMO so maybe I do you know something Darcy are you did you just breach

147
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:49,020
an NDA no I didn't anyway I meant 14 so whatevs um so anyway um I I I figured out I'm basically

148
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,460
just running around doing as much of the hunting log as I can and I'm on the appropriate level for

149
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:00,660
myself now like I am halfway through the hunting log the level for hunting log so that's really I'm

150
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:07,780
happy I'm still playing Animal Crossing and I now have blue roses so if anyone wants blue roses I

151
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:18,580
could be persuaded to turn on my game tonight and give one lucky person in chat who messages me

152
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:26,160
first to blue roses if such a person desires and what's the big flippin deal about is they

153
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,300
take fucking forever it took me an entire year to get hybrid Reds and then and I had to do perfect

154
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,740
town to do it so now did you have to grind the bones of Ed in or yes I had to sacrifice Ed to

155
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:45,260
the gods of my village no what you have to do is you have to you know you start off with your white

156
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,980
red or yellow roses you have to breed orange roses then you have to breed purple roses then

157
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,100
you have to breed purple and orange roses together to get a hybrid red and you have to have two hybrid

158
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,460
Reds to eventually maybe breed a blue I have so many fucking flowers in my village but now I have

159
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:09,940
like a big clutch of blue roses and so I in fact I will tell you what I will be kind enough to give

160
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:15,220
two people in chat blue roses because I have enough to do that all right well there you go

161
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,860
like reverse bachelor style or is that no they don't give them or they give them a rose of their

162
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,660
stains yeah I don't watch the bachelors yeah they give him a rose of their study so it is bachelors

163
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,100
there was a girl from Sacramento apparently on that show I heard and she got she got she got

164
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,460
totally screwed over by the guy in the end that's what I heard but I hear all this stuff you know on

165
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,860
the radios because I don't watch you know I like survivor and big bro I love Big Brother but that's

166
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,540
about the most reality TV I was oh and RuPaul's Drag Race that's that's important too but RuPaul's

167
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,060
RuPaul's Drag Race just transcends all other television they should get interesting like

168
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:53,540
reality twists you know they think they're going on a show for bachelor but it's survivor haha well

169
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,020
I always said that the best season of Survivor would be when they cast a bunch of drag queens

170
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:05,580
I mean let's be real that's that is must-see TV right there come on now to tie it back to video

171
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,660
games though have you ever have you ever played some of those video games based on TV there's

172
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,460
like a bachelor video game on mobile oh yes there is on the Wii and there's yet that's right there

173
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,380
was that and there's like a survivor video game also on the Wii and there well there was like an

174
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,820
old-school one on PC they're all terrible they are so like how are they too bad how are these

175
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:29,780
games so bad like in the licensing like well like at least like Wheel of Fortune Jeopardy the game

176
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,580
should press your luck like at least you know what you're gonna get you are gonna get those games and

177
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,020
even though they might not be the most fluid presentation sometimes they work well enough

178
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:44,820
for what they are but oh my god like Survivor is just bad it's so bad but anyway sorry I don't know

179
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,260
how we got on a tangent somehow we were on Dark Soccer's gaming weeks just talking about blue

180
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,420
roses did you did you get people to join your village yet I have two people and I am going to

181
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:00,420
go plant two roses near my train station I mean sorry four roses near my train station and two

182
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,740
are gonna be for acts deft and two will be for Queen Simeon there you go and then if you want

183
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,740
to try and steal it from one of them get to her village quickly and start whapping people with

184
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,540
bug nets and only the survivor will win all right Loki while she does that how was your gaming week

185
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:21,580
didn't play that much this week I think I played a little bit South Park I played Call of Duty

186
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:25,140
modern warfare 2 because I actually picked that up because we're kind of we were getting bored

187
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:30,700
with just modern warfare 1 because we've played it before we actually started off in modern warfare

188
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,700
1 then we moved to modern warfare 3 when we were playing on Xbox and then you know they wanted to

189
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,380
kind of go back to modern warfare 1 because it was what we considered the best game that we played in

190
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,420
the series so far well then I picked up modern warfare 2 and I think that's the best game in the

191
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:50,380
series so far and then I started the grind you know because in modern warfare 1 I had the grind

192
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:56,380
quite a bit just to get leveled up but apparently there's a lot of hackers on modern warfare 2 so it

193
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:01,300
didn't take me it only took me five games before I got into a modded game and I'm already ranked 70

194
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,940
now so hackers yeah my Xbox live game no it this is PlayStation Network and then you think no this

195
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,860
is PlayStation Network I'm playing on PlayStation 3 right now so yes and sorry hackers on my internet

196
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,980
thing but here's the thing though and like I don't really understand you know the point of it but

197
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:27,700
it was kind of like generous but like I don't this is retarded at the same time because when he came

198
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,500
in the first thing that happened was he ranked everybody up to seven unlocked everything so I'm

199
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,780
like hey cool I got all my stuff unlocked and then he proceeded to kill everybody with an aimbot I'm

200
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,540
like okay well this is I guess I guess I'll let you kill me the name but because you did rank me

201
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,300
up to 70 but you know I just don't I don't know why I'm still in this game and eventually it

202
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,860
actually the server detected that he was cheating and then kicked him off but the hell kinda like

203
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:58,620
what is that I'm good I'm gonna bring you up up up up and then take you down I don't get it but

204
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,860
I'm like hey cool now I made you and now I'm gonna break you snap it kind of sucks because I was

205
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,940
enjoying you know kind of leveling up and grinding a little bit because I was you know enjoying you

206
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,940
figuring out the classes and stuff and then they got ranked up to 70 I'm like well I don't need to

207
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,820
play this anymore so I'll just wait until we play her actual private matches but technically I didn't

208
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:24,180
cheat somebody else I benefited well this happened to my co-worker on modern warfare one he got

209
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:31,300
ranked up to level 50 and so I you know he got everything unlocked because at one time I was

210
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:36,260
like hey why is your clan tag marked as something and he's like I don't know I don't know how to

211
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:43,220
change that so I played that I played more South Park the stick of truth and that game is hilarious

212
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:54,620
and what else they play a little bit 2048 just because you know it's addicting and how what else

213
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:01,900
I think that's actually it oh I played a little bit modern warfare one because we this Wednesday

214
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:08,060
we actually played a private game but that's probably gonna be the end of that so yeah lots

215
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:14,860
of modern warfare old modern warfare games and I don't know I don't have a lot of gaming time

216
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,140
anymore so it's it's kind of limited to that with two kids you don't have gaming time what are you

217
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,620
talking about oh yeah all right my gaming week I was also pressed for time a little bit this week

218
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,080
with you know the whole moving thing and in trying to get everything wrapped up with the other

219
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,280
apartment which finally took those keys over on Saturday and it felt so good to be rid of that

220
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,560
but anyway I did fit in a little gaming time and one game that's been taking up quite a bit of my

221
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,320
time besides besides Final Fantasy 14 that's always a given because I'm on a rating team in

222
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
Final Fantasy 14 so I'm always playing that you know at least one or two two nights a week but

223
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,160
I've been playing Diablo 3 again you know I know I've been talking about this on the show the past

224
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,000
couple weeks but with the expansion coming out this this Tuesday is the big day for the expansion

225
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,520
they were doing an experience boost they were doing 50% experience boost for a couple weeks

226
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,120
well they up the ante for this weekend only and it's a hundred percent experience boost so it's

227
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,080
like get my paragon levels get my paragon levels as fast I can because in Diablo if you didn't know

228
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,400
you level your character from 1 to 60 and then in the expansion that's going to be 70 but once you

229
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,000
hit max level you start grinding these things called paragon levels and the paragon levels go

230
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,840
from 1 to 500 which I know seems like wow you can level your character to 500 it doesn't really work

231
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,440
that way because the paragon levels all they do is they give you one stat boost and they rotate

232
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:39,080
through four categories it's like offensive defensive utility and a potpourri I don't know

233
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,840
there's some other thing but you you choose basically what you want to put your stats in

234
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,840
in those but the cool thing about the paragon levels is that they are for all of your characters

235
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,120
so let's say I am paragon level 26 which is where my character is at right now if I start a brand

236
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,960
new character she'll be level 1 but character level or paragon level 26 so I can still put

237
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,560
those 26 points and stat boosts into my level 1 character so that's pretty cool that's why a lot

238
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:11,640
of people get 26 per character or is it just you know it's 26 per character but it's not I mean

239
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,360
it's not the gigantic boost you it sounds like it is like 26 levels because like let me like okay

240
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,480
it cycles through the four and one of them is offensive and so I keep putting my points in

241
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,560
critical hit chance so each point is a tenth of a percent increase in critical hit chance so it's

242
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:35,320
not okay so it's like the Borderlands 2 system that they have for experience awesome points or

243
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,360
something I bet it is yeah I bet it's a very similar thing they probably won one probably

244
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,800
borrowed from the other and probably yeah I would be surprised at all so that's that's a big thing

245
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,040
everybody grinding because knowing that the expansion hits Tuesday now instead of paragon

246
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,040
leveling everybody's gonna be taking their characters to level 70 but they'll be able

247
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,240
to carry those paragon levels with them as they level through act 5 so it's you know people are

248
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:03,480
very busy with that so been we have a clan for Horde house my other show so you know just finding

249
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,080
other people to play with them their eyes they haven't given you a way to just pay to level up

250
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:15,000
to 70 yeah right or giving you a free boost with the pre-order for the expansion none of that yet

251
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,920
not yet not yet we can level up really fast now but anyway yeah also in Diablo news this week

252
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,160
the auction house shut down so that is done so if you were staying away from Diablo 3 because

253
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,720
you were waiting for the auction house to go away well here's a chance there's no more auction house

254
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,600
the icon is still there because people can claim their items and cash out everything through like

255
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,680
June but you can't list things anymore it's it's done so there you go so there's that the only

256
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:49,280
thing that makes me a little sour face at Diablo 3 is I was reading the FAQ for the expansion and

257
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,560
everything for the expansion on launch day and they're telling people what to expect and

258
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,400
everything right and so if you remember when Diablo 3 originally launched everybody was

259
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,920
hitting that error 37 right it was a big big thing and you know the game got a lot of shit

260
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:08,280
because you know back when Diablo 2 did not have mandatory online I didn't have to deal with this

261
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:15,560
fuckery well they're saying on the FAQ launch page you might hit a queue when logging into

262
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,840
Diablo 3 and you know if you hit the queue just wait and you'll be able to attack the monster and

263
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:27,480
I'm kind of thinking like that doesn't help the case that people do not like that this game has

264
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,880
mandatory online which by the way is not a problem in the PlayStation and Xbox versions still don't

265
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,520
know when the PlayStation 4 version is coming out but I imagine the holiday at this point they're

266
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,160
gonna bundle it with the expand they're waiting for all the PC people to buy the expansion I

267
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,280
thought they already they're gonna announce 30 or they said that the PlayStation 4 version was

268
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,480
gonna be that you know with the reaper of souls and stuff in there is I how can it not at this

269
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,960
point they may have but and I missed it but how can it not at this point but they wouldn't want

270
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,440
to announce that because that's gonna cut into PC sales of the people who want to play it now

271
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,880
so they're gonna wait until a month after and then they'll announce that the ps4 one officially

272
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:10,640
has both well watch I've been following Blizzard way too long it's exactly how it's gonna go down

273
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,520
so anyway God where was I with that whole mess yeah oh yes there's gonna be a queue to possibly

274
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,760
get into Diablo thumbs yeah a little a little ridiculous a little ridiculous so I am making

275
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,680
a little bit of stank face at the game for that but I'm also not the type of Diablo player where

276
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,360
I have to be in there day one like I'm not like that big on it so if I can't play right away then

277
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,480
what else I'm not not worried about it one other game I've been playing this week and I think a lot

278
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,200
of you all you all out there have been playing this as well I have been playing the Final Fantasy

279
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,640
10 HD remaster which does include 10 2 but I've only been playing 10 because you know I want to

280
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:55,040
play that first huh what what can I do for you no I'm not playing 10 2 yet I'm playing playing just

281
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:02,520
10 right now but um I it is what you would expect it is Final Fantasy 10 but it's in widescreen and

282
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,080
with with up bridge graphics you know Alan walked in when I was playing and he's like I can't really

283
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,760
tell the difference I could though like and I don't know if that's just the quality of TV has

284
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,880
gone up in the 10 years or no longer than that probably 15 years since Final Fantasy 10 was first

285
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,360
out but just like I'm like the colors are more vibrant things just look crisper and better this

286
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,120
soundtrack has been redone a little bit and I don't find the redo the redos of the songs are

287
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:34,000
faithful to the originals they didn't like like completely screw up the chocobo music or anything

288
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,040
like that like everything still stays faithful to the original the only thing I don't remember the

289
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,760
loading times being such a bear in the Final Fantasy 10 version on PlayStation 2 or loading

290
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:53,400
times yeah oh yeah like you know and it's just the put in the disc launch the game oh okay now

291
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,400
I'm on the main menu where I choose which game do I want to play all right pick FF 10 loading

292
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,160
all right gonna click load game loading gonna load my game loading this is kind of like all right

293
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,640
there's a lot of loading screens here and I was kind of surprised didn't do any type of like

294
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,000
install or anything to try and maybe minimize that a little bit but that's like my one little

295
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,720
bitch and you know what to be honest maybe it was that way and I just forgot after all these years

296
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,320
but I felt like on PlayStation 2 it seemed like I kind of got in there a little faster and got to

297
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,000
play my game or as you know you gotta say say your time aside go get your drink and your sandwich

298
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,920
before you play your game but that's my one one minor little bitch with Final Fantasy 10 otherwise

299
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,800
it's it's a great deal especially if you know I realized we have a lot of listeners that are

300
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,840
probably like 18 to 21 you know kind of in that range so you were probably too young when Final

301
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,080
Fantasy 10 first came out and maybe you've gone back and experienced it which you know thumbs up

302
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,440
good for you but if you somehow miss these games but you do kind of like Japanese RPGs and you like

303
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,080
those types of games or you're interested in them I think this is a great way to pick them up you

304
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,160
know it's only what it's like 40 bucks for the two games it's that's a great deal and it's not only

305
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,680
the two games they are the international versions for the first time in America so that's pretty

306
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,960
cool because you can do the alternate sphere grid I had I have the international version for

307
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,160
10-2 so okay there you go but you had to import that right yeah yeah I did but it played just

308
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,080
fine it also comes with the audio drama that plays over some credits there was like a Final

309
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,520
Fantasy 10 audio drama or something that came after 10-2 and then there's a another Final

310
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,280
Fantasy 10 like extended movie or something or is there am I thinking last mission oh no there's

311
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:43,360
like every bonus that goes with Final Fantasy 10 is all there I mean it's all with it I'm trying

312
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,720
to be that guy who goes through and plays one at a time but if it goes anything like Kingdom Hearts

313
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,160
did I'll get like a quarter of the way through the game and then be like oh my South Park game

314
00:28:52,160 --> 00:29:00,640
is here time to go play that because I'm waiting on that now so it's fantastic yeah I'm going to

315
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,240
the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com act deft and chat says Final Fantasy 10 sucks anyway well

316
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,360
you know what that's what I have to say Syal in chat says I'll play Diablo 3 when offline mode

317
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,880
becomes a thing the PlayStation 3 version or Xbox 360 version are for you offline mode is a thing

318
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,560
in those games if you're curious so there you go s2100 Matt says kind of reminds me of the horrible

319
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,840
loading times for the Final Fantasy Chronicles disc Final Fantasy 4 and chrono trigger for ps1

320
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,760
well here's the good news it doesn't load for like battles and things like that I mean that

321
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,920
feels fluid like that was the annoying pain in the ass thing about those was like every time you

322
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,840
got into a random battle there was like a little loading time that was a bit much on those like old

323
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,080
PlayStation games but you don't you don't have that here it's not that bad so all right so that's

324
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,800
gonna do it for our gaming weeks so quickly our housekeeping I don't have a whole lot to say here

325
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,400
since you know we had our week off last week but I hope you got y'all enjoyed the tape show that we

326
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:07,280
ran over Loki's budgeted time sorry about that but we made it work sorry it was the baby crying

327
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,320
I understand but I'm glad we were able to do something for the listeners I saw there were a

328
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,080
lot of people that use the passphrase that's hidden in the show to check in so I know a lot

329
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,040
of you guys were checking it out one way or another so I'm glad we could do a little something for you

330
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:25,320
guys but now we're back to our form and and hopefully coming at you for the next next many

331
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:31,800
few weeks here solid twitter.com slash olr facebook.com slash orange launch radio or google.com

332
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,640
slash plus orange lounge radio all the different ways you can follow us on social media I should

333
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,760
throw this little a little teaser out there too we are thinking about what we're gonna do for a

334
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,440
new look at orange lounge radio.com because you know we've had that old website that we've kind

335
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,440
of neglected a little bit ever since vog network launched because a lot of the focus has been over

336
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,680
there and with good reason but we are gonna kind of take a look at what can we do to orange

337
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,160
lounge radio.com to kind of make it a real central hub for show related things and more

338
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,640
info about the show and you know the fact that this show does have a 12 year history behind it

339
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,040
and counting so you know kind of some of the historical things for our show and what we can

340
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:16,040
put on there so we're old don't remind me you know what these posters these posters keep me young you

341
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,920
see that that is some of these posters are older than some of our listeners that's a DDR second

342
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:27,040
mix marquee which which of these posters would be older than one of our listeners maybe the second

343
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:32,240
mix marquee second mix marquee that would be for one of the Silent Hill 3 poster baby I don't know

344
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,720
I would hope I would hope we don't have 12 11 come out it was 2005 so you were doing second mix yeah

345
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:48,360
anyway cloud here on a wall scroll um to give the visual to you guys there will I will probably do

346
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,520
a YouTube of it I'll do like a little YouTube to put for the channel and and have Jason make it

347
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,560
nice if he's willing to do that and put it up on our channels that way you guys can go check out

348
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,240
our YouTube channel we'll give you a little visual look of our studio once once we get a little more

349
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,920
in here I think it'll be really ready to show off so yeah there you go um okay so let's get into our

350
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:15,600
gaming news tonight Loki once you start us off so it was rumored that they were gonna do this and

351
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:23,920
of course they did it so Sony kind of announced their codenamed project Morpheus what that is is

352
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:30,960
basically their VR headset and spec wise it sounds kind of similar to the oculus rift it's you know

353
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:43,800
1080p 90 plus degrees field of view also kind of utilizes the PlayStation camera I guess it

354
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,960
sort of has like the same move motion sensors built into it and of course a bunch of support

355
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,240
from all sorts of middleware and development companies that unity havoc you know epic games

356
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:06,720
Autodesk crytek you know all the big guys and of course no information on price no information on

357
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,240
release date or anything like that they did show off some tech demos utilizing games that are

358
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,040
already out there like thief looks interesting I mean I'm kind of excited about VR actually

359
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,720
coming mainstream to consoles my only concern of course with anything that you know you have

360
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,600
like a new technology is the first few games that come out for it are gonna be very gimmicky

361
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,600
it's just like I don't know like even with the 3d stuff on the 3ds or with the motion controls

362
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,080
on the Wii and even the second screen on the DS it was just gimmick gimmick gimmick gimmick this

363
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,320
isn't really needed oh hey or hate the Kinect any games that have come out for the Kinect they

364
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,440
haven't been dancing game and pretty much gimmick gimmick gimmick gimmick so that's the only thing

365
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm concerned about and probably price point because you know that's really expensive then

366
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,640
I don't really want to buy it well the cost of the technology may come down a little bit though

367
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,400
by the time this thing actually comes out I mean I really don't think you guys should expect to see

368
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,800
it this year I think we're talking out there I think they even said not this year yeah holiday

369
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,120
2015 maybe I mean and you guys have to remember it is game developers conference this announcement

370
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,520
was not an e3 type of announcement and that's where some people you know and Bobby gets into

371
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,400
this a lot more on his show where he you know and he kind of has that perspective because he does

372
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,920
develop games like flappy vlog and all that right so he does kind of have that perspective and and

373
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,080
that game developers conference is not e3 and we kind of have to remember that sometimes we get

374
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,800
thrown little tidbits you get thrown little things and you know to try and get excitement

375
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,880
and sure ever everybody wants the media to report on them so sometimes you're gonna get a little

376
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,120
bone thrown at you but you have to remember the news isn't really for you and something like this

377
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,360
especially for Sony to kind of say all right we are gonna do this for the PlayStation 4 can get

378
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,280
developers thinking all right what kind of game do I want to make because you can't really make

379
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,360
a PlayStation 4 game overnight you know people are working on now the stuff that's gonna come out

380
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,640
holiday 2015 holiday 2016 for heaven's sake you know things that are way way out that's how long

381
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,560
a video game takes to make so I mean by kind of announcing this publicly to the developers now

382
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,720
it's kind of like all right no more of this leaked stuff we all know this is something we're working

383
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,560
on here's the specs and you know good luck have fun with it I would love to see like something

384
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,960
like this being patched into like currently you know like games that are already out there even

385
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,000
like re-releasing them with this kind of like how they do with kind of the move stuff obviously you

386
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,120
know adding motion controls versus adding you know a whole second camera to make it stereoscopic

387
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,680
and all that stuff and head tracking and all that it's a lot more complicated but it'd be kind of

388
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,560
cool you know to be able to play like say Killzone or something like that in VR or even Minecraft in

389
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,840
VR I mean cuz obviously the oculus rift version was pretty cool so I would like to try that and

390
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,360
also you know if the price point is nice I'm going to our chat room real quick real quick

391
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Ragingator in chat at live.vognetwork.com says will project Morpheus offer users the choice of

392
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:08,640
a red pill or a blue pill hahaha well let us not let us not forget project Morpheus won't be the

393
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,800
final name I mean there's all there's development names all the time yeah we're still playing the

394
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,000
revolution in ultra 64 y'all right yeah besides the project Morpheus that's something more I'd

395
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:29,400
see associated with the one fuck off all right but speaking of the choice I hate you so much go

396
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,680
back home all right I'm kidding all right it is good to have you back speaking of the choice

397
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,080
between the red pill and the blue pill now users are gonna be faced with a choice between project

398
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,800
Morpheus and oculus rift or are they and then also there's you know Microsoft what they're coming out

399
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,120
with remember that there's this whole roadmap thing that leaked out I want to say is it been

400
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,680
a year or two years now you know talking about the whole you know Kinect and Xbox one and you know

401
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,680
this whole project for tell fortaleza which I guess they're singing translates to fortress in

402
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,880
Portuguese if I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean but they're saying it's supposed

403
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,440
to be like some sort of like augmented reality of VR type thing and it's something that they're

404
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,400
apparently working on this is now also being confirmed by like I guess a second source now

405
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,400
it's whatever happened to the the luma room thing that Microsoft was doing I thought that was their

406
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,440
thing um no that was something else but it apparently is just too costly right now with

407
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,520
you know what's out there I mean how you're asking someone to basically set up a projector

408
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:38,920
that's gonna project stuff on the walls I mean that sounds cool but it's just it's too expensive

409
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,280
and just imagine trying to sell that you need a very specific room for that it's just not something

410
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,040
that anybody could do I mean it'd be neat if they can actually do that and pull it off well now wait

411
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,800
a minute you dodged my question let's go back are you gonna are you do you feel like you're gonna

412
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,000
have to make a choice between oculus rift and project Morpheus or do you think there's room in

413
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,360
a gamer's house for both depends on the price and just you know once again like I haven't really been

414
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:14,160
jumping into just buying you know a PlayStation 4 and Xbox one or even a new gaming PC I'm just

415
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,120
gotta see what's gonna be for it I'm not gonna just jump in and buy you know a new console and

416
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:27,520
like you know $200 plus device and you know what were they gonna support with it I mean what kind

417
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,840
of games are gonna see cuz remember you know we did this with like the Kinect and stuff like oh

418
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,840
you need to get the Kinect to play all these games and then it's very limited way you can play it's

419
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,320
like okay I can play dancing games or I can play games that implement Kinect for really stupid

420
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,360
reasons you know you know I don't know it I gotta wait and see what they have for it I mean I think

421
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,240
I'd hope with VR that there's gonna be some cooler stuff with it but it's all gonna be also how

422
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,160
sensitive everything is you know is it gonna be able to pick up movements out you know obviously

423
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,800
with this these newer cameras and stuff they're a lot better than the original connector even the

424
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,160
PlayStation I was so I'm hoping that it will be a better experience but I have to see that I have

425
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:14,480
to see the reviews games all that stuff for me even though I I get the competitions healthy and

426
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,700
I think that'll be kind of a good thing in this case you know and I get that they are and they

427
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,680
aren't competing I mean the PC market and the console market are very different right and the

428
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,420
things that are gonna be good for oculus rift on PC versus Morpheus on ps4 is just like back to

429
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,820
those same adages about PlayStation 4 I see about console gaming in general versus PC gaming is that

430
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,780
you know with console gaming you have your sets of standards and you never have to worry about

431
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,740
that but at the same time you are stuck within those standards whereas PCs can kind of always

432
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,780
continuously upgrade right so that's you know there's gonna be pros and cons between the two

433
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:51,860
you know whatever and I'm sure you're gonna see some game overlap between the two for me the the

434
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:57,660
honest-to-god thing I'm having a hard time conceptualizing is how why would I want two

435
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:04,660
VR headsets in my house and maybe this is just like a I'm not like like I'm sure there was a

436
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,700
time in a day where people were going like you mean I need to have a Nintendo and a Sega in my

437
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:16,300
house I don't need both right or even way back in the day I need to have two television sets in my

438
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:22,620
house what am I gonna do with two television sets I only need one so maybe that's just I you know

439
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,860
again once like all the games are there it might but I just right now I'm like I don't want to buy

440
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:33,220
two VR sets the thing is like you know I kind of view a VR set is almost like having a TV it's like

441
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:38,900
well this is stupid that I should have a second TV to play a second game system on one this TV

442
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,660
could easily play both game systems they should just be able to switch back and forth and here's

443
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,740
the thing like they're even talking with the other project Morpheus headset they have a game

444
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:54,940
with the Eve Valkyrie I think is what it was that is a game that's being co-published by oculus so

445
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,500
that's kind of interesting right there that there's a little bit I don't know if it's being done by a

446
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:06,540
different company for you know for the PlayStation 4 but the fact that that's also coming to this

447
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,180
head says well it's like it would be nice if it was just all oculus or all one company together

448
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:18,420
making this device that could be used across everything but of course everybody wants their

449
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,700
own things so they can patent it and sue each other and all that fun stuff I'm going to our

450
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:28,980
chat room over at live dot vog network calm Akuma JP says in Japan no room to spare oh that's a good

451
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,140
point and you know I'm not I'm not were there Japanese developers in that list of people for

452
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,660
project Morpheus because now that I think about it you know again I don't follow oculus rift as

453
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,980
closely as say Bobby or some of the other fans will but our Japanese developers it wasn't it

454
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,220
wasn't necessarily developers it's more of like engines and middleware and that type of stuff so

455
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:54,340
like you know unity unity or even like you know unreal and stuff that's used by different

456
00:41:54,340 --> 00:42:00,140
developers you know it could be you know from all all corners of the world so I don't think that's

457
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,860
I'm sure that especially you know being that I think that would take off from Japan if the

458
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:09,500
prices right because you know that is a big selling point not a lot of space VR could be

459
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,340
pretty cool well I'm curious if there's going to be like maybe a cultural difference you know

460
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,420
sometimes there are differences in the games that work in Japan versus that work here and vice versa

461
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,940
I'm curious if VR is something that's going to be on both sides you know because Sony obviously has

462
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,260
a big presence in Japan and America so I just I'm just kind of curious I mean I just I honestly

463
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:34,580
don't know how well VR is received in Japan maybe maybe Akuma or some of our other folks know well

464
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,700
Bobby Black Wolf's there saying in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com there are a lot of Asian

465
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:46,860
developers working on the rift that's where most of the porn is from actually I'm and that's what

466
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:51,380
I was gonna say I'm totally looking forward to all the you know all the not necessarily pornographic

467
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,580
but all the perverted games coming from Japan who never use this there's a there's a very big plus

468
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:02,020
in the oculus rift column I'm serious there's a very big plus in the oculus rift column you know

469
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:07,900
why because everything on the PlayStation one's gonna be controlled whereas the oculus rift you

470
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,740
can literally you know anybody that has a dev kit can make stuff for it and I'm not just you know

471
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:19,220
I'm not just talking about porn although you know hey but you know it's it's the other stuff as well

472
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,300
you're not gonna really be able to get that same homegrown stuff on the PlayStation 4 I mean yes I

473
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,060
know that PlayStation embraces the indie developers and so forth but it's it's so much different like

474
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,740
you know like Bobby Black Wolf can't put flappy vog on PlayStation 4 as easy as he put it out

475
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,220
there on the internet you know I mean that's that's like the difference what I'm saying so

476
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:46,980
anyway let's see Alan alchemy in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says VR porn is

477
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,660
terrifying because you have a helmet on like you can be jerking it and have three people watching

478
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,220
you with their cell phones out that is not a future I want to live in not only that but

479
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,020
because you know like something like this device would be utilizing a secondary camera you could

480
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,060
actually watch yourself jerking and have the VR camera on at the same time you'd have it like

481
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,700
you know picture-in-picture almost if you're into that sort of thing I guess Wow so like

482
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,380
would would cam sex have a whole new thing to it we're like I don't know I don't know it's

483
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:27,100
POB to the max wouldn't be camp starvation too much like hamster so I don't know people are

484
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:33,660
into hamsters let's see SSG 100 man our chair at live.vognetwork.com says the hardcore gamers

485
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,220
only compile a margin of the overall profits towards gaming sales while the hardcore gamers

486
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,180
might have interest in this it doesn't mean that the casual people will jump at this VR not just

487
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:52,700
the Sony thing but also the rift well it depends on if they can get Wii Sports on it or all tongue

488
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:59,220
and cheekiness aside if they can find that Wii Sports type of game that sells it I mean think

489
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:07,980
about it Wii Sports sold the Wii that is how you push a peripheral I has there ever in history been

490
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,940
a game that better sold a peripheral than Wii Sports I don't think there has Super Mario

491
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:20,140
Brothers that wasn't that's not really a peripheral that's the whole damn system I don't

492
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:27,480
well me I can't you might and I'm sure somebody's gonna say DDR but dude Wii Sports was million

493
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,220
DDR zillion for the master system I don't know about that because well I mean the whole hair

494
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,340
to Wii Sports come on not in that respect but zillion was pretty big for pushing master systems

495
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:45,660
because they based the whole light gun off of the zillion gun maybe centipede and a trackball

496
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:52,500
I'm reaching here but that that's a tempest that in the trackball that was a good point good point

497
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,980
that's what I'm saying though I mean we could we could name all these different types of things

498
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:01,020
here but that's what I'm saying is that oculus rift and project Morpheus need its Wii Sports

499
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:06,660
that's what's gonna really sell those things all right let's move on with some other news here

500
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,860
because it is only a three-hour show we could talk VR all night long I'm sure but I want to

501
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,140
talk a little bit about some really big retail news that broke I think it was around the same

502
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,460
time as game developers conference but this was not from game developers conference Walmart

503
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:27,900
announced that starting March 26 you can trade in your used games at more than 3100 Walmart stores

504
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,140
and in exchange you'll get a gift card that you can use at Walmart or Sam's Club all the exchange

505
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,060
products will be sent for refurbishment and then will be made available for purchase in like new

506
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:45,340
condition so Walmart don't fall for it don't fall for it you are you are already ready to hate on

507
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,180
this well I fucking hate Walmart I don't really try not to give them my business they're a highly

508
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:56,220
disreputable company uh-huh they're just just research their business practices before you

509
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:01,100
give them it I like GameStop better than Walmart oh that's it okay but here okay so the hate boner

510
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,220
is strong with this one but but your your hate boner for Walmart does that have anything to do

511
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,220
with the whole use or do you think there's something about this used game practice that

512
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,020
actually is going to be bad no I don't there's anything about the practice it's just that I think

513
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:21,660
that in terms of social morality they're about the lowest on the pole you can get so I don't support

514
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,780
them I would rather other people not support them I would rather just go to the mom-and-pop stores

515
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:34,020
go to games go to GameStop before you go there and definitely go to Costco before you go to Sam's

516
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,100
Club um just to give you an idea about how some things are going for Walmart right now the

517
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,500
PlayStation 4 you can trade in for three hundred and seventy five dollars the Xbox one three

518
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:49,460
hundred and ninety dollars the that's a pretty good trade-in value I'd have to say the Wii U

519
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:57,780
deluxe $120 a 3g Vita is $95 that's actually kind of tempting because I don't really need the 3g in

520
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:05,100
my Vita I've never used it Grand Theft Auto 5 do not give them money $27 I won't $27 72 cents

521
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:11,700
Super Mario 3d World $38 those really aren't bad values but I mean honestly at the end of the day

522
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,940
Dark Sakura what I prefer to do I cut out the middleman entirely well I mean I sell my games

523
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,500
on eBay I mean so I guess yeah eBay is the middleman but I feel like it does still put

524
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,720
me direct with the buyer and I get profit that way I would like to point out to Tiger Claw that

525
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:31,700
people of Walmart is really a very not everyone who goes to Walmart looks like that that's just

526
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:37,620
playing into stereotypes sure but the average person doesn't choose to educate themselves on

527
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:44,260
the business practices of the place that they go to so I really really would rather that people

528
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:49,660
actually put conscious effort into making the world a bit of a better place and not putting

529
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,740
money into the hands of the people who are trying to fuck it over well here's the thing though Dark

530
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:59,260
Sakura is that people you know the reality of the situation is Walmart is huge whether we like it or

531
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:06,020
not they're huge they're a behemoth out there and I I could really see where this is gonna be a big

532
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,640
thing I think it would have been a bigger thing five years ago I think Walmart's really late to

533
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,720
the game in this regard but you know if if you had been able to take your games in and get that

534
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,280
money that you could put towards groceries especially when the recession hit I think that

535
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,000
would have been huge for Walmart yeah but I think that I would still be able to find other ways to

536
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,600
get money there are there's a there's actually other places out there who will give you money

537
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,560
for your games we have dimple sure and you probably get as much well dimples a local chain

538
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,400
but a lot of places everybody's getting in on this Amazon you do their Amazon you can buy a lot of

539
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,840
groceries out from Amazon in some cities you can do this for through I think Best Buy was to you

540
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,120
but I think they ended it but there's there's definitely other places that you can go look you

541
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,040
probably know a few more to that I'm not thinking of but what's your thoughts on Walmart taking the

542
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:59,880
used games do you think it'll be successful for sure they'll do okay with it I don't know if it's

543
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,080
gonna be just like it all depends on what what their trade-in values are and what they're

544
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:10,160
reselling their used games at I mean that's really gonna decide how successful is because you know

545
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:15,360
all they're gonna do is you know someone's gonna come up with a metric where okay game

546
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,560
subs give me this Walmart's give me this here's where I'm gonna go you know especially if they're

547
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,920
looking just to turn it around and purchase games with it now I don't know if Walmart does pre-orders

548
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:32,000
on new games I mean I think that they do but I don't know no target does so I would think where

549
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,960
one does the other probably does too but see that that's the thing is I mean I'm sure they don't

550
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,640
really care because they're just looking at reselling that you know used stuff and making

551
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,480
more of a profit margin from it so they could care less about you know the people that usually go to

552
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,480
Walmart are looking for deals I mean and even the few time I don't really care to shop at Walmart

553
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,760
either but the few times I have gone there because I purposely need something cheaply made are the

554
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,400
only times I've gone to Walmart like I need a really shitty sheet for a theater production

555
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,880
and I actually need it to be so shitty that it see through when you put a light behind it I think

556
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,200
that was the last time I went to Walmart it was I actually needed a terrible sheet but it but anyway

557
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,160
that the people that you you usually are going to Walmart looking for deals I would think are gonna

558
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,760
really benefit from having to use games there because they're gonna be cheaper and people are

559
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,160
gonna be like hey I don't care that it's a minute they'll throw in a dump in and people eat it up

560
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,000
just like they eat up the cheap DVDs that they have yeah for real I don't know you can see that

561
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,680
happening act-def in our chat room at live that vog network comm says Walmart does pre-orders so

562
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:44,760
there you go I confirm that they do that do that I'm not surprised at all it doesn't seem like a

563
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,360
particularly difficult thing for a company to do and you know kind of gets gets a little bit of

564
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:55,280
their money and their customer loyalty from that all right anyway let's move on with some more news

565
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:02,400
dark soccer with some interesting news coming up as soon as I can get my connection till you know

566
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:08,400
to participate with the show live instead of participate five you know five hours from now

567
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:14,160
so this is I know I'm actually not super sad about this but you remember I met somebody who

568
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,800
was on my list of people to meet one year at e3 and it was this particular kind of rock star

569
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:29,240
fella it was a Igarashi Koji who designed most of the latest to Castlevania games and was one

570
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:36,880
of the developers for Symphony of the Night or as it was in Japan Nocturne in the Moonlight which

571
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:44,920
is I think a better name basically he left Konami his last day was on March 15th and I'm gonna go

572
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,800
ahead and read his quote because I actually like how he says it he said I've decided to break out

573
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,440
on my own to have the freedom to make the kind of games I really want to make the same kind I think

574
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,720
fans of my past games want as well leaving Konami was a big decision not one I took lightly I've

575
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,480
spent my entire career there made many friends had a lot of great opportunities but I hope all

576
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,360
the gamers and fans have supported me in the past will join me in being excited about what comes

577
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:17,240
next wish me luck and I just got to meet him I you know we he put up with my really at the time

578
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:27,640
awful Japanese and he's just a really neat guy I mean just you know to have met just once but I'm

579
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:32,440
actually not sad to see him leaving Konami I think that we're gonna see I would like to be able to

580
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:38,520
see his work with a lot more freedom because he's clearly very creative has fantastic ideas and I

581
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,320
think it's gonna be good for him and for the gaming community in general to see what else he

582
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,320
can come up with it's kind of interesting seeing that the reason one of the reasons I guess he left

583
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,320
it was the whole fact that Konami is now kind of focusing more on social gaming and kind of the

584
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:57,840
mobile scene you know basically he said you know the more hardcore the game the less suitable is

585
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:02,640
for the casual market unfortunately I'm good at making core experiences so it was two years of

586
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:08,320
making the game that leaned to hardcore for the social market so it was canceled then I'd try

587
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:15,480
again and be canceled and again and be canceled so this this is a very interesting read of sorts

588
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:19,320
on where Konami in general has been heading because you know I think we were even just a

589
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,800
couple weeks sitting here going what is really Konami got in their in their cards right now

590
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,160
besides Metal Gear these days on consoles the metal gear and Pro Evo that's they don't they

591
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:33,720
don't really push out a lot of the franchises like they used to back in the day when we had a show

592
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,760
that was half dedicated to one of their franchise a Konami franchise I mean that is not the same

593
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,760
Konami that's there now but yeah they really crank out social stuff mobile phones and let's not forget

594
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:51,800
and pachinko and really lucrative market for them actually Konami's in that business to listen

595
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,160
let's not forget that you go to a casino and you'll see the Konami logo on a lot of the slot

596
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,440
machines it's always cracked me up before the record where's my DDR slot machine I want to know

597
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,880
I would also like to point out to people who call the Castlevania games on the handhelds as

598
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,360
Metroidvania yeah she said when working on Symphony of the Night that his biggest influence was

599
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:16,760
actually the Legend of Zelda that Metroid didn't factor into it oh interesting that it was the

600
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:26,300
the exploration and finding and hidden things here and there that inspired part of the item

601
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:33,720
system for Symphony of the Night and the subsequent games go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

602
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,560
Tigerclaw says how long before the former Castlevania developer starts a Kickstarter

603
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:43,520
for Castlevania like game who knows probably not long well I mean there was that story out there

604
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,560
about that he would be happy to go work on a Metroid game and I think I think somebody posted

605
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:53,940
that to my wall on Facebook and I responded with that picture of the cat that's all over

606
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,160
tumblr that has that look on its face it just has the caption heavy breathing because that's exactly

607
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:05,520
like yes yes how many times have I posted that on Facebook but I mean seriously like I would love

608
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:11,600
for him to go work on a Metroid game I mean the newer Castlevania games were kind of crap I don't

609
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,720
think he wasn't involved with the newer ones all right I don't think so because newer Castlevania

610
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,720
games weren't they kind of forced them to be Castlevania as it was yeah exactly originally

611
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,920
going to be a Castlevania game yeah so I mean I don't know like I don't know about how you

612
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,960
guys feel but I kind of think like Castlevania peaked a long time I tried to make Castlevania

613
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,720
several times with not quite Castlevania games you know with the Lords of Shadows and then there

614
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:38,920
was that one that was God and I can't remember the name now but it was you're fighting robots

615
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:47,800
and instead of blood it was oil or something and it it was nano breaker I think oh yes I do remember

616
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:55,040
you know what I remember that game when it was cyber bot it was nano break yes I remember them

617
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,400
yeah it was they were demoing that at e3 when you're a man I like cyber bots yeah I think I did it

618
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,520
for a classic game once already 3ds ones are awesome I don't know dark Tetsuya telling me

619
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,760
there is a beat mania slot machine I didn't know you said DDR yeah I did say DDR but I mean that's

620
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,000
still pretty cool although I'm sure they don't make it anymore cuz my money's dead would you

621
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,680
heard well that I think technically they're think technically they're still making you beat but

622
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,120
whatever hey the money lives on on on iPads don't you know huh cyber bots is Capcom's number one

623
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:32,040
game don't lie it's a quote it's a devil out quote from puzzle fighter that's oh that's right

624
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,720
that's old-school everyone here's like what cyber bots reaching into the archive for quotes there

625
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,520
all right he's not the only guy leaving lots of people are leaving different companies and for

626
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,560
pretty much the same reasons kind of move on and do their own thing another person that's actually

627
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:54,640
leaving Sony stig a moose and he's not working I guess at Sony Santa Monica he was kind of the

628
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:02,880
creative director of God war 3 and I get guests basically you know they canceled what his new

629
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:12,760
project and so you know he's basically left the company after being there for 11 years also along

630
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:24,960
with him at sucker punch was see here Jamie Grissom er and basically he left after working on

631
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:32,400
infamous second son but he's been there for quite a while as well a lot of these guys is kind of

632
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:38,160
moving on and doing their own thing going back India yes this has to be related to the layoff

633
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,720
news from a couple weeks ago what they laid off those people at Sony Santa Monica and this says

634
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:48,120
that his project got canceled so he left that that has to be tied together and this one I'm

635
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:54,760
kind of disappointed about but hopefully he's gonna be doing some great stuff on his own Tetsuya

636
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,360
Mizuguchi has departed Q entertainment and of course you may recognize that name from such

637
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:08,320
wonderful games including rez and rez like games like child of Eden basically saying that uh you

638
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:15,400
know I guess he's moving on to his own well I thought that there was news like about a year

639
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:21,560
ago that he was taking on another role anyway because I seem to remember morning the Mizuguchi

640
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,640
was gonna be making another game anytime soon before and I thought there was something I mean

641
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,400
I don't think the news was that he had left the company but that he was taking some type of like

642
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:34,600
other role within it so I mean and they're even kind of confused on that sucks though cuz I love

643
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,320
his work I guess there's like some anonymous sources they're saying that you know they're

644
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:41,600
kind of confused when he may have left that he's been keeping a secret that he's been gone and he

645
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:48,080
may have actually departed was it last year sometime so I don't know what the hell's Q

646
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:54,160
doing then that's interest no idea I haven't really seen anything developing so maybe there's

647
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,320
got they've got something in secret they're working on no big no where he would be pretty

648
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:04,120
awesome huh harmonics yeah I don't know in East meets West West kind of thing could be interesting

649
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:09,360
badass I kind of I think with like the visual styles that he's got with his games and stuff

650
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:15,040
that fit right in with you know was it uh their brand new shooter that they've got you know there

651
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,000
is a reality though that maybe he doesn't want to do video games anymore like the guy who did

652
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,800
Katamari Damacy right ended up making like kids rides yeah he came back and started making like

653
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,920
smaller video I mean he keeps coming back and making little videos here and there and he'll

654
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,480
come back hopefully we haven't seen the last of music and you caught a Mario fucking awesome

655
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,720
that's just that's a series that's been kind of quiet for a little while huh it's cuz he drove

656
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,960
it into the ground it's like hey it's a new game Oh psych it's just still the old levels again it's

657
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,320
another new ads kids old levels that it that is a series I'd like to see kind of come but that

658
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:52,040
that's something they could put on project Morpheus because that will make people sick

659
01:00:52,040 --> 01:01:03,240
whatsoever can you imagine Katamari Damacy in VR it would make for an interesting like survival

660
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:10,680
mode where you're running away from the giant Katamari Akuma JP with a clarification on now

661
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:16,720
where Tetsuya Mizuguchi is gone Akuma JP says he was going to teach in a university and Q is doing

662
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,480
social games so I mean this is really like a running theme is I mean maybe not so much the

663
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,960
Sony one but we're seeing that companies shifts toward social games is driving the old guard and

664
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:35,400
some of these these faces that really developed the classic games we love out well they're taking

665
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,920
the safe route because it's it's a you know social gaming is where they're making a lot of money so

666
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,800
you can't fault them for wanting to you know keep their company profitable but at the same time it's

667
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,400
like yeah it does kind of suck that these guys are going but you know if the you know these

668
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:56,800
creative guys that are you know known for these fantastic games they're not necessarily needed

669
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,640
for a lot of these social games anymore because I mean you don't have to be too entirely creative

670
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,600
to come up with something that's gonna sell okay on you know mobile devices I could see them you

671
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,400
know going on to form their own you know spinning off to form their own companies and a lot of these

672
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,880
guys do that and you see a lot of stuff being kick-started or you know that's why there's a

673
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:21,140
whole indie resurgence again so I I don't know it's I'm hopeful that he'll make something cool

674
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:27,000
lots of very passionate comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com game guru says

675
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,600
it is kind of sad that both Capcom and Konami are both essentially going to disappear for the mobile

676
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:37,080
market Jason with a little bit of a rant here saying people make social games with the same

677
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:41,680
boring-ass formula if there's one thing Nintendo got right it's the incredibly light use of

678
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:47,320
effective social elements Nintendo Network Super Mario 3d world low Nintendo is doing

679
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:54,120
non real-time social better than anyone else hmm dark Tetsuya supports that comment that she actually

680
01:02:54,120 --> 01:03:03,800
do agree I don't know I do and I don't like I I don't I don't know like I do still enjoy those

681
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:10,080
elements that Nintendo puts in their games but yet I still yearn for like Nintendo to really push

682
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:16,640
that envelope further with online like where is my true online experience I don't even think like

683
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,560
the stuff that they have implemented in some of these games and you know with the whole you know

684
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:24,560
hey I could leave a comment here in this part of the game stuff that they do on the Wii U I don't

685
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:30,040
think that's if you didn't have that like you'd really miss it I would think I just think it's

686
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:34,600
kind of like oh that's gonna neat but it doesn't really add that much it doesn't say like wow I

687
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,220
need to get this version of the game because it has this feature in it that's never crossing

688
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,920
anyone's mind it just kind of something that I do that's like see you look hey we have internet

689
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:49,360
we understand social media we're hip we're cool you know I think the coolest thing that Mario

690
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:55,640
does is when it gets the ghosts in the levels that came from you know other people running it

691
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,920
that I think I think that's the coolest use of the social media and that's the kind of stuff

692
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,520
I would like to see like more of I think that's that's really cool that's not even social media

693
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,840
that's like shit they were doing from the DS like where you would you know get ghost data from

694
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:14,200
people and stuff I just don't it's not that new it's cool I like that they have that but it's I

695
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:19,600
wouldn't even go as far as saying it's like social media it's just you're sharing ghost data I mean

696
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:26,520
let's let let's not overly complicate things all right let's move on with some more news and that

697
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:31,120
has to do with the Xbox one which we haven't talked a whole lot about tonight but I know a

698
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:35,000
lot of people have been picking up Xbox ones because like there was a big sale this week on

699
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,320
that new Titanfall bundle right like I think Walmart marked it on 50 bucks and then Best Buy

700
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:45,000
was price matching it so a lot of people picking up an Xbox one right now and a lot more people

701
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:51,440
gonna be picking them up in September because the Xbox one will come to 26 more markets in September

702
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:59,400
eight of those were part of the original launch lineup that includes places like Denmark Russia

703
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,880
Sweden Switzerland they were cut from the original launch plans but now they will be launching there

704
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:10,600
in September one of the other big places of note where the game will be launching in September will

705
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:17,960
be Japan so finally Japan gets its Xbox one but the question is who cares will they care yeah

706
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:23,440
Akuma do you think other people will care it's all about the games right well it could I mean

707
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:29,440
let's see what happens at e3 because you know if you think about it okay if the system is coming

708
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,120
out in Japan in September this is the opportunity this e3 for Microsoft to get up on stage and say

709
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:41,160
hey XYZ Japanese developer who has been secretly working on an Xbox one exclusive this whole time

710
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,760
such as they weren't getting those some good support for the Xbox before for a lot of the

711
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,360
shooters so I wonder if that would be enough to you know if they start getting more local development

712
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:57,640
for like just those bullet hell games would that get people to buy to hell more RPGs I have a

713
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:05,360
tinfoil hat theory Akuma JP says don't care I have a tinfoil hat yeah well what's missed Walker

714
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:11,360
doing right now because we know remember they were big stuck in the bathroom with explosive diarrhea

715
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,920
no but they remember they they were a big start of the push for exclusives on the Xbox 360 when

716
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:24,240
they have Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey which you know but the problem is again Lost Odyssey wasn't

717
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,520
exactly a huge sales behemoth which is criminal because that game is fucking amazing I thought

718
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:34,960
that Blue Dragon was really fun and on the Wii I know they did last story was on the Wii right

719
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,960
and I know they've done some DS games in between there but what are what's like their big project

720
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:45,040
they're doing right now hmm I don't see them working on something for the Wii U maybe maybe

721
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:51,480
maybe I don't know maybe yet did the last story sell better than Lost Odyssey did now miss Walker

722
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,680
didn't do Dragon Quest right there were no no that's I get confused because it's the same art

723
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:05,400
square enix well yeah but I mean think of the out source development no and well we never got

724
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,920
the Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest X is the MMO we never got that anyway which is weird I don't

725
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,920
think that would do that well over here I it's just it's one of those things is you know they

726
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:19,360
don't have a lot of people that have just you know you're cornering the Wii U market then you

727
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,560
have you know people that are gonna play an MMO on this thing it's just I don't know that it's

728
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:31,320
too risky to bring it over here Akuma JP says missed Walker is in social games too that's a

729
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:37,800
sad laugh um Akuma JP also says yeah like like Dart Sakura had quoted earlier they don't care

730
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:43,800
people who want to play Titanfall will buy that's kind of what's happening over here like five

731
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:49,560
people well I don't know I think it's more magic well me actually in Japan probably not a lot but

732
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:54,720
I should have to say after seeing Titanfall in action yeah III think it would be it would

733
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:00,520
actually be a decent selling factor it actually is pretty good yeah on Xbox I mean I mean not

734
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,680
Xbox but I saw the PC one yeah and it was it was pretty good but see that's the thing it's like if

735
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:09,760
they really want to play Titanfall I think they just pick it up on PC why wait you know almost

736
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:18,480
six months yeah all right um let's anyway lots and lots of regions that the Xbox will be coming to

737
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:27,520
other big places Argentina India Israel Korea Saudi Arabia Singapore South Africa those are

738
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,720
just some of the countries a lot lots and lots of places getting the Xbox one a little later this

739
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:38,480
year so please look forward to it to register participation for this week's episode of Orange

740
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,600
Laundry radio at vog network comm use the passphrase belt well how about something that has

741
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:50,040
nothing to do with actual gaming systems but does affect gaming systems let's hear it well Netflix

742
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,920
we've been talking about the whole deal with the net neutrality popping up and since the the ruling

743
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,680
past and just on top of that there were the other situations where we're seeing Netflix making deals

744
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:08,080
with Comcast and you know other companies trying to get a bandwidth deals well now Netflix is sort

745
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:19,200
of turning it over and their CEO Reed Hastings put on a blog post this past Thursday that that

746
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:26,280
uh basically they're just he's just completely they said that the original definition of net

747
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:34,800
neutrality isn't fitting and it needs to be changed to to basically describe better the

748
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:40,400
activities around customer activities and what's going to you know demand what's going to use more

749
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,560
services can use less this quote says without strong net neutrality companies like Comcast can

750
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,720
make these demands driving up cost and prices for everyone else which is basically what we've been

751
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:57,600
saying anyway yet they've gone and make that deal so is this you know a case of a little hypocrisy

752
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:03,840
or is it that this is something that was already in the works is it I just don't understand why

753
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,240
they would just switch over like that but it I mean but it's a correct statement we know we see

754
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:17,000
it's happening already and there's also a Comcast executive though who was saying that the Netflix

755
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,600
CEO was wrong this is the open internet rules never were designed to deal with peering and

756
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,920
internet connection providers like Netflix have always paid for their connection so we've got a

757
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,320
little bit of an argument here well obviously there's concern about net neutrality because

758
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:38,880
it's in some ways it's kind of a ticking time bomb when it comes to gaming specifically because you

759
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:44,960
know we don't know what might happen where you know I think what's ultimately gonna happen is

760
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:49,680
that you're gonna see that these these providers start to put their data caps out there and they

761
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,920
have the different plans and they're gonna try to sell these cheaper plans that are very stringent

762
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:00,280
on the data caps but yet there will be certain services that will not count towards the data cap

763
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,440
which I think already happens with Comcast and they're like Xfinity movies and things like that

764
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:08,360
I don't think count towards whatever I don't even know if they're enforcing data caps right now but

765
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:15,240
you know they had that thing I and but it's just a matter of time before we see will Xbox live count

766
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:21,320
towards that will PlayStation Network count towards that will something like on live or

767
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:27,120
one of those streaming gaming solutions will they try to be the ones that you know I get the free

768
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:33,160
pass on the bandwidth I don't know but I I just don't think like Comcast can be so bold as to

769
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:38,000
start telling these tiered internet things because it's gonna be a huge revolt it's not like customers

770
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:43,600
don't have the choice to go other places yes they may have not have other cable providers in your

771
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:49,160
area but shit I know people that would go back to DSL rather than put up with this tiered internet

772
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:54,280
bullshit well also I'd like to read what the pagans you just said and the theory behind the deal is

773
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,520
good marketing because of the upcoming merger they want sure they can play nice at least that's what

774
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:08,160
I heard on NPR and why did Alan say but when doesn't he say but he doesn't want the internet

775
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:16,720
to regulate the pictures of butts going on out there I think is the problem but anyway yeah I

776
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:23,600
think I think that's a good theory that Comcast is making nice nice with Netflix because that could

777
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,640
have been a thorn in their side with the merger coming up and you know they're gonna have to

778
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:37,080
show that it's not antitrust basically that they control too much so anyway also hmm I agree with

779
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:44,080
butts who doesn't agree with butts all right well coming soon to a gaming store near you let's see

780
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:52,040
if there's some video games that may feature butts Loki anything in the u.s. sorry no butts this time

781
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:59,080
cut the rope triple treat coming out on 3ds the witch in the hundred night on PlayStation 3

782
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:06,760
although the alternate artwork for that does feature I think her but Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls

783
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:14,920
I think there's a butter to in that on PC Dynasty Warriors 8 extreme legends on PlayStation 3 and

784
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:22,280
extreme legends complete edition on PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 deception for blood ties

785
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:31,960
on PlayStation 3 and on the Vita Cabela's big-game hunt her pro hunts on ps3 Xbox 360 and Wii U and

786
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:41,360
that is Alan alchemy by the way in our chat room clarifying his comment saying I said butts because

787
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:46,960
Comcast which actually is a perfectly valid explanation now that you say that Jamie do

788
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:52,440
you accept that explanation that's all the time well that's a game because before the show I said

789
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:57,520
that you liked big butts and you cannot lie you other brothers can't deny all right going to Japan

790
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,760
and talking about some of the releases over there hey on the PlayStation 3 biohazard 6 premium

828
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,040
realness which you all should check out if you haven't been listening to it it's a really fun

829
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,120
show but they've been talking a lot about smite it's it's kind of like a League of Legends style

830
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,120
game I know it does like more like you can do like first-person points of view or not not for

831
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,840
but like more like World of Warcraft looking because you know how League of Legends is kind

832
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,840
of like a like a top-down sort of thing but like I guess smites a little more like World of

833
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,760
Warcraft leading so I it's kind of one of those style games I would also like to point out for

834
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,520
people next month that goat simulator comes out next month and everyone needs this game I'm going

835
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,920
to be getting goat simulator the heat Loki's been talking sorry I'm great give it up for the goats

836
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,880
that it that is when I a I convinced my sister she doesn't even have steam or anything I'm like

837
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:36,560
dude you need to get that's coming out next and you know in two weeks and she's like okay well

838
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:44,640
we need to hook up Sean's computer and you know give it up for the goat see it looks great but

839
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:50,520
here's the best here's the but what here's the best part but yes the best part about goat

840
01:18:50,520 --> 01:19:00,840
simulator besides the fact goat emulator beside the fact that it looks crazy is steam they're

841
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:06,240
gonna have the whole steam or workshop support so you're gonna be able to make your own shit

842
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,320
if you really want to I don't know if it would probably get voted off there because it's

843
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:16,200
inappropriate you could make your own goat say yeah I have this weird feeling that goat simulators

844
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:22,160
like the new minecraft like wait like I kind of think I it just I don't call it a hunch kind of

845
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:26,840
think goat simulators the new minecraft reginator says what about goat simulator to goat stimulator

846
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:34,680
oh I saw there like sirs you are a damn pervy I've been in the corner I've been following the

847
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,960
guys that you know they make the game and just like just basically trolling everywhere to try

848
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:44,200
to find you know some sort of new footage of the game and the best I could do with someone posted

849
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:49,800
a vine video that they had of playing goat simulator at GDC that cliffy B had that I don't

850
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,880
remember but it was something yeah where he had the tongue stuck to the back of the car and he

851
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:59,360
was being drunk around in circles like oh god I need this game now it's so amazing it does look

852
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,400
like a game that you you would have made it really did it's like you love you guys you guys know

853
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:08,920
Loki loves his sandbox games come on grand theft auto 5 he never shuts up about it Saints Row 4

854
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:14,500
he never shuts up about it he loves the sandbox game what is goat simulator it's just I just

855
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:22,280
stewed in parts with goats and it's not ridiculous over the top which is the other but I see you

856
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:25,960
know I would get this too because you know what my one of my favorite animals and all the entire

857
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:32,000
universe is goats because I love their eyes and goats are the best they're the most adorable

858
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,840
things ever and like the goats that are at fairy tale land here in Sacramento for when I have to

859
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,640
go with Becky and she takes Julian and I just hang out with goats say you love the goats say you do

860
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:50,960
I love cats yeah okay how's that you happy you ever have to do a new intro you know what you

861
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:57,400
guys can bite me and you're gonna say that you guys are awful okay here I am trying to support

862
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:06,080
independent gaming and you guys are being you know what that indie game yeah I know plenty of what's

863
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:12,360
pick that indie game is probably the first one in a long time where all three of us said pre-ordered

864
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:26,160
I don't know I think the game is pretty mad I like big goats and I cannot lie oh come on were

865
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:35,880
you raised in a barn no all right um that's it for the UK dates yes I'm seriously hoping that

866
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:41,160
they put goat boy in that that game somehow all right Loki why don't you reach on in and pull

867
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:51,280
out another story for us okay so um there was I guess Siliconera had asked Nintendo about you

868
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:57,200
know unity coming possibly to the 3ds because you know it's supported on the Wii U and hell that's

869
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:01,800
how a lot of those you know indie games are on the Wii U's because people are building them in

870
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:09,240
unity and porting them over using the unity export stuff and of course the generic answer that they

871
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:14,840
got I don't even know this is exactly news is we're definitely looking at it so there you go

872
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:22,480
they're definitely looking at something so I'm definitely looking at it yeah my eyes are in that

873
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:33,440
general direction what you're you have you already forgotten about the goats have not but I I heard

874
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,600
aren't they aren't there supposed to be like 50 games or something using this that are coming to

875
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,320
we use soon I thought there's a lot of games that are using it I'm not sure on the exact number but

876
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:47,320
I can imagine like 50 games that sounds about right makes everybody I mean a lot of people are

877
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:52,840
using unity especially because the Wii U doesn't really support a ton of different engines that

878
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:59,560
you know can be multi-platform so I can see it's one of the few that you know people are developing

879
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:04,120
games for that's easy to port to other systems how they added support for the Vita and you know

880
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:12,440
PlayStation 3 for it supports most of the consoles out there right now all right well as SSG 100 Matt

881
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:18,440
in our chat room says moving on to the next topic well apparently your boyfriend thinks we need Jesus

882
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:26,640
why don't you tell him a thing or two let me tell you a thing all right moving on let me tell you

883
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:32,320
about Unreal Engine 4 Unreal Engine 4 this is some other big news that came out of game developers

884
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:37,840
conference Unreal Engine 4 is gonna be out it's it's gonna be basically available to plenty more

885
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:43,320
people it's it's open to the public essentially for the low low cost of $19 a month but there is

886
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:48,960
a catch if you are going to profit off the game it will involve a royalty agreement asking for

887
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:54,880
5% in gross sales so you know but I mean you can do a lot with Unreal Engine so it might be worth

888
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,840
it to some people so yeah Unreal Engine 4 is gonna be available to the public it's a subscription

889
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:03,800
based service there this is the same thing that triple-a game developers have been using for lots

890
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,200
and lots of money but yeah it's big big news coming out of game developers conference direct

891
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:13,440
out of direct out of the mouth of Tim Sweeney who is the epic games founder so this is great because

892
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:20,220
you know assuming that developers are willing to take the you know 5% agreement a lot of indie

893
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:25,920
games can really focus on you know making that game and you know the engine will do a lot of

894
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:32,120
hopefully the legwork for them we see a lot a lot of games out there that use Unreal Engine 3 as it

895
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:38,360
is you know things like forget doesn't Final Fantasy 13 run on Unreal some of it like like

896
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:42,200
there's a lot of weird games out there you wouldn't think run on this engine that do I know the last

897
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,920
remnant ran on yeah real yeah there's just a lot of games out there that run on it like the Mortal

898
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:54,800
Kombat games do right pretty sure they do so you know this could be a great thing for Loki this

899
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,000
sounds like the type of thing where you might be raising an eyebrow going is this another thing I

900
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,560
should play with no I don't want to learn something else you don't want to learn something else ones

901
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:10,480
enough for you yeah maybe later fair enough all right well before we get to our break here we're

902
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:16,680
gonna go back to a classic time in gaming it's a classic time when there was no engine there was no

903
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:22,200
do-it-yourself you end up you want to make a video game you learned assembly language we've

904
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:26,920
bought a very expensive you had you had a Texas Instruments computer and programmed a little

905
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,960
bleeping ball that's right dark soccer is gonna take us to the classic game of the week archive

906
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:38,080
dark soccer what is a video game that you think the kids out there should be playing this week

907
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,960
speaking of things that come on he's fucking run into the ground nothing is as great as the

908
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:49,040
original Frogger what a what a timely choice unintentionally and I will tell you about Frogger

909
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,960
and my history with this game before I go further into it and to be clear this is the original

910
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:03,920
arcade game not the pot not the shit not the dumps that Konami took on the franchise so anyway I

911
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:14,520
imagine me around eight years old on roller skates playing Frogger it's damn hard to play Frogger on

912
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:18,800
roller skates it's hard to play almost any arcade game on roller skates and I did play a stand-up

913
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:25,680
pole position on roller skates as well I played the exact same Frogger machine at Babalu skating

914
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:33,040
rink in Dothan Alabama every summer for probably the next 11 years after that so and it still

915
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:38,400
worked it had some burnin it was old but damn machine still worked and now it's gone and I

916
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:44,320
mourn that particular Frogger but that was my Frogger anyway Frogger is a game we play as a

917
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:51,200
stupid frog and you were trying to get across the street and then across the pond into your little

918
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:56,200
froggy hole and sometimes crocodiles might try to eat you which I've never seen a crocodile eat a

919
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:02,960
frog but I have seen it grab a man by its leg this happened for now I've seen this having him

920
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:11,400
because I'm from the swamp anyway a Frogger came out in 1981 it was developed by Konami and licensed

921
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:18,200
by Sega and Gremlin at the time so basically you just have to navigate traffic you know keep from

922
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:24,320
getting run over by the damn front by the trucks and apparently a Formula One cars go on the street

923
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:33,880
in whatever town this is and all kinds of things it is you know one of the very classics of games

924
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:42,800
it also was one of the first games that used more than one CPU is choose 80 processors it is

925
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:51,920
basically still super popular and shush don't judge me for saying froggy hole okay I'm not the

926
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,600
one having an obsession with froggy don't get distracted by chat especially when they're being

927
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:05,560
perverts up so anyway by 2005 Frogger sold more than 20 million copies worldwide including 5

928
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:12,760
million in the u.s. so yeah you use a joystick you you know have to navigate the froggy around you can

929
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:18,680
send them up and the different types of vehicles that you can be smushed flat by our cars trucks

930
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:27,320
buses dune buggies bulldozers vans taxis bicyclists motors and or motorcycles that will just cut

931
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:32,520
through traffic and then in the next half you have crocodiles and turtles the turtles can sink

932
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,160
into the ground the crocodiles can eat you but you can land on their backs you can ride their ass the

933
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:44,320
entire way if you want and then you land in your frog home sorry not frog hole and the levels are

934
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:49,800
timed so different things will kill you make turning you into a little skull and crossbones

935
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:58,400
which the last time I saw a frog a frog skull it was when I was cutting into it when I was in ninth

936
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:06,960
grade in biology class so at any rate you could be hit by a car you could jump into the water run

937
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:14,280
into snakes otters or into crocodiles jaws you can jump into a home invaded by a crocodile you

938
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:19,080
can stay on a diving turtle that is submerged to ride a log crocodile turtle off the screen

939
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:25,800
jump onto a log a home already occupied by a frog jump into the side of a home or in the bush and

940
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:32,880
running out of time before getting your froggy home as far as other versions there have been

941
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:39,360
many others there have been clones as people in chat room are mentioning right now Sierra had the

942
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:46,080
magnetic media rights as far as cartridge versions Parker medic media as in discs Oh

943
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:55,680
okay Parker brothers licensed it from Sega for cartridges we've seen copies on the TRS 80 the

944
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:02,240
Sinclair 1000 and Sinclair 2068 sorry it has just clicked for me after all these years why

945
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:07,640
Frogger two three deep which was the one I loved on Commodore 64 was only ever on cartridge because

946
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:13,960
it was a Parker brothers game I just had an aha moment Thank You dark soccer I feel welcome

947
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:20,960
lightened we had Atari 2600 versions the multiple releases and there was a cassette for the

948
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:27,040
supercharger and Tommy there was a Tomy Tudor version that was also licensed from Konami

949
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:33,000
themselves but not it's not clear if it's been developed by Konami Parker brothers also did the

950
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:39,000
releases for 2600 and television Atari 5200 which I have the clique of vision which I have

951
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:46,040
Atari 8-bit computers the vic-20 and Commodore 64 as you mentioned Rob Sierra had the Commodore

952
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:52,520
64 disk versions which is why there were two versions on the Commodore 64 and there's Apple

953
01:30:52,520 --> 01:31:00,400
to those the original 128 came Macintosh the IBM PC the Atari 2600 supercharger and then the versions

954
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:08,680
for the TRS 80 color computer and Sinclair did had a version developed by corn soft in the UK

955
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:16,400
about 10 million was spent on advertising for Frogger and it was advertised along with the

956
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:23,360
Empire Strikes Back there's your Star Wars thing Coleco also had a mini arcade tabletop version

957
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:29,760
that was released also along with Pac-Man Galaxian and Donkey Kong I have one of those taken apart

958
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:38,120
awesome now there were clones of it including froggy for the ZX spectrum hopper by anchor

959
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:45,080
anchor and soft for the BBC micro and the acorn electron there was another Frogger for the BBC

960
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:51,800
micro ZX spectrum there was Frogger for sharp MZ 700 in the UK and a version of done for the new

961
01:31:51,800 --> 01:32:00,800
brand by the name of elite the Atari 2600 also had a game named freeway that its working title

962
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:07,720
was bloody human freeway awesome so I mean like I said there's just been like a bunch of different

963
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:14,840
versions I mean we have them by Hasbro we have them you know rereleases for PlayStation we have

964
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:21,120
there was a prototype based off a Frogger for the Sega Game Gear that was never released but

965
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:27,120
apparently I think there are leaks of the ROM set out there was a Porta Frogger for Xbox Live

966
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:34,760
Arcade and that was developed by Digital Eclipse and published by Konami so then you were right

967
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:40,760
the sequel to Frogger was Frogger 2 3 deep in 1984 there was another Frogger in 1997 Frogger

968
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:45,480
2 swap is revenge in 2000 and then a bunch of shit that Konami took on the franchise well

969
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:52,080
well that first Konami won the Frogger in 97 that was a huge game that was a huge that was on the

970
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:56,800
original PlayStation that was a huge game it was very different you know because it had the larger

971
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:03,560
kind of worlds you know that game I thought was incredibly boring I I owned it actually I didn't

972
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:09,280
I didn't mind it I thought it was cool well how about some pop culture references this time Frogger

973
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:18,600
had an animated series as part of the Saturday Supercade the CBS did it was included with it

974
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,680
was Frogger pitfall Harry and then their segments were replaced by kangaroo and space ace and there

975
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:31,800
was a segment on remember that show VR troopers they were beating a frog monster called amphibidor

976
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:37,720
based off of Frogger and it's been mentioned in that horrid horde show Seinfeld which I still

977
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:46,240
do not like to show MTV movie that was a really funny episode though okay well basically there

978
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:51,880
was a reference to a bunch of different early games in that one and Frogger was in wreck-it Ralph

979
01:33:51,880 --> 01:34:00,160
hanging around a game central station and in 1982 and that's why I'm saying stay tuned to the very

980
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:06,240
end of the show tonight Buckner and Garcia did a song called froggies lament that was on the

981
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:12,040
Pac-Man fever soundtrack and as I recall for single wasn't it the b-side I don't know bad

982
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:19,360
religion did a song called Frogger where he says that Los Angeles is trying to play Frogger with

983
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:30,720
his life yeah there's basically quite a number of different references but the best of them ever in

984
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:37,080
2006 there's a group in Austin Texas that modified a Roomba dressed as a Frogger to do a real-life

985
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:43,400
version of the game that used a bitch a Bluetooth controller the Roomba was able to get across the

986
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:49,600
street 10 times 40 lanes and survived for 15 minutes before it was quote killed by an SUV a

987
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:57,440
game over you know and actually Frogger has been a nickname for disease as well I don't know if I

988
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:07,000
was it was a name given to the jumping gene for a particular family fruit fly okay then there you

989
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,480
go is that it there's all the highest by the way the highest Frogger score by Michael Smith

990
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:17,640
of Springfield Virginia and the world record was nine hundred and seventy thousand four hundred and

991
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:25,120
forty points and he beat Pat Lafayette on December 26 on 2099 and I'm guessing that's a some sort of

992
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:31,720
yeah it's a Twin Galaxies thing so whatever all right what evs there Frogger there it is your

993
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:38,520
konami shit there it is your classic game of the week Frogger which really is a real real classic

994
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:43,400
if you think about it yeah I mean all those references alone no Frogger will ever be as

995
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:50,280
awesome as me on my roller skates as a seven-year-old playing at Babalu skating rink in Dothan Alabama

996
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:59,640
well fair enough all right here then Rob uh-huh it was long and bored straight my hair when I

997
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:07,080
was seven went to my ass you will never see it be that long ever all right we're gonna take a break

998
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,920
Jamie's doctor I'm just looking at the related videos by the way to the Frogger video and

999
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:16,080
somebody recreated it of course in Grand Theft Auto Frogger of course they did that's hilarious

1000
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,920
that seems like the type of thing Loki would have done all right we're gonna take a break guys when

1001

1026
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:51,000
one hour and it was for her own good and safety we didn't want her to run away hey not that she

1027
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:54,800
would ever go outside but she would just she would have freaked out more outside all right

1028
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,080
unfortunately this is not a podcast dedicated to cats although I don't know maybe I should

1029
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:04,800
start a fourth podcast about cats but I could totally do a podcast about cats I'm gonna just

1030
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:10,720
gonna call it old cat lady it'd be fun you never know I'm surprised they don't they probably do

1033
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,800
talk about what's going on in games real quick Loki so looking forward to playing Titanfall

1034
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,680
and 360 was supposed to be coming out this week but then at the last minute they're like hey it's

1035
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:38,160
not ready and so it's now coming out on April 8th in North America and April 11th in Europe

1036
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:44,280
and they said no we'll we see a few things that can be made even better and so we're giving

1037
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:51,160
blue point a little bit more time to deliver an epic Titanfall experience for the 360 according

1038
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:59,920
to the press release more like it's not done yet and that they they're working on epic day

1039
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:07,880
one patch but you know that's neither here and there but yeah hopefully it's an awesome game

1040
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:15,680
PlayStation 4 they announced that they're also offering in these some new development tools

1041
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:21,840
to help with publishing games on their console including with that you know the ability to export

1042
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:30,160
to PlayStation 4 on game maker studio as well as mono game which is I guess free to license

1043
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:36,080
Sony computer entertainment developers and also of course you know unity does support PlayStation

1044
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:44,280
3 and PlayStation 4 and I guess our PlayStation 3 and Vita and the PlayStation 4 version of the

1045
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:52,240
export is coming for I guess some early access people in April and so that would be pretty cool

1046
01:40:52,240 --> 01:40:59,360
also they're authoring tools framework I guess this free open source available to download and

1047
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:04,000
they use that you know in their first party games like you know last of us and beyond two souls and

1048
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:14,760
that kind of stuff so pretty cool and then also they're going to be doing some more updates to the

1049
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:21,240
PlayStation 4 firmware that's gonna allow you to do some game capture without HDCP restrictions

1050
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:28,000
because right now you're kind of limited how you can capture on you know the PlayStation 4 but with

1051
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,640
that you're gonna be able to I guess you know export clips and that kind of stuff you know you

1052
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:41,840
can record and share longer clips of gameplay sessions and you know beyond I don't know if you

1053
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:48,440
can yeah upping the resolution on ustream and twitch streams to 720p which is gonna be coming

1054
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:52,800
in a later update so that's kind of cool that they're doing that and also the ability to save

1055
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:59,040
videos and screenshots to a USB Drive so you know you want to edit them off your PlayStation 4 you

1056
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:06,120
can do that as well instead of having to just export and stuff that's awesome all right well

1057
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:11,400
moving on to some other news disregarding Mega Man Legends 3 you know it broke many hearts that

1058
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:17,960
this game did not end up happening including the Mega Man creator KJ Inafune still wants Mega Man

1059
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:23,400
Legends 3 to happen he said recently that if somebody asked even right now what's the game

1060
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:28,520
you want to create most it's still Legends 3 I put so much effort into that game so much passion

1061
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:34,040
into that game but it didn't happen it's always a regret in my mind even now we all know that it's

1062
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:38,840
not gonna happen though as long as Capcom holds the IP but if they asked me to make the game I

1063
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:45,040
could still gather most of the original team even right now so hey I'd be happy to see a mighty

1064
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:53,400
number 9 legends if you know what I mean that by the way in comments to a US gamer moving on I

1065
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:59,160
mentioned during the Japanese release dates that a new Nintendo Wii U was coming well it's just a

1066
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:02,920
different type of bundle here what's happening is that the Wii U premium pack in Japan is being

1067
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:09,880
replaced with a Wii Sports Club bundle hmm so yes a Wii Sports Club bundle is going on sale in Japan

1068
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:17,280
starting on March 27th it will be a 32 gig Wii U premium console with a gamepad and then we use

1069
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:22,680
our excuse me Wii Sports Club passes for events like bowling golf and tennis from Wii U Sports

1070
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:27,360
Club because remember we use sports clubs that whole weird like free-to-play thing where you can

1071
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:33,200
like demo it for 24 hours or you can buy one game or you can buy yeah so it comes with passes for

1072
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:38,520
some of the games there and of course a Wiimote controller and a wrist strap all for the low low

1073
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:44,640
price of 30,000 yen as you say they include a Wii remote with that that's just bullshit I know of

1074
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:50,000
course there's a there's a Wii remote there so you can actually play the game and lastly also about

1075
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:59,240
Nintendo a trademark for QOL in Japan for a number of products QOL quality of life and the trademarks

1076
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:03,480
are covering things including portable gaming devices standalone gaming devices merchandise

1077
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:10,000
beauty products so very interesting nobody knows though what exactly this could be about although

1078
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,280
some people think it could be some type of new fitness initiative well yeah I remember they were

1079
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:18,840
talking about that they wanted to kind of go in that direction in which I still don't I mean I

1080
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:27,840
cool but once again I don't think this is gonna I don't know where they're going well I ranted a

1081
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,160
few weeks ago about how Nintendo should have had the Fitbit craze and they lost it and maybe this

1082
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:37,640
is their chance to try and still capture that although I kind of thought we you or we fit you

1083
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:41,400
was supposed to kind of have that whole thing in it so I don't know what else they're enhancing to

1084
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:49,080
the fitness thing but we'll see I just don't I don't get it right now I mean it to me this is

1085
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:55,520
almost like how I didn't get the Wii vitality sensor and I still don't get that and it's cool

1086
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:59,760
the app they want to you know do something where you can exercise and they can do all that sort of

1087
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,880
tracking stuff but the problem is there's already stuff out there that does that and probably does

1088
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:09,360
it better and just because it has my has a me in it doesn't mean I'm gonna fucking buy it or I'm

1089
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:15,640
gonna buy a system for it so I'm I just wait and see what they're gonna do with this we'll see

1090
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:23,080
dark soccer what do you have for us we have some stuff basically we've got going on and this is

1091
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:29,120
kind of sad but all of the DLC for guitar hero DJ hero and band hero is going to be going away

1092
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:38,320
as of March 31st so yeah I get it while the getting's good and guitar hero on iOS is going

1093
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:45,000
to be discounted through the end of the month on the App Store in other news we have a new

1094
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:55,160
character that has been revealed for ultra Street Fighter 4 and that's Decapra Decapra Decapra who's

1095
01:45:55,160 --> 01:46:01,360
one of bison's dolls or I should say Vega for the Japanese version she's the arch villain of the

1096
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:09,960
doll guard and she is a clone of Cammy also and this one was really sad and Dan and I actually

1097
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:14,560
talked about this because part of what put him in the hospital for congestive heart failure were

1098
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:23,160
energy drinks and a Norwegian team teen I'm sorry basically was part of a he was 14 year old kid

1099
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:30,880
named Henrik who was at his cafeteria school doing a Call of Duty land party that lasted 16

1100
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:36,800
hours he said this is the quote I was playing Call of Duty then everything went dark and I passed

1101
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:45,920
out he was sent to a hospital in Lillehammer who basically he was in a coma for several days his

1102
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:51,560
kidney started to fail other organs started to fail and it was because he had been drinking

1103
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:59,320
energy drinks the entire time the rest of the rest of his health had been pretty okay all up until

1104
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:07,400
that point but it was the combination of lack of sleep focused attention and just drinking

1105
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:12,560
consistent energy drinks for the period of 16 hours he drank four liters of energy drinks that's

1106
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:18,880
a little excessive that's even you wouldn't drink that much that's just stupid that is also 14 which

1107
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:24,280
goes along with you know stupid and that that's a good way to make your heart explode yeah but but

1108
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:31,160
and the reason I'm saying the soup is more like an ignorant thing you think the human brains under

1109
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:35,880
like 25 years old are not programmed to think about long-term effects they're programmed to

1110
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:41,800
think about immediate reward so that is I need to stay awake let me drink another I need to stay

1111
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:47,320
awake let me drink another and not putting any thought at all into what is this going to do to

1112
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:53,000
my kidneys take a break my liver can't process this much taurine when you're when you're playing

1113
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:57,280
games or you know doing anything like that take a break why do you think we take a break here at

1114
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:01,960
OLR instead of doing three hours because people's gotta pee take a little break to you know drink

1115
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:08,560
water and use the restroom and all that stuff so all right anyhow let us take a break on over to

1116
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:14,360
our Facebook and Google Plus communities because when you slam those words together you get FUGL

1117
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:21,240
Plus but we just call it FUGL for short in a segment we call the FUGL question of the week

1118
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:35,640
heading on over to our communities we're gonna get some responses to this question tonight we

1119
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:39,840
are sure that many of you have heard the news this week that Igarashi left Konami after many

1120
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,840
years of working on the Castlevania series so we thought we'd use this as an excuse to ask our

1121
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:48,400
audience about their thoughts on Castlevania the past and the present do you have a favorite game

1122
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,800
in the series do you still play the new games or could you never get into the series and why

1123
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:57,800
so we're gonna get people's thoughts on Castlevania tonight so let's start with over on

1124
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:02,480
Facebook wicked from the nerdgasm Network who says the Castlevania series is a very personal

1125
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:07,760
favorite of mine I originally cut my gaming teeth playing countless hours of Castlevania 2 just

1126
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:12,680
trying to decipher what the hell the villagers were telling me I never did beat the game until

1127
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:17,760
I was into my 20s though sorry guys I suddenly decided to get a case of the hiccups my favorite

1128
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,960
game in the series fluctuates a lot especially after all of my game challenges over the past 18

1129
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:26,640
months right now it's Aria of sorrow followed up by Symphony of the night sandwiched by dawn of

1130
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:31,800
sorrow in third I fell in love with the Metroidvania style of Symphony growing up and I feel the sorrow

1131
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:36,720
pair took the spirit of the game and ran with it I like the classic style side scrollers especially

1132
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:42,240
Rondo of blood and super Castlevania 4 but I never could get into the 3d ones sour taste to

1133
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:47,100
my mouth from Castlevania 64 I guess then I know a while back I think he went through and played

1134
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:51,740
like every single stinking Castlevania game because they they do these like little challenges

1135
01:49:51,740 --> 01:49:56,980
on their show where they play every game in a series it's pretty impressive let's see dark

1136
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:01,380
Tetsuya says favorite game in the series has got to be Symphony of the night games like that helped

1137
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:08,420
inspire my favorite indie title ever wink what could that be as for egos future well if he follows

1138
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:12,940
in the footsteps of KJ and ifune I'm very excited about the prospect of a similar game with his

1139
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:19,540
influence yeah I'm sure that's just a matter of time our pal Jeremy from Koopa Club says I love

1140
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:24,700
this series my faves are the original games the more action-oriented ones I like the Metroid style

1141
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:29,740
games as well but those don't appeal to me as much as say super Castlevania 4 does the first

1142
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:34,220
Lords of Shadow isn't all that bad but it's not really that great either I haven't played the

1143
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:38,260
other two games in the series and maybe I will someday but right now I have no desire to really

1144
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:44,940
reward Konami with any of my time oh snap I also don't see why anyone is sad that Ega left chances

1145
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:48,860
are he'd never have made another Castlevania game anyway given that they had him working on social

1146
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:54,620
games for the past few years and I'm adding into that and canceling them let him leave and make

1147
01:50:54,620 --> 01:51:00,420
something better I can agree with that Ian also from Koopa Club that's Koopa with a Q Club with

1148
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:07,060
the K another great podcast says I remember liking Castlevania 64 a bunch and really got into the DS

1149
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:11,740
games I'm not sad about him leaving either as that appears to be the trend that people are doing

1150
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:15,940
I'm hoping the Silent Hill masterminds follow suit and we will get kickstarters out the ass

1151
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:22,740
and vag for their respected games what do you think dark Sakura how about kickstarters out the ass and

1152
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:33,780
vag don't know no no no no no no no no no no no no no SSJ 100 Matt giving us our favorite kind of

1153
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:41,340
answer a haiku here we go are you ready for the haiku whipping vampires never get that's all you

1154
01:51:41,340 --> 01:51:48,540
already lost whipping vampire oh no I just kidding I can't count just kidding that whipping vampires

1155
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:56,700
that's for no way whipping vampires I made the same mistake it's yeah um fam whipping higher

1156
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:06,940
vampires vampires is two syllables Rob I'll let it slide whipping vampires never gets old except

1157
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:13,900
when it is Simon's quest that is a lie Simon's quest is one of my favorites don't spread lies

1158
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:22,060
on my show our friend Shane says Castlevania 3 only because it had a pirate named Grant

1159
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:27,460
de nasty cracks me up every time I read it was that a mistranslation thing or is that really

1160
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:34,620
was grant de nasty grant de nasty according to the website how many syllables calm vampire is two

1161
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:42,060
syllables but what about vampires that would use syllables will be two syllables thought I'd try

1162
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:51,220
unless you're from Texas or Alabama or somewhere vampires then it's got 50 all right and lastly

1163
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:56,980
nemesis 47 on Facebook nemesis 47 says Castlevania Symphony the night on the old PlayStation one

1164
01:52:56,980 --> 01:53:01,620
still to this day one of my favorite games in the series I still remember the time I beat it and got

1165
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:07,340
the good ending by exploring every nook and cranny in the castle remember getting that stinking

1166
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:11,300
upside-down castle the first time in one of the top 10 moments in gaming ever when you unlock

1167
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:16,780
that upside-down castle and you're like ah fuck no it's after you get through with with butthole

1168
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:24,660
shaft which is what I called him related to the acid badge Kickstarter no no no butthole shaft

1169
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:36,080
was yes the dark priest shaft I'm just talking about shaft shut your mouth um I still what I

1170
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:40,740
always wanted to do that was I was trying to find because you know there was the hidden track for

1171
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:47,500
Maria having been turned into or possessed by the succubus hmm but I never did find that in the

1172
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:54,900
Japanese one which Dan imported before he and I got together wow that's actually pretty impressive

1173
01:53:54,900 --> 01:54:02,140
yeah all right let's see going to Google Plus and reading some of the answers over there act

1174
01:54:02,140 --> 01:54:07,140
deaf says super Castlevania 4 is definitely my favorite in the series that was a good one I love

1175
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:11,580
that one on Super Nintendo and then there was Castlevania 5 on the Super Nintendo and I remember

1176
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:16,220
thinking at the time this game is ass and it wasn't until much later I learned about how it's

1177
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:23,140
because Castlevania 5 was it was um why can't the name slips me not symphony night but the one before

1178
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:29,500
it Rondo blood blood oh blood crammed into a Super Nintendo cartridge and it wasn't Castlevania 5

1179
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:34,580
it was actually listed as Dracula X Oh was it I thought they called it five here they it was

1180
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:39,460
Dracula I think it made might have like given it a subtitle is Super Castlevania 5 yeah cuz Super

1181
01:54:39,460 --> 01:54:48,180
Castlevania 4 was the redo of the first one but it wasn't really a redo sort of it was first style

1182
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:56,380
yeah but um but yeah Dracula X was in fact I've got the box and manual and everything but nothing

1183
01:54:56,380 --> 01:55:01,260
is as awesome as playing the damn game on the PC Engine because oh my god I remember you brought

1184
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:08,220
fucking epic you brought that over to our we listen to the beginning in gothic German with

1185
01:55:08,220 --> 01:55:13,900
the when the girl gets stabbed oh god that game is awesome and oh my god playing through the game

1186
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:19,780
is fucking Maria singing the entire time okay she gets a special attack wouldn't you get the the

1187
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:24,780
him where I think what Richard does is throw it at people or some shit like that she starts singing

1188
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:30,420
and her singing is so bad it kill things are you finished no that games fucking awesome alright

1189
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:35,940
lastly Jason over on Google Plus says I tried playing Lords of Shadow the first one and I

1190
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:40,380
wasn't pleased I made it through four distinct levels before giving up at the shadow of Colossus

1191
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:45,620
ripoff lol I love Castlevania I've always loved Castlevania I got a late start on the series and

1192
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:49,880
played Symphony of the Night before I even played the Nintendo and Super Nintendo versions but I

1193
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:54,500
enjoyed them all I enjoyed practically every 2d Castlevania and have fond memories of Castlevania

1194
01:55:54,500 --> 01:56:02,060
64 what but any more modern 3d Castlevania than that just hasn't attracted me that is some by the

1195
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:05,660
way I wasn't able to read them all tonight because we had a lot of long answers but please check out

1196
01:56:05,660 --> 01:56:10,540
all of our answers at our Facebook community facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and also

1197
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:16,900
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio for the other answers over there thanks to everybody

1198
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:23,020
that answered the question this week what a shit once and for all in chat what's that how many

1199
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:30,580
syllables vampire has oh no remember Castlevania judgment um don't know no I don't it never

1200
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:37,500
existed it never existed in my universe la la la la that was the beginning of the end you know what

1201
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:42,420
you know what you know what we need to just like just completely play through Rondo blood at my

1202
01:56:42,420 --> 01:56:50,380
house break out the the turbo duo get some Rondo on it would be nice if we finally got one of these

1203
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:54,460
gaming marathons I've been talking about doing for five years off the ground and they're right

1204
01:56:54,460 --> 01:57:01,060
all right let's move on we got more news to get to and your calls and emails pretty soon here but

1205
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:07,100
starting off with Loki so the oh yeah has done a lot of weird made a lot of weird decisions lately

1206
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:14,580
in making itself irrelevant but now they're doing I guess I want to call this almost like the final

1207
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:19,740
nail in the coffin but they're now dropping the free to try requirement for developers because you

1208
01:57:19,740 --> 01:57:25,220
may remember when the OUYA came out all the games around the OUYA had a free component to them so

1209
01:57:25,220 --> 01:57:29,260
you can at least try them out now that's not required so now basically it's the Android

1210
01:57:29,260 --> 01:57:36,420
marketplace on a really shitty console that now you can also play those games on other things

1211
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:43,180
including maybe soon PC so what's the point again tell me do you regret your decision to back that

1212
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:49,260
Kickstarter ah yes I do but at least I got to try the console out for a while and I mean I made

1213
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:56,860
most of my money back so hey ladies again extended rental it was a it was a rental it was a red box

1214
01:57:56,860 --> 01:58:01,380
but a silver box yeah it's like when I used to rent consoles and I got to try it too so it worked

1215
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:12,660
out yeah so I got to laugh at it but yeah I don't know why they would do that but whatever um also

1216
01:58:13,060 --> 01:58:20,220
apparently Disney interactive they are scaling back and that story was left over from last week

1217
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:26,460
oh I'm sorry how was my bad on the Cheryl tonight sorry fired I knew there'd be a mistake I knew we

1218
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:30,700
would come to the new studio and there'd be some damn mistake well this it was just that not worse

1219
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:37,860
the best part is we can edit that out we do it live here at all our fuck it we'll do it live

1220
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:42,180
well I just want to reiterate from last week that Disney interactive is making less games

1221
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:50,300
because you know what they made like what one game last year you know one console game Disney

1222
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:55,900
infinity oh I'm sorry two games there's planes to like everybody else social so social is huge

1223
01:58:55,900 --> 01:59:00,220
on social yeah and so you know what's gonna happen now there's not gonna be planes this year so fuck

1224
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:03,980
you people that like planes you're only getting get Disney infinity too if that ever comes out

1225
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:10,940
which it probably will because it made a lot of money all right anyway moving on to more recent

1226
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:18,900
news and things that are upcoming to the PlayStation 4 apparently pre-loading is supposed

1227
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:23,140
to be a thing that's coming to the PlayStation 4 I thought this was something that was already

1228
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:29,380
available on games but I guess not sucker punch which of course is the studio behind infamous

1229
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:34,980
second son said on Twitter that this is a feature that's coming later in the spring there was a

1230
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:39,940
tweet that said quote no preload until April this of course a response to all the people that wanted

1231
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:43,660
to play infamous second son which I know none of us were able to talk about during our gaming

1232
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:47,140
weeks none of us have played it I know my buddy Shane's been playing it a lot he really likes

1233
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:51,220
it a lot he says he said it reminds him of crackdown it looks like it looks good I need to

1234
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:56,420
try that I never really got into the other games but no no I it's making it sound really good so

1235
01:59:56,420 --> 02:00:00,780
I have to check that out but anyway yeah sucker punch said that in the tweet no preload until

1236
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:06,560
April so this could mean that future games will be something you can digitally download and then

1237
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:09,920
play on the launch day I don't know what big games are coming out in April I know there's

1238
02:00:09,920 --> 02:00:14,440
Final Fantasy 14 but that's a little different being an MMO so yeah I don't know I don't know

1239
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:20,480
but that'll be cool that people can download the games and then play them at midnight on the launch

1240
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:30,800
day as a lot of people will be doing with Diablo 3 this week I'm sure dark soccer so this is just

1241
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:39,040
I really had to bring this article up just because of something that Bioware Montreal's game designer

1242
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:46,280
Munvir Hare was bringing about he actually did a talk at game developers conference called

1243
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:53,200
misogyny racism and homophobia where do video games stand basically challenging this whole we

1244
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:59,560
only develop male characters because only guys or the majority of our market are guys he said

1245
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:06,040
and this is a from here that it's cynical to assume that an audience isn't capable of embracing

1246
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:13,680
a gay character in any way and that more exclusive female protagonists that aren't glorified sex

1247
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:18,640
objects and have personalities beyond supporting the men in the game that it's a good thing I mean

1248
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:26,600
basically is bringing up you know the female Shepherd who you know there's a yeah okay well

1249
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:32,400
is it 15% of the players had a female Shepherd but still you got a lot more I think attention

1250
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:39,560
with her in the third Mass Effect which was about the best thing about the game and I mean they're

1251
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:45,640
basically saying you know the people are arguing that women weren't soldiers in medieval times but

1252
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:52,600
there actually is plenty of historical evidence that women were would fight and that in other

1253
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:58,300
cultures outside of our typical Eurocentric video game you know focus that there were plenty of

1254
02:01:58,300 --> 02:02:04,440
female warriors in other cultures so it was really really good you know but the best thing that I

1255
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:08,720
think came out of this that he's quoted saying is let's not be scared to ruffle feathers and let's

1256
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:14,000
be open and honest about our intentions let's push and engage in a new discourse as a result

1257
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,920
of these dynamics and let's do all of this because we are current what we are currently doing is

1258
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:26,400
absolutely not working it's about damn time I'm trying to see if some of our chatters have some

1259
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:31,480
comments on this Seattle in our chat room says everybody loves Samus not counting other M hey

1260
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:36,520
you know there's some people that like other M as well you know well I think that it's it's I mean

1261
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:44,240
but but I mean he's right it's sad that it needs to be said it's not like females aren't accepted

1262
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:51,920
as huge big important video game characters like you have you know Samus like you have Lara Croft

1263
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:57,160
like you have I mean heck Princess Peach in a way you know is well I mean you know people were

1264
02:02:57,160 --> 02:03:01,840
excited to be able to play as her I know that might be a bit of a stretch but femshep and you

1265
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:06,760
know so on well and I'm not I'm not like saying it's perfect by any means but I'm just saying

1266
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:12,280
that like you know it's not like they can't there shouldn't be that fear to have the female lead

1267
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:17,320
because there's plenty of very successful ones well and it's not just the female lead it's having

1268
02:03:17,320 --> 02:03:30,400
other sexual not just sexualities but having a gender sexuality of race you know even religion

1269
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:35,920
I mean we finally have had a few Muslim characters pop up here and there we need more I think you

1270
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:42,160
know I'm gonna say Co C's characters of color you know we need more people and we need to actually

1271
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:49,560
have where I like being able to make have your character and make the choice but I like having

1272
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:55,480
other characters that interact with it also have you know not just oh we're gonna do whatever

1273
02:03:55,480 --> 02:03:59,480
because you're the main character but I'd like to see other characters that are strictly like like

1274
02:03:59,480 --> 02:04:05,640
I hate to go back to Mass Effect 3 on this one but how are you had trainer or you had Steve you

1275
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:11,760
know they were very firmly in their sexuality you know yet you had plenty of other characters

1276
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:18,160
who didn't matter you know but my point is is that it needs to be recognized that you have people

1277
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:23,800
coming from all sorts of walks and you know I really hate using the word preference because

1278
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:28,160
it's something that's you're born with something that's ingrained and preference to me denotes a

1279
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:35,840
choice you know so I've had a lot of people say identity yeah well but I look at identity

1280
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:43,400
as yourself and not necessarily what you know organs you like to play with if that makes sense

1281
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:51,960
well I like the church organ well you know what I hate organs so you'd like to play the piano

1282
02:04:52,960 --> 02:05:10,280
exactly anyway anyway now I'm a flautist cuz I flout it uh-huh but let's say they release I

1283
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:18,360
don't know Halo 5 with a gay master or you know gay master chief or whatever like good I mean

1284
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:22,520
this is what I would say no there's gonna be a lot of people out there that are gonna have

1285
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:26,960
something to say it's not that I don't I don't hear me wrong on this I mean I would love something

1286
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:31,720
like that but I also am a realist where there's a lot of people that would be like you know here

1287
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:36,320
would be my problem with Master Chief as in the character that has existed through these games

1288
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:43,560
there's a cannon established and I'm really fine with keeping a character cannon if say that there

1289
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:50,320
was a much future Halo game much you know later on in the future and it's a new Master Chief and

1290
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:57,280
he happened to light the cock fine I don't care that'd be great I don't really think people need

1291
02:05:57,280 --> 02:06:04,880
to be judged by you know what bits they like poking in their bits I don't think it should

1292
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:11,160
matter and it's no one's fucking business yeah it really is no one's fucking business and I hate the

1293
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:17,640
whole concept of closets and in and out of closets because who the fuck cares I don't care what parts

1294
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:22,640
people like to play with well unfortunately there's too many people out there that do in

1295
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:33,160
this people suck but my whole point is that I don't care if this X person has a wife or if she's got a

1296
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:37,680
girlfriend on the side or if it's a big open marriage and there's a bunch of fucking going

1297
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:42,040
on under what I don't give a shit don't give a shit and I would like to see more characters

1298
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:46,320
or stuff like that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what their sexuality is it doesn't matter

1299
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:52,240
who they fuck I'd like to see a whole lot of fucking going on to you would you for no but I

1300
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:56,560
think it doesn't matter it shouldn't matter it should matter what their skin color is what

1301
02:06:56,560 --> 02:07:02,920
matters is that yes this creates who this person is we respect that these are the things that make

1302
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:10,000
this person who they are but it should just be a oh okay that's cool that's who you are I don't

1303
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,960
need I don't care you know if you know what I mean not that it's not a doesn't matter kind of thing

1304
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:21,200
but that it's a that's who they are I respect it let's keep moving all right I'm going to some first

1305
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:26,840
a question from our chat room from our buddy Shana Lenko Jamie would you consider male Shep being

1306
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:32,720
straight cannon since until Mass Effect 3 he never was interested in men just women which would mean

1307
02:07:33,160 --> 02:07:39,400
they fundamentally changed me I to tell Jason I didn't say what bits with their bits I said what

1308
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:45,320
bits in their bits oh because some people like it in the ass and some people like it in the badge

1309
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:52,640
okay some people like it in other things I don't care because you all right but what about Shane's

1310
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:59,920
question god damn it would you consider male Shep being being straight cannon since until Mass

1311
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:03,960
Effect 3 he never was interested in men just women which would mean they fundamentally changed him

1312
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:11,520
that's kind of an interesting one because I think that they realized that it shouldn't have been a

1313
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:17,920
thing to begin with technically your Shep doesn't have to have sex at all or doesn't have to have

1314
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:23,280
your set you can have can be asexual I could totally have an asexual Shepherd except Garris

1315
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:29,200
but you know what I mean if you if Rex was available I'd totally go for that if you could

1316
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:33,480
resist Garris's temptations you could have a completely asexual Shepherd I tried once Rob I

1317
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:40,560
really did try and I tried to play a bro Shep so I could get Caden uh-huh and I couldn't play him

1318
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:48,280
because no all right going to s to 100 Matt because I like this day I like what see I'll just said

1319
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:53,600
put my bits in your bites as she went under Matt says progress takes time it took a long time for

1320
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:59,000
there to be female protagonists and film movies books etc video games with the in-depth storylines

1321
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:03,160
are somewhat of a new media but what does what does bother me is that given how much we've

1322
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:08,760
progressed as a society that it would be quicker but again progress takes time and I actually kind

1323
02:09:08,760 --> 02:09:13,560
of agree with us Joe and under Matt I think I think we'll get there and I I still I think the

1324
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:17,960
only way we're going to get there is if we keep hooping and hollering and talking about it and

1325
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:23,760
having this dialogue that's how we're going to get there but I just wish it wasn't necessary I have

1326
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:29,040
faith that we will get there I mean but look at look at what the indie gaming scene is already I

1327
02:09:29,040 --> 02:09:34,080
mean you have things like gone home you have you say was here pitching Dominique Pamplemousse which

1328
02:09:34,080 --> 02:09:40,000
you know to tackle some very some issues you you don't really see in games otherwise you know and

1329
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:48,880
so on so it's starting in the indie scene for the record by the way to add another thing to what

1330
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:56,160
Shane asked in my own headcanon as far as I could get away with playing a broshep he was totally

1331
02:09:56,160 --> 02:10:03,600
whacking off to Caden it's a picture totally whacking it because honestly I like the Caden

1332
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:08,520
romance with a broshep a lot more than I do with a female Shepherd Tiger Claw in chat says what

1333
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:16,440
would Shepherd be like if he or she was transgender the same be Shepherd Shepherd with bits that don't

1334
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:20,760
quite fit of course in the future hopefully they would have much better corrective surgery for that

1335
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:28,640
I I'm wondering if maybe Tiger Claw means there could be a because you know how some folks prefer

1336
02:10:28,640 --> 02:10:36,000
to use gender-neutral language like neither he nor she you you they or Z you know a different term

1337
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,880
but that's not really possible in Mass Effect but I think I think we also have to look at you know

1338
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:46,560
like say on Facebook there's what 50 different ways you can identify your gender it might be a

1339
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:51,000
bit much for a video game to have 50 different branching options I mean you know yeah you do

1340
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:56,720
have to kind of and not that I'm saying that we shouldn't you know have transgender representation

1341
02:10:56,720 --> 02:11:02,080
I absolutely think that would be a great thing but as the designer does kind of have to choose

1342
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:07,320
at some point you know what are the possible branches for these characters and I think down

1343
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:12,440
the line we're definitely especially as technology catches up but for the most part and this is

1344
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:17,760
another sad thing too I think that while the developers were trying really trying to be more

1345
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:24,720
open and basically throw more of a bone to you know I really think trying to push some limits

1346
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:31,400
they're trying to be a lot more respectful of people in their lives we still have a very binary

1347
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:38,560
viewpoint when it comes to gender you know just in general it's hard to change you know having

1348
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:44,200
centuries of that beaten into your culture and then have it turn around it's still pretty you

1349
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:50,920
know instinctive to say he or she instead of realize that that what you see may not be what

1350
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:59,800
you get so it's another thing that just has to be tackled but I'm saying that for now it's to be

1351
02:11:59,800 --> 02:12:06,160
expected but I don't think it should be expected much later on if that makes sense sure all right

1352
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:09,920
well I'm sure there's plenty more comments on this but I would have to direct those to our email bag

1353
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:14,480
which is participate at orange laundry calm if you'd like to participate further in the discussion

1354
02:12:14,480 --> 02:12:18,320
but in the meantime in the interest of time we're going to tackle some other news stories so going

1355
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:25,520
over to Loki all right so this is kind of interesting kind of all part of the I guess

1356
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:33,240
evolution to the steam service but they're adding a virtual reality mode to I guess the latest steam

1357
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:41,680
beta and what that's gonna do originally you would have to add a command line dash VR to enable it

1358
02:12:41,680 --> 02:12:46,600
but now they actually have a button for it and it's I guess meant for head mounted displays like

1359
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:52,760
the oculus rift and so it has an ear face I think is from what I hear is similar to like the big

1360
02:12:52,800 --> 02:13:00,440
picture mode but you know it's meant for VR displays so it's interesting I don't know I

1361
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:04,600
guess obviously it's something they're gonna need you know if they're gonna be you know forward

1362
02:13:04,600 --> 02:13:14,840
thinking so be kind of curious to see what that looks like I don't know hmm well I guess this is

1363
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:21,000
just in time for this headset craze that's growing right yeah well if I remember correctly I think

1364
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:27,240
the valve was kind of working with you know oculus maybe a little bit and you know just some of their

1365
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:33,320
ideas with I remember I read a comment about like they're saying increasing like the frame rate or

1366
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:40,280
something or doing something with the it was some sort of different method for displaying pixels

1367
02:13:40,280 --> 02:13:48,120
that allowed you to get a lot less motion blur and basically involve them displaying an image

1368
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:53,680
and then flashing to black almost so that you don't have that kind of streaking effect with

1369
02:13:53,680 --> 02:13:57,960
you know pixels being left on the screen or something of course I'm just talking out of my

1370
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:02,600
ass right now but that I remember reading but Bobby says that there in in chat he's saying

1371
02:14:02,600 --> 02:14:09,800
that all these news sites that are running this story are getting it from a reddit post and so he

1372
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:22,080
actually links us to the reddit post how funny it's his own it's his own post so Bobby Bobby's

1373
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:29,880
the one that posted this to read it and yeah I said FYI steam beta now has a VR mode in view

1374
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:35,160
menu no command-line argument needed how fight good job Bobby why didn't you break that news

1375
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:39,800
over a vog network like oh I'd you have to give that one to read it it's fine it's funny though

1376
02:14:39,800 --> 02:14:46,320
but they didn't source them and they never source read it but my god now half of half of what

1377
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:52,840
Facebook has on it like comes from like BuzzFeed they owe read it a lot of money let's be real it's

1378
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:57,640
ridiculous what sites run I mean shit sometimes they run stories based on like random people's

1379
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:04,720
Twitter posts I just don't understand it sometimes that's hilarious yeah well let me let me read the

1380
02:15:04,760 --> 02:15:10,480
rest of what Bobby submitted to the or the reddit here which he submitted oculus is reddit it's

1381
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:14,760
still just big picture mode on a curved screen but it works pretty well for what it is when I

1382
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:19,280
first tried it it required me to do some monitor trickery with the rift on an extended monitor and

1383
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:23,840
it was very flaky now it works with my normal setup and works immediately for those that never

1384
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:28,560
tried it you'll need to opt into the steam client beta and have steam VR installed from tools I'm

1385
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,960
also opted into the beta branch of steam VR but I'm not positive if that's required for the new

1386
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:41,880
version or not so hmm good job body he's going viral and not even he says is it says the logo

1387
02:15:41,880 --> 02:15:45,440
is that's true you do have the little vog logo next to your submission there that's pretty cool

1388
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:51,200
all right well moving on to some other news this this I am NOT getting from reddit but directly

1389
02:15:51,200 --> 02:15:58,320
from the website of the creators of the game this kind of goes back to one of those the dangers of

1390
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:04,800
kickstarters stories again the game was called super action squad that at one point was super

1391
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:11,080
retro squad and coming from the website here exploding rabbit.com it says quote super action

1392
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:15,160
squad is too big of a project for us to handle right now so we're putting it on hold to make

1393
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:22,280
some smaller games first we will resume development on SAS or sass once we are in a better position to

1394
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:27,200
make it the reasons for this decision including why the original Kickstarter was a bad idea in

1395
02:16:27,200 --> 02:16:32,760
the first place are explained in detail below not going to read the entire post but I'll read some

1396
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:38,480
of the bullet points here it boiled down to inexperience lack of understanding and scope

1397
02:16:38,480 --> 02:16:44,320
unrealistic estimate of cost being part of an ineffective team which I thought was a pretty

1398
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:51,320
ballsy thing to write about unity is not a good tool for 2d platformers which I don't know if I

1399
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:54,480
agree with that I don't yeah I don't either because it's kind of one of those things where

1400
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:59,440
it's like well you shouldn't have kickstarted a game that you didn't know that you should have

1401
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:04,440
tested the system first I don't know if I buy that either well here's the thing it's like I think a

1402
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:10,560
lot of it his main excuse was like he's used to programming in flash and then going to unity was

1403
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:15,920
completely different but I think aside from creating the engine I wouldn't think it would

1404
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:22,160
be that difficult to be able to port everything else so obviously it is I mean just because you

1405
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:29,040
I don't know they had but yeah I mean going from taking you know creating was it Super Mario

1406
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:34,800
crossover and just basically grabbing pre-made levels and pre-made assets and all that stuff to

1407
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:40,040
creating your own stuff which let's be honest it's just kind of slight changes to the sprites of you

1408
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:45,440
know Super Mario crossover it's Super Mario crossover retail version minus all the Mario

1409
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:51,960
and Nintendo stuff because we'll get sued well there's also a section in the post called what

1410
02:17:52,400 --> 02:17:57,440
do differently and I think this is interesting just a little quote from this section quote the

1411
02:17:57,440 --> 02:18:02,040
thing is though knowing what I know now I would have never launched a Kickstarter for the game

1412
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:06,960
as my first project it makes little sense for a team with little to no experience that has never

1413
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:11,920
worked together to try and make a big game it would be much better to focus on something small

1414
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:16,680
and simple after getting experience releasing small projects we would be able to work our way

1415
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:22,560
up to bigger ones so they you know and no real word on what's gonna happen all those people that

1416
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:26,960
gave money although they are saying you know they kind of say a little bit vaguely in the post you

1417
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:32,880
know if you were a big donator contact us we'll work something out we're not unreasonable but

1418
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:36,200
they're talking about they can't really do refunds right now probably because the money's already

1419
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:41,560
been spent you know people in the Kickstarter comments are pretty bad yeah I will of course

1420
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:46,480
but this is this is part of the dangers of Kickstarter this is why I've always been very

1421
02:18:46,480 --> 02:18:50,760
nervous to get in on that craze and there's still really only a hand for you to think

1422
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:56,880
him I can probably count on one hand the number of projects I've given to so all right anyway I

1423
02:18:56,880 --> 02:19:02,440
could probably also count on one hand the number of emails we received this week but that's okay

1424
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:05,880
we love hearing from our listeners even when it's only a couple of them I know when they're

1425
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:11,840
wrong you can you cannot you oh you can email us anytime you like participate at orange lounge

1426
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:19,520
radio.com oh what's coming up tonight our saga nothing all right hello LR I've listened to the

1427
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:23,880
to the shortened episode this weekend I must say I appreciate you guys taking the time to record

1428
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:28,200
something during your busy schedule I very much enjoyed listening to it and I think it's great

1429
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:33,280
that snake was mentioned as it truly is a classic game I also very much appreciate you guys

1430
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:39,080
mentioning snake 360 and it's still in development as you read this sequel however there was a yyr

1431
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:43,840
however there was one big inaccuracy in what was said during the episode that simply cannot let

1432
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:48,280
pass Oh cinnamon toast crust cereal is a hundred percent naturally flavored and does not contain

1433
02:19:48,280 --> 02:19:54,760
any fake cinnamon yes big red gum and other things containing fake cinnamon aren't the truly gross

1434
02:19:54,760 --> 02:19:59,000
gum in general is gross anyway but but only a hundred percent cinnamon and sugar present every

1435
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:04,880
bite along with 15 essential vitamins and minerals it's true that some people who shower name

1436
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:10,840
mainly seen as me are fully entitled to their incorrect to keep the fuck but let it be placed

1437
02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:14,960
on record that cinnamon toast crunch cereal is officially yummy and delicious keeping it real

1438
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:20,560
yyr and you know what I still think it tastes like balls so I agree with the statement until

1439
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:24,240
you put it in milk and then it just kind of dissolves and it just because yeah I think

1440
02:20:24,240 --> 02:20:28,200
it's the in milk part that really just made it very much with cinnamon and milk I mean it's

1441
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:32,960
here's what I do a cinnamon toast I don't eat any cereal with milk I'm weird I I have one cup

1442
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:38,740
like a giant cup we're talking like 40 ounce cup full of cinnamon toast crunch a second cup with

1443
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:44,280
milk you just eat them separate it's still good but it's a way better than if it was soaking in

1444
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:49,720
milk yyr I would you know I don't do this very often on the show but I would like to apologize

1445
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:55,920
for dark soccer's behavior unless I would like you to sit and spin and golden grams golden

1446
02:20:56,400 --> 02:21:04,160
shit it is shit it is not shit it is the shit I I will I will not allow the woman to comment

1447
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:10,720
on breakfast cereal again you know what okay but mind you mind you what did I say my favorite

1448
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:16,600
breakfast cereals were as a child you liked great great night like weird total and crackling oat

1449
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:22,960
bran but at least you pooped regularly I did poop regularly okay granted okay there were two kids

1450
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:30,520
we know she's not full of shit see okay and by the way there were two shut up oh my god

1451
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:40,600
yeah Rob but there were two kids cereals that I did like one was Apple Jack's which tasted

1452
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:45,920
nothing like fucking apples Apple Jack's is kind of dumb I don't like it oh god you're a horrible

1453
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:50,480
person who would eat like kicks I never understood that it's like eating packing peanuts I mean it's

1454
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:55,680
seriously gross kicks is gross but what I'll agree with you there honeycomb fuck that shit

1455
02:21:55,680 --> 02:22:02,480
all right the other one was I really liked Rice Krispies I felt when they made Rice Krispies

1456
02:22:02,480 --> 02:22:08,920
treats a cereal okay but I would have to eat my Rice Krispies like super fast because I hated

1457
02:22:08,920 --> 02:22:15,800
that soggy shit at the bottom oh my god why are we talking about fucking sir I'm hungry now thanks

1458
02:22:15,800 --> 02:22:22,440
Rob I'm hungry you know what I saw at the store I couldn't free pizza today and it was great we

1459
02:22:22,440 --> 02:22:26,320

1460
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:31,360
change right and one of the one of the things we were looking at getting was you know Ritz crackers

1461
02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:37,560
or one of my favorite snacks right do you know they have bacon flavored Ritz cracker what it's

1462
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:45,360
probably not very good you know what I found huh when I was at a total wine looking for I was going

1463
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:51,840
to go get some frivolous and they were out of frivolous the fuckers bacon wine they had bacon

1471
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:41,880

1518
02:29:14,480 --> 02:29:21,400
all right anyhow getting back into some gaming news Loki so speaking about Kickstarter and how

1519
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:31,240
it's a terrible idea to back game projects you you Suzuki is researching the idea but not yet

1520
02:29:31,240 --> 02:29:37,160
decided if he's going to kickstart Shenmue 3 which I can tell you right now if that were to

1521
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:44,400
be put on the Kickstarter would probably be approved immediately so research a little quicker

1522
02:29:44,400 --> 02:29:51,720
but yeah so I don't know that would be kind of neat to see him put you know Shenmue 3 on there

1523
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:58,040
does he own the rights to that or is it still Sega I I don't know I think the license yeah I thought

1524
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:02,720
we had a story just a couple that yeah we just had a story a couple weeks ago the the licensing

1525
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:12,240
expired the trademark I don't know that so it is open season now all right moving on to one more

1526
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:16,760
story about a game a lot of people are looking forward to in fact if this game doesn't show up

1527
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:23,040
at e3 this year I don't know what Nintendo's gonna do it will be cut bitches III think so but it has

1528
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:31,800
to do with the Wii U version version the Wii U version in order to save this system I'm gonna

1529
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:40,680
need to sacrifice three virgins all right now the Wii U version of the Legend of Zelda and the

1530
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:46,160
producer eg Anuma has made some interesting comments about the Wii U version of the Legend

1531
02:30:46,160 --> 02:30:53,000
of Zelda and that could be that there may be a top-down view in these future Zelda games because

1532
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,680
you know top-down was the way the old Zelda game with at least the very first Zelda game was then

1533
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:02,240
of course linked to the past and you know link between worlds is kind of brought that back a

1534
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:08,920
little bit but we haven't I mean the console ones involved in 3d ever since you know ocarina so could

1535
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:14,800
the top-down view return and let's see the official Nintendo magazine had an interview and the

1536
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:19,120
question the interviewer asked what did you learn from making this game can you use any of these

1537
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:24,400
ideas in future titles for example the merge with walls ability and is amazing and it would be a

1538
02:31:24,400 --> 02:31:29,600
shame if it was never used again and he says I think the top-down view made the ability to enter

1539
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:34,560
the wall really interesting also in this game I feel we found a new direction in regards to the

1540
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:39,600
potential use of the good old top-down view for Zelda it's the kind of point we will take in good

1541
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:44,400
consideration when thinking about the next Zelda game I think people might be reading into that

1542
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:49,440
quote a little too much but when you consider that there's a second screen I could definitely

1543
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:54,880
see some sort of like maybe like top-down map view in addition to what you're seeing on the screen I

1544
02:31:54,880 --> 02:32:00,640
think would be a very logical extension or dungeon maps certainly on your or your Wii U screen I

1545
02:32:00,640 --> 02:32:07,160
think there's certainly potential for top-down things to come into that that map or in the the

1546
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:16,120
second screen if nothing else so all right my game guru and Chad at live dot vog network

1547
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:22,360
dot-com says oh god they're making a new four swords game aren't they hey you never know you

1558
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:20,080

1559
02:33:20,080 --> 02:33:25,800
that Rainbow Six Patriots isn't redesigned from the ground up three times so that doesn't mean

1560
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:33,720
it's coming out anytime soon that I don't really have it's slow slow news week which is weird

1561
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:37,560
because game developers conference was this week but then again that means that's that's because

1562
02:33:37,560 --> 02:33:43,320
you know again it's not a news conference so nobody's developing right now cuz they're all

1563
02:33:43,320 --> 02:33:48,800
at the conference not all of them I know seriously like one of the shows I watch cooking with unity

1564
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:54,320
they've been off this week because he's at gay only I was about to like where are you guys you'd

1567
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:09,800

1568
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:17,800
while listening to it live well welcome back thanks for being here hello well the darks occur

1569
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:22,320
it's like what you want to share with our listeners tonight do you have a question or a statement or

1570
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:28,040
what oh yeah it was like so here's a question I've been going over it cuz this happened to me

1571
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:33,160
the other week so what happens when your backlog like you have something that's on your backlog

1572
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:39,880
like basically I had like Final Fantasy x2 it was all my backlog for these two so long that they

1573
02:34:39,880 --> 02:34:46,320
didn't HD they did each HD remake I still haven't got to it but it's been like 14 years so when you

1574
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:51,400
have all these games in your backlog does it just become like a collection or a vault it's like yeah

1575
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:58,840
hi yeah I I have had games and I hate to admit this cuz I'm so gonna get judged for it I have

1576
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:06,000
games that I bought the day they came out and they're still sealed because that's how bad my

1577
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,760
gamer a DD is okay so that's what it takes I have the same thing too it's like I have games still

1578
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:16,080
shrink wrapped and they're like from previous like there's stuff on ps2 that I think I would

1579
02:35:16,080 --> 02:35:22,280
get to one day but that one day hasn't happened like in ten years it's like wow yeah no you're

1580
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:26,440
not alone I can tell you that I do it too I don't know if any of our chatters want to admit to that

1581
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:31,080
as well over at live that vog network calm but dark soccer you're the most ultimate collector

1582
02:35:31,080 --> 02:35:36,120
of them all do you have games that you like you played once or like you've like never even played

1583
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:41,960
but you just like hey I gotta have this remember the games I have that are still in shrink wrap so

1584
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:48,680
yes yes do you remember any up top of your head um I don't think I've opened my copy of death

1585
02:35:48,680 --> 02:35:58,720
smiles and I have the special edition um feel my Saturn RPGs a couple PlayStation games I don't

1586
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:03,600
actually I think that one of my copies of Space Channel five part two is still shrink wrapped

1587
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:11,360
because I had the Japanese one and I haven't played my copy of Bayonetta yet so you're not

1588
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:18,680
alone jammer Jay there's plenty of us that have the same problem now let me ask you this are you

1589
02:36:18,680 --> 02:36:23,600
gonna finally check out tend to and are you gonna check out your original PlayStation 2 version or

1590
02:36:23,600 --> 02:36:29,960
if you just said I forget it at this point I'll just play the the new HD remake I I think I'm

1591
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:35,960
just gonna play the new HD remake because my actual x2 is like the international version but

1592
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:40,640
I never got past the intro to see if the rest of the game was in English or not I think I do have

1593
02:36:40,640 --> 02:36:54,200
another x2 copy of 10 to Jamie bonkers over here it's not to give up too much information I am one

1594
02:36:54,200 --> 02:37:00,440
of dark sikora's now I'm one of her co-workers in the land of cubicles so land of cubes low cat in

1595
02:37:00,440 --> 02:37:09,920
the house yeah okay does it drive you then crazy when people say I asked I don't think if I could

1596
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:14,760
I I hear people say it but that's not what it is and people drive me crazy when they do anything

1597
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:21,520
X when it's supposed to be 10 I've gotten like and I blame Bobby for this now actually because

1598
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:29,400
of this whole gif thing but I still call it gif because I can pronounce things properly yes but

1599
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:35,640
now I hit stun says Mega Man x2 was a great game that one actually is an X because that's a legit

1600
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:41,480
X yeah because it's a prototype yeah but like what gets nevermind I'm just not gonna say anything

1601
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:46,840
else you almost had her going all right the jammer Jay is there anything else you want to share

1602
02:37:46,840 --> 02:37:53,280
with others tonight so now at this point it has become a collection I guess the backlog if it goes

1603
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:59,280
back more than 10 years like that if it goes back more than 10 years you know if it's still shrink

1604
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:03,840
wrapped you could consider selling it on eBay depending how common or uncommon it is otherwise

1605
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:12,000
you know what hold on to it as a memory to quit wasting your freaking money I know there's like

1606
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:18,160
some like C titles that I have like in the backlog doll I think like Dark Sector for 360 I think Loki

1607
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:22,200
might have planned it I don't know no one else has ever heard of it I have a copy for some reason

1608
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:26,920
haven't I haven't played it but I actually still have tchotchkes from like a few years ago from it

1609
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:32,280
oh my gosh oh that's what I was gonna let you guys know I was gonna ask you about I was gonna

02:39:27,880 --> 02:39:36,840
the Twitter is really fast what stop stealing my diseases sorry I'm finding this longer the

1620
02:39:36,840 --> 02:39:41,360
show's going on the harder time I'm having with my voice so I may have to call it a little a little

1621
02:39:41,360 --> 02:39:46,040
earlier tonight but we'll see here moving on let's go to another call because it is lighting up here

1622
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:51,880
hi you're on orange launch radio who's this yeah this is raging leader no if it isn't our newest

1623
02:39:51,880 --> 02:39:59,840
intern intern rage inator how you liking the new joke book loving it what's up buddy uh just two

1624
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:05,520
questions but I'm willing to bet that the answers are gonna be kind of long-winded if my guess is

1625
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:15,840
right um you know the first one have you ever been have you ever known you know people not to

1626
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:25,680
basically we're like a better work petition three companies to get certain games onto steam and be

1627
02:40:25,680 --> 02:40:35,840
successful about it oh to get a game on steam and be successful about it um not not like green light

1628
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:43,160
word you know where copies is basically say hey we're thinking about bring this game I would you

1629
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:50,960
buy it whereas we we the consumer folks down well I think are you're talking probably about like

1630
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:54,680
these Sega games they have a bunch of positions going on try to get a bunch of different Sega

1631
02:40:54,720 --> 02:41:02,320
games ported the PC and I think on steam but I think for most companies nowadays that aside

1632
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:09,200
from EA but they probably want their game on steam and so it's not really an issue of oh I have to

1633
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:16,320
convince you to put your already you know available PC game on steam usually they want to be on steam

1634
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:22,680
with the exceptions of you know some of them are there on EA's origin service or you know like in

1635
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:26,560
the case of like Mojang and stuff that has you know he's doing well enough by himself he doesn't

1636
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:34,520
need steam oh all right yeah you know the reason I bring it up is because I was commenting to dr.

1637
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:40,640
her the other day you know speech at that it's kind of a crying shame that aside from metal

1638
02:41:40,640 --> 02:41:47,320
gelt metal slug three there's not really anything by SNK on service so I thought there was a king of

1639
02:41:47,320 --> 02:41:53,320
fighters one of the recent king of fighters game oh oh yeah you're absolutely right you're

1640
02:41:53,320 --> 02:41:57,920
absolutely right I completely forgot about that that's all right it's a big store it's easy to

1641
02:41:57,920 --> 02:42:05,560
get lost in yeah really now as far as my second question you know it goes it's probably more

1642
02:42:05,560 --> 02:42:14,640
geared towards a Loki because he's more of the builder expert in some group now when you were

1643
02:42:14,640 --> 02:42:21,640
building your cabinets you know be your main campus or what have you what god you know like

1644
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:32,120
joysticks and monitors aside what kind of materials did you use did you use like parker board or well

1645
02:42:32,120 --> 02:42:38,760
it's mainly MDF for it I mean depends on the size you know I my first main cabinet which was

1646
02:42:38,800 --> 02:42:45,680
an ultimate arcade to cabinet it was made with three quarters at MDF it was actually supposed

1647
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:53,880
to have been I think 5 8 or something which made it a lot heavier than it needed to be so

1648
02:42:53,880 --> 02:43:03,320
is is basically MDF but I mean I don't know it all depends on how you're trying to you know what

1649
02:43:03,320 --> 02:43:07,960
you're doing with it like if you're painting it or if you're gonna you know put a laminate on it

1650
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:15,480
or you know whatever but usually they're out of MDF or some sort of plywood just because you know

1651
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:22,040
MDF does tend to be a little bit weak sometimes especially if you have really heavy the other

1652
02:43:22,040 --> 02:43:27,040
thing too is like you know if I were to go back and do it again I wouldn't have done like kind of

1653
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:32,440
a classic arcade cabinet I would have wanted it more like you know the view Lex cabinets and stuff

1654
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:38,640
where it's just control panel and HDTV because honestly trying to get stuff you know running on

1655
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:43,440
low enough resolution though you know work with a TV or you know a monitor or something like that

1656
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:47,800
it's just a pain in the ass it's a lot easier just to have a nice HD screen because then you can do a

1657
02:43:47,800 --> 02:43:53,680
lot more with it you can you play indie games on it or whatever and you know may not be as classic

1658
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:58,600
as you you know you have it a main cabinet but it's a hell a lot cheaper and probably a hell a

1659
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:04,600
lot easier to make I want to say I spent three grand on that first cabinet really wish I hadn't

1660
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:10,240
built it yeah honestly no I've been kind of sort of toying with the idea of building y'all a

1661
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:18,120
candidate but it you know if I do build ones could be like big the basic shell of the cabinet they

1662
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:26,480
would look like basically like y'all your classic arcade candidate from the 80s or early 90s yeah

1663
02:44:26,480 --> 02:44:33,680
probably make it out so I kind of went for lemon on the sides and what that in for like a martyr I

1664
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:43,840
would probably use like a flat screen LCD monitor or TV yeah off the shelf Bob you know fight stick

1665
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:51,800
and then just so I don't like I get my computer to overheat because lack of circulation ever off

1666
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:59,880
the side yeah no that way I can't really skip y'all play our key game especially if I were

1667
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:04,880
played like something like Street Fighter 4 or what have you well the other thing you can do

1668
02:45:04,880 --> 02:45:09,880
too is actually just get an old arcade cabinet and just convert that over it might even be cheaper

1669
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:14,560
and it's already been built up nice and there's a lot of people on you know not even necessarily

1670
02:45:14,560 --> 02:45:18,640
eBay bond Craigslist they're willing to get rid of those things for like a hundred bucks or less

1671
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:22,480
or even you know a couple hundred dollars to pay on the condition dark soccer you guys had like a

1672
02:45:22,480 --> 02:45:26,080
pole position machine in your house at one point it was like a converted thing like that right we

1673
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:30,800
did yeah we um made our yeah our main was built out of the pole position which for a while doubled

1674
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:36,720
as Shermie's house that's awesome an arcade cabinet is a cat house it's actually kind of

1675
02:45:36,720 --> 02:45:41,760
because okay the stand-up one had the pedal so sure me would just walk in with where we had no

1676
02:45:41,760 --> 02:45:48,640
pedal yeah and that was just her house it's like I live in an arcade cabinet now you go Shermie

1677
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:53,440
that is amazing all right and the rage inator by the way since we see him on video he's petting

1678
02:45:53,440 --> 02:46:03,080
his kitty right now is in the background there hi Anakin all right oh he looked all right

1679
02:46:03,080 --> 02:46:07,320
rage nader I'm gonna let you go buddy so we can wrap up the show but thanks for the call

1680
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:13,960
yeah take care of you too bye I am actually gonna close up the Skype line I'm sorry I didn't end up

1681
02:46:13,960 --> 02:46:18,640
taking more calls tonight but I do kind of need to take a little break because I'm finding the

1682
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:23,200
longer we're going on I'm like more sinus pressure that's not good I think it's time for pills so I

1683
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:28,000
want to quickly shout out some of these tweets we got here at twitter.com slash olr by the way

1684
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,320
if you didn't get through and you do have something to say please do email us we'd love to hear from

1685
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:35,120
you I mean dark soccer only had like two emails to read tonight and one of them was like a line

1686
02:46:35,160 --> 02:46:45,440
long so give her work next week y'all participate whatever what let it go stop I'm gonna throw this

1687
02:46:45,440 --> 02:46:50,160
cell phone at you I don't even care all right just a few tweets here that I want to read a

1688
02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:56,480
few stories that were submitted s2100 Matt sent us a tweet about the ET 2600 game landfill site

1689
02:46:56,480 --> 02:47:02,680
dig documentary is put on hold by New Mexico authorities really oh the Popo is shutting it

1690
02:47:02,680 --> 02:47:08,480
down I guess they didn't like the idea of people going out there digging it all up hmm I think we

1691
02:47:08,480 --> 02:47:13,320
referenced this early in the show but Tiger Claw says this link to a story about how Nintendo has

1692
02:47:13,320 --> 02:47:20,840
50 unity games on their way to Wii U but can they can they sell well alongside Mario I mean is the

1693
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:25,760
question absolutely can I think that I think they can too because what I buy Mario what else you're

1694
02:47:25,760 --> 02:47:30,520
gonna buy well well but I hear the games are doing really well on Wii U too because of the fact that

1695
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:35,280
they don't get lost in the marketplace like they kind of do on the other systems so I mean there

1696
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:44,040
is that and lastly Tiger Claw says this is a link Microsoft saying DirectX 12 will improve Xbox one

1697
02:47:44,040 --> 02:47:51,120
performance um that's that's not too surprising I mean you know sometimes these firmware updates

1698
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:55,400
and things will help the systems run better right and so when we're talking about something like

1699
02:47:55,400 --> 02:48:00,360
DirectX which is basically you know Xbox that whole name Xbox comes from DirectX something

1700
02:48:01,240 --> 02:48:06,080
I mean that's no surprise that should help things but wouldn't that be akin to like a graphics

1701
02:48:06,080 --> 02:48:10,840
driver update or something like it might it might make a few things better here and there but it's

1702
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:14,840
not gonna like radically change your experience um it's actually supposed to improve frame rate

1703
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:22,240
is better and you know they're talking about fours of five and stuff and saying it was like 60 I

1704
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:26,640
thought fours of five is already 60 frames per second but I guess they're talking about how you

1705
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:31,200
know they use it to improve fours of fives performance and stuff and how it's supposed to

1706
02:48:31,200 --> 02:48:36,320
have a lot less overhead so you know a lot less processing power is required to do the same stuff

1707
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:42,360
so that will help because you know a lot of these you know Xbox one games are having trouble hitting

1708
02:48:42,360 --> 02:48:47,520
1080p I mean it's a lot of the 720 you know upscale and they're having trouble hitting 60

1709
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:53,560
frames per second so anything can help and hopefully DirectX you know 12 will get you

1710
02:48:53,560 --> 02:48:59,160
where it needs to be on par with like the PlayStation 4 all right sounds good well that

1711
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:04,600
is going to wrap up another edition of orange lounge radio our first from the brand new studio

1712

1735
02:51:15,560 --> 02:51:22,920

1736
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:28,800
awesome not like steam like the video game service on PC's although you know that steam's pretty cool

1737
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:33,480
too but I want some old-school steam and so I think I'm gonna go get some I want the live
