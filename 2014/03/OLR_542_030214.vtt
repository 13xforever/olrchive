Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Digital Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
This week, one beta ends as another one begins as Valve releases family sharing as the Steam Music Beta begins.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
News from South Park and Stick of Truth continues with outrage from policy makers and gamers alike over censorship in much of the world.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll take your comments on these events on the show wherever Gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 542 of our show for this March the 2nd of 2014.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts and over the next few hours we'll be talking about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Hi.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
How you doing?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm happy.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
You're happy? Good. That's good. If you're happy and you know what, clap your hands.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
May I have a little more please?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Yes. Just as long as you're going to be okay to drive.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
This is me.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
We decided to crack open a bottle of wine here in the studio so you know, that's how things go.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
That's how we roll here at OLR. But drink responsibly kids.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yes.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
It's a three hour show so we've got a lot of time.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I just made the heart fingers at Rob.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright, and joining us via the Skype line, say hello everybody to Loki Oler. How you doing Loki?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm doing good.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Good, good. What's new?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Not much.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Yeah?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Just put in a cat door today.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Put in a what?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
A cat door.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.000
A cat door. Oh, you're being quite homely while you're around. Being the man of the house.

01:43.000 --> 01:50.000
Yeah, I guess. So, yeah. Because the cat was annoying me and kept whining at the door.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
And sure enough, I put the door in, she didn't give a shit. She's like not even bothering with the door anymore.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
So you should have made the cat door so the cat can go out but the cat can't get back in.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Actually, funny you should say that, there's actually an option on there to do that.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Or you can have her come in only. You can lock it one way so it's kind of funny.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Awesome. Well, there you go. Well, I do want to say hi to everybody.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
And I try to do this once in a while every few months or so but sort of reintroduce ourselves.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
So if it is your first time listening to this show, welcome.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
And just a quick reintroduction, my name is Rob, that's Jamie.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And joining us on the Skype line tonight is Loki, or Matt.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
And he's on the Skype line because him and Mrs. Loki just had a baby about, where are we at now?

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Over a month ago now at this point, right? Or just about a month ago?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It's like six weeks.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Wow, time flies. But he's still on baby leave.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
Usually we're all in the same studio but obviously we want Loki to take time while the wife is healing and all that stuff.

02:51.000 --> 02:58.000
So usually though we're all in the same room and about ten years ago we all met at a local arcade playing a music-based video game.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, those types of things.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
We would meet up once a week or so at the arcade just like you would with a fighting game community or racing game community.

03:08.000 --> 03:15.000
And afterwards we go to the diner across the street, sit around the table, and just talk about gaming because we're all gaming nerds.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
So here we are 12 years later, we're doing that same thing virtually.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
And thanks to the internet we have the world's biggest diner table via our Skype line, our Twitter, and the chat room.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Live.vognetwork.com.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Because after all we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.000
We are live at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern every Sunday right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
vognetwork.com.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
By the way Rob, since someone complained.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Sup bitches.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Someone complained that you weren't using your usual tagline.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
It's not really my usual, I've done it twice.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Well you said a couple weeks ago it was going to be your new tagline.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Okay now it's my, okay, sup bitches.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
Stop disappointing the people out there.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Rob, you know what?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Stop being a false icon.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I reject that statement.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Thank you guys so much.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Whether you're listening to us on the podcast feed or via Stitcher or whatever, or listening to us live.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
We're up against, you know, the Oscars as being a live Sunday night show.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
We typically seem to go up against like every big American thing.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
You know, every award show, every Super Bowl, sports-a-thon thing seems to be on a Sunday night.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
But you guys are loyal listeners, you're here with us.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
So hoping we can include you guys as much as possible as we go through tonight's show.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Let's talk about our kickoff topic real quick.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Since the Oscars are going on after all, I mean I'm going to acknowledge that it's a big movie night.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Although I'm going to be honest, I didn't see a single one of the movies nominated.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I saw maybe like three movies last year.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
What was nominated?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I've just become that.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
I don't know, everybody's talking about Gravity and 12 Years a Slave is the other one.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
And American Hustle, which I should have seen because I do love Jennifer Lawrence.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
She's perfect.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I am pissed off though that Saving Mr. Banks didn't show up.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Because it was really good.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't even know what that is.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Is that the Disney one?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
That was the Disney one.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Okay, I didn't see that.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Tom Hanks should have freaking won everything for being Walt Disney, sorry.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I used to watch the Oscars every year, then I got this show.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh well, it's fine. I prefer doing this.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
So the Oscars are the Oscars.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
But it does beg the question, since we are a video game show, this is usually the time of year where we talk about video game movies.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
And the question I want to ask everybody is, you know, and this goes to our chat room as well over at live.vognetwork.com.

05:27.000 --> 05:38.000
What's it going to take, or is it ever going to happen, where a movie based on a video game can actually be a contender for an Oscar?

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Because let's be real, most of the video game movies they've put out have been stinkers.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
There's only been a few good ones, passable ones.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
The original Mortal Kombat I think most people agree, it wasn't bad.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Resident Evil, depending on what you're into, seems like most people.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And they're not quite game canon anyway.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, they're really not.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
First Silent Hill, I really like that.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I didn't even mind the second one.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
It wasn't really for everybody.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
But let's be real, that game was never going to get, it's not really an Oscar flick, it's a popcorn flick.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
But we do see that the caliber of writing in some games these days is really, really good.

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
Of course, I would be a bad fan boy if I didn't throw out the fact that Mass Effect has some really great writing.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
If we kind of overlook that ending thing with number three, I mean they did go back and fix it and then the Citadel DLC.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Clituring some of the characterizations.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, so we'll overlook the imperfections and say, you know, overall Mass Effect had some great writing.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
And who goes to bed in their armor, really?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
A lot of people loving Dragon Age as well.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
Not to put all the focus on BioWare, because certainly tons of people are really enjoying The Last of Us.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Even Beyond Two Souls, you know, is kind of like a playable type of game.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Or is it a playable type of movie that is a game.

06:48.000 --> 06:54.000
So my question is, do we think we'll ever see the type of movie that actually gets nominated for Oscars?

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
I'm not talking about just necessarily like special effects Oscars, that's one thing.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm talking about like writing, heaven forbid acting, or even a picture nomination.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
Could we ever get that type of caliber movie out of a video game?

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
Or are movies based on video games forever pigeonholed into, well they're gonna suck.

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
I think it would really just take having the right director behind it, and having the right people in it.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
And I think that would turn a lot of it around.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Because I mean, if you actually, going back to the Silent Hill one.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
Despite, you know, it being really following more of the game formula with the movie.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
The acting in it was really freaking top notch.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
It really was good. I mean look who was in it.

07:40.000 --> 07:49.000
Had some of the best, you know, actors, especially, what's her face, that played the big bad lady.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
Not that played Dahlia, but played Alice Krieg the bored queen.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Oh my god I love her. She is perfectly creepy.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
I wanted all of those performances to be nominated because they were really good.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Well I think they got nominated in like science fiction awards and things that are a little more niche.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
So we can't say that the movie was completely ignored.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
But obviously there were a lot of people that didn't like the movie.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Well I understand. Some of it was a little cheesy.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
The little girl was a little bit cheesy.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Silent Hill! Silent Hill!

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay that part was...

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
It had its imperfections.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
But the rest of it was awesome.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Loki, what do you think?

08:27.000 --> 08:34.000
The only chance I think that they have is like, you know, maybe if that Minecraft movie comes out later on.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Because it's being done by like, was it the guys that did the Lego movie?

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
I think that could win like the best animated movie or something.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
But I don't know.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
A lot of the people that bring on video game properties, they don't really take it seriously.

08:50.000 --> 08:57.000
So I just, I don't know if you would really see like Oscar winning performances out of that stuff.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Let's go over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and some of the responses.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
First we have some other people naming movies that really weren't bad that were based on video games.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
AkumaJP says, the first Tomb Raider movie, which actually might have gotten...

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Somebody would have to look that up, but I think it might have gotten Oscar nods,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
but in like the special effects type of categories.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Like, you know, Angelina Jolie wasn't nominated.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
Neither was her leg.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Dungeonbuster says, Prince of Persia wasn't too bad either.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
I forgot about that one. I think that's the problem.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Raginator brings up Final Fantasy VII Advent Children.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And some other comments on this topic.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
A good video game movie doesn't take the source material as gospel.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
They need to tweak it to work as an actual movie.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
And we do see, I mean it's not like there isn't movies based on other material.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
They have a whole category at the Oscars for that.

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
Because they have the best screenplay original and best screenplay based on some type of source.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And almost always it's a book.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
Either a memoir or a fiction book or what have you.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Once in a while it might even be like a newspaper article.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
You know, there might be some other type of inspiration.

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
But it's not like there isn't a category where a, putting my fanboy hat on, Mass Effect movie couldn't fit into.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
But the question is, are we ever going to see something of that caliber? I don't know.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
Brad from Pod Culture suggests Bioshock would be a great candidate, I think, for that type of movie.

10:22.000 --> 10:29.000
Even though I'm not into fandom, I think that of all of them, Assassin's Creed II would actually make a good story.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
Because it would be historical fiction having to deal with some of the most fucked up politics ever in Renaissance Europe.

10:36.000 --> 10:41.000
Speaking of fandoms, I've always been surprised you're not really into Bioshock.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Like I know you downloaded games, checked them out, but I'm kind of surprised.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
I haven't had time to, I started Infinite, remember, right before I started.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And I know you're a big fan of like art direction in games.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
And like when I think of games with like A plus art direction, Bioshock Infinite's like up there.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I have the game. I've started playing it.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
It's just, you know, with me working at, you know, Locat.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I understand.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I haven't been able to...

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I understand.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Degenerate Johnny in chat is placing his bets.

11:06.000 --> 11:15.000
Degenerate Johnny says, the first video game movie that will win an Oscar will be the Warcraft movie because Blizzard never settles less than the best.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
I could definitely see Warcraft, I mean, depending on where they're going with it.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
I could see Warcraft be one of those special effects, those types of contenders.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Will the writing be good?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
There's a lot riding on that movie, isn't there?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
We'll see. We will sure see.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
I would actually see a movie based off of Assassin's Creed 2.

11:35.000 --> 11:41.000
Just because seeing those Medicis killing each other and busy being Pope, that would be awesome.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Ragenator brings up, if you keep Ue Bull the fuck away from the movies.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
You know, I kind of feel like he's a joke that died out several years ago.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
I mean, isn't, like, has he been allowed to make a movie?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Loki, you've followed him more than any of us.

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
Not that you should be proud of that, but has he made any movies lately?

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
I think he has some new movie coming out soon, but he hasn't really made a whole ton of stuff lately.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
I think he's been trying to do his own properties, and he even made, like, was it Tunnel Rats that he wanted to spin off into a game?

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
I think that happened, but no one cared.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
He should make Showgirls 2, honestly.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
No. You do not want him touching our beloved Showgirls.

12:22.000 --> 12:28.000
I think he's doing another, remember, the last thing he did was try to kickstart another Postal movie.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
He went to Kickstarter?

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, he went to Kickstarter.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
People gave that man money?

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
No, I don't think it, it failed, so he didn't.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
What a shock. What a shock.

12:39.000 --> 12:45.000
Didn't he do, now, there was a Dungeon Siege movie with Burt Reynolds in it, am I correct?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
There was several Dungeon Siege movies.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Wait, no, I'm sorry, I'm not thinking Dungeon Siege.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
There was several, what was the vampire one that he used to do a lot of?

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Blood Rain. Several Blood Rain movies.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
They were all terrible.

13:03.000 --> 13:11.000
I think we're all kind of over him, and certainly he's the guy that needs to stop giving video game movies a bad name because he's ruining it for all of us.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
They had a Blood Rain movie that was a spaghetti western with zombies in it.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
What the hell?

13:17.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm sorry, last good zombie movie was that one that I still have of yours?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
28 Days Later, although those weren't really zombies?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
No, Wild Zero.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh, okay.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I need to give that back to you.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
Anyway, so we'll see, so some of the chatters predicting Warcraft, my fandom predicts Mass Effect if they could ever make a movie out of that.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
Any predictions on what video game would make great source material for an Academy Award winning movie?

13:42.000 --> 13:49.000
I would have a really hard time watching a Mass Effect movie because you know they put some dude, I can't, my head cannon doesn't accept a male Shepard.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
I really think they could convince people better that FemShep works than male Shep.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
I stan male Shep obviously because of some of the choices I made in the game, but I would accept FemShep in the movie.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Heck yeah.

14:05.000 --> 14:14.000
Especially if they got somebody like, I don't know why but I just keep thinking, I think this is a really easy choice so I apologize to the FemShep fans out there, but for some reason I really picture Scarlett Johansson.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Just because she kicks so much ass as Black Widow.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, I can see that.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
She'd have to, I think, work out a bit more.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Sure.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
I mean seriously, you know I actually installed a mod for my Mass Effect 3 that's called the Buff FemShep mod.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
That actually makes her look less way fish and more like a career soldier.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
It's actually really cool.

14:38.000 --> 14:47.000
As far as like a game, I could see, if you were going to do something animated, I would say Journey.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Oooh.

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
Have you ever seen any of those different animations where there's no dialogue, it's all set to music?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
Oooh.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Or for example like the interstellar 5555.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
So you're kind of almost going with a short film almost.

15:02.000 --> 15:11.000
You know what's funny is I was going to make a joke here because Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com suggests Gone Home as a movie and I was going to joke, oh that would be a short film wouldn't it?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Because the game wasn't really that long.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
But, you know, actually that's the type of medium that really could work.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
It's not like, it's unheard of.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
Mortal Kombat now exists in short films on YouTube, the little episodic things they're doing.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
But I think that Journey would make like a really neat art film.

15:29.000 --> 15:34.000
You know, I mean it's an art game if you want to be...

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
And Blackwolf does remind us, Journey's soundtrack already ran a Grammy.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.000
So, it's already on its way to that.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
Anyway, alright, we could sit here and fan wank about movies and video games and all this for a very long time.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
But we want to get into the gaming news, but we can't get there until we talk about...

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Wank Rob, wank as far as the eye can see.

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
We can't get there to gaming news until we talk about our frame of references and that's why we always do at the top of the show.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
How was your gaming week and what were the video games that you were playing this week?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Dark Sakura.

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
This is actually the first time I've been influenced by a fanfic.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
But I started playing Dragon Age 2 again so I could play a mage.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
I love your shirt.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
Actually, my shirt, since, thank you for...

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
My shirt actually says Realm Maintenance.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
It's actually another podcast that's out there and the host of Realm Maintenance, Ro, was kind enough to give me this shirt at BlizzCon.

16:27.000 --> 16:34.000
So, shout out to Ro and his fantastic podcast, Realm Maintenance, which is great in the Warcraft podcast community.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
I really wish we had something like it in the general gaming community. Anyhow, sorry, go ahead.

16:38.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, I did start Dragon Age 2 again, except I'm not too happy with how my Hawk looks.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
So I'm going to redo her because I have a crap ton of mods.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
And unfortunately, some of the mods that I put in made Aveline's face turn black.

16:52.000 --> 16:57.000
So I ended up installing this mod that makes Aveline look like the default Hawk, except blonde or something.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
So I was like, okay, whatever, I can deal with Aveline being pretty.

17:00.000 --> 17:09.000
But I started Dragon Age 2 again, playing some more Mass Effect 3, just because I want to...

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
I put my retagon game on hold for the longest time, so now I'm just trying to finish it.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
And we just cured the genophage.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Ooh, I had cries again because...

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Crying.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
Still playing Animal Crossing because what the fuck else?

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Because those animals need Aaron's Run stat.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Hey, I have no more Ed, so it's glorious.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
That dresser ain't going to run its way over to whatever's house by itself.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm like, hey, can you give this to Eric?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Eric walks right by.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Sure?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
My townsfolk are stupid.

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
So yeah, I played something else. I'm trying to remember what it was.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
Oh yeah, I did actually play Govellius on iOS, and it sucks. So I deleted it.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
I also did play the candy... what was the original?

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Candy swipe?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Candy swipe? It's not fun.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
I mean, no offense to the guy, because it's not that the game isn't fun, it's that the music sucks.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
Get better music for it, and I'll play it more often.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
That poor guy probably did it all himself on a Casio keyboard.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
It sounds like something, just, no, I could do better.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Even if you hire me, I will do better.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.000
But I still bought the game, I still supported it, and I'm still telling people not to buy Candy Suck.

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
I mean, Candy Crush or whatever the fuck they stupid shits call it.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
And I've had some wine, so I feel great.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I played something else, but...

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
If Dark Soccer and I are a bit all over the place tonight, you'll know who to thank.

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
It took me drinking half a bottle last night to be slightly tipsy.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
You can ask Becky, because she was there.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Oh yeah, I played Final Fantasy XIV.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
And thank you to everybody who helped me finish Braeflop.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
I mean, Braeflox is whatever the crap is called.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
But I still think it's funny to call it Braeflop, even though that's the best dungeon so far.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Because you're outside, and there's crap going on.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And you get to shoot fireflies. That's kind of cool.

19:16.000 --> 19:23.000
So yeah, I had a really good time playing Final Fantasy XIV, and I will get to play much more of it, and back to other games.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Alright.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
So, stuff and things.

19:26.000 --> 19:30.000
I almost felt like I was going to throw up watching Dan play Forza.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
That good, huh? Is that the new one on Xbox One or one of the other ones?

19:33.000 --> 19:38.000
No, it's not Forza. It was some other racing sim he has on his triple screen.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
What was that one? It's like an actual rally racing sim.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
Dirt?

19:44.000 --> 19:51.000
No, it's got some sort of interesting European sounding name, and whatever.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
One of them.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
Some game, some game.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
Probably Toca?

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
No, it was two words, but I forget.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Anyway, Dan's doing his big sim racing thing again.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
They had it running all day, so I got really tired of hearing...

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
You know, so I was like, I'm going to hide in the back room.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Alright.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Let's move on.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
It was okay.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I didn't play a ton of stuff, because, you know, time and everything,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
but I did manage to play a few things.

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
Sadly, not a lot of it I can really talk about, just because one of...

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
Well, I can mention that I played Chroma, because I got into the alpha for that.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
I just can't mention what I thought about it.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
I mean, other than it was good, I guess.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
I played a little bit of South Park, the Stick of Truth.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
My God, is that game amazing.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
It is just fantastic.

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
The humor in it is spot on, and it literally looks like you're watching the show.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
It's just awesome.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Wait, hold on, because a lot of people are kind of worried,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
because there's, you know, tight embargoes on South Park,

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
and I guess the reviews aren't going to pop up until right when the game comes out,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
but knowing, you know, that you have your connections and things,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
not piracy, we're talking about other connections that Loki has,

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
you sometimes get things early, so you've actually had a chance to play it?

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah, just a little bit, like 30 minutes.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Oh, because one of the big questions out there is that the rumor is the game is really short.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Like seven to eight hours.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
I don't know about that.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
Okay, well, I'm just throwing it out there, for better or worse.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
The rumor is that the game is only like seven to eight hours,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
which for an RPG is really short.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
But, I mean, if it can deliver the funny for seven to eight hours,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
I still, I like, I don't know, I kind of,

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
like the South Park movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my entire life,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
so if this game can deliver that for seven to eight hours,

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
I do kind of think it's worth the $60, honestly, but we'll see, we'll see.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
It's pretty funny, there's a part in the very beginning of the game where you go to Cartman's house,

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
and then you're standing there, and you're walking through the living room,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
and his mom's there, oh, you're a friend.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
And so, one of the options is to talk to her,

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
and you try to talk to her, and Cartman's like,

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
she's not part of the game.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
And so I just thought that was hilarious.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
Where they have like, you know, you can take a shit in your toilet

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
and pick up the shit so you can throw it at people.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.000
You know, it's just, I don't know, it's just really South Park humor.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Classy.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Yeah.

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
And then I think I'm pretty sure from what I read in the beta stuff

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
that it's okay to talk about,

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
the latest beta was for Elder Scrolls Online.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
I played a few minutes of that.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
I wasn't a big fan of the game,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
well, I mean, when it first was down,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
so I was like, oh my god, this game looks awesome.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
And every little bit of news that I heard after that,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
it's just been kind of going downhill.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
And I played it, and it didn't change my mind.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
I mean, it looks like an Elder Scrolls game,

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
but it's just kind of, I don't know,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
missing something, like charm, I guess.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
But I mean, it's a beta still,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
so obviously the opening cutscene stuff's gone,

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
and they don't have that there.

23:05.000 --> 23:09.000
They have a little text thing explaining what the cutscene was going to look like.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
And the combat's kind of okay.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
I was a little pissed off that it didn't support controllers,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
because that's what I normally play stuff on,

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
and so I had to do kind of keyboard, mouse,

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
and it worked all right.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
But it's just, I don't know, I would definitely not pay for it.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
But I don't know, people will be excited about it, I guess.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
Coming out in a couple months.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
We've been talking about that game pretty extensively over on Hoard House,

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
where we talk about a lot of the multiplayer and online games,

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
and I have to admit, I wasn't even drinking on the show this weekend.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
I kind of became a little unhinged at the whole Elder Scrolls thing,

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
because I'm just really shocked that they're going to charge a monthly fee for it,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
and every sign points to it's not going to work for them,

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
and they're going to reverse on that mighty quick.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
I mean, we might be wrong, but we'll see, we'll see.

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
The initial buzz doesn't look too great.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Yeah, I don't know. It just seems very basic to me.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
But, like I said, I didn't give it that much time.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
But I was short on time, I was like, okay, well, I can play more Elder Scrolls,

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
or I could play South Park.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
I'll play South Park.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
There you go.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
All right.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
That's pretty much it.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
That's it.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Well, my gaming week.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
I've got to admit, I didn't play a lot of new stuff,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
because I'm still trucking along in Final Fantasy XIV.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
But, again, I've been focusing on a game that I kind of went back to

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
after a little while away.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
I've been talking about the past couple weeks on the show Diablo III

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
on the PlayStation 3, which I was playing,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
and I was talking about how it kind of controls weird,

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
but, gosh, it makes me really curious to go back and check out the PC version.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
Well, like Clockwork, the PC version got a huge patch this last week,

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
the 2.0 patch, because they've got that expansion coming

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
that they want to get sold copies of

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
and convince people they need to go to level 70

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
and play as a Crusader and so forth.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
So there's a huge patch that went out for Diablo this weekend.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It added clans into the game.

25:02.000 --> 25:07.000
But most importantly, it changed the loot system completely.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
And now the loot you get, the vast majority of it,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
like 90% of it is something your class can actually use,

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
with the minority being stuff that you might want to put in your stash

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
to give to other characters.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
And the other huge change they made was the difficulty settings.

25:21.000 --> 25:25.000
They completely eliminated the fact that there are four difficulty levels.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.000
There was, what, Normal and Hell and Inferno.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't remember what they were all called.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
But there was the four different difficulty levels.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
They eliminated that completely.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
And now all of the characters scale to your level,

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
and you choose, do you want it to be Normal, where it's kind of easy?

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Do you want it to be Hard, where it's a little more difficult,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
but you get increased experience and gold drops?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Do you want it to be Terror, where it's even hard?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
And so on.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
So they changed it so that you have a little more tweak

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
over how difficult the game is, as opposed to,

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
you've got this track, this track, this track, and this track.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
And I've got to tell you, when I first read that,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
I was a little bit like, oh, level scaling?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
I don't know.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
That doesn't work so well in Final Fantasy.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
But it really does work in Diablo III.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Because Normal, yeah, you can kind of steamroll it.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
And even Hard, if you have the right gear, is not really...

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I've been playing mostly in Hard, and it's really not that hard.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
But as you get into other difficulties, I imagine things get a lot more difficult,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
especially as you bring more players in the mix.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
So it really does feel like you have way more control

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
over how difficult the game is, as opposed to,

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
you've got these four vanilla tracks.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
So I think in some regards, that has really changed the game.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
And most people I know that have gone back and played the game say,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
wow, Diablo III is really fun.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
And it's not like they didn't go back and add really a lot of story,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
or they didn't really change the game in that regard.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
It's just they made a few key design changes

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
that have really flipped the game upside down for some people in a good way.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.000
The Auction House is still there, but that will be eliminated in about two weeks, I think.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
And it's really a footnote now.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
You kind of have to really search for it to find it.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
Because obviously they want to make it so you can just strip it out really easy

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
and you're not even going to be able to notice.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
I couldn't even find the Real Money Auction House.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
I think that's already gone.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Or that is so well hidden, I couldn't even find that.

27:13.000 --> 27:18.000
So, yeah, if you were not wanting to play Diablo III

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
because of some of the Auction House fuckery and all that,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
it's different now.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says,

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
Does it have BBF mode or Bobby Black Wolf Forever mode?

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
So we sometimes call it.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Yes and no.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
I mean, no, there's no super easy mode.

27:36.000 --> 27:42.000
But if you play on normal and you're just staying on top of your gear drops

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
and replacing it, you will not have a problem.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
I really can't see that you're going to die an awful lot.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
And if you die, oh well.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
You run back to your corpse and you come back without penalty.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
It's hardcore mode where you have to worry about that.

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
Because in hardcore mode is the whole die once, die forever.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
I always kind of preferred the way Path of Exile handled that,

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
where if you die in hardcore mode,

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
your character is bumped down to the normal bracket

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
and you can't play hardcore again on that character.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I kind of like that a little better.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It doesn't make the loss feel as severe,

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
but the stakes are high when you decide to be a hardcore player.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
And it's so funny, because I actually did start a hardcore barbarian this week

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
and I did not think I would like playing a barbarian,

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
but they're actually a lot of fun.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
But anyway, when you start a hardcore character,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
you basically have to sign a waiver, so to speak, with your mouse.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
It's like, this character will be gone forever if you die.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Customer support will not bring these back for any reason.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
You have to accept this before you play.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
So it's pretty awesome.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Anyway, I'm sure a lot of people got their free copy of Diablo 3

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
with the whole blood pact that Blizzard did with World of Warcraft some time ago.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
And even if you didn't, it's pretty cheap now, I think,

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
because they have that expansion.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
They're going to try to make their money on the expansion.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
And they really...

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
When you go to select a character,

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Crusader is just one of the options right there.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
You can pick just a witch doctor or barbarian

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
or something that's in the game normally.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
But of course, if you try to click OK, it'll say,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
oh, Crusader is only available in Reaper of Souls.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
Give us your credit card now.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
You know, that whole type of thing.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
But yeah, Diablo 3, it's changed for the better.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
And if you had the game already,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
you didn't have to pay a monthly fee for it or anything.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
So reinstall it and check it out and see what you missed out on.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Or not so much what you missed out on,

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
but see what's new because it is worth checking out again.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
That oddly enough reminded me of what the other thing was, by the way.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
League of Legends.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
Oh, that's right. You started randomly getting into that, huh?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
I installed it just to see what it's like, but I haven't tried it yet.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
Well, that's nothing. You didn't play it then.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
Just saying.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
It doesn't count.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
It's on my computer.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
Next. Well, big deal.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
I got a lot of stuff on my computer I've never touched either.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
You want to look at my Steam library?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
All right.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
After I get through going through mine.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
Well, as we get into the news a little later on tonight,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
we can go through each other's.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Ooh.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
All right.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Some housekeeping first before we get there.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
As a reminder, there will be no show on March 16th.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Or I should say no live show.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
I need to talk to Dark Soccer and Loki because I want to put something together

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
that may be pre, you know, done in advance or whatever.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So we'll try to do that.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
That way you podcast folks don't have to go a week with no show.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
But we will not be here live on March 16th.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
That is because the studio is moving.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Because I am moving.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Much more space.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
They're growing legs and they're walking.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
Well, there's going to be space.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
And with space means we can consider the webcam.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.000
That's all I'm going to say.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
That's all I'm going to say.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
I'm not going to promise nothing.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
So.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I'll be wearing a sheet.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
We can put you in a box.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
I'm going to become the Berka Avenger.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.000
We can put you in a box.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I'll be cosplaying her every week.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
So no show, no live show on March 16th.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
And of course you can follow us on Twitter.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
We're also on Facebook.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
And one other important piece of housekeeping.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
For the past couple weeks we've been talking about a fun little free game,

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
a parody game that's available over at VoG network dot com.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
It is Flappy VoG.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
And Flappy VoG.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
Flappy VoG did get its second character pack tonight.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
It is character pack two, the final.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
And the sole star of character pack two is Loki.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
So if you've.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And I got to say though, Loki's lines are pretty hilarious.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
I won't spoil it here.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
But well done sir.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
I laughed.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
I laughed a lot.

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
I played it for a little bit and I'm already getting tired of hearing my voice.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.000
Yeah.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
So you can check that out over at Flappy dot VoG network dot com.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.000
But as we talked about earlier on the Bobby Black Wolf show.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Part of joke.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Part of parody.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Part of satire is that you got to know when to walk away.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
And the joke's already starting to get a little stale.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Loki doing it has breathed some life into it.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
But after this it is for sure done.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
We're not going to really talk about it anymore.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
You got that song stuck in my head now.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
What song?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
The Gambler.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
I'm a joker.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
I'm a smoker.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
You got to know when to hold it.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.000
Alright.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Walk away.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Are you going to serenade us with some karaoke revolution tonight?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
No.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Some Sing Star?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
No.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
You're already singing the Joker when I was talking about The Gambler.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I have Sing Star Abba and Sing Star Queen.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
I need to borrow by the way Sing Star Abba.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
In hell.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
Alright.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Bitch.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Let's see if I bring you anyone.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
Let's get to.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
Although I think it was already here.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Let's get to some gaming news.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Loki will start us off while Dark Soccer and I fight over my copy of Sing Star Abba.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Loki.

32:26.000 --> 32:33.000
Well, with the phasing out of a lot of the Wii stuff, they are now pulling the plug on

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
online play for the Wii and the DS.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
Because hey!

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
They have a Wii U and a 3DS that they want you to buy.

32:40.000 --> 32:46.000
So if you want to play online with people, you can buy a new system.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
And that is happening May 20th.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
And of course, that shuts down such things as just online play.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
Also, some of the stuff that will not be affected.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
Of course, anything that involves you paying them money.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
So the DSi shop or the Wii.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
What was it?

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
The Wii shop.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
Those are staying open.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
Of course, the browsers and Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, etc.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
That's all going to still work.

33:17.000 --> 33:23.000
But remember, they took away the weather and news channel.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
Well, now they are taking away online as well.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
That does kind of suck.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
I love to spin the globe and the weather channel and check out what the weather is going to

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
be like in Antarctica.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
I mean, I guess I could do that online.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
It's cold.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
Yeah, it is kind of disappointing that they have removed online for their games.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.000
Especially when you consider that a lot of other systems out there, their games are still

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
alive and kicking.

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
Some of the thought might have been that this was due to the fact that they are releasing

33:56.000 --> 34:01.000
their servers through GameFly or GameSpy.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.000
And because of that, and I think that they went under new ownership that the fees are

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
a lot higher.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.000
So now they're just kind of cutting their losses and hopefully trying to drive people

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
to play stuff on the Wii U.

34:14.000 --> 34:19.000
Also, considering I think one of the more popular games on there was Mario Kart Wii,

34:19.000 --> 34:24.000
and it literally shuts down 10 days before Mario Kart 8 comes out.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.000
So that could be something.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Hmm.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
A little bit aptly timed there.

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
By the way, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, VX JasonXV is in chat and talks about how he

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
likes to spin the globe and the Weather Channel and comes across Cockburn Town.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
There's a place called Cockburn Town.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
I had no idea.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
There's a Cockburn Town.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Probably.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
I knew there was a Fuck Austria.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
I knew about that.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Is it Fucking or Fuck?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
One of the two.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
I think it's Fucking or something, Austria.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.000
But I did not know there was a Cockburn Town, but apparently, yes, it is the capital of

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
the Turks and Caicos Islands.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
Who knew?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Fun.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Go visit Cockburn Town, everybody.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
There's also stuff called Cockaleaky Soup, which I just think is funny.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
It's basically Chicken and Leek Soup, but it's called Cockaleaky.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
No comment.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Hello all of our friends in Scotland.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
And it's not like you can't do this on theweatherchannel.com or maps.google or whatever, but I don't

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
know.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.000
There was something very therapeutic.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Just roll with me here.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
Surely I can't be the only one.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
I know Jason just admitted to doing this too.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
There was something very therapeutic to that little music in the Wii Weather Channel, the

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
doo doo doo.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Little ambient Philip Glass shit that they would play in the background.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
I love Philip Glass.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
He would just like spin the globe, spin the globe, spin the globe, spin the globe.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And then like, Ooh, what's the weather going to be like here?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
Stop.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
No way.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
He's fucking Austria.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
All right.

35:42.000 --> 35:49.000
Anyway, but, but, but, but, but there's also hell and there's um, the crap else I was thinking

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
of.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Um, there's a cool California.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.000
There's weed California.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
That's right.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
They, they make a killing off shirts.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Yes, they do merchandise.

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
I went to weed and all I got was this shirt.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
All right.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
So what do you mean to derail what you were saying?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
Was there anything?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
No, no, that, that's pretty much it.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.480
I mean, it's just kind of sucks that they're, you know, shutting down the online, but they've

36:10.480 --> 36:13.720
already kind of written that console off and to be honest, there's not really any games

36:13.720 --> 36:15.160
coming out for it anymore.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.400
There's some of these really small third party guys.

36:17.400 --> 36:23.000
They're still releasing things, but no major companies supporting that system anymore.

36:23.000 --> 36:30.000
Ironically, same with the Wii U, but you know, Hey, uh, I don't know.

36:30.000 --> 36:36.000
It's, I don't, if they're thinking that turning off online is going to get people to, you

36:36.000 --> 36:39.000
know, force them into buying a Wii U, then I don't think that's going to happen.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.600
I think if anything, it's just a kind of save some money.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.200
I'm not, I know there's a lot of people that want to shout conspiracy theory and all this

36:45.200 --> 36:46.200
stuff.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.480
I'm not necessarily convinced that's the case.

36:48.480 --> 36:53.120
I kind of think that was already the case when Nintendo started releasing these consoles

36:53.120 --> 36:56.720
because the last two skews of the Wii didn't even have online in it.

36:56.720 --> 36:57.720
Right.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.520
The Wii U friendly mini Wiis or whatever that didn't, that was just the Wii mini and it

37:01.520 --> 37:02.960
didn't even sell that well.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.280
They, they released that very limited and that was it.

37:06.280 --> 37:10.200
Um, I still think the Wii has online.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.680
It's just that doesn't have backwards compatibility at the GameCube anymore.

37:13.680 --> 37:18.400
I think the reality is people aren't playing these games online anymore because they've

37:18.400 --> 37:23.580
all moved on to either Wii U or let's be real PlayStation and Xbox games.

37:23.580 --> 37:27.160
You know, I don't, I just, and I think anybody that's still playing these games probably

37:27.160 --> 37:29.040
is playing them in the same room or whatever.

37:29.040 --> 37:33.600
You know, what's going to sadly happen with a lot of this stuff and I think this might

37:33.600 --> 37:40.920
be the case is, you know, um, there are pretty capable Wii emulators out there that have

37:40.920 --> 37:45.560
online, I think support or for multiplayer or something.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.720
That might be the option is that they do it that way.

37:48.720 --> 37:49.720
Some sort of tunneling.

37:49.720 --> 37:58.400
Um, I had mentioned before like, uh, for the Xbox and Xbox 360, I think PSP and GameCube,

37:58.400 --> 38:04.360
they have options there called tunneling programs and basically it tricks the system into thinking

38:04.360 --> 38:09.340
that it's doing like a system linker land game, but instead it's going over the internet.

38:09.340 --> 38:14.000
And so you kind of peer with other people that way, but it connects via land.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.920
See they, cause they have that with the GameCube, although it wasn't a feature that a lot of

38:16.920 --> 38:22.240
people use, like for example, with Double Dash, but you know, the Wii never had that.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.320
There was no land games on the Wii.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.320
Right.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.640
Um, well, and that's, that's the only bummer of this to me.

38:28.640 --> 38:33.060
I mean, I can accept the fact that really nobody's playing these games online anymore,

38:33.060 --> 38:34.520
so it's time for them to come down.

38:34.520 --> 38:38.000
And if I really wanted to play Mario Kart Wii online, then I probably should have been

38:38.000 --> 38:39.640
doing that the past three years.

38:39.640 --> 38:43.380
I'm sure Nintendo is looking at reports and there's, there's so few people that are playing

38:43.380 --> 38:46.680
these games online, it's not cost effective to keep the servers going.

38:46.680 --> 38:47.760
I get that.

38:47.760 --> 38:52.040
But the part of me that loves classic games, as we talk about a lot here on Orange Launch

38:52.040 --> 38:56.840
Radio, classic gaming, the part of me that loves classic games is a little bit disappointed

38:56.840 --> 39:02.020
that nobody will ever be able to play a game of Mario Kart, I mean, after May, will be

39:02.020 --> 39:07.060
able to play a game of Mario Kart Wii over the internet, at least through any type of

39:07.060 --> 39:08.060
official means.

39:08.060 --> 39:12.240
I mean, you're going to have to hack a system like you're talking about or, or do emulators

39:12.240 --> 39:15.800
or some type of, you know, underground things in order to do that.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.400
That's, that's the only part of it that's a little bit disappointing to me.

39:18.400 --> 39:24.320
I mean, I'll get over that, but that's the only bummer is that, you know, in 10, 15 years

39:24.320 --> 39:28.440
when we want to look back on gaming's history, the way we look back fondly on a lot of our

39:28.440 --> 39:32.960
NES games and, and, you know, Genesis games, Atari games of the past, we're not going to

39:32.960 --> 39:35.960
be able to do that completely with these internet enabled games.

39:35.960 --> 39:40.000
But, I mean, this is, this is a complaint that isn't limited in Nintendo.

39:40.000 --> 39:43.680
It's something, I mean, obviously EA pulls servers down all the time and so on and so

39:43.680 --> 39:44.680
on.

39:44.680 --> 39:45.680
So.

39:45.680 --> 39:46.680
Yeah.

39:46.680 --> 39:52.000
So, uh, yeah, I guess Nintendo's just following the trend in that regard, but, uh, yeah, I

39:52.000 --> 39:57.120
mean, there are some games though on the DS that, you know, haven't really seen any type

39:57.120 --> 39:58.120
of re-imagining.

39:58.120 --> 40:01.120
I know Bobby was talking a lot about clubhouse games tonight.

40:01.120 --> 40:06.640
Um, Allen had brought up, was it Pokemon puzzle league or was it, no, that was a Nintendo

40:06.640 --> 40:11.400
64 game, that puzzle planet puzzle league or same type of thing, but it was on the DS,

40:11.400 --> 40:15.600
you know, those types of games don't really exist on the 3DS, at least yet.

40:16.520 --> 40:20.280
Ooh, Loki, here's a tinfoil hat thought.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.040
Tell me what you think.

40:22.040 --> 40:25.280
Aren't DS games supposed to be coming to the Wii U virtual console?

40:25.280 --> 40:26.280
That is true.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.000
Do you see where I'm going with this?

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Do you think they will have online enabled?

40:31.000 --> 40:40.200
Uh, if, uh, probably, um, if, you know, I don't know, probably, um, but once again with

40:40.200 --> 40:44.480
the DS though, although they don't have a tunneling program available, anything that

40:44.480 --> 40:50.360
can play, you can play locally, should be able to connect over, um, the internet if

40:50.360 --> 40:53.160
someone finishes the tunneling program for that.

40:53.160 --> 40:57.120
But yeah, I see what you're saying is that, you know, maybe they're going to add, uh,

40:57.120 --> 41:00.820
you know, multi- online multiplayer to DS games.

41:00.820 --> 41:04.280
I would like to hope that that's going to be something that they do, although they tend

41:04.280 --> 41:08.680
to go the lazy route with a lot of these things and not add features like that.

41:08.680 --> 41:12.480
They just kind of put the bare minimum, okay, games on, you know, virtual console.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.480
That's it.

41:13.480 --> 41:17.320
Still, it's, it's one of those questions you got to wonder about, and Bobby Blackwolf

41:17.320 --> 41:20.040
and Chad says, I don't think they'll have online enabled because they're shutting off

41:20.040 --> 41:25.440
the servers, but what if, what if they decide to release Metroid Prime Hunters?

41:25.440 --> 41:28.920
I really think they should bring back online for something like that.

41:28.920 --> 41:32.360
Like I, I, you can't sell an emulated copy of the game without really giving you the

41:32.360 --> 41:33.360
full experience, right?

41:33.360 --> 41:38.260
Because, you know, it will have been at that point, what, a good five, six, seven years

41:38.260 --> 41:41.020
since that game originally first came out by the time they released this on virtual

41:41.020 --> 41:42.020
console.

41:42.060 --> 41:45.660
I don't know, just throwing it out there, throwing it out there.

41:45.660 --> 41:50.260
Tigerclaw wants to say, don't worry, Mario Kart 7 has race courses from Mario Kart Wii.

41:50.260 --> 41:53.980
Then soon, Mario Kart 8 will have race courses from the Wii and 3DS version.

41:53.980 --> 41:57.140
Nintendo likes to recycle the old tracks in each iteration.

41:57.140 --> 42:03.580
That is a true point, Tigerclaw, but it is selections, and of course, your favorite track

42:03.580 --> 42:06.060
never seems to make the cut, now does it?

42:06.060 --> 42:09.020
Maybe it does, but for a lot of people, they always go, well, they should have had this

42:09.020 --> 42:10.020
track in the game.

42:10.060 --> 42:12.380
Of course, it would be very interesting if they decide to do DLC.

42:12.380 --> 42:17.820
I mean, think about it, couldn't Mario Kart 8 feasibly have every Mario Kart course ever

42:17.820 --> 42:18.820
made?

42:18.820 --> 42:19.820
They could just do it through DLC?

42:19.820 --> 42:22.460
They won't do that, because they're remaking all the tracks.

42:22.460 --> 42:26.260
Like even they have one from the Game Boy Advance or whatever, and it looks completely

42:26.260 --> 42:29.460
different now, because they've completely changed it up.

42:29.460 --> 42:33.460
So I don't think they're going to go back and remake all the tracks.

42:33.460 --> 42:37.060
The problem, they may have like a DLC pack, but that's it.

42:37.100 --> 42:40.620
Maybe that's even just more characters, they might not even go the route of making more

42:40.620 --> 42:41.620
courses.

42:41.620 --> 42:45.500
Alright, well I'm going to move on to another story here that has to do with Nintendo and

42:45.500 --> 42:48.860
some of the things that they should or they shouldn't be doing.

42:48.860 --> 42:52.580
This is a comment that really spread around the internet this week from Seth Fisher, who's

42:52.580 --> 42:55.500
a big hedge fund manager in Asia.

42:55.500 --> 43:00.900
So he's of the investor sort, and investors haven't been making a lot of great comments

43:00.900 --> 43:05.380
about Nintendo lately, but this one is one of the ones that takes the cake.

43:05.380 --> 43:08.740
Because they say Nintendo has a huge library of casual games, and so they should get to

43:08.740 --> 43:10.820
smartphone and tablet-based gaming, right?

43:10.820 --> 43:12.820
So we've heard this one before, right?

43:12.820 --> 43:13.820
But here's the quote.

43:13.820 --> 43:18.820
Quote, Nintendo needs to embrace this thematic change in consumer demand, behavior, and expectations

43:18.820 --> 43:19.820
to stay relevant.

43:19.820 --> 43:24.700
It is readily apparent that the standard elasticity of demand principle no longer applies in the

43:24.700 --> 43:28.980
consumer entertainment market when access requires the purchase of a physical project.

43:28.980 --> 43:32.380
As the holder of what is arguably the largest library of casual games, Nintendo is well

43:32.380 --> 43:34.540
placed to make an immediate entry into mobile.

43:34.540 --> 43:39.900
Okay, well, that's fine, but then this led into talk about, well, you know, because you

43:39.900 --> 43:45.180
see in Candy Crush Saga, they get billions of dollars, what was it, $1.9 billion in revenue

43:45.180 --> 43:46.740
or whatever it was they made.

43:46.740 --> 43:54.980
What if we just had it where you could pay 99 cents to make Mario jump a little higher?

43:54.980 --> 43:59.740
And like my head exploded hearing that, especially with all this talk of Donkey Kong Country

43:59.740 --> 44:02.900
this week and how insanely difficult it is on the Wii U.

44:02.940 --> 44:05.540
I mean, that's part of the experience.

44:05.540 --> 44:11.460
I mean, Nintendo makes A plus platformers and for a reason and suddenly changing that

44:11.460 --> 44:16.660
formula where, oh, Mario can jump just a little bit higher for 99 cents is really gonna, that's

44:16.660 --> 44:17.660
shitty.

44:17.660 --> 44:19.420
That's somebody who does not get it.

44:19.420 --> 44:20.420
Yeah, right.

44:20.420 --> 44:24.180
Who's not, who does not get the point of having a game.

44:24.180 --> 44:26.860
People like this tend to loop video games.

44:26.860 --> 44:29.740
See, there's a key in here.

44:29.780 --> 44:33.020
He just wants to exploit a market and not make a good product.

44:33.020 --> 44:36.820
Well, the problem is these folks that are tunnel visioned here, which I understand the

44:36.820 --> 44:38.340
goal is to make money.

44:38.340 --> 44:39.340
That's what investment is.

44:39.340 --> 44:40.340
He wants your company to make money.

44:40.340 --> 44:41.340
I get that.

44:41.340 --> 44:46.700
But when we get really tunnel visioned, we, we start to think that, oh, Mario, Candy Crush,

44:46.700 --> 44:48.700
the same thing.

44:48.700 --> 44:54.060
No, not even close.

44:54.060 --> 44:59.380
I mean, for better or worse, at least Nintendo has got way better clout amongst gamers and

44:59.420 --> 45:06.500
there's a certain expectation from a Nintendo product than there is, you know, King.

45:06.500 --> 45:10.740
You have something that's only looking on the money making aspect of it.

45:10.740 --> 45:15.100
You're going to eventually get too many jaded consumers who aren't going to put their investment

45:15.100 --> 45:16.200
in the product.

45:16.200 --> 45:20.700
They want something that's going to be fun, that is a game to enjoy, then they're going

45:20.700 --> 45:22.700
to spend the money on it.

45:22.700 --> 45:27.380
You know, how many of these different clones out there that are just, you know, revenue

45:27.380 --> 45:33.020
monsters really get as successful as some of these little single ones do and then people

45:33.020 --> 45:34.020
forget about it.

45:34.020 --> 45:35.020
Move on to the next one.

45:35.020 --> 45:38.940
I think another thing these investors tend to forget is that Candy Crush Saga is a flash

45:38.940 --> 45:40.440
in the fucking pan.

45:40.440 --> 45:45.500
It's a flash in the pan, just like Farmville and you notice how quickly Zynga went up and

45:45.500 --> 45:46.500
now they fell.

45:46.500 --> 45:50.620
I mean, they're not out of business per se, but Zynga has come down from their peak.

45:50.620 --> 45:54.340
We know that the same, the bubble is going to burst on Candy Crush Saga as well.

45:54.340 --> 45:58.900
In fact, I would argue it's already beginning to burst because of all that negative publicity

45:58.900 --> 45:59.900
they got.

45:59.900 --> 46:03.140
We'll get into that a little later in the show, but my point is that bubble is going

46:03.140 --> 46:04.860
to burst.

46:04.860 --> 46:08.280
Now maybe for an investor, that's not such a bad thing because it's like you're trying

46:08.280 --> 46:09.780
to ride the waves of the ocean.

46:09.780 --> 46:11.220
You try to catch a company, right?

46:11.220 --> 46:14.580
It's going to go up and then you sell, sell, sell, sell, sell right before it's going to

46:14.580 --> 46:15.580
go down.

46:15.580 --> 46:17.140
You get onto the next big flash in the pan.

46:17.140 --> 46:21.660
That's how, you know, a lot of the stock market works, but that's not what we expect.

46:21.660 --> 46:24.020
Nintendo is not a flash in the pan.

46:24.020 --> 46:27.140
I really don't, even if you're the biggest Nintendo critic in the world and you hate

46:27.140 --> 46:31.620
the Wii U, you've got to admit, Nintendo is not a flash in the pan.

46:31.620 --> 46:32.620
There's a certain expectation.

46:32.620 --> 46:35.660
There's a certain expectation you have out of Nintendo and I think that's why people

46:35.660 --> 46:36.900
are disappointed in the Wii U.

46:36.900 --> 46:42.660
Loki, any thoughts before we move on?

46:42.660 --> 46:48.380
This is why, you know, companies tend not to listen to, you know, each investor because

46:48.380 --> 46:51.660
you put money down in the company and all of a sudden you think that you run it.

46:51.660 --> 46:53.780
I mean, it's just, I don't know.

46:53.780 --> 46:55.260
I think it's, it's a dumb idea.

46:55.260 --> 46:57.660
They already own the handheld console market.

46:57.660 --> 47:00.220
I don't think that they need to really change what they're doing.

47:00.220 --> 47:01.220
All right.

47:01.220 --> 47:02.220
Fair enough.

47:02.220 --> 47:04.540
Let's move on to something else besides Nintendo.

47:04.540 --> 47:05.540
Dark Soccer.

47:05.540 --> 47:07.540
What do you have for us?

47:07.540 --> 47:12.420
Well, um, the, uh, we've brought this up before about Steam, uh, starting their, uh, family

47:12.420 --> 47:17.900
op, the Steam Family Sharing and, uh, well, it's now out of beta.

47:17.900 --> 47:18.900
It's official.

47:18.900 --> 47:19.900
You can do the Steam Family Sharing.

47:19.900 --> 47:25.980
So basically, it lets for, uh, anyone who, you know, is family or trusted friend or something

47:25.980 --> 47:33.700
like that, that has, uh, access to the different games, um, be it PC, be it Mac or Linux, um,

47:33.700 --> 47:39.700
via Steam, they can share their libraries with each other, um, and so they can basically

47:39.700 --> 47:43.820
share their progress over the Steam Cloud, which, I mean, like for me and Dan, we have

47:43.820 --> 47:44.820
a few overlapping games.

47:44.820 --> 47:47.820
This would actually be great because then we can, you know, share our games with each

47:47.820 --> 47:52.420
other, um, instead of each of us both having to buy five different versions of Strider

47:52.420 --> 47:56.740
like we did, and I haven't played it yet, um, but it's pretty neat.

47:56.740 --> 48:00.340
I mean, they've got all the details on it on their website, and I'm thinking that he

48:00.340 --> 48:02.940
and I should give it a try this week.

48:02.940 --> 48:06.500
Something really fascinating about this feature that I find, and maybe this is just my own

48:06.500 --> 48:12.260
experiences, but it's, it's horrifically underused, like, I, I, I've been in the beta for a while,

48:12.260 --> 48:14.780
and I was even telling friends of mine, like, yeah, you want to check out that game?

48:14.780 --> 48:18.460
Because I, I'll get the Steam thing set up on your computer at some point, but they never,

48:18.460 --> 48:19.460
we never do it.

48:19.460 --> 48:22.620
Like, they never really want to play it that bad enough, and even Alan and I are still

48:22.620 --> 48:26.300
buying, like, two copies of the same game, maybe not as bad as we used to, but, like,

48:26.300 --> 48:28.020
you know, he has access to my Steam library.

48:28.020 --> 48:31.620
I don't think he really uses it, like, and not, you know, I'm just saying, I think it's

48:31.620 --> 48:33.300
an underused feature right now.

48:33.300 --> 48:37.340
It's really weird because I think there was that perception out there that, oh, people

48:37.340 --> 48:41.420
are gonna share their library with 10 different people, and, you know, that's why Steam has

48:41.420 --> 48:45.420
to lock them out, but, like, that, at least in my experience, that isn't happening.

48:45.420 --> 48:49.460
I have, like, offered up my library, and no, I'm not gonna give it to any random listener,

48:49.460 --> 48:52.300
but trusted friends of mine that kind of don't seem to care.

48:52.300 --> 48:56.700
It's because we all have 200-some games that we haven't played yet.

48:56.700 --> 48:59.340
And maybe that's, maybe that's really it, Loki.

48:59.340 --> 49:01.620
I wouldn't doubt that that's an issue.

49:01.620 --> 49:06.580
Well, I'm, I'm just gonna enable mine for Dan anyway, you know, because he, I've had

49:06.580 --> 49:10.060
some games that I've told him to check out, and he just said, oh, well, I don't want to

49:10.060 --> 49:13.780
buy it, so now you can check him out.

49:13.780 --> 49:18.020
Yeah, and, and, and Alan and I really need to set a rule, quote-unquote, that we don't

49:18.020 --> 49:20.020
buy two of the same game anymore with this.

49:20.020 --> 49:22.180
Unless you've got multiplayer and you both want to play together.

49:22.180 --> 49:23.180
Yeah, exactly.

49:23.180 --> 49:24.180
Exactly.

49:24.180 --> 49:26.300
Something like that the case, or whatever, but, you know.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.300
Yeah.

49:27.300 --> 49:31.940
But, I mean, it's, it's still, regardless of how utilized it's gonna be, I still think

49:31.940 --> 49:34.340
it's a good, it's a good thing to have.

49:34.340 --> 49:42.780
It gives more value to individual purchases, and it will make, um, honestly, I think it

49:42.780 --> 49:48.460
might alleviate the need to have so many consistent sales, at least for big titles.

49:48.460 --> 49:52.560
It make it, uh, you get, you get more value out of the game, so the bigger titles will

49:52.560 --> 49:54.860
sell while they're still closer to full price.

49:54.860 --> 49:56.980
All right.

49:56.980 --> 50:00.900
I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask the chatters about this in a minute, but I'll move on, because

50:00.900 --> 50:04.300
I know we have more Steam news, and I want to come back and ask the chatters a question.

50:04.300 --> 50:06.460
So let's go to Loki.

50:06.460 --> 50:11.100
So I'm surprised that this wasn't a thing in the first place, but apparently there was

50:11.100 --> 50:17.640
a big elaborate process in order to, you know, put your titles on sale if you were someone

50:17.640 --> 50:20.580
selling a game on Steam.

50:20.580 --> 50:26.260
Well now they have some sort of modifications to that with the new Steam Work tools that

50:26.260 --> 50:32.260
allows you to configure discounts for custom sale periods, or opt-in to take part in an

50:32.260 --> 50:34.900
upcoming week-long sale.

50:34.900 --> 50:39.980
And you can also configure when the discounts will start, or if they start at a specific

50:39.980 --> 50:43.500
time, or how long to run, and that kind of thing.

50:43.500 --> 50:48.800
That seems like something that should have been there in the first place, but now I like

50:48.800 --> 50:54.080
the idea of it because now it gets people, you know, on Steam checking it, you know,

50:54.080 --> 50:59.460
all the time instead of just waiting for, you know, a holiday sale or something.

50:59.660 --> 51:04.220
Yeah, I kind of thought this was already a thing, like, I kind of didn't realize that

51:04.220 --> 51:07.860
publishers didn't really have control over that, although it does seem like every sale

51:07.860 --> 51:10.120
that we see on Steam is very timed.

51:10.120 --> 51:14.780
Like there's always the week sale, the weekend sale, the holiday sales, you know, and so

51:14.780 --> 51:15.780
on and so on.

51:15.780 --> 51:18.780
There's not really, like, random sales, and that's what you're going to start seeing now,

51:18.780 --> 51:19.780
right?

51:19.780 --> 51:20.780
I guess, yeah.

51:20.780 --> 51:25.020
So, I don't know, that was just kind of interesting.

51:25.580 --> 51:30.420
Hold on, before you get to the next Steam story, I've got one thing here I want to ask

51:30.420 --> 51:35.380
our folks, and I'm actually going to make this a live poll, because, you know, I love

51:35.380 --> 51:36.380
my live polls.

51:36.380 --> 51:41.540
So, we're going to ask the audience over at live.vognetwork.com a question right now,

51:41.540 --> 51:43.660
and that question is quite simple.

51:43.660 --> 51:46.700
Have you used Steam Family Sharing?

51:46.700 --> 51:50.180
And I try to really limit the number of answers here because I want a clear picture.

51:50.180 --> 51:52.380
Yes, I use it regularly.

51:52.460 --> 51:54.140
I used it once.

51:54.140 --> 51:55.140
Or nope.

51:55.140 --> 51:59.500
Answer now, live listeners, you've got to be logged in over at live.vognetwork.com and

51:59.500 --> 52:01.220
it'll show up at the bottom of the screen.

52:01.220 --> 52:05.980
I'm only going to leave this open for a couple minutes, so hurry up and vote over at live.vognetwork.com.

52:07.980 --> 52:09.980
Loki, back to you.

52:09.980 --> 52:17.500
Alright, and then the other thing is, finally, the Steam music is going into beta, and so

52:17.500 --> 52:23.820
they've, I guess, put out the first round of invites, and I guess for a limited time

52:23.820 --> 52:32.780
you'll be able to stream some MP3s, I guess, currently only MP3s, and then later they're

52:32.780 --> 52:40.780
going to add more formats, and I guess users can purchase game soundtracks or other things

52:40.780 --> 52:41.780
like that.

52:41.780 --> 52:42.780
So that's kind of neat.

52:42.780 --> 52:49.100
I guess you're going to start selling music as well, and then allow you to, you know,

52:49.100 --> 52:50.100
I don't know.

52:50.100 --> 52:54.860
For me, I don't think this would be a big, like, something I would want to use just because,

52:54.860 --> 53:00.420
you know, I'm playing on PC, I can just play music in the background.

53:00.420 --> 53:04.180
But I guess with this being tied in, you know, it would like maybe shut off the music in

53:04.180 --> 53:06.900
the game or something to that effect.

53:06.900 --> 53:07.900
I don't know.

53:07.900 --> 53:14.660
I just don't know what the advantage would be going this route versus, you know, just

53:14.660 --> 53:19.740
playing music on my computer.

53:19.740 --> 53:22.180
Is it something maybe for the Steam Box?

53:22.180 --> 53:23.940
Like kind of like a long-term vision type of thing?

53:23.940 --> 53:31.620
Well, it is something that's limited to SteamOS and big picture mode, but I don't know.

53:31.620 --> 53:37.000
Apparently they're going to have an interface also that's going to be for just the regular

53:37.000 --> 53:42.360
desktop version, but right now it's just for those two versions, so.

53:42.360 --> 53:43.360
I don't know.

53:43.360 --> 53:48.200
Once again, you know, not a feature I even really use on consoles either, so.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.200
I don't know.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.200
I don't know what the big deal is.

53:50.200 --> 53:53.680
I guess it's just, you know, it allows them to sell more things.

53:53.680 --> 53:55.840
Jason in our chat has a perspective.

53:55.840 --> 54:00.000
Our buddy VXJ6V says, Steam music exists for one reason.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.700
Valve needed a player in SteamOS.

54:02.700 --> 54:07.260
Steam music as it stands is kind of bunk, in my opinion.

54:07.260 --> 54:08.260
I guess that makes sense.

54:08.260 --> 54:13.700
Yeah, I mean, when these Steam Boxes come out, my assumption is they need to be able

54:13.700 --> 54:16.900
to play media as a part of it, right?

54:16.900 --> 54:22.540
Because a lot of people razz the fact that the PS4 won't play an audio CD, I think.

54:22.540 --> 54:23.540
So.

54:23.540 --> 54:24.540
Anyhow.

54:24.540 --> 54:30.180
All right, we'll do one more story and then we'll go to the results of the poll here.

54:30.180 --> 54:32.600
So we've been talking about Steam.

54:32.600 --> 54:36.560
Let's talk about sharing of a different nature because some big news came out this week about

54:36.560 --> 54:40.200
Twitch TV and how they're going to integrate with the Xbox One.

54:40.200 --> 54:43.160
Now, a lot of folks have been anticipating when this is going to happen, when this is

54:43.160 --> 54:48.200
going to happen, and some folks thinking that Microsoft may wait until E3, but it looks

54:48.200 --> 54:50.560
like we are going to get it a little bit sooner.

54:50.560 --> 54:55.520
We're going to get Twitch streaming on the Xbox One on March 11th, and this is kind of

54:55.520 --> 55:00.120
timed a little bit key because that is when Titanfall is supposed to come out.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.120
So make no mistake.

55:01.160 --> 55:04.600
I'm sure the rush was, hey, if we can get this enabled in time for Titanfall, that'll

55:04.600 --> 55:09.840
be a lot of free publicity for that game through the Xbox One Twitch integration.

55:09.840 --> 55:11.360
So they are working on that.

55:11.360 --> 55:17.560
Now, the nice thing about Twitch on the Xbox One versus the PlayStation 4, on the PlayStation

55:17.560 --> 55:19.880
4, those cameras are still impossible to find.

55:19.880 --> 55:20.880
Let me tell you.

55:20.880 --> 55:22.460
I don't know what the hell's going on there.

55:22.460 --> 55:25.700
I thought after the Japanese launch it might get easier, but no, it seems like they stopped

55:25.700 --> 55:27.280
making them or something.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.240
But with the Xbox One, that ain't going to be an issue because everybody's got a camera

55:30.240 --> 55:31.240
in their house.

55:31.240 --> 55:35.240
Also, it seems like they've kind of taken the Twitch integration to the next level than

55:35.240 --> 55:38.560
what you see on PlayStation 4 because you're going to have that chat room on the side that

55:38.560 --> 55:43.040
looks a little more like it does on Twitch TV where you have the emote icons, the different

55:43.040 --> 55:45.120
colors by people's names.

55:45.120 --> 55:49.120
I don't know if this is to maybe enable some of the subscription things where subscribed

55:49.120 --> 55:53.320
users get their own emote icons or what, but there's that.

55:53.320 --> 55:58.320
The CEO of Twitch, Emmet Shear, told the Associated Press, it is a complete integration.

55:58.320 --> 56:01.260
It's exciting because we've never had the ability to broadcast from a console like this

56:01.260 --> 56:03.440
with such a deep level of integration.

56:03.440 --> 56:08.000
The concept of being able to join a broadcaster's party is really cool, and it's another step

56:08.000 --> 56:13.920
in the direction of interacting more closely with broadcasters.

56:13.920 --> 56:18.720
No word yet if PlayStation 4's version will be patched or updated to try and compete with

56:18.720 --> 56:19.720
this a little bit.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.640
We will see.

56:22.640 --> 56:27.480
There will also be, and this is kind of a big deal, they're also going to be able to

56:27.480 --> 56:31.040
archive the streams on the Xbox One, which is something you can do with Twitch on the

56:31.040 --> 56:32.040
PC.

56:32.040 --> 56:37.280
For whatever reason, PlayStation 4 streaming will not archive broadcasts right now, and

56:37.280 --> 56:41.740
when pressed for comments, Sony wouldn't make a comment on if this is going to change.

56:41.740 --> 56:44.880
I sort of think they're going to have to be pressured into it, but my thought was, I thought

56:44.880 --> 56:49.440
that was all on Twitch's side, but maybe there's something where Sony's providing some of the

56:49.440 --> 56:50.440
oomph?

56:50.440 --> 56:53.040
I really don't know.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.680
To start streaming to Twitch, apparently all you have to do is say Xbox broadcast, which

56:57.680 --> 57:03.940
I'm sure will open up the Xbox Ones to all sorts of trolling, but we'll see.

57:03.940 --> 57:05.960
So there you go.

57:05.960 --> 57:10.100
I know you don't own an Xbox One Loki, but let's say hypothetically you did.

57:10.100 --> 57:12.080
Would you be excited about this Twitch sharing?

57:12.080 --> 57:13.960
Would you be using this, or?

57:13.960 --> 57:16.420
I don't know if I'd be using it.

57:16.420 --> 57:19.240
Even if I had a PlayStation 4, I don't know if I'd be using it.

57:19.240 --> 57:20.240
Maybe.

57:20.240 --> 57:21.240
I don't know.

57:21.240 --> 57:22.240
This is a good time.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.120
I've done a limited streaming on the PlayStation 4.

57:24.120 --> 57:25.280
It works really well.

57:25.280 --> 57:29.560
Like streaming Final Fantasy XIV from my PlayStation 4 is better than the PC, but that just might

57:29.560 --> 57:32.040
be the fact that my PC's five years old as well.

57:32.040 --> 57:37.360
I guess if someone really wants to watch me play games, I mean, sure, why not?

57:37.360 --> 57:41.640
Alright, well before we get to the next story, let's get to the results of the live poll.

57:41.640 --> 57:46.040
We asked our live listeners, have you used Steam Family Sharing?

57:46.040 --> 57:50.160
That was the question, and the three options were, yes, I use it regularly.

57:50.200 --> 57:52.960
I used it once, or nope.

57:52.960 --> 57:54.320
Get this, guys.

57:54.320 --> 57:57.720
Eighty-two percent, no.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.080
Never used it.

57:59.080 --> 58:02.080
Fourteen percent, I used it once.

58:02.080 --> 58:06.680
And only single digits, probably like one or two people saying, yes, I use it regularly.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.040
Fascinating.

58:08.040 --> 58:09.920
So there you go.

58:09.920 --> 58:10.920
Interesting.

58:10.920 --> 58:15.360
So much hype for such a feature that people really don't seem to be using at all.

58:15.360 --> 58:16.360
Very interesting.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.360
Just pointing that out.

58:17.560 --> 58:21.080
Anyhow, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

58:21.080 --> 58:27.000
Well this was actually a big rumor going that Blockbuster had been licensed out, that Dish

58:27.000 --> 58:31.440
Network licensed Blockbuster brand to Crash Entertainment.

58:31.440 --> 58:37.640
This has actually been determined to be incorrect.

58:37.640 --> 58:43.280
The story actually came out, it was a few days ago, and then it was updated to say that

58:43.280 --> 58:47.200
Dish said, no, we haven't done this.

58:47.200 --> 58:51.440
Dish Network and Blockbuster have not entered any sort of licensing agreement.

58:51.440 --> 58:54.400
This is for Blockbuster in the UK, by the way.

58:54.400 --> 59:01.520
And that Crash Entertainment said that it had a claim that it licensed Blockbuster,

59:01.520 --> 59:05.000
and then it looked like it was actually not true either.

59:05.000 --> 59:11.660
However, they said they wanted to open ten new Blockbuster stores in 2014.

59:11.660 --> 59:15.480
It was on their website, and it has been removed from their website.

59:15.480 --> 59:19.440
So no Blockbuster, sorry.

59:19.440 --> 59:22.880
So Blockbuster was going to be a thing, and now it's not a thing anymore.

59:22.880 --> 59:23.880
Yeah.

59:23.880 --> 59:26.960
Subtle would interest some people, you know, in case you wanted to get a, you know...

59:26.960 --> 59:29.240
Aren't there still stores here and there?

59:29.240 --> 59:30.240
No?

59:30.240 --> 59:31.240
No, God, yeah.

59:31.240 --> 59:33.680
I guess I was thinking the one that I used to see over on, I know this is going to be

59:33.680 --> 59:37.160
lost on non-local people, but there was one over on Greenback and Hazel for the longest

59:37.160 --> 59:38.160
time.

59:38.160 --> 59:39.160
No, not anymore.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.160
It's not there anymore, huh?

59:40.160 --> 59:41.160
Yeah, it's closed.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.160
Wow.

59:42.160 --> 59:43.160
That one that was near my house is gone too.

59:43.160 --> 59:47.560
And I mean, we had a friend who was a manager at one, and yeah, they're gone.

59:47.560 --> 59:48.560
Interesting.

59:48.560 --> 59:49.560
I didn't realize they were all gone.

59:49.560 --> 59:51.040
I mean, it makes sense, sadly.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.760
Yeah, that ship sank.

59:52.760 --> 59:56.760
My first minimum wage job was at a video store, not Blockbuster, but a local chain, which

59:56.760 --> 01:00:01.240
is Blockbuster and Hollywood put that chain under that I used to work for.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.000
And then, you know, now it's kind of interesting that Hollywood went under and now Blockbuster

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
went under.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.800
So it's just, that's how technology can really change the commerce in our world.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.800
So interesting.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:16.280
Alrighty, we have some more stories for you guys, but first we're going to travel around

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.760
the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming out in a game store

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.760
near you.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.760
And, Logie?

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.220
Not a whole ton this week.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:28.320
It's pretty much just South Park, The Stick of Truth on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:36.240
Zoo Tycoon, I think, is getting a disc release this week on Xbox One, and they have an XCOM

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.560
Enemy Unknown Complete Edition coming out on PC, kind of a re-release for that.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560
That is it.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.200
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out the releases there.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.080
PlayStation 4 is still laying on their launch lineup.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.840
There's no new games, really, until mid-March, so we've got a few weeks before we start seeing

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.220
more on the PlayStation 4, but as a reminder, it is out in Japan, so they are eating up

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.340
their launch content right now.

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:02.780
On the PlayStation 3, however, a little different because we do have some releases, a lot of

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:04.340
price reductions, actually.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:10.740
Injustice price reduction, Lord of the Rings, War in the North, F.E.A.R. 3, Biohazard 6,

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.520
which of course is Resident Evil 6, lots and lots of price reductions, but we do have some

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.520
new games.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.800
Yaeiba, Ninja Gaiden Z, regular, special Ninja, and special Zombie is all coming out.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:27.500
I do not believe this is the same as, like, this isn't canon Ninja Gaiden series, is it?

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.900
It looks like the art...

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.180
It's a spinoff.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.360
It's like, um, it's done by the guy that did Resident Evil.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:37.740
Because it looks very cel-shaded manga style, so it's not like a part of the main Ninja

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:42.300
Gaiden series, it's like a spinoff, cartoony, ultra-violent, it looks like blood everywhere

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:46.580
from these pictures, and there's one picture where, I'm assuming this is Ryu or some type

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:51.540
of relative, it's basically holding a decapitated cyborg head, yet there's red blood everywhere

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:52.540
anyway.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.540
Anyway.

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.540
Hey Rob, it's oil, it's machine oil.

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.980
Oh, of course, of course, of course.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.980
Sure.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:02.220
For those of you guys that like to slash Zombie's Ninja Gaiden style, there you go, that is

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.980
in Japan this week on March the 6th.

01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:09.440
Over on the Xbox 360, same thing, Yaeiba, Ninja Gaiden Z seems to be the big release

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.460
this week, but Biohazard 6 also getting a price reduction there if you missed that for

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:14.520
whatever reason.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:18.680
On the PlayStation Vita, Luminous Electronic Symphony gets a price reduction, that of course

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.180
was one of the launch titles.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:25.180
There's some new SKU coming out, the new slim model welcome box, I'm not sure what all that

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.180
entails.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.380
I'm assuming it must have some different pack-in games, but that is something that is coming

01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:34.660
out in Japan, or that's like a PlayStation Plus, it looks like it comes with God Eater

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:40.100
2, Terraria looks like it's in there, I'm trying to look for this really tiny box art,

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:44.380
some type of baseball, one of the baseball simulators, it's just basically, you know,

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.580
do they have PlayStation Plus in Japan, like we have it here, where they give all the free

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.580
games?

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:50.300
Yeah, I think they have it in Japan.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:55.420
I bet that's part of it, but anyhow, if you've been sitting on a Vita and you're waiting

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.460
for some extra games, there you go.

01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:58.460
Waiting for it to hatch?

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.460
I guess.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:00.460
Sitting on a Vita?

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:01.460
You need there to be tons of games out.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.460
There you go.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.580
Soul Sacrifice Delta also out this week in Japan, and let me check out the other handheld

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:13.460
real quick, that would be the 3DS, the 3DS gets Doraemon, Shindobita no Damaekyuu Pekkon

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:20.300
no, or excuse me, Pekkoto 5 Nin no Tankinatai comes out this week, cause you know, you love

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.300
your Doraemon, right?

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.300
Doraemon!

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.220
Doraemon is that, if you didn't know, is that-

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:26.580
It's the little cat with no ears.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.580
Yeah, that blue cat you sometimes see.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:32.100
So Doraemon is so cute.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.760
So he gets a new game there on the 3DS this week.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.380
Also Anpanman Toa- What?

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.620
I want this.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.620
I do not know what this is.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.620
It's Anpanman.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:43.620
No, you don't get it.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.620
It's Anpanman.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:45.620
Oh, excuse me.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:46.620
I don't get it.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.620
Please.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.620
I have a special love of Anpanman.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:49.620
Anpaneducate me, lady.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:55.340
It's a superhero made out of Anpan, which is a delicious, yeasty bread filled with red

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.580
bean paste.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:03.300
I have a stuffed Anpanman in my art studio room.

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.580
Okay, so what the hell is this game then?

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:06.580
I don't see screenshots.

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:07.580
He's a superhero.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:08.580
He's holding a pencil.

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.580
Does he draw?

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.580
I don't know what this one is.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:15.100
I don't care cause it's Anpanman and I want it, but I don't have a Japanese 3DS.

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:18.380
And the 3DS is region lonk to womp womp.

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.380
Yeah.

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380
No, I love Anpanman.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:22.380
He's so cute.

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:23.380
All right.

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:24.380
Well, there you go.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:25.380
Those are your Japanese releases.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:31.860
So I guess Dark Saga is going to try to convince Akuma JP to come over.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.860
Let me see your 3DS.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.300
I like a 3DS and some Anpanman.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:40.220
To be perfectly honest, we actually have a good place in Sacramento that makes fantastic

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.220
Anpan.

01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:47.620
And then they also make little chocolate choco-pan in the shape of Anpanman's face, which I

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.620
think is even more hilarious because they should actually make the Anpan in the shape

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:54.260
of Anpanman's face, but nevermind.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.860
Meanwhile in the UK, Dark Sagra.

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:57.260
Oh yeah, some stuff.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:01.780
On the 5th, we have Dead Nation Apocalypse Edition for PS4.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:07.260
And then on the 7th is Atelier, Escha, and Loggie.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.600
South Park, The Stick of Truth on Damned Near Everything Else, and The Dead Rising Collection

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.460
on Xbox 360.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.460
And that's it.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.460
All right.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.580
All right, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.580
the week.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.580
Logie.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:27.260
So, real quick, King, the company behind Candy Crush Saga, they've withdrawn their trademark

01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:31.040
application for candy in the US.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.900
They do have Saga, though.

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:34.900
That is all.

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:35.900
They suck.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:40.580
So in other words, that bad publicity with the whole candy swipe thing really did them

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:41.580
in?

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.180
Because I kind of think that's what it was, but...

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.180
Yeah, pretty much.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.940
Well, is this a good thing or a bad thing?

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:50.980
I think it's kind of a loaded question.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:55.300
I don't see how you could say it's a bad thing, but humor me here.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.820
Is this a good thing or a bad thing that they lost that trademark over candy?

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:05.220
I think it's a no one gives a shit anymore because they suck.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:06.220
I guess that's fair enough.

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:09.220
The king is dead.

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:10.220
Long live the king?

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.220
No, no, wait, that's not how it works.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.540
No, no, long live the queen.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.900
Why wouldn't you dare?

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:18.900
No.

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:19.900
No.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.900
They just need to go away.

01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:21.900
Okay.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:22.900
Fair enough.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:23.900
All right.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:24.900
Moving on.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:25.900
One more story for you guys.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.140
Actually, it's a couple of stories because it's updates.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:31.500
We've been talking about Nintendo systems a little bit tonight, and there are some updates

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.940
to consider when it comes to the Wii U and the 3DS.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:36.700
A new update for the Wii U went out this week.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.700
It's version 4.0.3.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:44.260
Not a whole lot of features, but they do say overall system stability, minor adjustments

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:47.700
to enhance the user experience.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700
That's it.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:52.060
No word on was it maybe trying to patch out some type of exploit.

01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:54.260
I can't remember if we had an exploit article on the Wii U recently.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:59.300
I feel like we did or what they're really trying to do with this, but that is out now.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:00.300
Check that out, I guess.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.820
Otherwise, on the 3DS, same deal.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:10.060
Improvements to overall system stability and those same adjustments, so it's very curious

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.660
what they could really be trying to do there unless they're prepping for something coming

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.660
in the future, maybe to deliver these virtual console games or who knows, but a lot going

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:18.660
on behind the scenes.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:23.060
Of course, the last big upgrade we got on the 3DS bridged the gap between the two, so

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:28.140
maybe these firmware updates are to really fix all this with the homogenization of the

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:33.340
Nintendo network IDs, and then Miiverse came to the 3DS in the last patch as well, so these

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.660
seem to be tweaks to probably get the two to play nicely.

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.380
It sounds likely.

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.900
Although I didn't notice a problem, but you know, I'm sure somebody figured out a way

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:44.900
to do that.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.900
There's always problems.

01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:46.900
People can fix that.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900
Yeah.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:48.900
All right.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:55.380
Well, it is about that time where we go down a trip of memory lane, and there was a time

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.260
back in the day you didn't get firmware upgrades to your system.

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.580
When things broke, you blew on the cartridge and prayed.

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:02.740
That was a firmware update.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:06.440
It's the classic game of the week.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.680
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:15.240
you kids, you totally ignored this flipping game, now go play it.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.400
Put down your freaking Call of Duty games and go play a real classic.

01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:22.520
Dark Soccer is the classic game of the week.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:31.440
The game is Rad Racer, which came out in Japan as Highway Star, and it was done by Square

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.160
for the Famicom in 1987.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:41.200
And you drive a Ferrari 328 or an F1 racing machine through a different race course.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:47.440
And the music for this game was done by Uematsu, so tune up a little bit.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:55.440
It's just not familiar also to people who've been struck by anything else.

01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.440
It's not familiar?

01:08:56.440 --> 01:08:57.440
Anyway.

01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.880
I did not realize those two tied together.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:00.880
Really?

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:05.000
The 20XD6 thing when he does the anime thing, and he picks the Rad Racer theme as his ending

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.120
song for his little Strong Bad anime.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.600
It's been so long.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600
20XD6.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600
Oh my gosh.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:13.680
Hey, Stickley Man, what are you doing?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.080
Hey, Strong Bad, I want to be the guy.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080
No.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:25.920
Anyway, so basically, you just go through driving the game, kind of pole position-like.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:31.920
You can get side swipes, you can crash into stuff, and you can actually crash by hitting

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.600
other cars too at higher levels.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.920
And you also can have your time run out.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:43.760
So basically, it's just still going through, just trying to get from one end of the course

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760
to the other.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:50.680
And in Japan, it had a 3D mode that you could use the 3D glasses that came out over there.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:58.160
And also, Square had used that same type of 3D technology with 3D World Runner.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:05.560
And so, the F1 car, by the way, is supposed to look like the Lotus 99T Formula 1 car,

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:11.320
but everyone plays the Ferrari, I mean, hello.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:16.720
So yeah, this was, I mean, pretty much one of the most popular racing games by the time

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720
it came out.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.720
There's been other ones that's been out since.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:25.680
It was also designed by Sakaguchi, I'm just saying, yeah.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.920
It was also, you know, with...

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:32.000
I didn't realize how much ties to Final Fantasy this game had, but I guess it makes sense.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Yep.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.240
Well, let's see, like I said, this was one of the few titles that used the Famicom 3D

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.240
system that had the glasses.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:48.240
And this was actually the game that, at the time, the Square owner, who was Masafumi Miyamoto,

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:55.960
used to demonstrate how the 3D programming that was done by Nasser Gabelli, who was the

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.080
programmer for the game.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:04.840
And there was a North American exclusive sequel, Rad Racer 2, that had...

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.720
It wasn't really as good as the first Rad Racer, I mean, there's really only one Rad

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.720
Racer.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.720
Which, I actually like the Japanese name better, because Highway Star, you know, there was

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:17.240
the song Highway Star, and anyway.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:23.680
This was ranked number 8 on Nintendo Power's Top 30 poll.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.600
It's just one of the better racing games that's been out.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.700
Like I said, Rad Racer 2, it came out in 1990, it was kind of crap.

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:34.000
It played a lot the same, but it really was not as good.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.240
It had like a different preview indicator and a turbo boost, no, not good.

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.780
So yeah, now the 3D that came out in this game, as I mentioned in another one, it was

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:50.800
used by 3D Worldrunner, but 3D Worldrunner was not as great of a sale as a seller, and

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.960
so this is actually what led up to Final Fantasy coming out, done by, you know, again, we had

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.520
Sakaguchi and Uematsu behind this.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.400
So it was their final attempt, right?

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.360
There was a scene also from this movie that showed up in The Wizard, and that was a scene

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:11.840
where Lucas uses the Power Glove to play through the first stage of the game.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.760
Did you ever actually get to play these games with the 3D glasses?

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:19.640
Because I don't know how many of you got to actually experience these games with 3D glasses,

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.640
but I actually, a friend of mine had Rad Racer with the 3D glasses, so I remember playing

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.680
it, and I gotta say, the 3D in Rad Racer actually wasn't very good.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.080
I mean, the game, it kind of doesn't lend itself very well to 3D, which I know sounds

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.760
weird because it's a racing game, but you already kind of have that perspective.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.040
Now, 3D Worldrunner, on the other hand, which hopefully you'll cover in another week, because

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:42.120
that was a pretty fun game, the 3D in that game was much better, I thought.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.680
That's just, that's my personal opinion.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:52.680
Well, just a little bit more about this too.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:56.240
And I like what the article says, that using the Power Glove to play the game was actually

01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.320
considered a feat because of how unreliable the Power Glove was.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:07.320
And Rad Racer is Uematsu's 11th work in video game music composition, and that song was

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:14.560
used with vocals for Stinkoman, which was the anime parody that Strong Bad did for Homestar

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560
Runner.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.520
It was a Strong Bad email.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:23.480
And then there was actually a song released by a group called Workdrugs, a selectropop

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:27.840
group called Rad Racer, and it has footage from Rad Racer 2 used in it.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.240
So there we go, Rad Racer.

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:33.720
You know, I'll thank Dan for this one because I had forgotten about it.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.920
Not forgotten about it, but just like, I thought I had done it, and every time he suggested

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.920
it, I was like, oh, I've done Rad Racer, I've done Rad Racer.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.080
No, I haven't done Rad Racer, now I have, so he can hush.

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.080
There it is.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.040
It is rad, it's so rad.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:50.080
Your classic video game of the week, Rad Racer.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:56.520
But the 3D, totally overrated in this game, that was one thing that, no, it sounds a lot

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:59.000
cooler than it really was in execution, just saying.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.200
Hey, Stinkoman, I hear you're the guy, but I want to be the guy too.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.200
Uh, okay.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.800
No way, you're just a kid.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.320
How old is Strong Bad, aren't those things like 10 years old now at this point?

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.320
Something like that.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.320
So sad.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.680
I can't believe I still, actually I'll tell you how I remember it because I just watched

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.680
it before.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.840
Which I'm not, I'm not knocking, that shit was hilarious and like, you know, to find

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.280
the internet a few years ago, but it's kind of sad.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.480
I was raised by a cup of coffee.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:32.120
Remember the Homestar Runner game that was out on, like it was on the Wii and I think

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:33.120
PC?

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.120
Yeah.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.000
It's the same company that brought us The Walking Dead years later.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Yeah.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Funny, funny, funny.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.320
All right, anyhow, we are going to take a break guys, when we come back there is plenty

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.120
more show to come, including your live phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype,

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.280
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:53.400
Also some more stories coming up in part B, including some surprise layoffs.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.920
That's never any fun news to talk about, but you know, we got to talk about that because

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.180
it was, it was a real shocker.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:03.480
In better news, we'll talk about, how about a big media expansion for a free to play game?

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.000
I think that's a little bit happier news.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.200
We'll talk about that when Orange Auditorino comes back right after this.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:22.040
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on March the 2nd of 2014 with the 542nd

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:28.280
episode of our program and lots of fun stuff in part A. We had a really kind of Nintendo

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:32.040
heavy first half of the show, but it seemed like they had a lot of news going on and some

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.360
updates on Steam as well with a fun live poll and so forth.

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:39.720
If you're just joining us because you gave up on that award show that's on TV, maybe

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:44.560
you're pissed off that Miyazaki did not win best animated film as some people on my Facebook

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.280
friends list seemed to be, but I kind of, kind of, usually those Disney movies tend

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.280
to win everything, right?

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.720
Frozen won of course and no surprise there, but you know, sure there's a lot of nerds

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.200
little pissed off that Miyazaki didn't win, although I do want to see his movie.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.520
I don't get out to see a lot of movies, but all the stuff they put out of his is really

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.520
good.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.520
So I want to go out and see that.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.520
So we'll see.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:07.840
Anyway, we are going to get into some rapid fire news and of course your calls a little

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:12.080
later in the program as well as your emails to our new mailbag over at participate at

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.080
orangelawnsradio.com.

01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:18.240
We'll get to the very first email in our new mailbag in just a little bit and joining us

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.240
over the Skyfline, Loki.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240
Sorry.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240
It's okay.

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:23.240
Background noise.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.240
If you guys hear random background noise, that's what's going on.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.600
Loki won't be on Skype forever.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.520
He will come back to the studio soon, probably around the time we move, but obviously baby

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.200
and family take priority.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:40.000
So we are having him, having him work from home and he's going to work with some rapid

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.480
fire news right now.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.560
Yes, I am.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.560
So March PlayStation Plus, they have some more free stuff, of course, for instant game

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.520
collection, including Tomb Raider.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.520
So that's pretty cool.

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:57.320
And then a lot of other PlayStation Network games included with that.

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:02.480
Thomas Was Alone, Lone Survivor, The Director's Cut, and that's on PlayStation 3.

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.880
Vita is getting Unit 13 and Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:13.600
And then also, I guess, they're operating some sales, I guess, on Hotline, Miami Escape

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:19.800
Plan, Flower, Killzone, Mercenary Tales, Mozilla, Dragon's Crown, and Ni No Kuni, as well as

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:20.960
other things.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.840
No PlayStation 4 stuff, though.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.040
I am sorry, Dead Nation Apocalypse Edition is going to be PlayStation 4.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.440
I almost missed that there.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.960
Yay, two zombie games back to back.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.680
There you go, yeah.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:41.560
Atlus has confirmed four new Persona games for North America.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.880
So that's kind of cool.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.760
They're going to be getting, let's see, I wonder if those are the same ones that they

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.480
announced not too long ago.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.240
Persona Q Shadow Labyrinth for 3DS, which is supposed to be Fall 2014.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:01.440
Persona 4 Arena Ultimax, which is going to be, I guess, a re-release of Persona 4 Arena

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:05.840
that's enhanced, that's going to be coming out in 2014 as well, towards the end of the

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840
year.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:12.540
2015, they've got Persona 4 Dancing All Night, which I guess is a music game.

01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:19.160
And Persona 5, which would be coming sometime into PlayStation 3 in 2015.

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:25.040
Also not to be left out, Xbox, the games with gold, are going to be getting two games

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:30.280
for the month of March, starting off with Civ Revolution.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:36.040
So that's going to be pretty cool, and Dungeon Defenders, which is the Xbox Live Arcade game.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:40.040
Civilization Revolution is going to be free through March 16th, and of course, Dungeon

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.560
Defenders is going to be after that for the remainder of the month.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:48.280
So Rob, Civ Rev, is that a good one to start off with, because I actually haven't played

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.640
any Civ games at all.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.520
I think Civ Rev is a great one to start out with.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.000
I know some people had its issues with it because of the way it translates to controller

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.560
play, but to me, Civilization Revolution has a lot in common with the very, very first

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:02.840
Civilization game, which is still one of my favorites.

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.600
I think a dumbed down, using my quoting fingers, a dumbed down Civilization game is not necessarily

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.960
a bad thing.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:13.020
It kind of gets you, you know, kind of into the series and what it's all about.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:17.400
And if you like it, then you can step up and play, you know, Civ 4, Civ 5, or one of the

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.000
newer ones, which Civ 5 is still great.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.360
If you didn't grab it during that Sid Meier Humble Bundle, though, I don't know what to

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.120
tell you, because that was your chance and you blew it, if you didn't get the Sid Meier

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.120
Bundle.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.120
I did not.

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.120
Well, you blew it.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.120
That's alright.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.120
It'll be on sale.

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.960
The only one I wanted to play was Civ 5, out of the whole bunch.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:40.600
So I didn't really feel the need to spend more than $10 on it.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.720
I understand, I understand.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:48.160
And last but not least, you had another game getting Zombie DLC, but this one's a little

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.160
strange.

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.640
Warehouse and Logistics Simulator.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.940
It's a sim game.

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:54.560
It's getting Zombie DLC.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.240
And that's just kind of silly.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:57.440
Wait, that's a real game.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.560
There's a game called Warehouse and Logistics Simulator?

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560
I've never heard of this.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560
Yes, there is.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.960
These are some of the games that are more popular on Steam.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:07.480
You may not realize it, like Farming Sim and stuff like that, just because it's kind of

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480
strange.

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:13.420
Or what about the Euro Truck Driver Simulator 2 or that crazy shit.

01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:16.500
And this is not the only game that I know that's in the Simulator series that's actually

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:17.500
gotten Zombie DLC.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:20.180
If I remember correctly, I want to see one of the Train Sim games.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:27.020
Either it was a mod or DLC that did get Zombie DLC or something for it.

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.020
It was kind of silly.

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:33.500
But yeah, it has you driving through a warehouse in a forklift trying to escape zombies.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.380
I don't know, it's just strange.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:42.900
But I guess you mow down the undead, they say they can get bombs, mines, and other weapons

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:45.140
to help you clear out the zombies.

01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:48.860
Hey, you gotta know your audience, or at least maybe that might get a few more people to

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:54.100
try Warehouse and Logistics Simulator, which, that's gotta be a pretty niche audience right

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.620
there.

01:20:55.620 --> 01:21:01.300
Over at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Hitstun says Euro Truck 2 is great, Honk!

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:02.300
Is that a...

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.340
I'll have to check out the game at some point.

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:07.940
And SSJ100Matt referring, I think, to the background noise, SSJ100Matt wants to know

01:21:07.940 --> 01:21:11.940
what's for dinner, and did you bring enough for the class, Loki?

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.980
That was my wife cooking dinner, so I don't know.

01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:15.980
Alright, fair enough.

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:19.500
Alright, I got some news for you guys, moving on.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:23.740
This was a little bit controversial last week, some talk about Metal Gear Solid V Ground

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:28.380
Zeroes, which again, was supposed to be kind of like that, I don't want to call it like

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:32.300
the starter chapter, but I guess that's really what it is, it was supposed to be a short

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:36.620
kind of Metal Gear Solid game, very short Metal Gear Solid game, that was gonna kind

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:40.500
of tide us over until Phantom Pain was released, and it was only supposed to be a couple hours.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:45.380
Well, they were gonna release the game for $40, however, the physical PlayStation 4 and

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:51.060
Xbox One versions had their price cut this week, down to $30, and in a statement the

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:55.780
company said they wanted to, quote, provide as many people as possible an opportunity

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:58.040
to play the game.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.820
In other words, you guys weren't having that shit.

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:07.220
It's really fascinating how the internet kind of turned the price of that game around, that's

01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:11.880
pretty awesome there, so, well, I mean, I don't know, I say it's awesome, but maybe,

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.780
you know, if the game is to make a profit for Konami, maybe it's not so awesome, I don't

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:16.780
know.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:21.780
But we'll see, a lot of people seem to be happy with the news nonetheless.

01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.860
The 3DS over at Nintendo is gonna be having a promotion that will allow you a free download

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.420
of Pokemon X or Y.

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:35.860
That's right, when you get a new Nintendo 3DS or 3DS XL or even a 2DS system, as well

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:41.940
as one of six select games to a club Nintendo account, you get a free download code for

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.700
Pokemon X or Y.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:48.140
This is only between March 1st and 31st, and the eligible games are Mario Kart 7, Super

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:52.540
Mario 3D Land, Animal Crossing, if you want to experience Ed in your town, just like Dark

01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.540
Soccer did.

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.740
I would not wish that on anyone.

01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.860
Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, Lego City Undercover, and Yoshi's New Island.

01:22:58.860 --> 01:23:03.380
If you get one of those six games and a new 3DS, you tie them to your club Nintendo account,

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:06.820
Nintendo's gonna give you a download code for Pokemon X or Y, and you gotta use it by

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.620
May 31st, 2014.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:15.980
I guess, who isn't a fan of free games, but my thought is, I thought everybody who wanted

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:21.580
Pokemon X or Y, they fucking got their 3DS by now so they could experience this.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:27.300
I guess maybe there's some holdouts, and if you were one of the holdouts, congrats.

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.260
Free game for you.

01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.480
So there you go, that promotion throughout March.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:37.380
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.420
use the passphrase, turkey.

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:43.420
And lastly, from me, new Tony Hawk game.

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.860
When was the last time you heard about us talking about a new Tony Hawk game?

01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.860
It's been a little while.

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.860
Isn't he like 50?

01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:54.100
Probably, hey, you're never too old to skate, I don't know, I gotta know.

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.780
Well they just have the HD one came out.

01:23:56.780 --> 01:24:00.540
Yeah, I thought there was like one not that long ago, but wasn't the beginning of the

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:05.620
end when they put out that like $100 skateboard thing, because they thought since Guitar

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:09.860
Hero worked and people bought that peripheral, people would buy the, yeah, it didn't quite

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:10.860
work out for him.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:17.860
Well, Tony Hawk is returning, but get this, it's a mobile phone game, womp womp.

01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:21.820
Tony Hawk talking to Bloomberg said, we're working on a game for mobile devices this

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:22.820
year.

01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.820
We've never gone exclusively in that direction, so I'm excited because with the amount of

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.460
time people are spending on their phones and their tablets playing games, we've never had

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.620
our own game in that space.

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:32.740
I'm excited to provide one finally.

01:24:32.740 --> 01:24:37.460
Well, that ought to get all two of you who care about that, a Tony Hawk game on your

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:38.460
mobile phone.

01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.580
Look, I'm not shading the Tony Hawk series.

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.220
They were great games, but they're just, they're going to suck on a mobile phone.

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.220
Let's just keep it real.

01:24:43.220 --> 01:24:44.660
It's going to suck.

01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.660
Sorry.

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:47.100
Not in the fun kind of way.

01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.180
That's right.

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:51.260
Well, how about some different gaming news?

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:52.660
How about it?

01:24:53.060 --> 01:25:00.020
Well, there's something coming out about a potential Minecraft movie done by the Lego

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:08.140
movie producer, and I don't know how I feel about that, but Notch basically said that

01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.180
there was a talk going on about it.

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:16.860
They're working with Warner Brothers about a potential Minecraft movie, so whatever.

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:25.100
Also, Retro Studios is saying that the Wii U is a powerhouse and is confirming that they're

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:29.940
developing a game for it, but they haven't really said what exactly, but they're able

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:36.060
to use, they're learning new HD techniques like pixel shading and stuff and things and

01:25:36.060 --> 01:25:38.860
that they loved working with Donkey Kong.

01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:41.380
So maybe that will be cool.

01:25:41.380 --> 01:25:45.020
Now I want to say that the reason why you're on the fence with the whole Minecraft movie

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:51.620
thing is because you probably haven't gone to see the Lego movie yet, which is a travesty.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:52.620
At some point I'll get out.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:53.620
I kind of don't care about the Lego movie.

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:56.020
Weren't we supposed to have a friend date?

01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:00.020
We were, and it just didn't happen because, you know, move and busyness and stuff.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:02.020
Aww, hi kitty.

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:03.020
Sorry.

01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.020
Simbio came out.

01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:06.020
You got distracted by cats?

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.020
Kitty.

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.020
Fair enough.

01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.620
I just heard meh, meh, meh, meh.

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:17.180
And then the Konami code works in Bravely Default.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:23.500
It's basically supposed to work once you've completed the game, but there's a clip about

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.780
what happens.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:30.220
It's online somewhere, so that's kind of cool.

01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:32.900
And for those who don't know, I'm not going to tell you because you should fucking know

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:33.900
this.

01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:34.900
I'm kidding.

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:36.780
It's up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start.

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.780
On the main menu.

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:38.780
No, you should know that.

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:39.780
Don't tell them that.

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:42.420
Unless you're playing Parodius, then you do it backwards.

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:43.420
Okay.

01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:46.320
Or if you're playing, which one was it where you had to use the L, R on top of the Super

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.020
Nintendo controller, it blew up your ship?

01:26:48.020 --> 01:26:49.020
Was that Gradius III maybe?

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020
Maybe Gradius III?

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.020
Yeah.

01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:53.020
Yeah, something like that.

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:54.020
Alright.

01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:59.740
Well, if that's it for our rapid fire news, then we shall take a trip over to Facebook

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:08.180
and Google Plus, so when you slam those words together, you get FUGL.

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:12.620
It's the FUGL question of the week, everybody.

01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:17.700
We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we get answers, your

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.420
answers over on those various sites, and we're going to start off tonight with some of the

01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:28.400
answers from Google Plus to our question, and I got to say, things got a little weird

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:38.420
on Google Plus this week, and I'm seeing people answer who I never see answer, and some of

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:43.220
it was getting a little heated, which I'm kind of not okay with, so just remember, everybody,

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.220
treat each other with respect over on Google Plus, and now for some reason I can't get

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:48.220
the post to come up.

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:49.220
That's not good.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.220
That's a little embarrassing when we're doing live radio.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.220
Where is it?

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.220
There it is.

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:54.220
Phew.

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:58.820
Yeah, see, just to put it out there, we have 16 responses on Google Plus, and I think that's

01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:01.500
more than we have on Facebook.

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:03.760
That's not normal.

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760
Something happened there.

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.760
This is not expected behavior.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.220
This is not expected behavior.

01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:11.860
I don't know what's up with that, but regardless, strangers were jumping in there telling each

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.500
other that opinions were wrong and stuff, and I'm not okay with that.

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.460
This is where every gamer has a voice.

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:18.020
Let them be heard.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.900
Act Def starts us off with a haiku.

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:23.220
Well, I'll read his full response since he took the time to give a haiku as well.

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.220
Oh, I didn't even read the damn question.

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.220
Sorry, guys.

01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:30.980
How do you feel about the news that Nintendo is pulling online support for DS and Wii games

01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:32.100
in a couple months?

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:35.220
Will you misplay Mario Kart Wii online, or do you think it's best that these servers

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:36.940
come down to make way for the future?

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.900
An Act Def over on Google Plus said, well, with these games getting old, it was so little

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:44.940
people playing them, it was only a matter of time for the servers to be shut down, specifically

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:48.500
since Nintendo probably wants to save money rather than lose it right now.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:52.300
It's sad, but I think it's time to move on, people, and here's the haiku.

01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:53.700
Servers are shut down.

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:56.060
New games are coming soon now.

01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:58.500
Nintendo needs cash.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.660
Jake F. replied on Google Plus, and he's a little mad about this situation.

01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:03.660
He's upset.

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.660
Sounds a little upset.

01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:07.460
Jake says, I have no purpose for playing Smash Brothers now.

01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:08.460
Thanks a ton, Nintendo.

01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:09.780
Nintendo, I support you.

01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:11.300
I swim against the current for you.

01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:13.060
I get made fun of because of you.

01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:16.820
I'm among the few to fend you in front of the masses of PlayStation and Microsoft fanboys,

01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:18.540
and this is what I get?

01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:21.180
Guess it really is time for a PlayStation 3.

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:28.020
Okay, overdramatization added by me, but it is Oscar night, everybody, for your consideration.

01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.900
Did you never learn to read?

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:32.500
I'm thinking Jake was playing Smash Bros.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:33.940
We ask, who's still playing online?

01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:36.860
Well, Jake is apparently playing Smash Bros. online.

01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.900
He's a little heated, so there you go.

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:42.540
He might jump ship over to PlayStation 3.

01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:45.700
Redertainment says, online foreign to Big N.

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:48.740
I don't care about Big N's shut down plans.

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:50.060
Yet another haiku answer.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:52.860
I'm loving this, you guys, loving it.

01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.940
Let's see, some other answers here.

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:59.940
Matt D. replied and said, it stinks, but they need the server space for their other newer

01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:00.940
games.

01:30:00.940 --> 01:30:06.340
Maintaining the old ones along with the new ones would cost a ton of money.

01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:11.700
Zordrac Shadowfang, and I'm sure that's his real name, said, it's the price of online

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.540
servers to handle multiplayer.

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.340
Eventually, they get shut down.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:20.940
At least these games otherwise still work offline in both single player and local multiplayer.

01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:25.380
And lastly, AJ Twist replies and said, eh, it's more proof than Nintendo doesn't understand

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.380
online.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:28.220
But maybe something good will come of this?

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:29.220
We'll see.

01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.340
There's some of the answers over from Google Plus.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:35.380
I was not going to read answers from people that were like, you know, thank you for your

01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.980
insightful commentary and just kind of weird stuff.

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.500
So I wonder how that happened.

01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:44.580
Is that because Google Plus like automatically tags things so it went out to a more public

01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:45.580
audience?

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.580
I don't even know.

01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.580
Whatevers.

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:52.780
Moving on to some of our answers over on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:53.780
We had quite a few answers.

01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:57.700
I'm only going to read a handful of these, so I apologize in advance, but I encourage

01:30:57.700 --> 01:31:01.340
you to check out all the answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:06.020
Monty Boggs says, I won't miss them, but it does seem like convenient timing considering

01:31:06.020 --> 01:31:09.000
Mario Kart 8 comes out a week or so after that.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.560
Something we had brought up on the show earlier.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:16.800
Our friend Wicked from the Nerdgasm Network says, the fact that Nintendo is ending their

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.260
online services for Wii and DS isn't surprising.

01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:24.160
Most games and services tend to sever servers after some years, especially when the newest

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.580
iteration releases.

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:29.460
What is surprising is the sudden urgency that's being done.

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:33.420
On May 20th, the 3DS will have been out for three years and the Wii U only a year and

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420
a half.

01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:38.060
I know that seems like a decent grace period, but if the sales numbers are correct, I doubt

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:43.820
the Wii's 101 million owners have all upgraded, given the Wii U's almost 6 million sold.

01:31:43.820 --> 01:31:47.040
I'm not saying they should keep the Wii servers on forever, but I think they should keep them

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:51.300
up a little bit longer, at least until the chasm-like gap has closed up a bit more.

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.780
But you know what's interesting about it, I mean it's not that I disagree with what

01:31:53.780 --> 01:31:57.900
we could say in here, but, and it's kind of a question we ask ourselves in general,

01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:02.660
are these gaming companies under any liability to keep these servers up a certain time?

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:03.660
They're really not.

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:04.660
I don't think so.

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:05.660
We're at their mercy.

01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:08.340
Which, as a consumer, kind of sucks.

01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:11.140
That isn't unexpected.

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:16.020
It's not, but I mean at what point do we say, god damn it, this is what I paid for and it

01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.560
ought to work.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.420
This is what I paid for eight years ago, and it ought to work.

01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:21.420
No?

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:22.420
No.

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:27.720
This mixing board we bought eight years ago, and if it broke tomorrow, I'm not just going

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.540
to be like, oh well, you know, well Radio Shack took it offline.

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:34.140
Well we didn't get it at Radio Shack, we ordered it from the manufacturer.

01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.140
You know what I mean!

01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:37.140
Yeah, I know.

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.140
Anyway.

01:32:38.140 --> 01:32:44.760
Uh, let's see, and uh, let's see, our power in A says, this move was inevitable, I think,

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:46.880
and telling of what's to come for Nintendo.

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.660
Dropping the Wi-Fi connection for the DS and Wii really is the sign that Nintendo is moving

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:55.140
forward and will soon discontinue manufacturing and support for those two systems.

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.140
Who knows?

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:59.500
Maybe this means Nintendo is at least thinking of their next console system?

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.260
Well, Rene, they're definitely thinking about it.

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:05.020
They plan that stuff years and years in advance.

01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:06.800
There's probably already early prototypes.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.900
That's how long these things take to develop, honestly.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:13.060
We had those rumors a couple weeks ago, for better or for worse, about the more homogenized

01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:19.860
Nintendo experience, but again, it's weird to me that they're dropping DS when they're

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:22.420
just gonna bring it out again over on the virtual consoles.

01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:23.420
Little weird.

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:24.420
Little weird.

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:29.100
Uh, lastly, Giove Dea says, it's not expected, and as long as I can still play the DLC content

01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:33.660
without Wi-Fi, I'm okay, mainly because I haven't used it, even with owning the games.

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:36.900
At least with the DS, there's still the option of local play, right?

01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:40.780
Yep, that is true, and that's gonna have to suffice for those of you guys that decide

01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:42.860
to spend the money on the games.

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:46.100
Alright, that's gonna do it for now for the FUCL Question of the Week.

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:49.500
And please read all the responses, because they're really good, over at Facebook.com

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.620
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:54.460
Let's get back into some gaming news with Loki.

01:33:54.460 --> 01:34:01.580
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about, eh, Zynga.

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:08.940
They had a lawsuit, or I guess, a fraud lawsuit, which unfortunately was dismissed, and because

01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:15.340
of this, now the plaintiffs plan to change their complaint.

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:23.060
Basically, the original complaint, which was 110 pages long, failed to offer relevant basic

01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:31.580
factual details, which I'd say is kind of an important part of any sort of lawsuit.

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:38.540
They're also saying that because of that, they're going to, I guess, resubmit with some

01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:40.700
further evidence and that kind of stuff.

01:34:40.700 --> 01:34:46.340
My thing this has to do with, I want to say, they were talking about maybe their initial

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:49.660
stock offering and stuff like that.

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:54.740
Don't know if it's necessarily, you know, nothing to do with, of course, their cloning

01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:59.780
of games or anything like that, but maybe some insider trading.

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:00.780
I don't know.

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:06.660
Sounds all very complicated, if I don't like Zynga.

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:07.660
It is a little bit.

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:12.980
Well, I think the IPO fraud thing is, basically, long story short, they said the company was

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:15.060
worth more than it really was.

01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:18.980
And again, that kind of goes back to the whole flash in the pan thing, is that Zynga was

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:23.620
riding a huge high when they went for the IPO and the bubble burst, and maybe some people

01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:26.420
believe that they kind of should have seen that coming.

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:28.540
Well, look at it this way.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:36.060
They're trying to do, it's almost like King is following Zynga's game plan almost.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:42.140
They had a flash in the pan game come out, and now they have all these games with Saga

01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.300
at the end.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:47.780
They're kind of using Saga as almost their vill, if you will.

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:53.860
And that's the thing with any of these companies, especially nowadays, that yeah, at one time

01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:58.740
it may be worth X amount of dollars, but it doesn't mean that these games are making that

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:01.300
kind of money indefinitely.

01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:05.980
It's just, people eventually move on to the next big thing.

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:10.020
Or even the next just popular thing.

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:13.300
We experience a very fickle market.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.380
Indeed.

01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:18.060
It's very casual, no one's really dedicated.

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:24.460
Alright, well, speaking of it being a fickle market, this was very surprising.

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:28.060
Some layoffs occurring at Sony Santa Monica.

01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:32.300
These are the guys that develop God of War, and obviously there's going to be another

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:33.780
God of War game in the pipeline.

01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:34.780
That's not a surprise.

01:36:34.780 --> 01:36:38.180
So it's a little weird to me, especially when PlayStation is kind of riding a high right

01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:40.060
now, that there are layoffs at the studio.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:44.100
And I want to say, didn't they just have some PR layoffs and things like that a while ago?

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:48.740
So this is really weird that this struggle is happening, I guess, at Sony Santa Monica.

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:54.420
But yes, Sony did put out a statement, a nice little PC statement that said, Sony Computer

01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:58.500
Entertainment America can confirm that we have completed a reduction in workforce at

01:36:58.500 --> 01:36:59.500
Santa Monica Studio.

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:03.860
This is the result of a cycle of resource realignment against priority growth areas

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.560
within SCEWWS.

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:10.380
We do not take these decisions lightly, however, sometimes it is necessary to make changes

01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:14.180
to better serve the future projects of the studio.

01:37:14.180 --> 01:37:17.960
We have offered outplacement services and severance packages to ease transition for

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.220
those impacted.

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:23.740
So I get the sense from this, and the rumors are definitely out there, that Sony was working

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.820
on something that got canceled.

01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.640
And this is a result of that.

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.540
And if you want to further believe rumors, again, huge salt lick of salt.

01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:37.140
But some rumors that are out there is that it was a project that was very similar to

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:43.340
Destiny and didn't look like it was going to compete well with it, I guess, at the end

01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:44.340
of the day.

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.300
I don't really know how else to easily put that.

01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:50.820
But again, rumor, huge rumor, take it with a grain of salt.

01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:56.220
But regardless, it is really odd to see such a big studio that produces titles like God

01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.780
of War going through these reductions.

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:03.260
And even more so when you consider it's coming a week after we just heard about a similar

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:07.160
thing from a studio we didn't expect, Irrational Games, right?

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.740
So this begs the question, what the hell is going on?

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.780
Loki, any thoughts?

01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:14.980
What the hell is going on?

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.260
I don't know.

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:19.460
Well, Irrational, we know what the situation was, is that they just wanted to go a different

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:20.460
direction.

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:26.100
Sony, Santa Monica, maybe they just have a, I don't know, there's downsizing, maybe they

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:32.140
have another team that's going to be working on God of War, I don't really know.

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:37.500
Well, still sad to hear, and I doubt we have anybody who worked for them that was impacted

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:42.540
listening to the show, but just in case we do, and this goes for Irrational or any studio

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:45.140
that we report in, our thoughts are with you guys.

01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:49.380
And it does sound like a lot of people were after those guys at Irrational, so it seems

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:52.960
like there are jobs available somewhere, I just hope you can find them in a place that

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.060
works for you and your family, and best of luck.

01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.260
Sorry to hear about that, it's no fun.

01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.460
That's poopy.

01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:04.180
So what if the game was similar to Destiny, you know what, we've had similar games coexist

01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:06.460
for a long time and it works out.

01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:10.300
Anyway, Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:39:10.300 --> 01:39:16.720
Well there's some other news that, it could be bad news for some people, it could be decent

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:22.480
news for others, but you know how we were talking about how there was the regulation

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:27.960
going about those multiple little transactions that happen in games?

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:32.600
Now there are meetings going on with representatives from the UK, France, Belgium, Denmark, and

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:40.800
other EU members to go about creating rules for about apps that ask for how much and when

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.520
these apps can ask for payment information.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:52.120
They've also got representatives from multiple different developers including Nintendo, Electronic

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:58.800
Arts, Google, a few others, basically trying to make sure that these games are not misleading

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:02.000
or exploit the market.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.400
So we'll see how that goes.

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.280
I wonder if we would ever have anything like that here.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:16.120
But it's basically going to be a, you know, this is coming right after the UK group, which

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:23.000
is the Office of Fair Trading, was basically saying, you know, hey, get it in order or

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.560
we're going to enforce it.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.200
So don't know how it's going to happen.

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.780
We'll see, won't we?

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:32.780
We will.

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:35.920
Or they will, I don't know.

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:39.680
And of course, if they have to change something for Europe, it's going to impact everybody

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.680
else.

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.400
Well, not necessarily, but it probably will.

01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.400
We'll see.

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:49.440
We might actually see them proactively working in the U.S. market to, you know, let's get

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.200
it done now before we get it forced on us.

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.460
All right, moving on, Loki.

01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:02.280
So South Park, the Stick of Truth, unfortunately was censored in certain countries.

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:07.800
They basically said that there's five versions of the game, one for North America, South

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:12.040
America, Europe, Germany, Australia, and Russia.

01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:16.160
The North America, South America one is completely uncensored on every platform, the Australia

01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:21.640
one is censored on all platforms, or the Australia one is censored on all platforms, European

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:26.880
one and Russian ones are censored on console only, and the German one is censored on the

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.360
console for anal probing, et cetera.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:36.720
And so, but the way they got about it is kind of, if you remember the South Park episodes

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:41.480
where they were showing, supposed to be showing the image of Mohammed, and it was just kind

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.520
of like, you know, this thing with a text box saying, you know, we would have shown

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:54.480
an image of Mohammed, but oh, well, so they have a, they have this image that pops up

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.480
as well.

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:59.920
You lose again Europe, this scene where you try to disable the force field around Randy,

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:03.680
but instead accidentally force the probing machine next to him to probe his ass with

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:06.760
a violent force is not meant for your eyes.

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:09.920
Randy, in obvious rectal pain, urges you to proceed onward.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:10.920
Wow.

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:17.720
So they explain all this stuff in there, but yeah, I mean, unfortunately it's just stuff

01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:24.320
that they have to do to get around, you know, certain laws for decency and stuff, but yeah,

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:30.200
I mean, if it's that much of a bother for you, and you do live in those countries, remember

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:35.520
the PlayStation 3 is region free, so import away.

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:41.720
Ooh, that's a good thought, that you could just, if you want to get around censorship,

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.720
just import from another country.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:45.160
Do you think there would be a lot of people that actually do that, now that they know

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.960
that that's out there?

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.960
Probably not.

01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:50.880
Interesting.

01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.440
I know if it was my country, I would, but then again, importing games can be expensive.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:00.440
All right, moving on, we were talking about free-to-play games a minute ago, and one of

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.040
my favorites that came along last year, which a lot of people were talking about, is Path

01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:05.040
of Exile.

01:43:05.040 --> 01:43:10.480
Path of Exile is a Diablo-esque style game that came out from Grinding Gear Games, and

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.200
apparently it's been doing very well for itself.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.840
They've held very strong to the standard that they're going to do ethical free-to-play,

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:24.240
meaning that they don't sell experience boosts, they don't sell weapon upgrades, they sell

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:30.560
like flashy things, like pets and cosmetic stuff only, and apparently it's been working

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:31.560
out for them.

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:35.840
This developer who is based in New Zealand, they have over 5 million registered players,

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.400
hundreds of thousands playing at any given time, and they just announced this week an

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.280
expansion, the Sacrifice of Vaal, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, V-A-A-L, Vaal, is

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:47.600
coming out next week, free!

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:53.200
PVP content, a new race of dark magic wielders, and you can charge up super-powered weapons

01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:58.520
by killing monsters, but no change to the monetization property, excuse me, no change

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:03.200
to the monetization policy, and lead designer Chris Wilson says we don't want to compromise

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.720
the game, we want to make a really good game that people love to play.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.380
So it seems like it's working out for them.

01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:16.440
They do kind of mention that we could make more money if we were to do more of the pay-to-win

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:23.080
model, but people apparently are into the cosmetic stuff, they like to show off, and

01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:26.760
it's because people view this as a bit of a hobby.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:33.280
And they, in the Path of Exile store, they sell a big blue scorpion for $110, and they've

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:35.200
actually sold a few hundred of those.

01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:36.800
You got the money, hey.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.080
Yeah, if you got the money and you want to support the game enough, I mean, in a way,

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:45.080
it's kind of like, you know, people give thousands of dollars to these Kickstarter projects for

01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:49.000
games, I think, just for an opportunity to be involved and so forth, so if people have

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.160
that type of money to give to something they really believe in.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.520
How many of us bought charity pets for a while?

01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:56.240
Yeah, well, because that was charity.

01:44:56.240 --> 01:45:02.160
Well, yeah, but still, I mean, it's the investing money into something you would support, right?

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:03.160
Right.

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:06.760
There's people who buy the pets for a while just because, hey pet, not just the charity

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:07.760
pets.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:11.680
And to be fair, I mean, $110, I mean, that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, don't

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:17.480
get me wrong, but it's also, what, two copies of a new video game?

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:21.480
That's the price of two regular video games, and Path of Exile is a game that some people

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:24.800
are getting hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours out of, so is that really

01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:25.860
that much money?

01:45:25.860 --> 01:45:26.860
Maybe not.

01:45:26.860 --> 01:45:31.440
A game like World of Warcraft, I mean, over a year's time for a $12 subscription fee,

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:38.320
shit, you've paid $144, so is $110 scorpion really that crazy?

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:39.320
Maybe not.

01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:45.760
Anyway, so yeah, if you're into Path of Exile, check that out for the new expansion that's

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:46.760
coming out this week.

01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.040
I know I will be checking that out, too.

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.320
I hope the game doesn't crush under that, all those people wanting to check it out.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.320
We'll see.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.000
All right, Loki, you've got one more story for us before we get to the mailbag.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:05.400
Yeah, real quick, Apple TV, we've been saying, hey, you know, if Apple adds games to Apple

01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:07.520
TV, that could be a killer device.

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:11.920
Well, another one of these rumors coming out saying, you know, reliable industry sources

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:19.400
say that Apple TV will be getting game support in an update likely to come in March or earlier.

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:24.600
Well, I'm going to say at this point it's going to be March because, you know, we're

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.600
in March.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:32.280
But they're saying that apparently developers are working on Bluetooth controller options

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:38.120
and, you know, they're saying that could, you know, work directly with Apple TV rather

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:43.020
than relying on another iOS device as an intermediary.

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.480
And basically saying that, you know, game support could be backwards compatible with

01:46:46.480 --> 01:46:52.440
current generation Apple TV, although, you know, they would expect that, you know, you

01:46:52.440 --> 01:47:00.760
would want maybe iCloud support because the Apple TVs don't really have much storage space.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.720
It'd be interesting if they did that.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:03.720
I don't know.

01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:05.480
I thought the Apple TVs weren't that powerful.

01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.600
So maybe if they release a new version.

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:14.040
Well, but they've got to be about as powerful as Sanuya, let's be real, right?

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.960
That's true, but I would think that maybe they're going to maybe release a new version

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:21.720
or something because, you know, if you want to show off like, you know, HD gaming or something

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:26.200
like that, I would think that maybe like a new version of Apple TV or something for maybe

01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:28.340
200 bucks would be interesting.

01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:32.480
It does seem about that time of year where Tim Cook ought to get up on the stage and

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:35.220
talk about what's happening over at Apple.

01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:38.940
I know, you know, because we usually have the iPhone thing and that's later in the year

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:42.140
or God, then they started kind of flipping the script and it was earlier in the year

01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:45.060
for a little bit, but iPads were usually early in the year.

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:48.340
Like I do feel like, hmm, it's been a good four or five months since we've had a big

01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:52.940
Apple pump and circumstance, you know, and Apple TV would be a thing that you'd think

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:53.940
they would update.

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:57.660
Although, I would be very curious, like, what else is Apple working on?

01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:03.020
There's been buzz for a very long time, you know, because it seems, correct me if I'm

01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:08.020
wrong, but it seems like ever since Tim Cook took over, we haven't really seen new per

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:09.020
se.

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:14.220
I mean, we've seen improvements to existing things like iPhone and iPad and so forth,

01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:17.340
but there's been rumblings forever now that, oh, Apple's going to get into television and

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:19.180
Apple's going to get into this or that.

01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.220
And we haven't seen that yet.

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:25.820
And I think a lot of us are really waiting for like, what's Apple's next card to play?

01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:31.660
Well, I think, yeah, they're trying to get into new spaces, basically, instead of, you

01:48:31.660 --> 01:48:34.900
know, trying to put out something else.

01:48:34.900 --> 01:48:40.620
I would be very skeptical that they would put out a TV, just because TV technology is

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:45.380
changing so much and, you know, the price point of a TV that was, you know, would have

01:48:45.380 --> 01:48:47.020
some sort of Apple integration on it.

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:50.460
I just, I would think that they would go like the Apple TV route because it would be cheaper

01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:53.260
and just, you know, plug that into a normal, you know, TV.

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:59.100
Why would you want, you know, the super high-res TV that I guess you would only get content

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:01.540
from Apple with for it.

01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:04.260
But I don't think they would go that route.

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:08.580
But like, I know one of the things that people have been saying for a while now is, you know,

01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:14.020
a watch that they have, you know, their wonderful, you know, office with the curved glass windows

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:20.380
and stuff that maybe they're going to, hey, that's Josh's lunch.

01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:22.180
Somebody's watch is going off right now.

01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:23.180
Yeah.

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:27.100
You know, they have that office with the curved glass and everything that they're supposed

01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:32.100
to be using some sort of like curved glass technology or curved display for like a watch

01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:33.820
type thing.

01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:36.420
So I wonder if that's, you know, a possibility.

01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:38.620
That's like straight up Dick Tracy right there.

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:40.420
Remember, God, I'm probably dating myself.

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:41.420
Remember like Dick Tracy?

01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:43.780
I mean, the originals were like from the 1930s.

01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:47.400
I'm not that old y'all, but I know they had a resurgence in the 90s and that movie came

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:51.000
out with Warren Beatty and he used to have like the little like TV on a watch where he

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.880
would talk to people and like, I could fucking see Apple doing that, like FaceTime on the

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.880
fucking watch.

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.760
Like it would be here for real.

01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:58.760
But I don't know.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.760
For me, I don't like watches.

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:01.760
I don't know.

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.440
I used to wear them as a kid, but I don't really wear them anymore.

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:05.440
I just don't know.

01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:09.040
Like maybe they would do that as your phone or something because I mean, everyone really

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.340
has like, most people have a smartphone now.

01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:16.440
So it would be just kind of weird to have like, oh, this is just an iPod, you know,

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:17.480
but it's a watch.

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:18.480
I don't know.

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:20.480
Watches are the domain of hipsters now.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:21.480
Well.

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.480
It's a dangerous combination.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:24.480
All right.

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.480
Well, we'll see.

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.880
I feel like we've heard this rumor out of Apple before, but we'll see, you know, sometimes

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:34.680
where there's smoke, there's fire, but it could just be a big poot too.

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:39.520
We'll see what happens next time Tim Cook takes the stage.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:45.200
If they plan something around E3, watch yourself, but otherwise probably no big deal.

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.640
Didn't they actually do a press conference during E3 one time?

01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:51.760
I seem to remember like, like not at E3, just coincidentally, it was like the same time.

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:54.680
Like I seem to remember Apple was doing a huge press conference, like the exact same

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.160
time as somebody else.

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:59.080
Anyway, random tangent.

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:04.580
Speaking of random tangents, why don't we open up our brand new email bag over at participate

01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:09.920
at orange lounge radio.com where you guys email us every week, your thoughts, your comments,

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.040
your questions here on the show.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:21.120
And most thankfully this week over in the new email address, no spam, glorious, glorious.

01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:22.120
So sorry to those.

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:25.520
You guys are still trying to use the old email address, but we had to take drastic measures.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:30.000
So again, if you want to email the show, participate at orange on traded.com is the place to do

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
so.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Let's get to it.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Dark soccer.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.240
Who has the honor of being our very first email or in the new mail bag?

01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:36.240
That would be AZHP.

01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:39.680
Hey, all our crew is HP here.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:44.120
Rob was wondering last week while people are so interested in Twitch plays Pokemon and

01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:48.480
also be among the fact that there were so many knockoffs, I'd like to give an explanation

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:53.800
for the first question and explanation for why other games don't work.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:57.440
First I think the reason that people are interested in Twitch plays Pokemon is because the community

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:02.400
is creating a narrative for all the things good and bad that happen when a normal person

01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.400
plays Pokemon.

01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:05.200
There isn't much dramatic tension.

01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:06.200
You're going to level up.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:07.200
You're going to fight.

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:08.200
You're going to use your best attacks.

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:11.200
And if you don't win, you'll level up some more.

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:17.200
With TPP, every time you fight a gym leader, you don't know if Pidgeot is going to use

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.280
sand attack seven times in a row or if Lapras will sing repeatedly before killing the enemy

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.280
in one attack.

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:28.280
When you're trying to catch Zapdos, you don't worry about whether or not you're going to

01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:32.240
accidentally toss your master ball or use it on the Pokemon you weren't intending to

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.280
catch or just straight up running away from Zapdos immediately after finding him.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.240
All these things are possibilities in TPP.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:44.200
Add to the fact that you can really feel like you're contributing by coming up with plans

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.040
and rallying people behind them, you've got a recipe for a fairly interesting time.

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:51.840
That's a good point.

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:56.000
The people who have tried to start up different types of games with the same principle don't

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.680
understand the reason why Twitch plays Pokemon is actually engaging to watch.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:04.960
There are several criteria a game must meet in order to be playable via chat with delay.

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:11.680
Game must not be turn based with little to no timing involved.

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:14.460
Game must not reset your progress when you die.

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:19.120
Game must not have an option to exit to main menu or soft reset.

01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:22.120
You can see that there are very few games that don't meet criteria two, much less all

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.240
three.

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:27.840
For instance, Bioshock doesn't reset your progress when you die, but you can pause and

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:32.880
quit the game and controlling Bioshock with a 30 second delay would be incredibly difficult.

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:38.640
For those reasons, I can think of no other game besides Pokemon that is interesting when

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.080
played via crowdsourcing.

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:44.680
Additionally, there is such a deep love of Pokemon and there is so much variety to the

01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:49.560
strategies in Pokemon that nearly everyone can have an opinion on what should be done

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:50.560
in the game.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:54.920
I hope I was able to shed some light on Twitch plays Pokemon.

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.640
As of this writing, February 27th Thursday, Twitch is on the road to the Elite Four, but

01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:01.760
it seems like they're going to be stuck in Victory Road for a while due to the one way

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:06.560
ledges and boulder puzzles which bar their way along with the high level random encounters

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:07.560
and trainers.

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:10.240
I wonder where they'll be when you guys read this email.

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:13.200
Love Always, AZHP, OLR's premier gold star recipient.

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:18.800
Well, there you go and now you get the honor of being the first emailer to participate,

01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:26.280
but a lot of what you say makes sense and certainly the fact that Pokemon will not throw

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:31.520
you all the way back to the beginning when you lose or whatever is a key component.

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:37.480
But yeah, I still worry that this is the type of thing where it's like it's lightning

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.480
in the bottle.

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:40.600
It's a flash in the pan.

01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:41.600
Don't take that too offensively.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.320
I'm just saying that I kind of don't think this is going to have the longevity people

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:49.680
think it does because there's going to be so many knockoffs and things like that.

01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.520
And you do outline what makes this work versus Mario Brothers and so forth.

01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.520
There's no denying that.

01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:58.560
But I would even suggest if you were to take other RPGs, which would be prime candidates

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.600
based on the criteria you've outlined there, it's not going to work forever.

01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.720
And once you get too many of them, it's going to dilute a lot.

01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:09.880
Now what this does bring to the table, because I don't want to make this sound negative because

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:15.560
it's not, because obviously people have noticed and developers have noticed and other gamers

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.960
and the people who make games have noticed.

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.160
And I think what you're going to see as a result of this is you're going to see more

01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:23.320
interactivity within games.

01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:27.600
We're already starting to see that a little bit as we got into last week with Tomb Raider

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:32.960
and there's another new one out there that does this too, but that people will be able

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:35.640
to interact with the Twitch streams in different ways.

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.440
And I think that is the door that Twitch Plays Pokemon is opening.

01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:44.840
But I don't really see Twitch Plays Pokemon as something we're going to be talking about

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:46.040
six months from now.

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:48.440
Funny enough, I think it's coming up again later in the show because we want to give

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.800
an update on where it's at.

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:52.920
And don't get me wrong, fascinating experiment.

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.920
Crazy how probably more people have watched Twitch Plays Pokemon than some second tier

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.200
basic cable channel.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.880
Probably more people were watching Twitch Plays Pokemon than were watching G4.

01:56:01.880 --> 01:56:08.560
Let's be, you know, so that, let's not underestimate what has happened there, but it's all happened

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:14.040
very quickly too at a count of two weeks and things like this tend to go as fast as they

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.040
come.

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.040
But if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.040
Hey.

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.800
I'm sorry, I've got a cough drop.

01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.800
That's okay.

01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:21.800
I got a glass of wine.

01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:22.800
Yeah, well I had some.

01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:23.800
Let's mix them.

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:24.800
Just kidding.

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:25.800
It's gross.

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.600
I just specifically want to take a moment here and now to give thanks to you guys.

01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:33.320
Specifically I wanted to thank Rob Roberts, Gimmitt, Captain Spike, and Exifer for giving

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:35.200
me advice and strength I didn't think I had.

01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:38.520
It is with their help that I was finally able to come out to my family and therefore the

01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.560
rest of the world.

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:44.640
The support I've received from everyone is amazing despite all my fears and I've yet

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.880
to encounter a single negative reaction to it.

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:50.440
I feel closer to my family now than I've ever felt before with my mom, dad, brothers, and

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:54.360
sister all sending me messages and calling me just to tell me how proud they are.

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:58.080
I wish I hadn't been afraid to tell them in the first place.

01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:01.480
I could honestly say that the way I feel now is probably the happiest I've ever felt in

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:02.880
my entire life.

01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:07.200
I needed this release and I have a word of advice to anyone who still isn't out.

01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:11.040
If you feel that your family and friends will accept you no matter what your sexuality is

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:12.300
then just tell them.

01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:16.480
The support and love that you can get in return is just so worth it.

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.000
Again, thank you so very much with love, Asfer.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.640
I don't know what to say.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:24.640
It's great.

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:25.640
It's fantastic.

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:28.440
I'm very, very happy to hear it.

01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:34.600
I'm happy to hear that you had that and that you had that, you know, welcomeness in your

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:40.320
family and so forth and that everything went really good for you and congratulations on

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.360
that big step.

01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:47.760
I know that has nothing to do with video gaming but I really don't give a shit because as

01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:53.240
long as we're going to continue to have talks about, you know, everything from why do we

01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.680
need a gay gamer convention, which I've talked to death about before on the show, to not

01:57:59.680 --> 01:58:01.960
to get too political here but I have to.

01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:03.480
This is my life we're talking about here.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:07.800
We have to talk about when people want to pass laws where people are going to be able

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.640
to refuse you service just because of, you know, what you are.

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.200
Like that shit is like obviously we're cockulous and thank God, you know, somebody came to

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:20.220
our senses and said, you know, maybe this is a bad idea.

01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:25.220
Did you see the restaurants that were putting up signs that says we reserve the right to

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:29.060
refuse service to Arizona legislators?

01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:30.060
Right?

01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:31.060
How does it feel?

01:58:31.060 --> 01:58:32.060
How does it feel?

01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:36.300
But there's also something that one of the things that really, really, really, really

01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:41.020
bothers me that some people have the perception of gays and lesbians and so forth is that

01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.460
it's a choice.

01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.980
Being a legislator is a choice.

01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:48.900
Being gay, not a choice.

01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:53.860
I am happy to tell you firsthand, I did not, I am a gay man and I did not wake up one day

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.900
and go, you know what, I think I'll be gay.

01:58:56.900 --> 01:58:59.660
I think, I think from here on out, I'm going to be gay.

01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:01.860
It's not how it works people.

01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:05.700
And whoever's telling you is, doesn't know what they're talking about.

01:59:05.700 --> 01:59:08.260
Ask them when they decided to be straight.

01:59:08.260 --> 01:59:09.260
Right?

01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:13.800
Anyhow, I could go on a whole nother tangent here because there's been a lot of chatter

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:19.160
this week about when are we ever going to have a AAA video game with a gay lead character

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:24.240
and one big developer decided to come out and say, eh, probably never, to, to all this

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:25.240
other stuff.

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:29.560
And you know, the continued, whenever I see gamer X, there's a great story that's run

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:30.640
on them.

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:36.280
There's always that first comment, well, I'm going to have straight gamer con.

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:37.280
You know what?

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:40.220
Every time you say that, it's like, you sound exactly like the people who ask about white

01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:41.640
history month.

01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:45.880
It's, it's, it's, you know, it's, that's what it is.

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:52.880
It's people not wanting their own ableist and march and marginalizing behavior brought

01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:54.880
out to the forefront.

01:59:54.880 --> 02:00:01.880
You know, when you get thrown in a trash can because you're straight, when you get threatened

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:07.240
with violence because you're straight, when you get called straight because you're bad

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:11.000
at a video game, we'll have a conversation.

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:15.000
Until then, knock it off.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.760
Don't even get me started on the people who say, well, that's not a sexuality at all.

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:20.760
You know?

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:21.760
Yeah.

02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:24.560
I, people just need to stop putting labels on other people.

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:30.240
I don't care who fucks who or who can't fuck anybody else or what people do with their

02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.780
bits as long as I don't have to know about it.

02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:34.780
I don't care.

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:35.780
No one else should care.

02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:36.780
It's no one's business.

02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:39.880
At the end of the day, isn't love better than hate?

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:42.840
At the end of the day, tacos are better.

02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:43.840
I do love tacos.

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:44.840
Okay then.

02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:45.840
All right.

02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:50.360
Anyway, I didn't mean to just, just to, I went on a crazy ass tangent from Oscar's email.

02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:51.760
Congratulations my friend.

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:53.320
This, this drinks for you.

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:58.480
I already drink on mine or I would, okay.

02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.280
This comes from my good friend Catastrophic Monkey, who I chat with every so often.

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.720
Not as much as I would like to since we were time zones apart and I have a job now.

02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:13.160
Farewell mailbag hello participation also and he gives me a link.

02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:16.160
I hope it gets a year of release and that the second one comes out too.

02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:23.180
This is Shin Megami Tensei coming to iOS and it's actually, you know, old school Atlas

02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:24.920
Joy.

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:30.360
It's going to be out on the 18th set in Tokyo and you know what, I may just actually get

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:35.440
this game because hey, Shin Megami Tensei and I've been meaning to play it so why not?

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:42.000
It's going to be $7.99 and it'll be about 40 to 60 hours to beat so maybe I'll eventually

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.080
finish it this year.

02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:48.880
Thank you Moggy for sending me the mail.

02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:51.240
Hey OLR or Hi OLR I should say.

02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:52.240
It's Raginator.

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:55.600
I just have a question regarding PC gaming seeing as I'm still reasonably new to the

02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:57.360
PC gaming scene.

02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:02.080
I know that typically people would do their gaming on a desktop if only because with desktops

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:05.720
you can upgrade the PC's innards to boost performance.

02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:10.760
However since I'm doing my gaming on a laptop that isn't a possibility as far as I know

02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:15.200
outside of upgrading the hard drive or RAM so my question is twofold.

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:19.080
Is it possible to tweak a laptop settings to boost its performance even if the increase

02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.300
is only marginal?

02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:22.320
By the way yes.

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:29.160
There are different graphical accelerators and if you've got an Nvidia capable type of

02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:35.680
card built in they actually do release an optimization thing for Nvidia.

02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:37.360
Actually AMD has one too.

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:41.120
It's got Raptor built in which some people have kind of the mixed feelings on and I'm

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:47.000
going to be honest I've gotten some better settings using different things but it will

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:48.880
give you a good benchmark.

02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:52.520
Like I used it for Diablo 3 and Final Fantasy 14 and the games do run really well using

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:58.160
the AMD because I have an AMD graphics card and it works well but you can always tweak

02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:00.560
it and get something a little better maybe.

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:05.440
Just be careful if you're on a laptop because laptop cooling is crap.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:09.440
And I would say before you ever really push something to its limits like that please read

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:18.880
up on it because it's not always, and I want to put this big disclaimer that if your computer

02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:24.000
sets on fire because you pushed your graphics card too much to limit your fault not ours.

02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:25.040
You're probably Loki.

02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:26.040
Yes you're probably Loki.

02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:32.560
It is probably me because hey I did everything to help that laptop stay cool and you know

02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:35.520
I had it a while though.

02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.320
You had it a while.

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:44.360
Well it was used so it was old and it was infamous for overheating but I did like all

02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:50.960
sorts of cooling mods to it increasing the airflow in it, overclocking the fan, put new

02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:58.840
thermal paste on there but Titanfall was enough to kill it so I don't know it's just

02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:00.440
you got to be careful.

02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:04.200
The newer laptops you have better cooling but if you're really looking for like you

02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:09.160
know like customizing a laptop or something like that they actually do have places you

02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:12.600
can buy customized laptops.

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:15.720
There's like websites that will actually do that.

02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:18.360
Very rare though especially for laptops.

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:21.080
Did our emailer say if they were on a laptop or not?

02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.760
Well I haven't finished the email.

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:23.760
Oh sorry.

02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:29.400
But he did by the way say it was Reaganator and the second question by the way was what

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.320
are those changes which we've already started answering.

02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:39.800
As a side note this is what I have an Acer Aspire V5 571 Windows 7 home premium 64-bit

02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:47.600
4 gigabyte RAM and Intel Pentium CPU 967 at 1.3 gigahertz.

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:49.320
Wow that's old.

02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:50.320
That is old.

02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.320
Yeah and I know we've chatted on the show before Reaganator and I know you have to game

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.240
on a budget and so forth so I can't exactly just sit here and be all like well go get

02:04:58.240 --> 02:04:59.880
a new graphics card.

02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:04.840
I understand why you really want to push the limits of what you have but the reality is

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:07.240
technology upgrades fast.

02:05:07.240 --> 02:05:12.880
That's why we you know our consoles upgrade that's why PCs are going up.

02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:17.280
If you want to stay on the cutting edge of technology you're going to have to I hate

02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:22.280
to say this try to squeeze in your already probably stressed budget a little bit.

02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:25.840
How you're going to maybe upgrade your video card to support as opposed to maybe stretching

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:26.840
what you got.

02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:27.840
And that's in a laptop.

02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:28.840
That would be damn difficult.

02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:30.000
Yeah and a laptop that's going to be really hard.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.500
If you were working with a desktop I would say in a desktop now here's the good news

02:05:34.500 --> 02:05:37.300
you might be able to find something really good second hand like on eBay or something

02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:38.300
like that.

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:42.040
I mean I know you're taking your chances and so forth but hear me out here you have a lot

02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:47.520
of people that are in a financial situation where they can buy the pick of the litter

02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:52.600
the new newest thing the hot new thing to play the hot new game and they're going to

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:57.180
sell off their old cards which really aren't that old that maybe you can benefit from.

02:05:57.180 --> 02:06:01.200
That's something that might be more appealing to somebody that's that's working on a really

02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:05.080
extreme budget but pushing what you have.

02:06:05.080 --> 02:06:09.580
Do you really want to take that risk that you're going to overheat your system and really

02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:12.860
screw it up because then you're going to really be in a pickle.

02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:16.160
So I would say if you're at that point where you're saying should I overclock to squeeze

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:20.140
out just a little more performance I'm going to I'm going to actually say no.

02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:21.140
Don't do it.

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:25.460
And if you're looking for like a custom laptop look for was it a cleavo.

02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:31.920
It's this company they do custom laptops and I think they're in Europe but they may have

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.860
them also in the U.S. as well.

02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:41.740
Yeah I think they actually do have one in the U.S. a pro star but those would be the

02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.740
ones that you can literally cut.

02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:48.580
They customize everything and so that's very unusual usually you know when you're like

02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:51.620
shopping like Dell or something like that you're going to be very limited to a certain

02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:56.800
skew and you know what you can upgrade and downgrade and that kind of stuff.

02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:59.140
Also everyone in chat seems to be telling you new egg.

02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:03.300
I have a better suggestion and that's if you have a fries take it to fries have them price

02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:05.700
match new egg and you save shipping.

02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:10.300
There's a little app I'm going to advertise an app right now it's called shop savvy.

02:07:10.300 --> 02:07:19.340
It will you scan the barcode of any any product and it will pull up online and in store retailers

02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:24.060
with all of their prices the URLs to the items so that you can take it up to anyone who price

02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:28.480
matches say this is the item have them search for it and go OK yeah we can give you that

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:30.040
that deal.

02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:33.940
That's how I got when I bought my my mass fix for you remember.

02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:38.740
That's how I had a price match Amazon because I found it for 36 bucks brand new instead

02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:40.840
of you know 50 something dollars.

02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:44.300
And M.M.2K in our chat room brings up a good point that when you when you shop with new

02:07:44.300 --> 02:07:48.740
egg or fries which now some of our chatters are like oh yeah fries M.M.2K says a better

02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:53.100
chance is building an eBay quote unquote rig a lot cheaper and the risk is not that high.

02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:55.340
That's a that's a really good point.

02:07:55.340 --> 02:07:58.960
I can I can support that and the dungeon buster points out you know what Amazon also has a

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:01.520
few good hardware deals from time to time surprisingly.

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:05.380
So those comments from our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com again to the

02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:08.920
email or rage nator don't feel like I mean when you see the price of new cards you're

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:12.180
going to be like two hundred dollars you know there's going to be some expensive stuff out

02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:16.400
there but don't feel like you have to go the tip of the iceberg.

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:19.360
Go to the models that are a year a year and a half old you might be able to find something

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:23.560
like 50 50 70 bucks who knows maybe even cheaper if you can really find somebody who's on loading

02:08:23.560 --> 02:08:26.440
a bunch of offloading a bunch of stuff and it's going to be better than what you have

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:27.440
now.

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:30.720
And you know what check check Craigslist anyway.

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:34.920
You know I actually like I was a fool might be giving it away for free.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:40.000
You take chances but I was just you know randomly hunting in to see because I want a MacBook

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:45.680
Pro and someone was selling like one from a year ago for five hundred fifty bucks.

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:50.760
I mean it's already gone but you know it was like that's a good price.

02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:54.720
You know you know a lot of people clear them out for maybe nine hundred to a thousand.

02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:58.080
You know I'm just using that as an example but you can always find people selling off

02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:59.960
their old graphics cards.

02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:01.560
Well good luck to you buddy.

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:02.560
Was that it for emails.

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:03.840
Oh there's one more.

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:04.840
One more.

02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:08.320
Wow you guys are filling up the mailbag this week at participate at orangesonsradio.com.

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:09.320
Hello.

02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:10.320
Hi.

02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:13.160
With the implementation of the new email address I thought I'd ask about spam.

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:14.160
Have you ever had spam.

02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:15.160
Do you like it.

02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:16.160
Do you cook with spam.

02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:17.560
Do you have any good recipes involving spam.

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:21.040
Spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam.

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.080
Stay black for entertainment.

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:25.440
This message was brought to you in part by money Python.

02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.760
And my answer to that.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:31.080
I don't like spam.

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:32.080
I think Jamie put it best.

02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:37.080
Spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam spam.

02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:38.080
All right.

02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.080
Anyhow.

02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:46.080
Participate at orangesonsradio.com but please keep the spam.

02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:47.080
Unless you're.

02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:49.840
It's like a theme song for our mailbox.

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:54.160
Unless you're in Hawaii where it's like part of the culture then spam is okay.

02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:55.160
All right.

02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:57.840
That was a great.

02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:59.760
We should change the mail address every week.

02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:02.580
We get great email segments when we do that.

02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:06.600
Not that they're all bad but that was a particularly great segment this week.

02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:07.600
All right.

02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:08.600
Anyhow.

02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:09.600
Let's move on.

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:10.600
It's the FUs of the week time.

02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:14.400
Oh now we're going to spam the airwaves with some angst.

02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:39.960
Get ready for it.

02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:48.360
FU to gaming sites taking secondhand knowledge from somebody that heard something else on

02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:51.680
some social media site.

02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:54.640
It's not a story.

02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:56.640
Well said.

02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:01.880
My FU of the week goes to the stress that comes with moving.

02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:03.280
Although I'm sure everything will be okay.

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.200
It's just one of those like oh my god I have to put everything in a box.

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:11.040
But it'll be worth it.

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:12.520
It'll so be worth it.

02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:13.520
Can't wait.

02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:14.520
All right.

02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:15.520
There it is.

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.720
The FUs of the week everybody.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.720
Moving on.

02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.720
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:23.520
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:24.520
lounge radio.

02:11:24.520 --> 02:11:25.520
But first Loki.

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:26.520
Yeah.

02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:32.680
So as we were talking about a little bit before Twitch plays Pokemon has concluded.

02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:34.040
Pokemon Red.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:43.720
They after like I guess two weeks they finally defeated the end of the game there and now

02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:48.120
they've moved on to Pokemon Crystal.

02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:50.600
So it's not over.

02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:52.420
It still goes.

02:11:52.420 --> 02:12:01.520
So is there like a helix fossil and crystal I mean because it's going to be sad that doesn't

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:02.520
move along there.

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:04.240
Yeah I don't remember that one at all.

02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:10.660
I watched a little bit of the feed today just to see like you know how they're doing and

02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:11.660
you know game over.

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.880
It was no they were just they were running in and out of a house but now it's game over.

02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:16.880
No they're on crystal now.

02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:18.960
Oh I meant I thought you were talking about the other one.

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:19.960
No no no no no.

02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:21.940
I saw all the victory screenshots and so forth.

02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:25.420
But my favorite thing to come out of this Twitch plays Pokemon thing honestly it's so

02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:29.280
funny that last week I was so ignorant to a lot of this stuff that we was bringing up

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:30.540
but I read up on some of it.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:34.880
And I got to say like the fanfic and the culture that have come out of Twitch plays Pokemon

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:36.720
is pretty hilarious.

02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:39.180
And if anything is going to keep it going it's going to be that.

02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:43.220
But like seriously there's like comics about bird Jesus.

02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:44.220
Thank you.

02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.220
You're right.

02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:46.620
It is kind of Tumblr's fault.

02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:54.700
My people Tumblr you guys are weird but I say that with love and Lord Helix and yes

02:12:54.700 --> 02:12:58.460
and what was that Evie is the false prophet or something like that like it was all this

02:12:58.460 --> 02:12:59.460
crazy shit.

02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:00.660
It's hilarious.

02:13:03.140 --> 02:13:06.180
Anyways so some of the stats coming out from that.

02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:10.580
It ran for 16 days 7 hours 45 minutes and 30 seconds.

02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:16.260
It at its max it had 121,000 people watching.

02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:21.940
There was over 122 million commands issued in chat.

02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:28.620
More than 9 million onlookers and 36 million views and they were saying total minutes watched

02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:31.780
more than 1 billion.

02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:32.780
That's ridiculous.

02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:33.780
Oh my gosh.

02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:34.780
Hey.

02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:35.780
Great.

02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:36.780
Great for them though.

02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:41.440
That's Twitch TV's just sitting there counting the cash from all the ads and the subscriptions

02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:46.580
on that although then again that's a bandwidth bill I'm not sure I'd want to have to pay

02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:47.580
for.

02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:52.220
They should do that with like a TV show or something where they pick the outcome that

02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:53.220
way.

02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:57.100
Well somebody in chat earlier and I apologize I don't know who said this but I just remember

02:13:57.100 --> 02:14:02.460
reading the comments somebody had said I wish I would watch the Twitch plays Pokemon

02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:07.100
channel on TV before I'd watch G4 again something to that effect and I was like kind

02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:10.740
of surprised somebody doesn't try to make like a TV show or something out of this but

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:17.900
I mean we live in this age where the internet is making us rethink TV.

02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:21.260
It is Twitch plays Pokemon is a TV show.

02:14:21.260 --> 02:14:29.140
It's just not on what you used to think of as TV just like you rent movies now not by

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:32.260
going to a blockbuster like you used to.

02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:34.980
Just interesting.

02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:39.220
So Jason says I don't think Twitch plays Pokemon had a subscription feature.

02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:42.940
Actually they do but they make very clear in there about that it's it they're not going

02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:47.260
to give you special treatment that it's just for you know you support what they're doing

02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:48.680
and want to help them out.

02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:51.880
You know again hey if you've got a little extra money and like what we're doing help

02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:58.480
us you know help motivate me to do the next Pokemon game and program that before the next

02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.480
thing.

02:14:59.480 --> 02:15:02.200
Tiger Claw in chat says we need a Twitch plays OLR.

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:06.360
Hey funny enough go check this out if you haven't already Jason works very hard on posting

02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:12.380
the shows up to YouTube every week and they run a week behind just because we want everybody

02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:16.480
to download through the traditional means but for the archive folks if you go look at

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:22.000
episode 541 on YouTube Jason did a hilarious intro that does incorporate the Twitch plays

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:27.460
Pokemon thing into it so Tiger Claw go check that out it's funny.

02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:29.640
So there you go.

02:15:29.640 --> 02:15:33.960
One more story for you guys then I think we'll open up Skype at 1877 game OLR username orange

02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:40.520
lounge radio but before we get there a rare game goes for over three thousand dollars

02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:46.060
on eBay and what game are we talking about it is actually an Ultima game yes Ultima as

02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:51.680
in that classic PC series but it was a rare side story which I have to admit I've never

02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:55.300
heard of this and I always thought I kind of knew my up and up on the Ultima games but

02:15:55.300 --> 02:16:03.900
Ultima Escape from Mount Drash it was originally on the Commodore VIC-20 from Sierra Online

02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:09.860
the company produced no more than five thousand copies the first time it ever showed up since

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:15.700
the eighties was in 2000 and Peter O was a collector in 2004 that bought one for three

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:23.140
thousand six hundred and five dollars he actually is the one who sold this recent one he was

02:16:23.140 --> 02:16:29.100
selling the copy it was the VIC-20 cassette in a plastic case the instruction cards in

02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:34.300
the original box and he lost five hundred bucks on the deal because three thousand fifty

02:16:34.300 --> 02:16:40.420
dollars is what it sold for so unfortunately the value went down incomplete copies meaning

02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:44.100
they didn't have the case or the card or things like that they sometimes go for like six hundred

02:16:44.100 --> 02:16:49.220
seventy five dollars or more so a very rare collector's item there Escape from Mount Drash

02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:53.700
again I had no idea this was the thing but this was back in the day when Lord British was like

02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:58.740
programming those games by himself so this must have been something where it was like contracted

02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:04.180
out to Sierra or maybe it was it even maybe unauthorized I don't know I kind of want to look

02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:10.620
this up real quick are there any classic classic games Jamie that you would pay a lot of money for

02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:15.220
like maybe not on this scale but let's let's say you had that type of budget dark soccer is there

02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:19.620
anything you would pay a shit ton of money for like that probably get well it's not worth that

02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:26.020
much but I'd get panorama cotton you know it's a $600 game hmm which actually I think what it is

02:17:26.020 --> 02:17:33.980
is that they literally made like 500 copies of that game so it's super rare not there's not

02:17:33.980 --> 02:17:39.340
really a whole too many you know I might you know I might want to buy a copy of Emerald Dragon maybe

02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:45.580
that's a pretty good game I got more information on what this game is all about the Ultima escape

02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:49.980
from Mount Drash here's the deal it wasn't rich written by Richard Garriott but it was by his

02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:55.620
friend Keith Zabala we I probably mispronounced that I apologize to Keith for butchering his last

02:17:55.620 --> 02:18:02.820
name but he wrote this game in 83 now Sierra had just put out Ultima 2 and so what they did they

02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:07.820
stuck the Ultima prefix on this game hoping it would sell better we've heard of this stuff

02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:13.980
happening before right one instance that comes to mind is that Konami was a team silent was working

02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:18.900
on a game called the room and Konami was like let's just call it Silent Hill 4 so they kind of

02:18:18.900 --> 02:18:24.060
you know had to put it into the Silent Hill canon so you know this happens a little bit in gaming

02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:29.380
sometimes you get side stories that get the the series name stuck on it there so it's a very old

02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:35.700
old version of that happening all righty we are gonna open up the skype line guys it's time to

02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:41.140
call us and I have your say on tonight's topics 1-877-GAME-OLR our username on skype orange lounge

02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:46.220
radio the skype line is open right now give us a call while we wait for some calls to come in

02:18:46.220 --> 02:18:51.540
Loki I'll check with you you have any last-minute stories while I load up Twitter I'm just watching

02:18:51.860 --> 02:18:56.060
I don't really have any last-minute stories but I'm just watching my cat cuz I like I said install

02:18:56.060 --> 02:19:01.260
the cat door in the garage door here and she does not know how to go through it she thinks it's a

02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:06.060
window she's kind of like getting all frustrated like why aren't you letting me out she hasn't

02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:12.100
understand the concept huh she doesn't understand the concept no she doesn't understand the concept

02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:28.060
chat room Rama hey Rama you are very good at getting into the show when you want to what's

02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:32.740
up buddy not much I'm wondering to see if I actually have to work tomorrow because the big

02:19:32.740 --> 02:19:39.340
and sudden snowstorm that's coming through do you guys have another freaking epic snowstorm coming

02:19:39.340 --> 02:19:46.700
your way yes yes here's the funny part that I just said I said on my Facebook earlier today now

02:19:46.700 --> 02:19:58.260
the fact that frozen has won an Oscar the amount of snow has dropped about 60% swear to God nice

02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:09.700
you know what I think Rama you just need to let it go let it go Rob you know what fuck it all I

02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:16.180
just want to remind you Rama I've been drinking a little bit here and there so crazy tonight

02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:22.340
want me to do a shot for you buddy hell yeah I do do you got something sitting right there you can

02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:24.860
take a shot at what am I saying of course you have something right there you can take a shot

02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:33.500
of oh my gosh oh I'm trying to get a picture of it but our skype lines ring it off the hook I

02:20:33.500 --> 02:20:39.540
can't like the webcam keeps cutting out there damn it I missed it you got to do another screenshot

02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:43.700
let me taking a shot of sake and I'll send it to you would you feel better about all right fair

02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:49.500
enough fair enough what's on your mind I just called talking about the whole new way upgrading

02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:54.780
your older machines and so because this is something I do on occasion and even now yes it's

02:20:54.780 --> 02:21:01.940
harder to upgrade a laptop for gaming but a desktop it's not that hard I mean not for nothing my last

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:09.940
major upgrade was about three years ago I dropped out 300 bucks on a new video card motherboard and

02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:15.860
processor and it wasn't bad because you can get a pretty good video card for like 50 bucks

02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:22.380
mm-hmm really expensive ones are for people who really just want to eat sleep drink game that

02:21:22.380 --> 02:21:29.740
really technical aspect of it right and like it like I said about almost a month ago one of my

02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:35.220
hard drives crashed I went out and bought a new three terabyte drive micro center had it for 109

02:21:35.300 --> 02:21:41.900
walked over to Best Buy instant price match done nice that wasn't bad it's just you kind of know

02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:46.820
where to look and yes even though Amazon does so computer parts just be careful I've been seeing

02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:54.020
people selling like 80 and 120 gig hard drives for like 99 bucks and stuff like that not like

02:21:54.020 --> 02:21:58.540
you get a lot of that reseller shit on Amazon so you got to be careful that when you're buying

02:21:58.540 --> 02:22:03.180
from Amazon you're buying from actual Amazon well I mean sometimes the resellers are okay but do

02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:07.740
your research a little bit because you get a lot of that make sure if you want it to be you know

02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:11.600
still like sealed and all that get it from actual Amazon like if I really want to get a PlayStation

02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:16.100
4 camera not to like throw it back to a topic from a while ago but I am I could get one on Amazon

02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:19.220
but it's gonna be through a reseller for like seriously they're charging like a hundred and

02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:25.060
eighty bucks for a camera that's supposed to be $50 buck and what's interesting is that like last

02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:31.900
week I went I finally got myself um a DualShock 3 Amazon had of a 39 price matching at Best Buy but

02:22:31.900 --> 02:22:40.860
on the next ad down a third-party reseller was selling it for $35 nice so do your research a

02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:47.220
little bit people mm-hmm we're in an age of an economic crisis we have to save and pay people

02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:53.380
we can that's right yeah well anything else on your mind tonight buddy ah no that's it brother

02:22:53.380 --> 02:22:58.420

02:23:10.220 --> 02:23:15.580
our username on skype is orange lounge radio if you want to give our show a call and I gotta say

02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:18.940
though the skype lines ringing off the hook tonight it's gonna be it's gonna be tough for

02:23:18.940 --> 02:23:22.100
some of you to get through but we do have another call coming in so let's get to it hi on orange

02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:27.180
lounge radio who's this this is Bobby hey Bobby it's our friend Bobby bachoff how you doing buddy

02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:33.300
I'm doing good what's on your mind oh I called in because you guys completely glossed over the

02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:39.700
important part of a story earlier oh we never do that come on completely glossed over and I

02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:44.340
spent 20 minutes on my show talking about it's because everyone listened to you it's only a

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:48.980
three-hour show Bobby yeah yeah we might have glossed over it because it was something that

02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:53.780
you went and it went into more death we try we try not to Jack your style too often here at our

02:23:54.100 --> 02:23:58.060
show Bobby but please what do you what do you want to what do you want to go back and refocus on but

02:23:58.060 --> 02:24:04.540
but it is king.com losing the candy trademark is that a good thing or a bad thing it's misdirection

02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:10.940
they got rid of it because they don't need it anymore they got that candy crusher trademark

02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:15.940
from 2004 so they don't need the candy trademark so they can do the good PR thing and have podcasts

02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:21.060
say oh this is a good thing King is the evil K is backing off and they're not they're just using

02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:26.260
a different more effective weapon to bludgeon their enemies with so so you don't think this

02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:31.540
this like they're gonna let the candy swipe thing go without a fight despite all of the negative

02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:36.420
press it's caused them because my thought was that they were okay so maybe they're relying on

02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:40.260
this other trademark but maybe they're not just is this another one of the ones that they got from

02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:46.700
Europe no this was one they got from a US company hmm because I know part of the weird thing about

02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:53.460
trademark law here is that if you don't in try to defend it you'll lose it so maybe I don't know

02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:56.820
maybe they're trying to default to something that they don't have to be as aggressive and defending

02:24:56.820 --> 02:25:00.340
I mean I I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt even though I might be a little foolish in

02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:06.420
doing so but yeah I mean that that could be it but I mean it is it was harder for them to take

02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:11.240
on candy swipe with a candy trademark that they're just getting right but the 2004 trademark yeah

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:16.880
they can definitely use that to bludgeon their enemies with and even in and you know spoiler

02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:20.880
alert and you know behind-the-scenes stuff I actually can see all our show role because I

02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:26.320
run the website so I can see everything you can the finalized one though I don't see the finalized

02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.000
one but I see where you guys put all of it put all the stories and even the article that you guys

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.180
used as a link has a statement from King stating we're getting rid of the candy trademark cuz we

02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:41.040
don't need it anymore cuz we got the candy crusher trademark mm-hmm so they've even come out and

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.840
said oh yeah we're not stopping what we're doing we just have a better way of doing it

02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:50.440
Jason in our chat room says I dislike black wolves tack on this I didn't even take on this

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:54.360
because they have the right to defend their trademark the exception is of course that their

02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:59.960
game 2012 came out after someone else's 2010 as far as them defending their own game I don't have

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:06.520
a problem with it I I don't have a problem with it either when people are making puzzle games

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:12.040
involving candy that like literally step on the toes of what candy crush saga is trying to do

02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:17.160
like with a very similar name but you know we all heard the story about banner saga a couple

02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:21.040
weeks like that that was that was fuckery right there like there was no reason well I mean there

02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:25.320
was reason for it but it was it was a ridiculous reason none of us agreed with that and I think if

02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:30.560
a developer wants to make a game that happens to be about candy that otherwise has nothing to do

02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:37.240
with like let's say Milton Bradley wants to put out candy land for the Xbox one using connect for

02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:41.560
you know four and five year olds to play dancing like crazy in front of the connector whatever I

02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:47.440
think they should be allowed to do that yeah and and that but I mean and even Jason says you know

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:51.640
if they use whatever 2004 game take out st. candy swipe that's that that's exactly what they did

02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:57.520
that's exactly how they got him to take down his game is that he was fighting their candy

02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:02.000
trademark so they bought candy crusher waved that around and there was nothing he could do about it

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.160
now they're like oh well we don't need the candy trademark let's abandon it everybody will say this

02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:11.680
is a good thing and we'll just use candy crusher to do what we wanted to do initially because it

02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:17.840
predates all these other games that predated us well well fair enough thank you thank you for

02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:24.040
reminding us why this company is still evil yes and just to be fair we didn't exactly tell

02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:29.880
everyone it's safe to install candy crush saga again no no and when you were discussing this on

02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:35.200
your show that's when we were opening the wine sorry yeah but it is safe to install the unity

02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:41.320
web player and go to flappy dot vog network comm yeah because Firefox had an update I this happened

02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:46.280
to me yesterday and it's like this did it when I tried to load up the unity player it actually had

02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:51.000
like this big warning saying this pull of this plug-in is vulnerable so we've disabled it that

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.480
happened to hmm so just upgrade it and it'll be fine yes we are not trying to read the contents

02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:01.440
of your computer and what porn sites you may or may not be visiting and all that because I God

02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:07.480
no I don't want to see that all right Bobby quickly please plug your show for our audience

02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.000
I have a hard time believing there's anybody out there listening to this that doesn't know of your

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.360
show but just in case give us a quick plug and then we'll let you go it's Bobby Black Wolf show

02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.440
I named it after myself so Jay Leno because he's unemployed right now he doesn't take take over

02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:25.200
the show it's 8 p.m. Eastern 5 p.m. Pacific right here before olr and I even run long into olr

02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:31.760
time and they graciously allow me to do that and I do fog and and and flappy fog which is over now

02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:36.720
jokes over I'm gonna move on now the joke is over step away from the joke but but at least experience

02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:40.040
character pack to a couple times before you get away from it completely all right that's right

02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.720
all right Bobby the man take care buddy good as always to hear from you take care all right bye

02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:51.760
bye all right one eight seven seven game olr is the place to give us a call or our username on

02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.560
Skype orange lounge radio all one word and we're there's a lot of calls coming through tonight I'm

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:59.320
gonna try to get to them all so I keep keep trying guys sorry if you're not getting through right

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:05.760
away but it's it's a race of sorts and the buffer that we have similar to what twitch plays Pokemon

02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:13.480
has that whole like 45 second buffer makes it a very challenging type of game so once again the

02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:23.880
phones are open and let's see I could try to go to could try to go to the Twitter's just take a

02:29:23.880 --> 02:29:31.040
topic but I think nope we got a call coming in let's get to it hi you're on orange launch radio

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:38.400
who's this oops sorry try again hi you're on orange launch radio who's this gamer girl hey

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:46.120
gamer girl what's on your mind my friend um nothing much just uh plan some lightning returns

02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:51.160
some lightning returns you know we haven't talked a lot about lightning returns here on the show

02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:58.680
what's up how is lightning returns it's really frustrating at first but I learned that you could

02:29:58.680 --> 02:30:03.160
actually um if you don't complete the game like you're supposed to you can actually replay it

02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:10.080
oh right because isn't it isn't the whole little twist in lightning returns that like you have 13

02:30:10.080 --> 02:30:15.080
days to do it but if you screw up and you don't get things done you can start back from the

02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:21.200
beginning but it's like it's like a new game plus type of thing or something yeah yeah you first you

02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:28.680
start out with like six days on the clock and then with each I think it's called a seed that

02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:37.520
you add to the tree and heaven it adds more time to the clock mm-hmm like the more more days the

02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:45.440
clock and I'm already on day four and I just started playing yesterday nice so yeah it's kind

02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:51.880
of like is it kind of like um Zelda Majora's Mask where it's like you know 72 hours remain and all

02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:58.600
that kind of that yeah looming doom is there a big is there a big angry face moon in the

02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:06.080
sky that's about to hit the earth not really but it's a movie much um you pretty much it's it's

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:11.800
like the same thing exactly because you have only a certain amount of days like I said and it gets

02:31:11.800 --> 02:31:17.200
really frustrating at first if you don't know how to do it so for those of you who want to buy the

02:31:17.200 --> 02:31:23.640
game or if you don't have it yet I highly suggest getting the strategy guide because you're gonna

02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:28.560
need it you're gonna need it how do you how do you feel about lightning returns compared to other

02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:32.480
games in the final fantasy 13 series like because I see fifth dream in our chat room over at live

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:36.520
dot vog network comm says I'm not sure how I feel about lightning returns at this point where are

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:40.720
you at in comparison to the original 13 because I feel so weird saying that the original Final

02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:48.520
Fantasy 13 and then 13 to how is it for you the only thing I don't like is the fighting system

02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:53.200
because you only have a certain amount of button presses before you can't you have to wait before

02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:59.920
your um I don't know what it's called but before it regenerates right and as with the original

02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:06.520
Final Fantasy 13 the first ones you could just press buttons and there's no there's no penalty

02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:13.120
for it and also there's a penalty system if you run away from your enemies unless you're playing

02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:21.080
on easy but if you're playing on like normal then you have a penalty system so that's kind of

02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:25.960
frustrating I'm like oh well I guess there's gotta be that's that's the challenge in the game if they

02:32:25.960 --> 02:32:30.560
just handed it to you that wouldn't be much of a game there so yeah fifth dream says you lose an

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:35.360
hour if you run so interesting um what else you've been playing lately anything else you want to

02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:42.560
share with us um minecraft I'm playing a lot of minecraft have you been playing on the vog network

02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:48.680
server um I don't know what the server is for that one because I mean I'm playing on ps3 so

02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:54.360
I don't know if you guys are playing it that way oh no we're not on ps3 we're on PC so yeah the

02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:58.560
piece ps3 one doesn't let you connect to PC servers fingers crossed that maybe the ps4 one

02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:03.040
will but I don't I don't know for sure if it will or not we don't know much about the ps4 version

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:10.520
so mad about ps4 so bad why so mad because one of my favorite games is not gonna be on ps3 so I

02:33:10.520 --> 02:33:18.080
have to buy a ps4 which is I believe it's Kingdom the next Kingdom Hearts oh yes well it's taken but

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:23.680
no you're right to be expected anyway yeah it's gonna happen if it's equals are gonna go to the

02:33:23.680 --> 02:33:30.080
next system that's that's what happens but just think of it even prettier Disney characters true

02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:34.160

02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:57.120
are mm-hmm gross I can't even imagine I was bitching about it being 30 so no I love you

02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:05.320
California I left you said you're okay with it what because we got snow so you know I love snow

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:10.520
it's um yeah it's kind of like Christmas except everybody already took down their lights cuz

02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:16.880
they're dumb what I was going to talk about I called in to talk about that I have now stepped

02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:21.920
into the year I think it's like 2001 and I'm finally playing Kingdom Hearts for the first

02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:27.120
time for real wait you've never played Kingdom Hearts before I played it when it first came out

02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:31.520
for like half a second and I hated the camera like I thought it was the worst thing ever so I quit

02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:39.880
playing and now I'm going through the ps3 version and I still kind of hate the camera but it's not

02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:46.120
as bad as it was but man that games not a lot of fun sometimes I'll just say they did fix it up on

02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:51.760
the PlayStation 3 version I seem to recall so it's is it a little better than what you remember yeah

02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:58.480
the camera is a little better than what I remember but I still the game is not grabbing me yet I

02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:03.360
don't know how long it's supposed to take before it does cuz first of all David Boreanaz can't act

02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:09.480
worth a crap so he needs to not be in any of the other games I hope but that's perfect for squall

02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:16.440
because squalls kind of I'm squall I mean let's see even your impression of what squall should

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:20.840
be is far better than what David Boreanaz is putting out in that game maybe Jamie should

02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:25.640
release like her own voice thing that people could patch into the game yeah that's fine I

02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:33.340
would I would use that for that's cool can you give us another squall line Jamie I have a gun

02:37:33.340 --> 02:37:40.700
blade there you go way more interesting how far are you in the game just out of curiosity I just

02:37:40.700 --> 02:37:46.580
beat the Wonderland world okay which that boss sucked yeah I literally for three hours last

02:37:46.580 --> 02:37:50.980
night yeah that guy is kind of a jerk yeah I remember that boss it's like the big it's the

02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:55.540
big guy like you go back into that room with the eat me drink me stuff and it's like a huge like

02:37:55.540 --> 02:38:02.540
weird I'm automation chairs and stuff right yeah and then like I was trying to kill him and I was

02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:08.340
like maybe I could use some fire on him oh wait that turns his batons on fire and it just kills

02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:14.420
me quicker yeah it was so frustrating but now I'm on the Coliseum world so I'm hoping it gets a

02:38:14.420 --> 02:38:19.980
little better well it's I I am gonna say this I kind of think Kingdom Hearts 2 is a better game

02:38:19.980 --> 02:38:24.940
but I still love Kingdom Hearts the Tron level will piss you off at first just doing the light

02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:30.500
cycle part would piss you off yeah I just want to play Tron legacy but I know that's in the 3ds

02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:36.100
one is the 3ds one not in any of the ones that I have access to right now so kind of sad about

02:38:36.100 --> 02:38:41.620
that that's okay well welcome to 2001 Shane thank you and you're playing it oh my god I'm about to

02:38:41.620 --> 02:38:45.580
graduate high school that's amazing you're playing an MMO from 2001 as well aren't you

02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:51.580
I actually yeah I am right now playing Final Fantasy 11 because I absolutely love this game

02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:59.500
and all the changes they've made to it it's fantastic not 14 mind you 11 11 yes now I am

02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:03.700
a dancer in it it's the best you have been trying and trying and trying to convince it you're

02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:07.540
trying to use those powers of yours to make me come back and play Final Fantasy 11 so far I'm

02:39:07.540 --> 02:39:12.540
resisting though I'm no no no you have started to give in because he said maybe after the move

02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:18.300
I said maybe just to shut you up that's all I needed you're a year too late I I was back in

02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:24.300
it for like a month you know I was free to play maybe I was in it for like a month earlier too

02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:30.180
but I Shane is convinced that it's it's all of a sudden so much better than that okay quickly

02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:34.340
Shane you may not be able to a hundred percent convince me but convince Jamie convinced the

02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:41.860
listenerships well no I have to pick and choose my targets I'm already two operating systems since

02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:45.780
the last time I touched that game and I swore I would never go back and I'm a stubborn bitch

02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:51.380
all right but you got to try for me Shane what why why is Final Fantasy 11 cool now because you

02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:56.580
don't have to play with anybody you've got this system that's not unlike Guild Wars where you have

02:39:56.580 --> 02:40:03.180
these NPCs that come fight with you and you make a mini party and I seriously in the past two hours

02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:11.580
gained like eight levels and that's eight higher levels I went from 42 to I'm just below 50 and if

02:40:11.580 --> 02:40:16.660
you've ever played Final Fantasy 11 before you know that's not an easy feat yeah I think after

02:40:16.660 --> 02:40:23.940
like three years I got to like maybe level 54 on one of my classes yeah so it's just it's so

02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:28.180
accessible that's what's nice about it and you apparently don't really even have to buy gear

02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:33.620
until you get into the 90s because they raised the level cap to 99 they did they did put higher

02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:38.660
textures out for Final Fantasy 11 at some point right did they I thought they did I don't think

02:40:38.660 --> 02:40:42.860
they did yeah I don't think they did I'm I don't want to play it if the textures were much nicer

02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:48.660
and it looks I just registry edit it that's what I did it looks way better than normal we'll see

02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:55.860
but again after I move it's already playing Final Fantasy 11 once chroma comes out anyway so that's

02:40:55.860 --> 02:41:03.340
kind of true I want that game so bad I'm very jealous oh Loki I want you to tell me more but

02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:08.380
he can want to see it make like a private YouTube all right we should probably talk about this

02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:13.580
offline but for now Shane anything else before I let you go nope it's just really cold all right

02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:21.500
well I put a jacket on mm-hmm I have a hoodie okay bye Shane bye one eight seven seven game

02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:25.940
olr if you want to give us a call or our username on Skype orange lounge radio I'm gonna try to

02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:30.380
squeeze in one more call because I've seen one more caller coming through I want to make sure

02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:34.180
I at least get the one another call and then I'll probably shut it off for tonight cuz I usually do

02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:38.860
about three calls but I have done six but that's because our show was running a little short the

02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:45.740
news went by quick tonight so um did you have any other last-minute stories you cooked up

02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:53.380
Logie I still get to get to Twitter now all right oh here's that call we're gonna go to it and take

02:41:53.380 --> 02:41:56.340
this call and then this will be the last one for tonight hi you're on orange launch radio who's

02:41:56.340 --> 02:42:03.820
this hey guys Jason hey Jason how you doing unlike everybody else and the polar vortex and snow of

02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:10.380
doom I made it home you made it home it's good to hear from you in your Colorado studio as opposed

02:42:10.380 --> 02:42:14.700
to here in the studio with us well to almost I was actually at a con this weekend so I'm actually

02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:21.100
I'm actually at a hotel and I'm hoping the internet holds up for the call but close enough to home I'm

02:42:21.100 --> 02:42:27.020
actually you know driving distance with reasonably so nice and you I will have you know that in your

02:42:27.020 --> 02:42:32.300
chair which was Loki's chair at one point but and he'll be back at some point but tonight hosting

02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:38.500
the show you know last week was my copy of bravely default tonight tonight is Jamie's glass of wine

02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:45.340
all right you didn't call us to talk about booze though at least I don't think so what's on your

02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:50.380
mind Jason I kind of just wanted to point out something when I was doing the video yesterday

02:42:50.380 --> 02:42:55.020
a friend of mine called me towards the end of the show last week so I missed the discussion on this

02:42:55.020 --> 02:43:02.260
topic I am NOT and this will probably shock quite a few people but I'm not so sure that the whole

02:43:02.260 --> 02:43:08.460
Netflix Comcast thing is a net neutrality concern because there were follow-ups that happened over

02:43:08.460 --> 02:43:12.220
the course of this week so obviously you know additions since we first since you guys first

02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:19.860
talked about it on the show I'm I'm a Comcast subscriber I use Netflix regularly I never saw

02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:25.020
these problems and people have been talking about them being problems for the last I don't know year

02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:29.940
and a half and worsening over that period of time and there was an article that came out this week

02:43:29.940 --> 02:43:37.220
that even people people that use Netflix on their desktop see these problems people that use a

02:43:37.220 --> 02:43:45.580
connected device more specifically in Apple TV like I do never saw these problems whatsoever and

02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:52.140
this article pointed out that Netflix sends for whatever reason they send Apple TV streams via

02:43:52.140 --> 02:44:00.780
a different pipe the short version of this story is that everybody on the internet has you know it

02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:05.620
always boils down to one big backbone if people want to look at what I'm talking about real quick

02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:14.900
go to internet health report calm and you'll see a grid of all of the major cross-network providers

02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:21.100
in the United States specifically and there's only one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:28.940
of them if you are talking one network to another you switch across one of these networks these

02:44:28.940 --> 02:44:35.100
people do you know they don't do gigabytes they don't do terabytes they do petabytes of traffic

02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:42.860
a day wow that's a lot of bytes well it's not exabytes or yada bytes so we're getting there

02:44:42.860 --> 02:44:50.460
eventually but it's it's one of those things where like Comcast was painted as the villain

02:44:50.540 --> 02:44:57.820
because a lot of people like I I I I derive I say bad things about Comcast from time to time too

02:44:57.820 --> 02:45:03.980
for you know better for worse for I think also in general Jason I think people aren't happy about

02:45:03.980 --> 02:45:07.540
the large market share they're about to have because I think we sort of see competition as

02:45:07.540 --> 02:45:11.540
a little bit of a good thing and there's also been a lot of talk lately about is the internet

02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:19.140
a utility and we saw a case you know many years ago when what was it Bell or whatever was taking

02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:22.060
over so much of the country when it came to the phone utility the government actually split them

02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:26.300
up yeah and so we're starting to kind of ask that question shouldn't the internet be considered a

02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:30.660
utility at this point I I'm actually one of those people it's kind of like I I think it is I think

02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:36.700
we live in a society that necessitates the internet and I don't like I don't disagree with

02:45:36.700 --> 02:45:42.860
any of this I don't like the state of broadband in America the fact that we do have one cable choice

02:45:42.860 --> 02:45:49.580
one DSL choice at best and in like 60% of the country less than that you know by no means am

02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:54.380
I saying that's a bad thing I'm just I'm just basically I basically just wanted to make the

02:45:54.380 --> 02:46:00.540
point that Netflix did this for a specific business purpose to better their service for

02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:07.500
people because the route that they have to take to get to Comcast subscribers for one medium

02:46:07.500 --> 02:46:14.380
desktops was terrible and they chose not to leverage the other links that they do have except

02:46:14.380 --> 02:46:19.180
for one source of video like I said the fact that Apple TV's never exhibit exhibited these problems

02:46:19.180 --> 02:46:25.540
like desktop viewing did so there's there's a lot more to this story than just Comcast constraining

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:30.940
and fucking over Netflix you know maybe maybe Netflix made the right decision they didn't want

02:46:30.940 --> 02:46:37.220
to oversaturate other links but there's a lot more to it this is a this is a really big story

02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:43.300
that just doesn't distill into well Comcast fucked up again so let's let's deride them for the next

02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:48.060
five minutes and then move on but that's basically all I wanted to get out as soon as I heard it

02:46:48.060 --> 02:46:52.500
editing the video you're just saying that there's more to this and a lot of people are kind of

02:46:52.500 --> 02:46:57.180
jumping to conclusions and I think that's fair because in the gaming world especially I mean I

02:46:57.180 --> 02:47:00.220
know this is a little more tech you know it's a little higher a little higher on the bubble

02:47:00.220 --> 02:47:05.060
than than than gaming but we tend to in this industry jump to conclusions all the time I'm

02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:10.060
guilty of it we're all guilty of it we sometimes jump to conclusions so you're just saying you know

02:47:10.060 --> 02:47:14.700
what look look beneath the service there's a little more to it yeah there's this is a big

02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:21.060
incredibly complicated thing not only to the u.s. but the wider internet at large and it's

02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:25.020
fascinating when you die when you dive into it you just have to find the medium to be able to do so

02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:29.100
all right fair enough you might want to link that in our chat room that website you just gave to

02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:32.700
because bonds double-06 says anyone got the site I don't have it I'm assuming that's the one you

02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:36.980
gave out I don't know but check in on that on chat if you will hey Jason I'm gonna let you go so we

02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:41.300
can wrap up the show but miss you buddy hope to see you soon oh somebody else was asking what what

my little pony fighting is magic tribute edition is released by fans note this is not done by

02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:33.100
main six the original devs and this is the whole thing where they you know they had to end up

02:49:33.100 --> 02:49:38.220
changing it and the creator of my little pony was gonna help him out anyway no surprise that

02:49:38.220 --> 02:49:43.580
the internet kind of did its thing and put it out anyway despite the legal wishes and so forth

02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:50.460
especially in a rabid fan community like my little pony but hope it's fun but I would I would still

02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:53.900
be looking forward to you know what's the new game gonna be that comes out of this what comes

02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:59.060
out of the ashes with that so it's like it reminds me of that you know that chrono trigger re remake

02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:06.180
that square shut down in and up on the internet anyway act F also says ultra Street Fighter 4

02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:11.780
will add addition select so you can choose which version of your character to use notice that's

02:50:11.780 --> 02:50:17.720
edition EDI TIO and not like one plus one is two so you can actually choose do I want to play

02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:23.360
regular championship or so forth because there's so many Street Fighter fours at this point sheesh

02:50:23.360 --> 02:50:30.080
all right some other tweets we got s2100 Matt tweeting us in a recent homebrew coding competition

02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:37.000
someone remade Castlevania in zx spectrum graphics that's awesome you know though the original

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:42.600
Castlevania was actually on Commodore 64 it might have been was it vampire hunter that they released

02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:48.240
it because wasn't that the original arcade it was vampire sex or msx so the fact is on zx spectrum

02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:53.680
not a total reach but still very cool I love the D makes did you see flappy bird on the Commodore

02:50:53.680 --> 02:51:00.880
64 no hilarious and of course I love love love and bring this up again super hexagon on Commodore

02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:09.440
64 awesome there was a couple other tweets earlier in the week Eric RPG had sent us a tweet about

02:51:09.960 --> 02:51:15.400
about a game that's being made that's inspired by f-zero I'm gonna see if I can bring up this link

02:51:15.400 --> 02:51:23.000
real quick here it's a racing and shoot-em-up hybrid that's being made and it's got f-zero

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:29.320
influences and let's see it is a top-down racer with f-zero influences it's called the next

02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:35.840
Penelope inspired by Ridge Racer type for kind of interesting you can check that out at indie

02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:41.840
games calm if you want to see more information on that game and Flacco Jones also sent us a tweet

02:51:41.840 --> 02:51:48.280
saying this might be interesting for your show and oh yeah I remember reading this link this let me

02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:53.600
read the headline for you from AV Club point one five percent of mobile game players account for

02:51:53.600 --> 02:52:02.600
half of all in-game revenue in other I don't know this stupid website has an ad on it but anyway so

02:52:02.600 --> 02:52:08.000
I can't read much more than that headline but yeah point one five percent is generating half

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:13.160
of the revenue for these games I'm actually not surprised by that whatsoever there's just there's

02:52:13.160 --> 02:52:17.320
some people that pump all this money into games you kind of go like is that what you're gonna

02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:21.200
spend your money on but you know what it's up it's up to somebody how they want to spend the

02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:30.560
money last but not least tech 2030 wants to give a shout-out to a Kickstarter project called koe

02:52:30.560 --> 02:52:36.640
koe I hope I didn't mispronounce that but it's a it's an introduction to the Japanese language oh

02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:42.240
well shit this is a game I probably need to play sounds like it's in the shell of a Japanese RPG

02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:48.760
but it actually teaches you the Japanese language sign me up that's similar to Final Fantasy and

02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:53.320
Pokemon hold on I'm trying to see it's actually out of the UK as well it's being raised in pounds

02:52:53.320 --> 02:52:59.600
but if you have zero experience with the Japanese language or you are well versed and looking for

02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:06.320
god damn it it is koe by the way because it says there if you are well versed and looking for a

02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:11.080
supplement for your studies or just want to play a JRPG for old times sakes this is for you well

02:53:11.080 --> 02:53:14.960
shit sign me up maybe I'll actually pronounce some of the games correctly in future weeks you're

02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:20.440
getting better I'm getting better I think I think Akuma JP was complimenting me as well which is a

02:53:20.440 --> 02:53:23.640
very nice compliment at least maybe I'm sounding like a kindergartener at this point remember

02:53:23.640 --> 02:53:38.440
you a oh I owe you just kidding how about this Baca all right you can search for that over on

02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:43.800
kickstarter if you want to see if yourself koe or it seems like somebody in chat just linked that so

02:53:43.800 --> 02:53:47.920

02:55:02.840 --> 02:55:11.080
correct except for animated short which was a tiebreaker question on our list so I think

it may have won well at least that'll be some good news at work tomorrow right exactly yeah

02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:22.400

02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:32.000
not allergic to the wine but um I ate some things tonight that I haven't eaten in a long time oh and

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:37.440
one of them might have had peppers in it oh so hey Alan do we have Benadryl oh you have some okay

02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:43.600
