7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week the news revolves around Facebook with their acquisition of Oculus, but the news unravels with events happening far and wide.
19000	24000	And more unsurprising news rumors of Microsoft's plans to compete begin with a recent acquisition, but how does it compare?
24000	27000	We'll explain all this and more on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	43000	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 546 for this March the 30th of 2014.
43000	48000	Let's talk about video games you guys in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
48000	54000	where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
54000	60000	Here in studio my name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
60000	64000	Sup bitches. How you doing? I'm a queen on my throne right now.
64000	68000	Yeah you were talking about just before the show you're going to bring in a crown in the studio next week. Fuck yeah.
68000	73000	I'll go to Burger King and get you one of those crowns. Do they still do that? I don't think so. I'm just going to make one.
73000	77000	Yeah. You know what else used to be a thing? And I don't think this is a thing anymore.
77000	82000	I don't know. Kids having their birthday parties at Burger King and McDonald's. Like that used to be a thing.
82000	87000	This is California. Kids are eating organic shit now. But I used to do that stuff when I was younger.
87000	91000	I used to crash them. Alright. It's not as fancy anymore.
91000	97000	I'll tell you what's fun is after the end of band trips and everyone buying Happy Meals and then playing musical instruments on their straws.
97000	102000	We used to go to Carl's Jr. and then steal the numbers. But anyway the voice you hear over there, Tech Master Loki.
102000	109000	Yeah kind of a funny bit of trivia but for some reason and I asked them once and I never really got a response.
109000	117000	For some reason the back doormat for my wife's parents house is a Taco Bell mat.
117000	122000	Like it's flipped upside down. But you can easily see the lettering of Taco Bell on there.
122000	130000	I'm like why do you guys have a Taco Bell mat? Where did that come from? Oh I don't know. Do you guys steal that?
130000	134000	It's like you know there's a story there. You don't really want to ask about it.
134000	141000	I just don't. I think I don't know. I think someone like donated it to them. But like where did they. Obviously someone at some point stole it from somewhere.
141000	146000	I used to have a Carl's Jr. number 70 here in this house and everybody was like why didn't you get number 69.
146000	151000	I'm like because my bitch friend before me was able to get that number and I got 70. You know what.
151000	158000	I had a stack of 15 of them at my desk at the former money store. I don't know if we should admit. Are we going to get sued.
158000	165000	When. No get this. When I came back to get my last check I stopped at the Carl's Jr. and gave them back their numbers.
168000	174000	It was like a confession thing. Like I'm really sorry. I was like I wasn't sorry but like you know what.
174000	181000	I just kept grabbing these and I forgot I already had some. So here you can have these back. They're like I think we replaced them.
182000	190000	Thank you. I think at some point all those it was the end of an era. They all switched to just the little paper things or like printed out laminated.
190000	197000	I think at some point they just over it. And we used to make the little numbers jump. We went to Carl's Jr. today.
198000	207000	Oh yeah. Yes. I was going to real quickly I want to share life with the family and how that's how it is. Sure.
207000	216000	So here is what happened when we went to Carl's Jr. today. We're waiting for food and we hear this.
216000	230000	Is that is that both your kids. Scream me the first and scream me the second.
230000	238000	Josh is screaming because he wanted his own soda. And the baby was screaming because he just didn't want to be the car seat anymore.
239000	246000	Well you know what's funny is that in a way they've kind of taken after Daddy because Daddy Daddy screams a lot on his radio show.
246000	252000	That's the funny part though is like Josh wasn't screaming at all. And then then Nellie got soda and I didn't order him one.
252000	261000	And he's like oh what's that. So I want where's mine. I want one. I'm like well I didn't order you one. And he just went ballistic.
262000	267000	I'm too young to properly express my dismay in adult terms.
267000	277000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Some folks talking about the birthday parties and things that we were mentioning a minute ago.
277000	284000	Act Deaf says kids having their birthday parties is still a thing here. Well I know but like I'm assuming he means like at the Burger King and McDonald's stuff.
284000	295000	But everybody I know here is like it's all about like Chuck E. Cheese and miniature golf and or other like honestly it seems like a lot of the families I know are just like I'm not throwing a party for all those little kids.
295000	300000	I'm not paying for other people's kids. Julian's birthday party this year is going to be at Farrell's. Oh okay.
300000	305000	I was like I want to be six years old. Yeah I know right. He's going to be seven. Oh my God he's going to be seven.
305000	312000	Maybe I should do my birthday party at Farrell's. The pagan Jew in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I miss the Chuck E. Cheese parties.
312000	318000	Yeah that was the other big thing. World's shittiest pizza and scariest animatronics in the world. But raddest video games.
318000	326000	Here's the cool thing though but they don't have the coolest video games anymore but they're all one. They're all one token. Every single one of them is one token.
326000	332000	Wait Chuck E. Cheese like actually has arcade machines still. Oh God. Last time I went into one there wasn't there was like maybe one racing game.
332000	342000	No they have a ton. They have a ton like it. There's a new one that's up in Rockland that Josh has gone to a few times one for a birthday party and then once just because he liked going there.
342000	352000	But yeah they've got quite a few arcade machines. Not a lot. A lot of it now is just like hey look it's a stupid Android iOS game that's now on.
352000	364000	You know I'm sorry iOS game that's now on an arcade machine you know like fruit ninja. It's like doodle jump. Yeah. It's like why is an arcade game that is not an arcade game as a giant cell phone game.
364000	375000	You know what. I was just thinking maybe we should do an episode of O.L.R. from Chuck E. Cheese. You know like have a birthday party and everything but not like it's like an birthday party.
375000	386000	A lot of people a lot of people don't know this but years and years years ago in the early early days of O.L.R. I'm talking this was around like episode like 22 or something. We actually broadcast from Roseville Golf Land and damn near got thrown out.
386000	396000	Remember they came up and I lied and said we were doing a project for high school. Those were the days that when we could get away with that true renegade independent radio.
397000	404000	You know like Chuck E. Cheese is trying to update their image. So they've got they kind of did that once in the 90s and then they're doing it again now.
404000	418000	So when you go there there's like three different generations of Chuck E. Cheese stuff that's in there. It's hilarious because they have on their little stage show it's not really animatronic anymore but they have like the old Chuck E. on there.
418000	425000	Then they have a video thing that plays it's kind of the semi new Chuck E. then they have the guy that comes out in the costume that's the brand new Chuck E.
425000	434000	But on that video though it's like super duper old. But you know what they have in there. That was like completely random. They have the troll a little song in there.
434000	442000	Like they literally have like the video from YouTube but it's like their characters dressed up and singing the song like what the hell.
443000	450000	Kids are not going to know what this is. Adults are like most adults wouldn't know what that is but like you know well me that middle.
450000	458000	It's weird what songs catch on with kids because like the whole the Fox that's also what does the Fox say that was like a mean thing right.
458000	467000	And that's like like that's a kid's song now you hear it all the time like at kid type places like I don't know but it was just so random.
467000	475000	What's the I can never remember what it's called in what is it Hungarian or Czech the dragons didn't day whatever.
475000	486000	Oh dragon stud and day. Yeah I've heard that on new my new my yeah that was unlike what hits or something or the kids Bob or whatever the crap they call it the kids like weird stuff.
486000	496000	Yeah. All right. Adults like weird stuff too. Oh thank you chat room over at life that bug network dot com VX chase next week says crazy frog.
496000	510000	Oh God. All right look we've got some big gaming stuff we've got to talk about we will get into our gaming weeks are going to get to your emails and your calls later on the show as well but we've got some big gaming news to talk tackle this week and we're going to start off with.
510000	527000	Our lead story tonight is is a bit of a whopper and it's something everybody's got an opinion on even if they don't necessarily have all the facts but let's which clearly none of us do because this is all still very early on and what is going to be a multi month process but Loki take it away please.
527000	537000	It's unbelievable news but did you know Mila Kunis actually is pregnant by Ashton Kutcher. Now I know this is shocking news to the gaming world but.
537000	547000	Wait he did he divorce Demi Moore or they have a long time ago and a long time ago. Where have you been. Am I supposed to care about any of that.
547000	558000	It's a joke because obviously everyone expects us to talk about Facebook and not know buying Oculus. So I threw I thought I would throw them a curveball adding a bit of humor because it's unexpected.
558000	564000	Well that story did show up a lot my Facebook feed. Anyway there's your transition.
564000	577000	Anyways so yes Facebook has acquired Oculus VR and they did that with quite a bit of money and a whole lot of shares of their stock totaling the value of two billion dollars.
578000	594000	And yeah apparently they're very excited to be working with Oculus and they're adding a lot of funding that they say is going to help you know bring down the cost of the system so they can actually sell my costs and put better components in them and all that fun stuff.
594000	603000	But of course everyone thinks that they're just going to throw ads in there and you know rape people with you know through their eye sockets or something I don't really know.
603000	611000	But apparently everybody's just doom and gloom doom and gloom and oh it's the end and you know the typical internet reaction.
612000	625000	Well did anyone not have an initial reaction of the fuck because I think a lot of us I mean even admittedly now I'm going to get into I am not a negative Nancy on the story and I'm going to tell you why in a minute.
625000	639000	But even I had that reaction of the fuck like I think we were all expecting you know if somebody was going to buy Oculus it was going to be Sony we were all hoping for the or maybe Microsoft a response or maybe another valve is another.
639000	650000	But Facebook I you know I I would think if there were a betting pool and you would put your money on Facebook you might have the money right now to buy the Oculus Rift back.
650000	655000	That's how much money you would have made on that. So did anyone out there not have that kind of reaction.
656000	664000	I think everyone was shocked. But once that simmered down a little bit I mean there was there was certainly a lot of that a lot of that initial talk of huh huh huh.
664000	671000	No we're going to play Farmville right in front of our face so we're going to play Candy Crush Saga. That's that's what it's going to all be about.
672000	685000	Well actually it could have been about that anyway because the Oculus was always an open ended PC thing right. It's not necessarily tied to one company or one platform or what have you.
685000	698000	So those games could have always existed on Oculus VR before Facebook bought them. I think it's also probably an important point to remember that Facebook did not create Farmville nor did they create Candy Crush Saga.
699000	702000	Other companies Zynga and King created those games.
702000	708000	They also didn't create casual games. They also didn't create monitoring you know ads.
708000	716000	Right. They they they now their platform gave these game makers a new way to create these type of social games.
716000	721000	So that's you know that's where you could quote unquote blame Facebook. You know what I mean.
721000	728000	But I think a lot of the negative feelings people have about Facebook there's kind of two places the negative feelings are.
728000	736000	One is a lot of the bullshit drama fuckery stuff that happens on Facebook and how just like dramatic things can be on Facebook sometimes.
736000	744000	That's not necessarily Facebook's fault. That's more of society's fault in the way that we are like tied to Facebook in a way.
745000	752000	But the second thing which is a little more of a legitimate concern is the whole privacy and you know how are they really using the information.
752000	760000	What sorts of things are they collecting. Zuckerberg's interesting history. Granted he was a dumb college kid at one point.
760000	764000	We all were. But you know obviously there's all that story that goes into it as well.
764000	769000	But at the end of the day we do have to remember Facebook is a free company.
769000	777000	Right. And when you use a free service ain't nothing free in this world. You know you can enter the publishers clearinghouse sweepstakes and have a chance to win.
777000	780000	What is it ten thousand dollars a week for rest. I don't know whatever the fuck is.
780000	785000	And 50 subscriptions you'll never cancel. Yeah. See that's the thing is that it's free to enter.
785000	792000	But then they have your phone number and your address and they'll be calling you nonstop for the rest of your life until you change those things right.
792000	801000	Or until you're on the do not call list. Right. So might well would that you might I wonder I don't know you know again I just kind of pulled this comparison out of thin air.
801000	807000	I would wonder if by entering the contest and signing the sweepstakes form you don't somehow waive your right to the do not call list.
807000	812000	I don't think they can. Maybe. All right. Well anyway. So whatever comparison derailed.
812000	819000	But anyway. I guess my point where I'm going with all this is that here's the thing about Facebook.
819000	828000	Is that Facebook. In a way. Has changed. For better or for worse. How we communicate.
828000	836000	And that's a lot of the bread and butter of Facebook's business right now. Facebook makes you know a lot of brings a lot of eyeballs to their site.
836000	843000	And sells a lot of ad space by the fact that Facebook messenger for some people is replacing email.
843000	848000	That's kind of like a big thing right. That's where Facebook kind of gets its bread and butter.
848000	854000	That's actually kind of how I quote text friends of mine in other countries. Yeah right. Yeah.
854000	860000	You know that that's you know I don't use messenger because I hate the messenger app but I use Facebook for it.
860000	867000	Yeah. My phone. And then of course if they've got you know messages I use that to message them.
867000	876000	Now. Here's the thing is that Facebook obviously is is kind of looking at how all this is evolving with the messaging and everything like this.
876000	884000	Could it be that Facebook maybe knows that its time is limited. If it doesn't try to stay ahead of the curve.
884000	891000	Look at what happened to Friendster. Friendster had a whole bunch of tech problems and fell off the face of the earth right.
891000	896000	Because everybody moved off of Friendster because the site hardly ever worked and people moved on.
896000	904000	Then there was MySpace. But MySpace started to kind of crush under itself and the fact that people.
904000	912000	I mean just MySpace became so big that it started becoming really uncool because everybody had that weird shit all over their profiles.
912000	918000	The backgrounds, the music that would automatically play and like every. It's like GeoCities plastered on everything.
918000	925000	It was every awful thing about the late 90s early 2000s internet all in one little space. I think people eventually grew tired of that.
925000	933000	If you really read what Mark Zuckerberg said in his statement about the acquisition of the Oculus.
933000	942000	It's very clear that they want to do more than just gaming. They want to do these other sorts of things with the technology.
942000	951000	Like being able to be at a sports event and be able to have the Oculus VR so that you can see everything around you.
951000	957000	In a way that's furthering communication. And that's really where Facebook wants to be right now.
958000	964000	Or imagine you have that on your head and you're at some sort of event or something and you're like.
964000	969000	I want to share this like in Instagram or something like that. And now you're seeing through their eyes.
969000	975000	Yes absolutely. I mean that is the type of technology. I mean I don't think that's the type of thing that's going to show up tomorrow.
975000	982000	But that's the sort of technology that I think they're really going to. I do not think at all that this is about Farmville in front of your face.
982000	992000	Or your Facebook news feed in front of your eyes. This is about what is the next step after integrating video calling directly into Facebook.
992000	998000	What is the next step after the messenger app that allows you to get around text message international fees and those sorts of things.
998000	1004000	What is the next step? Oculus could be one of those steps. Oh hey and it plays video games too.
1004000	1008000	Just like oh hey you can play games on Facebook too if you want.
1008000	1017000	So I don't necessarily see like all the doom and gloom and all of this stuff. I think a lot of people have these really wrong perceptions.
1017000	1024000	People are just straight up making shit up. Now I don't want to be seen as like totally defending Facebook here either.
1024000	1032000	Because obviously they have a lot to prove. That they're going to use this for the quote unquote forces of good and not the forces of evil.
1033000	1041000	And a lot of this is going to show in how they start to integrate this. What the Oculus starts to look like six months from now.
1041000	1051000	But what I'm just saying is I have an open mind with it. Maybe Facebook bought Oculus because Facebook wanted to make sure they were still relevant in a couple years.
1051000	1061000	And when has two billion dollars in funding been a terrible thing for any company? I mean I think that they could do a lot of good with that.
1061000	1064000	You're going to get a better end product from that.
1064000	1071000	SSJ100Matt says in our chatroom live.vognetwork.com keep in mind that yes Facebook is now a big company that people do not trust.
1071000	1078000	Let's not forget it's also a publicly traded company now which was not the case when it first started and that will change things significantly.
1078000	1085000	SSJ100Matt continues but at one point not long ago it was the indie place that people liked. Times change and economics happen.
1085000	1090000	That's right remember at one time you could not sign up for Facebook unless you had a .edu account. You had to be a college student.
1090000	1095000	Remember the early days of Facebook you could not do it without. It was that underground.
1095000	1104000	That would be like me saying you could not sign up for vognetwork.com unless you have like a .gov address or something. I don't know something crazy right?
1104000	1114000	Tigerclaw in chat says sky so basically Facebook wants people to share Facebook photos but the photos would be 3D rendered? Perhaps.
1114000	1123000	And yes you should expect that at some point those experiences will be brought to you in part by McDonald's.
1123000	1127000	That's just the reality of our culture.
1127000	1129000	I think I threw up in my mouth a little.
1130000	1147000	I don't like the trend honestly but I want to say that and I'm not wearing my socialist hat but I'd like to say that the evolution of capitalist society has sort of led us down that path.
1147000	1168000	If there was less time spent worrying about the bottom line and worrying about maybe people then we might actually have more quality communication that isn't sponsored by some... Forgive me I'm about to go off and I don't want to.
1168000	1177000	That's fine and you know what though to be fair I think there could be a lot of good that comes to this but again it's way too early to really know one way or the other.
1177000	1190000	I'm just saying I have an open mind about this. Sure when I hear that Facebook buys Oculus I kind of go to fuck but I also see maybe it's not as horrible as everybody instantly assumes it is.
1190000	1200000	Because a lot of the bad things about Facebook are not necessarily Facebook created. They're created by your friends and people you know on Facebook or they're created by other companies.
1200000	1206000	Now the one thing that Facebook ultimately does control is the whole privacy and how they use your information.
1206000	1212000	That's what we need to keep an eye on over the next six months as they integrate Oculus Rift but I'm willing to have an open mind over it.
1212000	1214000	You know I'm not going to judge one way or the other.
1214000	1225000	The other thing I think about a lot when I hear this news is I think about how Microsoft's Kinect technology has kind of hit this weird stoppage when it comes to games.
1225000	1229000	You know we haven't really seen the Kinect really evolve anything in games for a while.
1229000	1234000	You know even though it's integrated into the Xbox One it's all about the shell and that system.
1234000	1243000	Everything interesting that's come out of Kinect beyond video games has been with the PC integration and you're seeing Kinect used in the medical field and things like that now.
1243000	1252000	In fact they're just launching or soon to launch the Kinect 2.04 PC. They just announced the pricing on that I think $199 maybe?
1252000	1259000	So maybe Oculus is going to have a lot of this similar implementation where there's so much more beyond games.
1259000	1272000	I mean hypothetically I mean I am no scientist nor creator but I would think perhaps now when we talk about that you could do surgery laparoscopic with a camera right?
1272000	1280000	When they do laparoscopic surgery what if that camera could literally let the doctor see inside you due to the technology of Oculus Rift?
1280000	1287000	I could think even though that's like really weird I could think that there is some significant medical advances to be able to do that.
1287000	1305000	It would have to be like perfect communication to do that because if you have something like that that's remotely off or relying on depth perception coming from a single lens going to double vision then there's way too much room for failure.
1306000	1311000	But my thought is if Kinect can advance the field then so can Oculus right?
1311000	1312000	That is a good point.
1312000	1316000	Again I'm not a doctor maybe what I just said was total wank or whatever.
1316000	1320000	They just have to improve the technology around the laparoscopy but yeah it's possible.
1320000	1329000	I mean it's actually a good thing if you have one form of technology encouraging another one to improve as well to keep up or to be used to make it compatible.
1330000	1343000	Dungeon Buster in our chat room says Facebook also probably looked at Oculus Rift as something much bigger than just games and we've seen novel uses for existing tech for other than what they were intended like in clinics using the Wii to help kids with physical therapy.
1343000	1355000	Very good point Dungeon Buster a lot of the same thing happens in like senior citizen centers you know like there's Wii bowling night at the senior citizen center because it's actually like a really healthy activity for older folks you know.
1355000	1357000	I actually have been seeing that used as range of motion exercise.
1357000	1365000	Yeah exactly so and then what's interesting is that Jason says surgery over the internet already happens.
1365000	1376000	He must be responding to another comment but my thought is like wow yeah I mean if the bandwidth gets fast enough I mean a doctor could really see you from a long distance.
1376000	1384000	I mean it's you know again we won't really know about this technology tell ways down the line but it could be fascinating.
1384000	1400000	But I'll give Facebook the benefit of the doubt to see what they're going to do with it and I think a lot of people should really do the same like if you're stuck on this whole Candy Crush and Farmville thing you really need to look at the bigger picture about there's a lot more than that.
1400000	1405000	If all you want is games though don't worry y'all Sony's got you covered and I think that's exciting too.
1405000	1409000	Now we really have a difference between Project Morpheus and Oculus Rift.
1409000	1417000	And just because they're talking about like you know games like Farmville and stuff you know existing let's just say worst case scenario there's a Farmville Candy Crush game on Oculus.
1417000	1422000	There's also all those other games that everybody else is developing for.
1422000	1427000	I mean I don't understand why you're all said oh I'm sorry you guys they have dev kits.
1427000	1429000	Yeah you're not going to be able to put anything up.
1429000	1432000	We only want Candy Crush in you know Farmville.
1432000	1434000	That's that's all you're going to be able to play.
1434000	1438000	I mean I don't ever it's just people are dumb.
1438000	1441000	I mean whatever you know they overreact much.
1441000	1448000	Seriously everybody I think kind of wants like it's like we've got this pitchfork in my hand I just need somebody to go after.
1448000	1450000	Oh hey look cool.
1450000	1452000	There's the next thing I'm going to charge after.
1452000	1454000	You know don't worry.
1454000	1462000	I'm sure there'll be another game they'll come out in the Xbox One or PlayStation 4 that you know won't be 7 you know 1080p or something.
1462000	1470000	You can go after those companies or oh it's a bowl shot or something or oh the frame rates lower on this one and this one.
1470000	1472000	People bitch about everything.
1472000	1477000	Guys you know in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says the majority of people on Facebook are not gamers.
1477000	1480000	They're not going to get them to wear that thing on their head.
1480000	1484000	Well maybe they won't have to someday.
1484000	1491000	I mean you know granted it's only the year 2014 we're still really early on in the implementation of the Oculus Rift.
1491000	1498000	But I mean what if and again I'm pie in the sky science fiction writer brain here.
1498000	1504000	But couldn't they maybe implement the technology in something like Google Glass where it would just be glasses.
1504000	1515000	Someday not tomorrow but someday couldn't our technology advance that fast where that type of technology isn't necessarily a giant box you wear on your head but just glasses.
1515000	1517000	Could be.
1517000	1520000	Like LeVar Burton and Star Trek The Next Generation.
1520000	1523000	It's always one step closer to the holodeck after all right.
1523000	1526000	And remember I mean just be just wait until it comes out.
1526000	1530000	Judge the final retail piece and not you know what you're speculating on.
1530000	1533000	I just don't understand people getting angry about nothing.
1533000	1546000	And in the New York Times seriously should know better than running a piece from an anonymous source saying oh well I've seen the Facebook branded Oculus and oh and all this.
1546000	1551000	Really you're going to run an anonymous source piece about something like that.
1551000	1558000	And then just like with it like the deal happened like you know literally like a day before and all of a sudden they have it.
1558000	1562000	Oh it's already converted over the Facebook or something like that.
1562000	1567000	It just it doesn't make any sense in the fact that people are taking this stuff as sources.
1567000	1573000	I don't understand people with really boring lives or really like to make drama where there shouldn't be any.
1573000	1583000	Well Twitter has changed our culture in an interesting way like that too because it's so easy to have that instant knee jerk reaction on Twitter and I'm guilty of this to Twitter anymore.
1583000	1588000	But but but the reality is newspapers are reporting on what people tweet.
1588000	1592000	I'm not saying that's good or a bad thing that's just that's our world right now.
1592000	1595000	It's.
1595000	1599000	I have another rant for me and I'm too tired to rant.
1599000	1602000	So I will put it in this way.
1602000	1605000	No I'd like to hear Jamie rant. We're a little overdue.
1605000	1608000	I like I ranted last week remember.
1608000	1612000	Like I said it's been a whole week we're overdue.
1612000	1620000	I just like this. You know it's sort of like arguing you know trying to be one person trying to turn back.
1620000	1624000	You know the hurricane force tide winds you know.
1624000	1630000	But it's something that I think if we look to you know we've been warned about this.
1630000	1636000	People predicted that we were going to end up in a society where everyone was going to be all for instant gratification.
1636000	1644000	We're all going to be living for our distractions and that it was going to be basically a society of knee jerk reactions.
1644000	1648000	Nothing was more important than the drama of the moment.
1648000	1651000	And I think that.
1651000	1659000	They it's too many people going with too many first impressions and letting out this wave of negativity instead of looking at possibility.
1659000	1664000	And that's what I think is causing the big fuss around this.
1664000	1667000	And yeah when the next big thing comes out everyone's going to forget about this.
1667000	1669000	Oh you're still talking about that whatever.
1669000	1679000	But you know at the end it's people living too close to their distractions and letting themselves be swept in by it.
1679000	1689000	And why isn't anyone concerned about a lawnmower man type scenario happening where someone might totally get immersed into VR and get sucked into the program.
1689000	1694000	Thus becoming an evil entity that has control over the entire phone system.
1694000	1697000	What of that. Nobody is concerned by that.
1697000	1701000	I have a few more things I want to say about this and then I want to move on a.
1701000	1713000	If you're one of those people that are making negative comments about the whole thing about how blah blah blah I am an angry person on the Internet blah blah blah and Facebook is the worst thing in the world and you're doing it from your Facebook account.
1713000	1717000	Check your life.
1717000	1722000	Like do you know how silly some people have looked making these types of comments from their Facebook account.
1722000	1725000	Look I'm not happy with Facebook 100% of the time either.
1725000	1730000	But the types of things that some of these people say it's like why are you on this network.
1730000	1732000	Why are you using this network that you are complete.
1732000	1736000	You are not required to use Facebook in your life.
1736000	1738000	You can cut it out if you hate it that much.
1738000	1740000	Just saying.
1740000	1743000	B. I know there's a very lot of.
1743000	1750000	I should say there's a lot a lot of very pressed individuals out there who contributed to the original Oculus Kickstarter.
1750000	1753000	One of them is a very well-known developer of an indie game.
1753000	1759000	Who is maybe possibly working on his hypothetical version of the game that maybe possibly was going to be on this system.
1759000	1762000	And he was very upset and wrote this big rant about it.
1762000	1766000	But my whole thing is that's a Kickstarter problem.
1766000	1769000	People.
1769000	1771000	That's part of the problem with Kickstarter.
1771000	1773000	You're not an investor in these.
1773000	1776000	Kickstarter is an elaborate pre-order scheme.
1776000	1781000	And by the way not to get on too much of a side tangent but this is a big part of the reason.
1781000	1786000	I have always resisted the idea of putting Orange Launch Radio types of funding on Kickstarter.
1786000	1792000	Because I kind of like the fact that we have the right to pull the plug on this show anytime.
1792000	1799000	Not that I'm threatening to do anything because dear God we've been doing this for our half our lives it feels like.
1799000	1801000	We're going to take our podcast and go home.
1802000	1806000	But if I wanted to do that I like the fact that I could be able to do that.
1806000	1808000	Well it's the thing is that people feel entitled.
1808000	1810000	Like they're asking for their money back.
1810000	1811000	Yes.
1811000	1813000	Like seriously you're asking for your money back.
1813000	1817000	Did you get everything that was promised in that little box on the Kickstarter?
1817000	1822000	Then you can shut the fuck up because your fulfillment has been taken care of.
1822000	1827000	Don't get me wrong I love the support we get from our community and our chatters and listeners.
1827000	1830000	And that is really the fuel that keeps us going week after week.
1830000	1836000	My thing is though once you bring money into it then it becomes a whole other ball game.
1836000	1841000	And that's why I'm like that's a line I'm not sure I want to cross.
1841000	1845000	Where it's like donate $20 and we'll say your name on air for the next six episodes.
1845000	1848000	And we'll do OLR for the next year and all this stuff.
1848000	1851000	That might work for some people it don't work for me.
1853000	1855000	I want to be the investor in this.
1855000	1857000	But I do take free tacos.
1857000	1859000	But I need $10,000 to do the...
1859000	1861000	Jamie will say your name on air for a taco.
1861000	1863000	I'll do it too.
1863000	1868000	I literally looked at a Kickstarter today for it was it was a podcast.
1868000	1875000	I'm not going to say which one but they were looking for $6,000 to do the third season of their podcast.
1875000	1877000	And I'm just like...
1879000	1881000	We've been doing this for 12 years.
1881000	1884000	And we've only we've been gifted money once.
1884000	1887000	And we've been gifted stuff a few times.
1887000	1889000	Very generously yes.
1889000	1891000	Which we're very happy for thank you.
1891000	1894000	But for the most part we haven't asked for anything.
1894000	1896000	Yes I don't like to ask for it.
1896000	1899000	We do ask as we say at the end of every show tell a friend or two about the show.
1899000	1903000	That's not like crossing the line or anything or making people feel entitled right?
1903000	1905000	That doesn't...
1905000	1907000	That's okay right? We cool?
1907000	1909000	Anyway I didn't mean to make this whole thing about us.
1909000	1914000	But the point I was trying to make is that you know when people kind of chip in that money there's that sense of entitlement.
1914000	1917000	Well y'all just learned a rough lesson about Kickstarter.
1917000	1919000	You're not an investor on Kickstarter.
1919000	1923000	Kickstarter is would you like to pay $5 to pre-order the game?
1923000	1925000	That's...
1925000	1928000	It's an entire company built on the GameStop pre-order system.
1928000	1930000	It's not necessarily that.
1930000	1934000	I know people a lot of times that's what they use to incentivize people to fund.
1934000	1941000	All it is is you're giving funding to a company so they can finish a product or do something with it.
1941000	1943000	It doesn't make you a part of the company.
1943000	1948000	All you're doing is you're giving them funding to finish whatever it is that they're trying to finish.
1948000	1950000	That's all Kickstarter is.
1950000	1957000	Yes a lot of the times you will get the finished version of a game or a DVD or whatever.
1957000	1959000	But that's all it is.
1959000	1963000	It's just giving them funding to finish something.
1963000	1966000	And a lot of times they don't even finish something.
1966000	1970000	A lot of the times they take the money and run.
1970000	1972000	But you have to be careful.
1972000	1975000	But it doesn't make you a part of the company.
1975000	1980000	It doesn't mean that you can ask for your money back because all of a sudden they came into $2 billion.
1980000	1983000	You helped them start their company.
1983000	1986000	And just because their company became successful doesn't mean they erode your money back.
1986000	1988000	That's not how it fucking works.
1988000	1996000	If you want to invest real money into something and get a dividend back, play the sock market.
1996000	1998000	Don't play Kickstarter.
1998000	2002000	You kickstarted that project because you wanted a fucking Oculus Rift.
2002000	2004000	Or you liked the idea.
2004000	2008000	And then you got whatever your perks were or a development kit or whatever.
2008000	2010000	You're done.
2010000	2012000	The transaction is complete.
2012000	2014000	You do not have say over this company.
2014000	2016000	Congrats.
2016000	2021000	The idea that you bought into with your money has proven to be successful.
2021000	2024000	That's a good thing I thought.
2025000	2027000	It's indie cred.
2027000	2029000	People want the indie cred. That's it.
2029000	2038000	And if you want to hear more on that, that is a great kind of reference to what Bobby kind of got into on his show tonight.
2038000	2040000	That was great.
2040000	2043000	I'm not going to spoil it, but Bobby definitely had his say.
2043000	2048000	You know Bobby is the Oculus huge guy around here at vognetwork.com.
2048000	2050000	And he definitely had his say tonight.
2050000	2052000	So that's all I'll say about that.
2053000	2055000	Anything else on Oculus and Facebook?
2055000	2057000	Hey hey hey Bobby.
2057000	2060000	That's not true. You kickstarted that project because you wanted a fucking Oculus Rift.
2060000	2062000	Wrong.
2062000	2069000	You kickstarted that project because you wanted to play virtual reality porn to fuck some sort of peripheral that would go with the Oculus Rift.
2069000	2071000	That was the other thing I wanted to say.
2071000	2073000	Thank you Bobby for reminding me of the boob tangent.
2073000	2076000	Because let's all hope, let's all pray.
2076000	2078000	Let's join hands for a minute.
2078000	2080000	Hold your hands out.
2080000	2082000	Bobby you're going to grab mine and we're going to say a prayer together.
2082000	2084000	To whatever you believe in.
2084000	2086000	To whatever it is you believe in.
2086000	2088000	Flying spaghetti monster, God, Buddha, whatever.
2088000	2090000	Pizza.
2090000	2092000	We're all going to pray to whatever it is that we believe in.
2092000	2096000	Facebook does not remove the 3D boobs.
2096000	2098000	Pray with me people.
2098000	2100000	They're not going to.
2100000	2102000	We get our 3D boobs.
2102000	2104000	They're not going to.
2104000	2106000	And the fact that they injected 2 billion dollars of money.
2106000	2108000	This is going to become a popular platform.
2109000	2111000	This is like next gen shit.
2111000	2114000	Maybe we haven't given Mark Zuckerberg enough credit.
2114000	2118000	Maybe he wants that type of porn just like all the rest of us do.
2118000	2123000	Isn't he just one of the guys after all?
2123000	2125000	I would like to have him come out and go listen.
2125000	2129000	You understand that this is just one step to the holodeck.
2129000	2131000	And that's all we want right?
2131000	2134000	That's what he needs to come out and say.
2134000	2136000	That's all we really want.
2136000	2139000	Once we have the holodeck, who gives a shit about anything else?
2139000	2142000	Alright, that's enough on the Oculus Facebook thing.
2142000	2145000	If you have an opinion on this, and I'm sure many of you do.
2145000	2147000	You can give us a call later on in the show.
2147000	2149000	1-877-GAMO-LR
2149000	2150000	Or of course you can always email us.
2150000	2151000	Mailbag.
2151000	2152000	Oh, excuse me. Nope, not anymore.
2152000	2155000	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com
2155000	2157000	No, send it to Mailbag.
2157000	2159000	You'll get a response, I promise.
2159000	2160000	It'll say bounce.
2160000	2161000	No, sorry.
2161000	2163000	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com
2163000	2167000	Hey look, you do one thing one way for 520 weeks of your life.
2167000	2169000	It takes a little while to change, okay?
2169000	2172000	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send those emails.
2172000	2173000	Alright.
2173000	2179000	Havok978 said, can you fuck a rift though?
2179000	2181000	And I was just thinking about wormholes.
2181000	2183000	That would be really weird.
2183000	2187000	Alan Alchemy looks like he's pitching a game here in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
2187000	2190000	3D baby oil standing wave ass cheeks volume 23.
2190000	2192000	Alright look, enough, enough people.
2192000	2198000	Let's get back to the actual video games in a segment we call How Is Your Gaming Week?
2198000	2201000	And what types of video games have you been playing this week?
2201000	2202000	Dark Sakura.
2202000	2204000	I didn't play Final Fantasy XIV.
2204000	2205000	Gasp.
2205000	2206000	I know, I need to.
2206000	2207000	They had a whole patch too.
2207000	2210000	I know, I patched it and then I got tired of waiting.
2210000	2211000	There's stuff and things.
2211000	2213000	I know, I know.
2213000	2216000	Well I patched it and then I was like, I don't want to talk.
2216000	2217000	Or don't want to play.
2217000	2225000	Anyway, I've been playing with modding since I reinstalled my older drivers, my Nvidia
2225000	2228000	drivers, I can now run text mod again except it suddenly stopped working.
2228000	2236000	So I've been playing through Mass Effect 3 again just because I wanted to redo the beginning
2236000	2243000	of the game and get some screen caps and I messed up and so far Liara thinks that my,
2244000	2245000	no.
2245000	2246000	No dating Liara.
2246000	2247000	Not me.
2247000	2251000	I will let other people, other friends of mine who are in chat right now, date Liara
2251000	2252000	all they want to.
2252000	2253000	No, not me.
2253000	2255000	But I totally respect your ship.
2255000	2257000	I just don't sail with it.
2257000	2262000	So anyway, I, hip starter.
2262000	2264000	See, I'll say that in chat.
2264000	2269000	Anyway, so I actually started a game today that I bought like a month ago called The
2269000	2277000	Shiva because I'm like, it's a video game based around Jewish concepts and there's murder.
2277000	2278000	I like it.
2278000	2282000	So it's actually pretty cool so far, but it's really depressing.
2282000	2290000	So I thought that I would cheer myself up by playing Dominique Pomplamoose and I didn't
2290000	2292000	really cheer myself up that much.
2292000	2297000	And yes, the pagan Jew, you can have all the Liara you want to.
2297000	2300000	So I played some of that today.
2300000	2302000	I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing.
2302000	2306000	I now have a bajillion blue roses and sorry, the giveaway was last week.
2306000	2311000	So to the lucky people who got blue roses for me, lucky you.
2313000	2321000	And then I've been playing mahjong during my breaks because video mahjong is actually kind of fun.
2321000	2324000	It's doing it like on this weird level system too.
2324000	2331000	I forgot what it's called, but it's like an app store game, not for the iOS, but for OS 10.
2331000	2335000	But it's like it takes you through different levels of mahjong tiles.
2335000	2342000	And then as you go through it, it adjusts your score based on how many times you ran out of tiles or how many times you ran out of matches.
2342000	2344000	And then it will reshuffle your tiles.
2344000	2345000	And it's kind of interesting.
2345000	2347000	It's sort of like level based mahjong.
2347000	2349000	It's pretty fun.
2351000	2352000	All right.
2352000	2353000	It sounds like that's it.
2353000	2354000	So let's go over to Loki.
2354000	2355000	How was your gaming week?
2356000	2360000	I played a little bit of Chroma, the alpha for that again.
2360000	2364000	Because I hadn't actually touched it in a few weeks and they'd made some changes at some new arenas and stuff.
2364000	2366000	So it was pretty cool.
2368000	2373000	Although, I think they tweaked something in the settings because my sensitivity...
2373000	2377000	Because I've always played with a controller and so I guess it would be mouse sensitivity.
2377000	2379000	It was way too high.
2379000	2382000	Like I was trying to target somebody and it's just like all over the damn place.
2382000	2389000	And because I don't really adjust sensitivity on controllers a lot of times, I wasn't sure if I needed to turn it up or turn it down.
2389000	2394000	And so I spent one of the only games I was playing of that trying to tweak that and get it right.
2394000	2395000	And I never did.
2395000	2396000	But it's fun.
2396000	2401000	It'll be cool once it's out of alpha and beta and actually playable.
2403000	2410000	And then I played a little bit of Modern Warfare 2 because we switched over to that from Modern Warfare 1.
2410000	2415000	Because we've played the hell out of Modern Warfare 3 already so we're playing the one we haven't hit up yet.
2415000	2419000	And I actually like it quite a bit because of all the different perks and stuff that they have in it.
2419000	2426000	It's a little bit different than Modern Warfare 3 where you can kind of customize your class to pretty much whatever you want.
2426000	2428000	Although they have a lot of things you can kind of exploit.
2428000	2431000	Like there's ways to get unlimited grenades and stuff like that.
2431000	2438000	But I've actually been playing with one of the default classes because I got into a mod game and it leveled myself up to 70.
2438000	2440000	And I feel bad for all the other people I'm playing with.
2440000	2442000	So I've been playing one of the preset classes.
2442000	2443000	But it's like a rushing class.
2443000	2447000	So you have unlimited sprint and I love it.
2447000	2448000	It's kind of fun.
2448000	2449000	So I've been playing that.
2449000	2453000	And then the game I've been looking forward to the most for like this entire month.
2453000	2455000	It might actually be probably two months.
2455000	2457000	Probably the first quarter of this year.
2457000	2458000	Goat Simulator.
2458000	2461000	The early access for that because I preordered it.
2461000	2462000	Goats!
2463000	2464000	I played the hell out of it.
2464000	2466000	I think I've played at least about four or five hours.
2466000	2472000	Although it says ten hours but that's because I left it paused because I was trying to get this one achievement.
2472000	2473000	You don't say.
2473000	2474000	Alright no I'm not going to do that again.
2474000	2477000	No but it's so ridiculous.
2477000	2479000	It's so broken.
2479000	2480000	I mean it's just...
2480000	2482000	It looks really funny just the little bit I saw you play.
2482000	2488000	It's pretty funny but like there's a lot of times like you'll break out of the new world geometry and get stuck in places.
2488000	2489000	And that's the whole point.
2489000	2491000	And I even got the achievement.
2491000	2493000	There's an achievement for the game crashing.
2493000	2494000	And it happened.
2494000	2497000	And so I got the achievement for that which is kind of funny.
2498000	2500000	It's just it's really stupid.
2500000	2501000	But here's the best part.
2501000	2503000	Like because they have the whole Steam Workshop stuff.
2503000	2505000	So people are adding all sorts of things to it.
2505000	2507000	They've got like new levels.
2507000	2509000	Well they haven't really played any of the new levels.
2509000	2511000	I tried one of them which is like a pinball level.
2511000	2513000	But it's all messed up.
2513000	2514000	Didn't quite work right.
2514000	2516000	But you can actually make your own levels.
2516000	2518000	It comes with an editor and stuff.
2518000	2521000	Although it's Unreal Engine so I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.
2521000	2523000	I was like I loaded the level up.
2523000	2525000	Okay I want to add something.
2525000	2527000	How do I do that?
2527000	2528000	I have no idea.
2528000	2530000	I'm going to copy paste this.
2530000	2532000	Ah crap I didn't copy all the things that are right there.
2534000	2535000	I give up.
2535000	2536000	That was about it.
2536000	2538000	It's like oh I'm going to make a really cool level.
2538000	2539000	No I'm not.
2539000	2541000	I'm not going to spend any more time on this.
2542000	2546000	And they've got a lot of they call these mutations that you can do in there.
2546000	2551000	So they have tall goat, feather goat, double goat.
2553000	2555000	Blue streak or blue goat.
2555000	2557000	And there's Yoshi goat.
2557000	2560000	So tall goat is a giraffe.
2560000	2561000	Which is hilarious.
2561000	2565000	And then feather goat of course is an ostrich.
2565000	2572000	Blue streak or I think it's like blue streak or blue goat or something is a Sonic type goat.
2572000	2575000	Where you keep hitting the spun button and he does a spin dash.
2575000	2577000	And he'll actually dash into the things.
2577000	2580000	There's one the Yoshi goat I haven't played as.
2580000	2584000	But apparently you can eat things and like throw a bomb.
2584000	2586000	Which sounds kind of funny.
2586000	2588000	And then people can make their own modifiers.
2588000	2591000	Like they've done one that will make you fat.
2591000	2593000	They have one that's called Australian goat.
2593000	2595000	And your goat's just upside down.
2595000	2600000	They have what else?
2600000	2602000	Like a teleportation thing that you can do.
2602000	2605000	But there's actually all sorts of weird stuff in the game.
2605000	2607000	Like you can get a rocket pack and fly around and stuff.
2607000	2610000	And you can become like the devil goat.
2610000	2616000	And it has this really crazy power where you can kind of suck things into a tornado.
2616000	2620000	And if you hit the ragdoll effect on that, he just goes flying up into space.
2620000	2623000	And it just looks really messed up.
2623000	2625000	But a fun game.
2625000	2627000	Just really broken.
2627000	2629000	But that's kind of the charm of it.
2629000	2631000	And here's the best part though.
2631000	2635000	Because of the Steam Workshop, someone's already working on a mod to add multiplayer.
2635000	2637000	It's not even out yet.
2637000	2639000	And someone's working on a multiplayer mod.
2639000	2642000	Because they said it wasn't possible and that would probably break the game.
2642000	2645000	But I can't wait to try that out.
2645000	2647000	That's it.
2647000	2650000	Oh no, I'm sorry. There was one other game I played.
2650000	2655000	Although it doesn't really play well on my laptop, I tried playing Frog Fractions.
2655000	2659000	The problem is with my touchpad, the way it works.
2660000	2670000	For some reason when I hit the keys to either do the typing or move around, the touchpad stops working for a second or something.
2670000	2675000	I try using them at the same time and it seems like I have to click back on the screen or something.
2675000	2677000	I don't know. It just doesn't seem to work right.
2677000	2682000	It worked fine on my work PC, but it just doesn't work at all on my laptop.
2682000	2684000	So I got frustrated and it stopped.
2684000	2688000	I don't know. I didn't play it enough for it to be really, really funny.
2688000	2691000	If you're going to go play Frog Fractions, you really need to say to yourself,
2691000	2697000	I'm going to stick with this for at least five minutes or you're going to miss the point.
2697000	2699000	That's all I'm going to say.
2699000	2703000	If you go to it and you play it for ten seconds and you're like, why is everybody whatever?
2703000	2709000	I did think it's funny though that they added a Kickstarter for Frog Fractions 2.
2709000	2713000	There's this whole ARG going on with the find the next Frog Fractions game.
2713000	2716000	Because they're not telling you what it is or anything.
2716000	2722000	But their stretch goal is two billion dollars, buy back Oculus from Facebook.
2722000	2723000	I thought that was funny.
2723000	2726000	Who says they'd sell it for two billion? Who knows.
2726000	2728000	Alright, my gaming week.
2728000	2733000	Honestly, because I was in the city this weekend visiting Grandpa from Hoard House.
2733000	2736000	We went and saw Drag Queens, which we'll talk about on this week's Hoard House.
2736000	2741000	Because we talk about online games and then apparently it sometimes turns into Drag Queen Jock.
2741000	2744000	But no, for real, as far as video games go, I haven't played as much.
2744000	2746000	Just because I've been a little busy.
2746000	2751000	But I was playing Final Fantasy XIV quite a bit with the whole patch and everything.
2751000	2753000	I was checking out what was new over there.
2753000	2756000	Like the challenge log was kind of fun to do some of those.
2756000	2759000	Especially the ones that are for the companion.
2759000	2763000	Because being able to have another way to get my Chocobo experience is very, very welcomed.
2763000	2764000	So that was a good thing.
2764000	2767000	I've also been playing on the PC Diablo 3.
2767000	2771000	The new expansion Reaper of Souls came out and I've been playing that.
2771000	2773000	And that has been a lot of fun too.
2773000	2775000	I'm not quite level 70 yet.
2775000	2778000	But I'm just making my way through Act 5 slowly but surely.
2778000	2781000	Some of my friends are already in the end game adventure mode stuff.
2781000	2783000	And they say it's great and I really want to get there myself.
2783000	2785000	So I've been playing a little bit more Diablo 3.
2785000	2790000	And then also still playing Final Fantasy X, the HD remaster on my PlayStation 3.
2790000	2793000	However, I finally got my copy of South Park today.
2793000	2798000	So I'm a little worried that that is going to take over the RPG on my PS3 for now.
2798000	2802000	So sorry to all my whiny Final Fantasy X characters.
2802000	2806000	But Cartman and the crew are going to take over for a little while I think.
2806000	2807000	They will.
2807000	2808000	So excited about that.
2808000	2809000	I need to go out and finish that.
2809000	2811000	So yeah, that's pretty much my gaming week.
2811000	2813000	Not a lot of new stuff.
2813000	2814000	Alright, some housekeeping.
2814000	2817000	Of course we always say, add us on Facebook.
2817000	2818000	Wink wink.
2818000	2820000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2820000	2824000	Because of course we do ask our interactive questions and interact with our community over there.
2824000	2827000	So I did talk about how it's changed communication, right?
2827000	2829000	So we like to communicate with you guys there.
2829000	2831000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2831000	2832000	We're also on Twitter.
2832000	2834000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2834000	2839000	And as far as I know, we are still here for the next few weeks.
2839000	2841000	We don't have any shows off planned as far as I know.
2841000	2845000	So if for whatever reason we end up with a week off in the near future, I'll let you know.
2845000	2847000	But for now, we're sticking with it.
2847000	2848000	We just moved in.
2848000	2850000	This is only our second show from these nice new digs.
2850000	2852000	We still got to break them in a little bit.
2852000	2854000	So we're going to figure out how we're going to use this TV over here.
2854000	2858000	If we want to put the chat room on the TV or if we're going to hook up some old school video games so we can play during the show.
2858000	2859000	I think for chat room.
2859000	2860000	For chat.
2860000	2861000	Yeah.
2861000	2862000	Because then I don't have to keep looking at this thing.
2862000	2863000	I mean, hi chat room.
2863000	2866000	Especially if we have guests in the studio.
2866000	2867000	It would be really good.
2867000	2868000	I kind of have.
2868000	2869000	So we'll see.
2869000	2873000	And we are throwing the ideas around about video.
2873000	2875000	And I'm not going to commit to anything.
2875000	2879000	So I'm just going to say it's more of a possibility in this space now than it was the old space.
2880000	2881000	Oh, I guess I should say.
2881000	2884000	I did finally hook up my PlayStation 4 camera.
2884000	2888000	Thank you to all of you out there in the wild who have been texting and tweeting me pictures of,
2888000	2890000	Hey look, PlayStation 4s are in stock everywhere.
2890000	2891000	So, yeah.
2891000	2895000	I mean, if you still want a PlayStation 4 camera, they're apparently super easy to find now.
2895000	2898000	I guess they really were holding them for the Japanese launch.
2898000	2901000	Because it seems like after that happened, they started showing up again.
2901000	2903000	Please do not buy one at GameStop.
2903000	2907000	However, because I thought that was really shitty how they marked up the price $10 because they were hard to find.
2907000	2909000	So they're at every other retailer right now though.
2909000	2912000	So buy your PlayStation 4 camera if you want one.
2912000	2920000	I haven't done any live streaming, but I did play the playroom a little bit.
2920000	2923000	Which was silly, as you'd expect.
2923000	2931000	I mean, the technology is kind of neat, but it's more of a tech demo than a game.
2931000	2934000	It didn't compel you to get naked on the camera.
2934000	2938000	It seems to compel these other people for some reason on stream.
2938000	2941000	Thought about it, but then I said, you know what?
2941000	2943000	That would be indecent.
2943000	2952000	Anyhow, let us get into some gaming news, of which there's a lot going on besides just the Oculus Rift sale thing.
2952000	2953000	There's a lot going on this week.
2953000	2955000	So, Loki, why don't you start us off?
2955000	2965000	Yes, lots of things, including investments in social media and the game developers and the like.
2965000	2970000	Of course, Facebook took a little bit of a hit when they announced that they were buying the Oculus.
2970000	2976000	I guess they were down, I guess, 4.5, what was it, 451.
2976000	2979000	So that's not a ton.
2979000	2981000	And it's usually just the knee-jerk reaction stuff.
2981000	2985000	Especially, you know, people are going to be jumping back in when they see that it's actually going to be worthwhile.
2985000	2988000	And then, of course, Candy Crush Saga.
2988000	2995000	The developer, King, they had their IPO this week, which I know I saw lots of pictures from that.
2995000	3006000	And I guess it originally went from their initial, I don't remember how much they were charging for,
3006000	3016000	but it went down 15.5% of its value, down to $3.50, or I guess a total of $3.50 down to $19 a share.
3016000	3018000	So I'm not sure what it is.
3018000	3021000	King needs to prove that they're not a one-trick pony. That's what it is.
3021000	3026000	Everybody thinks, you know, because I think a lot of people felt very burned by the Zynga thing.
3026000	3033000	I watched, because I was bored on Friday, and I was doing a lot of order entry, so I tend to listen to things.
3033000	3038000	Not necessarily podcasts, but a lot of these GDC talks and stuff like that.
3038000	3042000	So I actually listened to one. It was from 2012.
3042000	3049000	I don't remember exactly the conference, but it's basically the guy that helped the folks that made Temple Run
3049000	3053000	port it over to Unity and put it out there.
3053000	3060000	And he talked about how a game like Temple Run, you don't know what's going to be successful.
3060000	3065000	A lot of people don't know. They put out about 50 other games before Temple Run,
3065000	3070000	and they didn't even think that it was going to be that big of a game.
3070000	3073000	They had actually put more effort into another game that launched kind of before it.
3073000	3077000	So you never know, and that's the kind of thing.
3077000	3080000	It's the exact same story with Flappy Bird, but Flappy Bird is one guy.
3080000	3082000	Or even Candy Crush Saga.
3082000	3086000	Well, Candy Crush Saga is kind of a rip-off of a bunch of other stuff, but you don't know.
3086000	3092000	It could be very well. They could put out another 50 games and still not have the same success that they did with Candy Crush Saga.
3092000	3097000	I mean, you don't know. That's why it's so risky to kind of invest in this stuff.
3097000	3102000	Well, here's the thing. If King.com really wants to get to the next level with their stock,
3102000	3108000	then all they need to do is click on the button to order a special blue lollipop that will help enhance their stock value.
3108000	3112000	Otherwise, they're never going to be able to clear this level.
3113000	3117000	You're a victim of your own success. You made your bed. Lie in it.
3117000	3122000	Anyway, yeah. Good luck, I guess, to King.com. You're going to need it.
3122000	3127000	And then I was also going to say that, you know, to kind of go along with King,
3127000	3137000	you may remember in Europe, they pulled back on trying to register it as a trademark for Saga.
3137000	3143000	But they still have, I guess, they're attempting to trademark the term candy.
3143000	3147000	Didn't they acquire that from somebody else? Like, that was the deal with candy.
3147000	3153000	Yeah, I think they had, was it ZeptoLab or something like that?
3153000	3163000	ZeptoLab is the studio that has cut the rope, and they're actually trying to fight the whole candy trademark.
3164000	3171000	I don't even know why someone would own that in the first place, even if it was something that they bought at someone else's IP or something.
3171000	3178000	It just doesn't make any sense. But apparently, King was trying to trademark the word candy in US.
3178000	3185000	And I guess they think they got it in Europe, but they're kind of fighting them, I guess, for it.
3186000	3192000	And of course, King says, you know, this does not affect our Europe trademark for candy,
3192000	3195000	and we continue to take all appropriate steps to protect our IP.
3195000	3201000	No, your IP is Candy Crush Saga. Your IP is not candy or crush or saga.
3201000	3207000	See, I don't understand how they would even be able to give them that.
3207000	3212000	Or even, like, just the word saga. Just like Ville. You can't trademark Ville.
3212000	3219000	None of us understand it, Loki. That's why we're all sitting here going, they really need to revisit how this whole system works.
3219000	3226000	Because we do not live in the same day and age that we did 50 years ago, 60 years ago, when a lot of this stuff was first, you know, last visited.
3226000	3229000	That's the big problem. Anyway.
3229000	3230000	I don't know.
3230000	3235000	Alright, well, moving on to a different note here. This is actually kind of a follow-up from my Game Developers Conference.
3235000	3240000	This is some other information that came out of one of the talks, and, you know, there's been a lot of talk.
3240000	3247000	We even got into it a little bit on last week's show, but Igarashi is the producer of the Castlevania series, or at least was for a very long time.
3247000	3254000	Moved on to the social games, which he wasn't finding the same, you know, I guess, rewards with doing.
3254000	3262000	So he left Konami. But he was doing some talks at GDC, and of course, you know, some people want to know about the whole Metroidvania thing.
3262000	3266000	Where did that come from? Where did, you know, where did Metroidvania start and so forth?
3266000	3271000	And what was interesting is that he talked about, you know, how he took over Castlevania and so forth.
3271000	3278000	And one of the goals that they wanted to accomplish was that they wanted to increase the amount of time that people would spend playing the game.
3278000	3281000	Because you remember, the older Castlevanias were all like stages. It was all like stages.
3281000	3283000	So they wanted something that would extend the life a little bit.
3283000	3287000	So Igarashi said, quote, we really wanted to extend the life of the game.
3287000	3293000	And the one game that popped up in our heads was Legend of Zelda, an exploration-filled action game.
3293000	3297000	Pretty much our entire team, including myself, were huge fans of the game.
3297000	3299000	And we wanted to make something very similar.
3299000	3304000	So now you know the origin of inspiration actually wasn't Metroid.
3304000	3308000	And he talks about, with the name Metroidvania, I like the name and I respect it.
3308000	3310000	And I like the meaning behind it. It fits very well.
3310000	3316000	So I'm actually kind of honored that Metroid, the name, is attached to Castlevania and then it morphed into this one word.
3316000	3317000	So I liked it very much.
3317000	3322000	But in reality, Castlevania Symphony of the Night was a Zeldavania game.
3322000	3327000	But it's, we're not, we don't care what your inspiration was for the game.
3327000	3331000	We're just saying that this game and this game look similar.
3331000	3337000	Thus, Metroidvania, it has nothing to do with what your inspiration was.
3337000	3340000	Your inspiration could have been tacos and we're not going to call it Takovania.
3340000	3341000	It doesn't make any fucking sense.
3341000	3343000	I want to call it Takovania.
3346000	3350000	I hope now that he's moved on, he can make Takovania.
3350000	3351000	I almost said Takovania.
3351000	3352000	I would fully support that.
3353000	3354000	I would like Takovania.
3354000	3363000	You can play the classic taco hunter, Dark Sakura, as she crawls through the castle looking for tacos and all the ingredients.
3363000	3365000	Guys, stop it. I forgot to bring dinner. I don't want tacos.
3366000	3367000	I'm sorry.
3367000	3368000	Tell Ellen to bring us tacos.
3369000	3373000	You know, during the break, there's a Jim Boyz like literally right at the tree.
3373000	3375000	Ew! No, I want good tacos.
3376000	3378000	Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3378000	3387000	Jim Boyz, I always associate with crushing intestinal pain, so no. No.
3387000	3388000	They're crushing with flavor.
3390000	3394000	No, it's crushing with my body trying to kill itself.
3394000	3397000	They put Parmesan cheese on their tacos. I think it's delicious.
3398000	3402000	It is. I know it sounds so weird, but that's what they have on the shelves.
3403000	3404000	They're delicious.
3405000	3406000	I'm with you. They're great.
3406000	3413000	Anyway, yet another company that's not paying us to endorse our product, but in the case of Dark Sakura, she's saying, stay away, it'll give you diarrhea.
3413000	3416000	No, no, no, no, no. It gives you the opposite of diarrhea.
3417000	3419000	You will not leave the bathroom for two hours.
3420000	3426000	So my wife wanted me to try the Ritz crackers that taste like bacon, or I'm sorry, they cleanly taste like bacon.
3426000	3428000	You know what they taste like? Hot dogs.
3429000	3432000	They seriously, they give you, they have that hot dog aftertaste.
3432000	3436000	I'm like, and that's the thing, I'm all, this doesn't really taste like bacon. I'm like, it kind of tastes like hot dogs.
3436000	3438000	She's like, you know what? It does.
3439000	3442000	So they should just market them as Ritz hot dogs.
3443000	3456000	At Deft in our chat room, at Deft, our friendly neighborhood Mexican, as he calls himself, over at live.vognetwork.com says, Guacamelee is kind of taco-vania if you think about it.
3457000	3466000	For the record, I would like to say that I did not see an Adelbertos on the way here. I saw an El Forastero, which was part of Adelbertos a while back.
3466000	3474000	There's, there's, it's all something bare-toes in this town anymore. Anyway, we're not a food podcast, we're a video game podcast.
3474000	3476000	Oh, dinner. I want dinner.
3476000	3478000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3478000	3480000	A bunch of fuckery, that's what I have next.
3481000	3488000	So, remember Leland E? Remember how we all laughed when he got arrested?
3490000	3495000	Well, that was earlier this week. We haven't, we haven't had the chance to laugh at his arrest here on the show yet.
3495000	3499000	So, if we all could take a minute, let's just take a minute to laugh.
3499000	3521000	So, if anyone who doesn't know who this guy is, basically, he tried to pass all this anti-video game legislation and, you know, violence. Anyway, so yeah, he was arrested for a bribery and corruption.
3521000	3526000	And on top of that, one of the things that he was involved in were rocket launchers.
3526000	3531000	Yeah, he was trying to bring in guns for, like, some New Jersey mafia or something like that.
3531000	3546000	He was basically associated with Raymond Chow, who ran the Chi Kung Tong, I hope I pronounced that right, basically Chinese mafia. And yeah, trying to get in rocket launchers.
3546000	3554000	Now, in his defense, you guys, I'm going to say something in Leland E's defense. In his defense, he learned it all from Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars.
3554000	3558000	Yes, he did. Video games are the blame for everything.
3558000	3560000	It's completely the video game's fault, after all.
3560000	3570000	Yeah, the whole point is, he didn't want anyone moving in on his business. You know, other people could learn these entrepreneurial skills from Grand Theft Auto, and they could be moving in on his territory.
3571000	3586000	Well, at any rate, basically, he was caught by an undercover agent who said he was looking to buy firearms, and basically, sort of like a number of redirections.
3586000	3595000	So there was a check made out to ye through an intermediary, and yeah, so forth and so on. Bitch got caught.
3596000	3603000	This is what you get for wasting San Francisco's money, and for being a total hypocrite douchebag.
3603000	3614000	Like, the thing about this is, is that even though we had a good little joke here where we laughed about it, this whole thing actually makes me like legitimately angry.
3614000	3623000	And I'm not necessarily from the Bay Area, but I'm super close, so this guy was sort of the representative and everything of the area, and it just, this whole thing makes me so angry.
3623000	3634000	Not only did he waste our tax- he wasted the taxpayer dollars on a law that was never gonna fly, because you can't vaguely define what is and isn't a mature game.
3634000	3641000	The kid should- that was the biggest flaw of the law, is that it's not up to the government to determine, in vague sense, what is and isn't mature.
3641000	3643000	Or violent, I think is what, yeah.
3643000	3653000	So not only did he waste our money with that, but now there's all this- now it's more waste of money, and now it's this whole stupid, ridiculous process where they can't throw him out on his ass,
3653000	3664000	they just suspend him without- or they suspend him with pay, because technically, okay, you're innocent until proven guilty, but you know, it's 170-something pages and he dropped out of the secretary-
3664000	3676000	I mean, I realize you're innocent until proven guilty in this country, but where there's smoke, there's fire, and is anyone kind of looking at this going- has he come out and said, I'm innocent? Has that happened?
3676000	3687000	Well, for anyone who's interested, I actually did post a copy of the FBI affidavit in chat that comes from, of all things, our local newspaper, the Sacramento Bee,
3687000	3695000	which isn't, you know, where I got my news from, but the whole thing is posted there if you want to read it in its entirety.
3695000	3708000	Yeah, and it just, you know, there's a big thing that I've noticed a lot lately amongst politicians, that the ones who cry out the loudest against something are the ones who are deep in it.
3708000	3716000	Right? It's like those senators that are like, we have to pass all these laws to protect America from the homosexuals, and they're giving him-
3716000	3718000	And they're fucking people in the men's room.
3718000	3725000	And they're giving handjobs in airport restrooms. Like, which, by the way, I would never do, and I am a homosexual.
3725000	3730000	Because you have a problem with your sexuality and have identity issues.
3730000	3731000	Clearly.
3731000	3739000	Don't inflict your issues on other people in your attempt to deny what you can't accept within yourself. The end.
3739000	3740000	So this whole time-
3740000	3741000	Politicians.
3741000	3742000	Leland Yee-
3742000	3744000	Was fucking a rocket launcher.
3744000	3746000	Loved Grand Theft Auto IRL.
3746000	3747000	IRL.
3747000	3754000	But there's a difference between a video game and IRL. Anyway.
3754000	3759000	Yeah, those rocket launchers will actually blow up people for real, and then you'll be a murderer.
3759000	3764000	He still may end up in the video game because they like the parody real life stuff in Grand Theft Auto, so.
3764000	3768000	Yeah, don't give this guy any fucking attention. Let's just put him away.
3769000	3784000	You know what? If he wants to gain back any iota of respect, any sliver, any spec molecule of respect, he needs to come out and just say,
3784000	3787000	Yeah, I did it. And this is why.
3787000	3789000	I don't care why.
3789000	3793000	It was because I played violent video games, and this is why we need to pass this law.
3793000	3799000	I don't really give a shit why they do shitty things. They just need to say, Hey, I did something shitty and I know it's shitty.
3799000	3800000	Yes.
3800000	3801000	I don't care why they did it.
3801000	3808000	And be a fucking man and stop letting the government pay you to commit crimes.
3808000	3809000	Be an adult.
3809000	3810000	Yes.
3810000	3811000	Because gender has nothing to do with it.
3811000	3813000	Fair enough.
3814000	3815000	Alright.
3817000	3819000	Moving on. Loki, change of pace.
3819000	3820000	Alright.
3821000	3826000	So, let's see. Let's talk a little bit about the Nvidia Shield.
3826000	3832000	And the Nvidia Shield, you know, it's just getting a price drop here in April.
3832000	3835000	They're dropping $100 to $199.
3835000	3838000	And along with that, they're getting remote game streaming.
3838000	3845000	And, you know, what's kind of cool about this is, you know, this is supposed to allow you to stream your games from your PC.
3846000	3852000	Of course, PC with a high-end Nvidia card because I believe that is the only thing that supports the Nvidia Shield.
3852000	3857000	And, you know, not only can you do that, you can also play Android games on it.
3857000	3862000	And what's something that they just announced for the Nvidia Shield?
3862000	3864000	But none other than Portal.
3864000	3865000	That's right, Portal.
3865000	3870000	And this is going to be a special version of the game that's actually going to be running on Android.
3870000	3878000	And the best part about that is, not only will it be coming to the Nvidia Shield, but it will be coming to other Android devices at probably a later time.
3878000	3884000	So, no word on when exactly that's coming out, but that's pretty cool.
3884000	3885000	I can't wait to play Portal on my phone.
3885000	3888000	Of course, my luck, it probably won't run on my phone.
3888000	3894000	But I look forward to the idea that I could play Portal on a phone if I got a newer phone.
3894000	3896000	Because I think that would be pretty awesome.
3897000	3900000	I hope it's a new Portal and not just something that they port over.
3900000	3909000	Although I think it's probably just going to be a port of the first Portal game because it might be a little too hard to do the other stuff.
3909000	3912000	I don't know, what do you think? Would you play Portal on your phone?
3912000	3916000	No, because playing games on the phone is awful.
3916000	3919000	Now, does the Nvidia Shield thing have the controller and stuff built into it?
3919000	3920000	Yes.
3920000	3927000	Well, that might be a little more tolerable, but I don't necessarily feel the need to replay something just because it's the handheld experience.
3927000	3929000	Do they add new stuff to the game?
3929000	3931000	I have no idea. They just announced it's Portal.
3931000	3937000	Hey, Portal's a great game, and for the few of you that still haven't played it, I guess this is another way to do it.
3937000	3945000	I think this is more of a step to try to kind of legitimatize this Nvidia Shield thing, which is in this weird kind of limbo place right now.
3945000	3949000	I saw it at Fry's when I went and picked up my laptop a little bit ago.
3949000	3961000	It's not really getting that same X factor that people are reporting on it and talking about it the way that the DS or even the Vita. People aren't really adopting it like that.
3962000	3977000	It just doesn't look that great. I can't see myself spending $200 on maybe $100 if it would work on streaming games for my PC without having to have a high-end Nvidia card.
3977000	3984000	Because I have a laptop. This laptop doesn't happen to have an Nvidia card, and even if it did, it probably still wouldn't support the streaming.
3984000	3995000	Or maybe have an external device that plugs into HDMI or something like that, and you stream with that locally within your house or something. That would be cool.
3995000	3998000	But I don't think it's going to happen.
3999000	4007000	Alright. Let's move on and talk about the... Oh god, this is so irritating.
4007000	4014000	We've had stories about this type of thing before. We've kind of talked about this, but this is just more like...
4014000	4019000	It's like actually you see bigger websites doing this. It's really infuriating.
4019000	4023000	What I'm talking about is the reselling of Humble Bundle games.
4023000	4033000	The Humble Bundle exists to support charity. Yes, it does end up supporting developers, especially when it's usually the indie developers.
4033000	4037000	Once in a while, I think the THQ bundle was like half charity.
4037000	4038000	EA.
4038000	4044000	Well, usually EA's. You can't choose to give any money to EA. It's all for charity and Humble Tip.
4044000	4049000	I don't usually think the developers are even offered to get a cut in that case.
4049000	4059000	But we all know that a big chunk of the reason why people do Humble Bundle is it's great games at a great price, and I can choose to give all of it to charity if I want.
4059000	4062000	Or I get to choose basically where the money goes.
4062000	4068000	So that's what makes this kind of shit infuriating. It's always for a limited time, because developers don't necessarily want to do that forever.
4068000	4071000	And they shouldn't have to. A developer's got to eat too, right?
4071000	4075000	So it makes it really infuriating when companies come around and resell those keys.
4075000	4079000	And we've heard of the cases where the games are being sold on eBay and all this stuff this week.
4079000	4087000	Well, apparently there was another PC Games digital distributor, 7 Entertainment, that was basically shown as doing this this week.
4087000	4092000	And they were on this site, and 7 Entertainment owns the site.
4092000	4097000	It's Fast2Play, Kingwin, G2Play, and a bunch of other sites as well.
4097000	4107000	I have never heard of any of these. I hate to say it, I might not be giving a break to a smaller indie store or whatever, but all these things sound shady as fuck.
4107000	4111000	Especially if I see something like this on there, I'm going to question that right away.
4111000	4115000	So, yeah, kind of messed up.
4115000	4121000	And they were talking about, you know, what can we, there's chatter on the internet about what can we kind of do to stop this.
4121000	4127000	Now Humble Bundle has gone to the lengths of, now when you redeem your Steam keys, you don't actually have a key anymore.
4127000	4131000	You click the button and it's instantly redeemed to your account, or you can gift it to somebody else.
4131000	4134000	So that supposedly will cut into a lot of this as well.
4134000	4138000	But, here's the thing though, isn't it? Yeah, we're talking about the Humble Bundle here.
4138000	4149000	However, there's plenty of other bundle sites that do these keys, and those sites haven't gone to the, you know, instant redeeming thing on Humble Bundle.
4149000	4154000	It's just, you know, they will give you a key, and they'll give you like multiple keys.
4154000	4158000	They'll give you a Disurrer key, they'll give you a Steam key, you know, all that stuff.
4158000	4168000	So, I can see where someone can go in and spam, you know, I'm going to buy this for a dollar, and then get a bunch of keys, and then go and resell them.
4169000	4181000	Now, just to be, make sure I cover all the angles here, in a statement to GameInformer.com, 7 Entertainment did reach out to them with a statement, and they did say in their statement that,
4181000	4187000	Kinguin is a digital platform for vendors from all around the world to sell their digital goods.
4187000	4191000	If you can put it simple, Kinguin is like an eBay for gamers.
4191000	4197000	We have already contacted vendors selling those products in order to receive some information regarding the origin of those keys.
4197000	4201000	We're sure that this situation will be resolved within next week.
4201000	4211000	That's, I have a feeling that, you know, that statement is coming from somebody who probably doesn't use English as a first language, because there are some missing words here.
4211000	4218000	Our Terms of Service is really clear, it's prohibited to sell games commonly offered as free, or games from any charity events.
4218000	4223000	And then they, you know, move on to say, we support the Humble Bundle, da da da, we'll take care of it, type of thing.
4223000	4229000	Which, you know, okay, good on them for doing the right thing, but I have to say this too.
4229000	4238000	We need to, as the gamers, it's very important that not only should we report this kind of fuckery when we see it,
4238000	4242000	it is so important that we don't support it.
4242000	4247000	Because here's the thing, these resellers wouldn't exist if people weren't buying them.
4247000	4252000	And we have to resist the temptation of, oh, I can get the game at such a low cost.
4252000	4258000	You know, it's like the old piracy argument, you know, yeah, you can get the game for free, but at what cost, really?
4258000	4260000	You know what I mean?
4260000	4269000	So, I think we as the gamers have to accept some responsibility too in resolving this situation that we don't support these sales of buttons when we see them.
4269000	4270000	True.
4270000	4275000	And I don't think any of our listeners would do that, but keep your ears out, because maybe other people you know and people you know.
4275000	4284000	At the same time though, I mean, it's almost the same as just going and purchasing them for like a dollar, you know, when the Humble Bundle thing comes out.
4284000	4293000	I mean, you can do that, you're within your rights to do that, granted that they want you to pay more than a dollar, but they have that minimum there.
4293000	4306000	So, I don't know, is it not a good, I mean, the fact that they're exploiting it and maybe using like a bot or something to purchase multiple dollar sets of keys and stuff.
4306000	4318000	Okay, that's wrong, but I would say purchasing a game from a site that's reselling it, I don't know if that's necessarily, I mean, yeah, you could be giving more money to the publisher,
4318000	4328000	but at the same time, it's, one person is having that copy of the game, it's not like they're pirating it, it's just that they should be paying the developer more for it,
4328000	4334000	but then again, then you can make the whole argument, well then you shouldn't be buying games through the Humble Bundle, you should be buying games straight from the developer.
4334000	4335000	So, I don't know.
4335000	4345000	I just think the morally wrong part would be just, you know, the fact that they're reselling keys, but I wouldn't necessarily fault anybody that's purchasing games that are inexpensive,
4345000	4352000	because, let's be honest, a lot of stuff that's on Steam is very inexpensive, at different places, at different times, for different reasons.
4352000	4360000	I mean, if you don't know where the keys came from or anything like that, or maybe, you know, there's probably people out there, again, not the type of people that listen to our show,
4360000	4368000	but there's probably a lot of people out there that don't know what the Humble Bundle is, so they see, oh, cheap game, they buy it, and you know, they're just ignorant, basically, to the situation,
4368000	4376000	that is a tricky moral ground. But if you do know better, and you still continue to support it, well, I hope you feel good about yourself.
4378000	4381000	That's all I really have to say about that. What else can I say?
4381000	4384000	A lot of ignorance can also be willful.
4386000	4388000	Alright, let's move on.
4388000	4391000	Dark Soccer, I think you have the next story for us.
4391000	4401000	I do. This is actually something about the UK copyright law, which sort of goes with games. I mean, it's something that's to be kept in mind.
4401000	4411000	But it will be legal to rip CDs, DVDs, and other media within the UK. There's a guide for what constitutes legal and what doesn't.
4411000	4416000	The quote actually comes out from the Intellectual Property Office.
4442000	4444000	So, or sharing the rights.
4448000	4450000	So that is interesting.
4453000	4457000	Do you think this is, what do you think is going to be the long-term impact for us over here in the US?
4457000	4478000	Hopefully, they'll, you know, usually what happens in one country gets evaluated by another. I'd like to see, you know, but we've got, you know, facilities over here that are just completely lose their shit when anyone thinks that anything they might remotely own intellectual rights to could be duplicated or shared elsewhere.
4478000	4486000	So, I would even go as far as to say that we're a very greedy society that wouldn't be considering the possibility.
4488000	4489000	Alright.
4497000	4504000	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out soon as we check out release dates. Loki starting in the US.
4505000	4524000	Well, there is a few things coming up this week. Starting off with Ragnarok Odyssey Ace for the Playstation 3 and the Vita. MLB 14 The Show on PS3 and Vita also if you want to get MLB 14 The Show and you also want a basketball game.
4524000	4541000	They have the Playstation Sports Pack Volume 1 which includes MLB 14 The Show and NBA 2K14 for PS3 and that's like I guess $89.99 so you would save a total of 30 bucks maybe?
4541000	4546000	I don't know. It's not that much. Probably could find a used copy of NBA 2K cheaper than that.
4546000	4553000	And last but not least, also coming out on Friday, The Elder Scrolls Online for PC.
4556000	4562000	Oh, and the most important release of the week of course would be on Tuesday, April 1st, Goat Simulator coming out on Steam.
4564000	4565000	That's it.
4566000	4578000	Alright, traveling to Japan and checking out what's going on over there. On the Playstation 4, Natural Doctrine comes out in a regular and Omochidashi pack. That's on the Playstation 4 this week.
4578000	4588000	On the Xbox One, I don't know why I'm seeing things listed for the various months but yet that system is not out until September. I guess they're just starting to load those things in the system. I don't know.
4589000	4598000	Anyway, on the Playstation 3 this week, Natural Doctrine is out there as well. Looks like there's a lot more on April 10th but that is all you have for the 3rd.
4599000	4610000	Same deal with the 360 and the Vita also has Natural Doctrine. That is there as well. And on the 3DS, nothing.
4611000	4620000	On the Wii U though, you get Just Dance Wii U, the Japanese version. So I guess it's kind of a slow week in Japan for releases.
4621000	4630000	We have a similarly slow week in the UK. We have on the 31st, Age of Wonders 3 and then on April 1st, Goat Simulator. That's all it's given me.
4631000	4640000	So have fun with those goats. The feathery goats and the tall goats. All the goats. Goat all the things.
4641000	4645000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys then the classic game of the week.
4646000	4660000	Yes, so I kind of talked a little bit last week about how the Wii U is becoming completely irrelevant and they keep stripping things away from it that were kind of exclusive to it and made it kind of interesting.
4660000	4676000	Well, here's yet another thing. The human element. You may remember that as kind of like the, I guess, emotion driven, zombie, survivor horror game that is supposed to be coming out in 2015.
4677000	4687000	I remember they announced this a while back and there was a Kickstarter and all that stuff. Well, one of the things that is supposed to be coming to the Uya was an exclusive prequel to the human element.
4687000	4710000	That's been cancelled. That's not coming anymore. They originally, Robert Bowling actually donated $10,000 to the Uya Kickstarter at the time and they were saying it was going to be the first console exclusive for the Uya and yeah. Not going to happen. Because Uya doesn't matter anymore.
4710000	4722000	So Uya is starting to lose a little more and more, huh? Was there still supposed to be another version of Uya coming? I thought there was a smaller second release.
4723000	4725000	Uya 2.0 or something like that. I don't even know if that's happening anymore.
4726000	4727000	You think it's going to buck the trend?
4727000	4744000	I think that it's going to become just another app store or something. I think the only unique thing would be if it would run also on PC. Then you could have your Android games on PC and stuff. That would be kind of cool.
4744000	4759000	Granted, they already have emulators for that stuff, but I don't know. I just don't really see the point anymore. Because it's so easy to develop for Android or for PC. A lot of people are just going the PC Steam route.
4759000	4774000	Alright, one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. This is definitely not something we had back in the classic game days, but it's definitely an interesting spin on what our modern gaming world puts us in.
4774000	4792000	And that is your reputation online. And certainly Xbox has always had it. And to be fair, PlayStation Network to a point as well in any online interaction has somewhat of a bad stigma of people that get on there and just troll people, abuse people, say bad language and all this stuff.
4793000	4801000	And let's be real, the Xbox 360's little feedback and rating system really didn't do shit to change any of that. At least not in any of my experience and I don't know if anybody feels differently.
4801000	4809000	But Microsoft is trying to do some different things with the Xbox One. After all, the whole reputations do not carry over from the Xbox 360.
4810000	4818000	So here's what's going to happen is that warnings will begin to fall out if your reputation falls into the needs work category based on feedback from other members of the community.
4819000	4827000	This is all by the way in a post that Microsoft put on their Xbox Wire blog saying, quote, these warnings are based on community feedback collected since the Xbox One launched.
4827000	4842000	Now Microsoft does plan to introduce rewards for good behavior, but if you fall into the avoid me category, like you're so bad and everybody is saying that you are a terrible person and need to get off the internet,
4843000	4856000	you will see things happen such as, quote, reduced matchmaking pairings and the ability will be revoked to use certain privileges such as Twitch broadcasting.
4857000	4867000	So yes, if you are the type to get on there and say words that start with F and N and all these things, you know, you shouldn't be screaming on Xbox Live at people you don't know,
4868000	4882000	then you are possibly going to not be able to broadcast on Twitch TV from your Xbox One. You will lose those privileges young man or young woman and you will go to bed hungry or something.
4882000	4885000	I don't know, like they are going to start punishing people.
4886000	4898000	Now of course there is a part of me that kind of thinks, well, wait a minute, could this be used for bad too? I mean could a bunch of people start to gang up on somebody's gamer tag?
4899000	4909000	Like let's say I put out my gamer tag and I might have my share of haters out there on the internet. I mean any of us podcasters do, big or small, we all got haters, right?
4909000	4918000	What if all those haters banded together and wanted to like screw over my Xbox profile? Can they do that? I mean I don't know enough about Xbox, I don't have an Xbox One so I guess I don't need to worry about it right now.
4919000	4925000	But can they do that? I mean could a bunch of people like band together to screw somebody's reputation over to take away certain privileges?
4926000	4932000	Maybe put an algorithm in place before, you know, they have to like check, because I would think you would have to play with that person.
4933000	4935000	Or be like randomly matched with them first, right? I would hope.
4935000	4942000	Because it would be kind of weird that, you know, just some random person that's never met you or never played with you is like being able to vote you down and stuff.
4943000	4952000	And if it's anything like the Xbox 360 was, when you play with those people, like I used to do that all the time and Grant had thought it, especially people that disconnect early from games.
4953000	4960000	I would always rank them down because it was fucking frustrating. Those are my kills. I fucking killed you a ton and you're going to drop from the game?
4960000	4967000	I always use the 360 ranking too for people that dropped early from matches because I was beating them. It's very frustrating, you know.
4968000	4973000	Let's see, SSG100Matt saying entire Call of Duty etc clans could take down somebody's rep.
4974000	4983000	And TigerClaw asking the same question over at live.vognetware.com. How is Microsoft going to know if all that system doesn't see any false reports? This could be open to abuse.
4984000	4988000	And then let's see, SSG100Matt says this won't do shit either, I feel.
4989000	5002000	So, we'll see. I'm curious. I think it's very interesting how they tie all the privileges and stuff into that. I just hope there's some sort of way we can filter the false reports.
5003000	5004000	And have those people get punished.
5005000	5024000	What if someone knows PewDiePie's gamertag or something like that and says, hey, we're going to knock off his Twitch stream because, you know, we're going to knock off his Twitch stream by banning his, you know, whatever.
5024000	5032000	But then again, that also doesn't really stop you from Twitch streaming because you could always use an external device to do that. And I think a lot of people would probably do that anyways.
5033000	5041000	But, I don't know. I guess they have to have some sort of repercussions for acting like a douche, but I don't think it's really going to matter.
5041000	5055000	My thought is that if these are perhaps related to video timestamp, it'd give a way to be able to prove that so-and-such had done something.
5056000	5062000	Oh, I guess that's true that the Xbox One is constantly recording you, right? Or is it doing that? Or is that just PlayStation 4?
5063000	5065000	It could technically record you, I guess.
5065000	5074000	But the thought is that, well, and as far as I was aware, anything that went out on Twitch was sort of recorded anyway, server-side.
5075000	5079000	So the fact remains that they'd still be able to pull a timestamp off of reporting versus...
5080000	5081000	Although you may not be broadcasting on Twitch.
5082000	5083000	True.
5083000	5091000	I mean, it may affect your Twitch privileges, but certainly I bet there's people out there that are dumb enough to do a scheme like this while they're broadcasting live.
5092000	5097000	I'm certain there's somebody dumb enough to try that. To show off how badass they are to all their friends, you know?
5098000	5105000	You'd be the ultimate douchebaggery from Microsoft if they offered you like, hey, spend $20 and you can give those privileges back.
5105000	5112000	Don't give them ideas. Be quiet. Settle down over there.
5113000	5122000	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane. Let's go back to, you know, if you didn't like the way somebody was treating you when you played a game together, you threw them out of your house.
5123000	5127000	That was how it worked. We're going to go back to a more simple time in games.
5127000	5143000	It's the classic game of the week. Every week Dark Soccer goes into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should like be playing this. Stop calling each other names on Xbox Live and go play a real game.
5144000	5145000	Yeah, call people names in person.
5146000	5147000	That's right.
5148000	5149000	While you're playing this game, because you will.
5150000	5152000	It's the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5152000	5156000	The classic game of the week is Fighters Megamix, which I'm so sorry.
5157000	5158000	What do you mean you're so sorry?
5159000	5161000	Because this game is kind of shit, but it's amazing.
5162000	5166000	Basically, it came out in 1996. It had no arcade release. It came out directly on Saturn.
5167000	5175000	And it's a fighting game that was developed by AM2 only for the Sega Saturn. Okay, and the Gamecom, but no one counts the Gamecom because that was utter shit.
5175000	5180000	But it has different characters from different Sega series such as Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers.
5181000	5185000	It has Janet from Virtua Cop 2 and the Hornet Car from Daytona USA.
5186000	5194000	And you can play as the bosses of Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers without having any codes.
5195000	5197000	I mean, this basically was like...
5198000	5200000	Didn't they also have something from Samba de Amigo in there or something?
5201000	5202000	Oh, sorry.
5202000	5214000	It had basically both ring styles. It had the open ring and the caged ring from the two different games.
5215000	5220000	And it was considered, well, they tried to say that it was like the first real 3D fighting game on the market.
5220000	5236000	So, as far as characters that were in the game, you had from Virtua Fighter 2, you had Akira, Pie, Lau, Wolf, Jeffrey, Kagemaru, Sarah, Jack, Shundi, Lion, Rafale, and Dural.
5237000	5246000	From Fighting Vipers, you had Grace, Bon, Roxul, Tokio, Sanmon, Jane, Honey was renamed Candy for the American and European versions.
5246000	5251000	Picky, Mauler, B.M., and Kuma-chan, or Panda-chan.
5252000	5258000	So, as far as unlockable characters, you got Bark, the polar bear from Sonic the Fighters.
5259000	5264000	Bean, the dynamite, also from Sonic the Fighters, who's a green duck that basically wears a neckerchief.
5265000	5272000	You had Deku, who is a green bean with a hat and there's a bird under it.
5273000	5281000	You have Janet from Virtua Cop 2, you had Kid's Akira and Kid's Sarah from Virtua Fighter Kids.
5282000	5285000	You had Hornet, which was the car from Daytona USA, which was really stupid.
5286000	5293000	My favorite, Rent-a-Hero, who only came out in, the Rent-a-Hero franchise only came out in Japan.
5293000	5303000	There was a Mega Drive game and there was the Dreamcast one, Rent-a-Hero number one.
5304000	5308000	You had Seba, who was a prototype for Virtua Fighter, who never made it out.
5309000	5315000	You had Uroban, who was another Fighting Vipers character.
5316000	5320000	You had the AM2 palm tree, you know which I'm talking about, right?
5320000	5322000	From the AM2 logo.
5323000	5331000	And Mr. Meat, who in Japan was just called Miku, he's basically meat that fights.
5332000	5334000	Which is another good character.
5335000	5336000	So yeah, there were a bunch of different things.
5337000	5341000	You basically had, you could do different color, you know, outfits in the games.
5341000	5348000	You had each of the stages from the various games except for Dural.
5349000	5353000	And the underwater one was used so she gets molars instead.
5354000	5358000	And there are critical hit flashes and blood from the Fighting Vipers matches.
5359000	5363000	Those were sort of differences with the different series.
5364000	5366000	You also had Virtua Fighter 3 previews.
5366000	5372000	Including, you had the announcer for Virtua Fighter 3.
5373000	5377000	You had the Virtua Fighter 2 characters doing their VF3 poses.
5378000	5383000	Jeffery's Virtua Fighter 3 theme song was used in Deku stage.
5384000	5392000	And Janet used Ume no Koji's moves for Virtua Fighter 3.
5392000	5395000	So it was sort of a big nod to Virtua Fighter 3.
5396000	5401000	As far as regional differences, there are different extra options.
5402000	5406000	There's like a girl's course that had Honey in her undies.
5407000	5413000	And in the US it was changed to her clothes and her Player 2 outfit.
5414000	5416000	And then a different image of Tokyo.
5416000	5422000	And just basically removing anything that showed boobs, be they man or female.
5423000	5428000	But that's it. Everyone needs to play this game and play as Rent-a-Hero or Mr. Meat.
5429000	5431000	That's Fighter's Megamix.
5434000	5437000	Awesome. I've never played this, actually.
5438000	5440000	Well then you'll have to come to my house and play it.
5441000	5443000	Why don't you bring it? I'm just kidding.
5444000	5448000	It definitely looks like one of those older fighting games.
5449000	5453000	Like a PS1 era. I know it's more Saturn.
5454000	5458000	But it definitely looks like one of those fighting games with the whole 3D technology and so forth.
5459000	5460000	But it's kind of cool that it's all those characters together.
5461000	5463000	I've heard of this game, I just never played it myself.
5465000	5469000	I like it when there's a classic game of the week that even I need to learn a thing or two about.
5470000	5471000	It's a fucking weird game.
5471000	5473000	I mean, just playing as the Daytona car is bizarre.
5474000	5477000	But I always like playing as Rent-a-Hero.
5479000	5484000	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week. Fighter's Megamix.
5485000	5487000	Reginator says Mr. Meat sounds like a porn star name.
5488000	5489000	It might be. I don't know.
5490000	5491000	You know what? I want some meat. I'm hungry.
5492000	5494000	Well we've got a little break coming up right now.
5495000	5497000	And who knows, maybe Dark Soccer's gonna fly and try to get something. Who knows?
5497000	5501000	But we're gonna take a break here and when we come back there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come.
5502000	5508000	We have some more news stories. We have the FUs of the week. We also have the mailbag and your Twitter topics and your phone calls.
5509000	5512000	All when we come back right after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5519000	5521000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5522000	5528000	Live on this March the 30th of 2014, episode number 546 of our show In Progress.
5529000	5533000	And of course, as I always say, if you want to join us live in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
5534000	5536000	Because after all, it's a show for everybody. Every gamer has a voice here.
5537000	5542000	And you guys can participate through the show through chat comments or through calling us later or tweets or what have you.
5543000	5550000	We want you to join us here and we'd like to hear all the opinions because a diverse amount of opinions is how we make educated decisions, right?
5551000	5552000	Anyway, myself here.
5553000	5556000	Yeah, exactly. Myself here, Rob Roberts with you in the studio.
5557000	5560000	That ignorant voice you hear over there is Dark Sakura. No, I'm just kidding.
5561000	5562000	Bitch, please.
5563000	5564000	And of course, Techmaster Loki here with me as well.
5565000	5574000	Speaking of ignorance and fuckery and all that sort of thing, just a friendly public service reminder from those of us here at Orange Lounge Radio that this week is April Fools Day.
5574000	5585000	That is on what? Tuesday is April 1st. And that means that really the way time zones work, that's going to start hitting like midday Monday, you know, just, you know.
5586000	5587000	Don't believe a damn thing.
5588000	5599000	Exactly. So just, just be like, I think it's already starting. Like somebody put the rumor out there that, or not even rumor, just like these fake screenshots of Nestor from Howard and Ness in Super Smash Brothers.
5600000	5602000	I think it was the thing that's circulating out there right now. And it's April Fool's joke.
5602000	5608000	Now, I don't know when we started doing April Fool's jokes, not on April Fool's Day, but you're doing it wrong.
5609000	5617000	So yeah, just, you know, just a friendly public service announcement for those of us here at Orange Lounge Radio, especially if you are listening to this show.
5618000	5624000	I know many of you do listen to this podcast on Monday. I know we have a lot of Monday commuters and Monday worker people that listen to us while they work.
5624000	5634000	Thank you for having us be your soundtrack for one, but just a friendly reminder that you're going to start seeing the April Fool's Day fuckery happen any minute now.
5635000	5637000	So I will say these things.
5638000	5643000	Number one, I'm not moving. Number two, I don't work at Disneyland.
5644000	5650000	Number three, Dan and I are still married. And number four, fuck April Fool's Day.
5650000	5655000	Let's see. What would be the top rumors about myself I need to dispel?
5656000	5663000	I did do an April Fool's Day thing at work one time where I was in a meeting with my boss. I said, by the way, I got hired by Pixar and she believed me.
5664000	5669000	And I was like, and I'm totally doing an April Fool's joke. And she just said, oh my God, like that. So yeah.
5670000	5676000	Let's see. What would be my top things? First off, I will not be getting evicted from the house I just moved into.
5676000	5686000	Let's see. I am not leaving to go work for a video game company, at least not this week. Let's see what else is there.
5687000	5688000	You're still a cutie pie.
5689000	5696000	Wait, April Fool's? I'm going to cry. Loki, are there any big rumors you would like to dispel in advance of April Fool's Day?
5697000	5698000	No.
5701000	5703000	Did I know anything about the next Call of Duty?
5706000	5710000	Rob's all red in the face now.
5711000	5717000	Because that's really funny, although not everybody's going to get that joke. But if you know the whole story, it's really funny.
5718000	5723000	Oh, by the way, another fact, I'm not naming my firstborn Grunt because I'm not going to have a firstborn.
5724000	5725000	You never know. Never.
5726000	5728000	No, I know. I'm not having any children. I have a cat.
5729000	5730000	Okay.
5731000	5732000	No children for me. It's not happening ever.
5733000	5734000	Okay. Fair enough.
5734000	5735000	Kitties are children too.
5736000	5737000	My midna is awesome.
5738000	5747000	Alright, let us get into some rapid fire news and talk about all that other stuff going on in the gaming industry that we don't think is an April Fool's Day joke.
5748000	5750000	We think these are legit. I sure hope so anyway. Alright, Loki.
5751000	5762000	So Origin is no longer going to be selling physical PC titles. They are stopping that as of the 4th, which is Friday.
5762000	5767000	And basically because they're solely selling digital stuff.
5768000	5778000	I guess if you want to get physical copies of games, which are really just discs and codes for Origin anyways, then you could probably just go through retailers and do that.
5778000	5793000	Now they're saying though that basically it's just games on Origin. It's not necessarily all EA games. I mean you can buy those elsewhere. It's just not from Origin.
5793000	5810000	Project Cars is a really cool looking game. It's kind of like your really high detail auto simulation type game and they're going to be adding virtual reality to it.
5811000	5817000	And it's going to be one of the first PlayStation 4 games to support Sony's Project Morpheus.
5818000	5833000	So of course they said, you know, virtual reality is a perfect fit for racing games since the game would literally comes rushing towards you from the distance and increase sense of depth and speed that stereoscopic vision affords you makes this incredible and real and tangible.
5834000	5843000	And they actually have already seen gameplay from the Oculus Rift version so it makes sense if they're already developing it for one they could easily develop it for the other.
5844000	5857000	Alright, and then of course to go along with that Sony is actually working on, you may remember, god I don't even remember how many years ago, was it 2012 or something? Yeah, 2012 E3.
5858000	5860000	That wasn't that long ago, Logie, geez.
5861000	5866000	Well in game time that's pretty long. For a game that's not out yet, okay? That was supposed to be out later that year.
5867000	5869000	That was the last time we heard about the last Guardian as well, right?
5869000	5877000	This is Until Dawn, and if you remember this is the survivor horror game that was going to be a move game.
5878000	5890000	And it was kind of like, you know, one of those cliche horror movies with teenagers in the woods or something and someone gets kidnapped and all sorts of shit goes down.
5890000	5897000	Well apparently now it's being retooled for the Playstation 4 and it's also going to be a virtual reality title.
5898000	5903000	Because, you know, it's very interesting because it's a horror game they said.
5904000	5911000	So, I don't know. I thought they just cancelled the title but I guess it's still being developed so it'll be interesting.
5912000	5916000	And then, there's a new game from the developers of Wipeout.
5917000	5919000	And no, it's not another Wipeout game.
5920000	5924000	But, it's sort of like the Micro Machines games. It's a tabletop racing game.
5925000	5932000	It's tabletop racing. It's coming to mobile and Vita and kind of reminds me of Micro Machines.
5933000	5935000	I don't know. They're going to have all sorts of stuff in there.
5936000	5947000	17 cars you can upgrade, 8 tracks, 9 power ups. They have time trial stuff, racing, eliminator, and 4 player online multiplayer.
5948000	5956000	And it's coming to mobile devices so iOS, Android, and Vita.
5957000	5963000	Is that going to be like the way you describe it there? Is it going to be like, well I know this is more from the first person perspective,
5964000	5969000	but I sure miss the Iron Ivan Stewart's super off-road racing that was at every pizza parlor.
5970000	5980000	It looks kind of like a combat racing game. It's more like a, I don't know, like a...
5981000	5982000	Maybe Mario Kart meets...
5982000	5987000	Not like Twisted Metal, but like, you know, kind of like just Burnout almost.
5988000	5995000	Or even, what was that game from? Activision. That was like their racing game that is car combat and stuff.
5996000	5997000	I can't remember now, but...
6000000	6005000	Oh, it looks interesting. That little ice cream truck they have on there reminds me of Sweet Tooth, but I know it's not.
6006000	6007000	It looks neat.
6008000	6010000	Alright, well moving on. Let's get into some other game news.
6010000	6014000	Here's a game, speaking of games that we didn't really hear about after they first announced it,
6015000	6018000	it's nice to get a little update on Disney Fantasia Music Evolved.
6019000	6023000	This is the harmonics game that is using Kinect and kind of disappeared.
6024000	6026000	We thought it was going to be a launch game for Xbox One, but it wasn't.
6027000	6030000	But we do have some news about more songs that are going to be featured in the game.
6031000	6034000	Nicki Minaj's Super Bass, which is interesting.
6034000	6042000	The White Stripes' Seven Nation Army, and the most overplayed song I think I've ever heard in my entire life, that song Royals by Lorde.
6043000	6044000	I love that song.
6045000	6047000	I like that song the first 5,000 times I heard it.
6048000	6050000	Cause we'll never be royals.
6055000	6057000	I swear to god that's what this song sounds like to me now.
6058000	6059000	It's just a bunch of howling cats in heat.
6060000	6061000	So I can't hear that song anymore.
6061000	6066000	So that's one song I will not be playing in Fantasia Music Evolved.
6067000	6069000	But you know what I will be playing that is awesome?
6070000	6073000	David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust is also in the game. Now that's cool.
6074000	6075000	Awesome.
6076000	6081000	Also kind of awesome is the fact that there's classical music also in the game, which kind of strikes me as a nod to the original Fantasia.
6082000	6088000	So Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 from The New World is also in there, so that's pretty cool.
6088000	6092000	So if you like your classical music, which I think Dark Sakura does.
6093000	6094000	That's my favorite number.
6095000	6096000	I do indeed. Actually Dvorak's pretty awesome.
6097000	6100000	Alright, let's see. Moving on to other news.
6101000	6105000	Could it be that Tecmo Koei wants to work on Mario?
6106000	6108000	Yeah, in an interview with ONM.
6109000	6110000	Mario, other M.
6110000	6116000	Well yeah, right? So Tecmo Koei did the whole other M, right? Which kind of got some mixed reception.
6117000	6120000	I don't think it was as bad as some people made it out to be, but it was different.
6121000	6123000	So could you imagine a different type of Mario game?
6124000	6125000	Well, here's the quote.
6126000	6130000	Disney, Star Wars, and Mario are just a few of the various franchises we'd like to work with.
6131000	6135000	So in other words, he wants to work with popular characters.
6136000	6137000	Can't say I blame him.
6137000	6139000	This story's a bit of a die, isn't it?
6140000	6143000	I think I'd like to make a game with very popular characters in it.
6144000	6145000	I think I'd like to make a successful movie.
6146000	6147000	I would like to make a successful game.
6148000	6152000	I would like to create a game that will be guaranteed success on name alone.
6153000	6154000	That's what I'd like to do.
6155000	6160000	I'd just like to show up, throw that franchise on my cover, and be down with it.
6161000	6166000	You know, anyone will buy anything that's Disney, Star Wars, or Mario.
6167000	6171000	I'd like to make Mario is Missing 2. That's the game I think I'd really like to make.
6172000	6176000	Yoshi's Cookie 3D. Isn't that what the world's been clamoring for?
6177000	6178000	We're going to reboot all the CDI games.
6181000	6185000	Hey, speaking of Takeover and so forth, Killer Instinct.
6186000	6189000	Killer Instinct doesn't have a developer right now because Double Helix got acquired by Amazon.
6190000	6192000	So that isn't going to work for Killer Instinct.
6192000	6199000	However, Iron Galaxy has now been tapped as the group to pick up on Killer Instinct where Double Helix left off.
6200000	6202000	After all, there's supposed to be a Season 2 of characters at some point.
6203000	6212000	Iron Galaxy has done a variety of games, including Divekick, which has done some interesting things in the fighting industry as well.
6213000	6220000	They have also contributed to games like Marvel vs. Capcom Origins, Darkstalkers Resurrection, and Street Fighter III Third Strike Online Edition.
6220000	6225000	So this is a pretty big project for them, but good luck and don't fuck it up.
6226000	6227000	Seriously.
6228000	6229000	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
6230000	6237000	In other news, now this is something that's pretty exciting for me and Dan since Outrun is a big, big favorite in my house.
6238000	6243000	But it's going to be the 11th 3D classic title for the 3DS in Japan.
6244000	6246000	So that means I'm definitely going to get it.
6246000	6254000	And also, while the page actually goes to the Fantasy Zone page, there's supposed to be confirmation coming for Outrun before too long.
6259000	6264000	There's also a Legend of Zelda crossover with the Lost World.
6264000	6281000	Basically, there is a Legend of Zelda zone where Sonic dresses up as Link and he goes against some of the same enemies that exist in Link's world, including Kukos.
6282000	6285000	As in, Chicken Swarm! Chicken Swarm!
6286000	6295000	And then, last but not least, EA has Dead Space for free on Origin right now, which has been done before.
6296000	6306000	I think they did it with Dead Space before, but now this is part of their On the House promo, where basically you get a free game and you keep the free game.
6307000	6311000	I may not always like Origin, but I like free.
6312000	6319000	To tie it back to something we talked about in the very beginning of the show, here's how nothing is truly free.
6320000	6323000	Yes, you can get this game for free, but you'll have to install Origin.
6324000	6326000	It wasn't that bad.
6327000	6335000	You know what? Since I already have Origin installed, was it Populous that I got through Origin? Was that one of the games they gave away before?
6336000	6338000	I'm going to go get Dead Space. How long is this good for?
6339000	6340000	You probably already have it.
6341000	6343000	You didn't buy the EA Humble Bundle?
6344000	6345000	Oh, I did.
6346000	6347000	You probably already have it.
6348000	6352000	That's the downfall of those Humble Bundles. You get so many games you don't even remember you have.
6353000	6355000	I think I'd gotten Dead Space 3, though, on some sort of cheaper...
6356000	6357000	That's probably the same Humble Bundle.
6358000	6361000	I don't have Dead Space 2, though. I should probably sit and play these, because fucking hell.
6362000	6364000	You have all these games! You bought them on the Humble Bundle!
6364000	6372000	I have Battlefield 3. I should install it now, because I was like, I'm not fucking installing Origin, and then Titanfall came out. I was like, I'm installing Origin to play Titanfall!
6373000	6378000	I feel like there's an OLR new game show idea in here. Which game do you already own that you forgot to own?
6379000	6384000	There's a ton. There's like, seriously, on Humble Bundles and stuff, I'll see you like, oh man, I gotta get the game!
6385000	6386000	Only limited to Steam, is that it?
6387000	6388000	I buy it or something.
6389000	6391000	And it's like, you already own that game. I'm like, oh fuck!
6391000	6395000	Yeah, I got one and three on the Humble Bundle thing, too, so whatever.
6396000	6401000	I guess it could even have a little theme song. You're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to sales. I don't know, something like that.
6402000	6413000	Well, at any rate, the on the house thing is, I think, just for each weekend. It's not really giving me too much of a detail, going on the thing, but they're saying...
6413000	6421000	Okay, I'm gonna read it directly off the thing. Free, what's the catch? There's no catch, grab full games, expansions are more at absolutely no cost.
6422000	6426000	Just make sure to act fast, because on the house specials can appear and disappear at any time.
6427000	6433000	You mean a free trailer demo, right? Nope, you're getting the full version of the real game for free. Once you've claimed it, it's yours to keep.
6434000	6436000	Wow, I like free.
6437000	6439000	I like free, too. Because I'm poor.
6440000	6442000	I have a car payment now.
6443000	6445000	Darsaco wants free tacos, that's what she wants.
6446000	6451000	No, you know what, I don't want tacos, I want free filet mignon. Because I deserve it. I'm worth it, because I'm worth it.
6452000	6455000	You're worth it. You're good enough, you're strong enough.
6456000	6461000	And I'll gun it. Fuck everything. No, I tried to do the hair toss, but I forgot I don't have enough hair.
6462000	6463000	Aww.
6464000	6466000	Look at this mess, it got redyed though. Thank you, Becky, for dyeing my hair.
6467000	6470000	Is that what girls do when they get together, they just dye each other's hair?
6470000	6474000	Becky and I dye each other's hair and talk shit about people. And drink wine.
6475000	6477000	You better not have been talking shit about me, you better not be me.
6478000	6484000	Me and Becky are going to be like, they are on Ab Fab, except you know we're not so shallow, and I actually eat.
6485000	6487000	I love Ab Fab, Patsy and Nadina, I love them.
6488000	6491000	We're just going to be like them all day with our glasses of wine, talking shit about people.
6491000	6500000	Sweetie darling. Sweetie darling, let's talk about Facebook. The Facebooks, darling. It's your face in a book.
6501000	6502000	I love Jennifer Saunders.
6503000	6507000	It's Facebook and Google+. You slam those words together, you get FUGL. It's the FUGL question of the week.
6507000	6522000	Every week we ask a question of our fan communities on Facebook and Google+, and we share some of our favorite answers with y'all here on Orange Launch Radio.
6523000	6526000	And the FUGL question of the week ties into a story we talked about earlier in the show.
6527000	6535000	Here's a story that caught our eye. Do you think it's fair to suspend certain console features based on an individual's reputation in online gaming?
6535000	6546000	Why or why not? And this ties back to the whole, you might not be able to broadcast from your Xbox One on Twitch anymore if you have been reported as having a shitty attitude one too many times.
6547000	6556000	So some of the answers here, going to, let's start on Google+. And evil starts us off, or E3VL starts us off saying yes.
6557000	6561000	Because again, the question we pose to the listeners is, is it fair? Why or why not?
6562000	6578000	Yes, as long as it's a temporary lockout. It will condition them not to be assholes online to give new players or those who just want to have fun online, not be discouraged to play an online session or match without the thought of any harassment within the online, excuse me, within the online player base.
6579000	6589000	ActDeaf follows up saying, I agree. I think something like time out is needed a lot of times with people that take their games too seriously or also just there to troll.
6590000	6597000	But I don't think a termination of service should be handed unless it's something truly severe. Why do I have an image of SuperNanny popping into my head all of a sudden?
6598000	6607000	You've been very naughty. You go and you sit on the naughty step and you don't move from the naughty step until I tell you it's okay.
6608000	6615000	You know what? When I used to take escalated calls, I used to tell people I'd give them a time out if they were yelling at me.
6616000	6617000	Go sit on the naughty step.
6618000	6621000	I'm going to put you on a two minute time out and we'll call back and see if you can be civil.
6622000	6624000	Customer service all-star, Dark Sakura, ladies and gentlemen.
6625000	6627000	I don't do that anymore. I can't really do that anymore.
6627000	6639000	Lastly, Travis H. on Google Plus says, I think something like this should have been implemented a long time ago. Some people just don't grow up. Punish them like children. Agreed.
6640000	6644000	There you go. Some fans of that over on Google Plus. Let's check out the answers over on Facebook and see if they agree.
6645000	6653000	Retertainment says, remember that long list of fine print that's part of the agreement you hastily clicked that you signed even though you didn't? No.
6654000	6659000	Well, if language is not included in that agreement, you didn't read that allows for the taking of privileges based on customer reputation.
6660000	6665000	The customer may have a case in saying that since the customer paid for the services advertised, they should get the services advertised.
6665000	6676000	However, since language like that probably exists and people rarely read those agreements, people will probably bitch about not getting what they paid for but still powerless to get their Twitch streaming back.
6677000	6687000	Corporations are wonderful. I would bet there is, that's a good point, I would bet there is a clause in there, I would bet anything there is a clause that they can add or remove features at any time.
6687000	6698000	Because if you think about it, Sony got rid of the Linux thing on the Playstation 3 a long time ago and they really couldn't be sued over it, although it didn't make them popular for a little while.
6699000	6701000	But they had the right to remove those things and that was in that agreement, nobody read.
6702000	6708000	And I would imagine the right to add or remove features does not have to necessarily be a universal right.
6708000	6717000	And even if you didn't like it anyway, Redertainment, you already agreed to the arbitration clause in there, so you won't be able to take them to Judge Judy.
6718000	6720000	The end result sucks to be you.
6721000	6731000	It sucks to be all of us. But at the same time, I personally don't necessarily disagree with what Microsoft is doing as long as they have something in place to prevent abuse of this system.
6732000	6735000	Isn't that ironic? Abusing the system for abusers.
6736000	6746000	Redthehaze responds and says, I think it's totally fair since it's a service of a private company and not run by the government, which is what the constitutional right to free speech is and is only protected from the government.
6747000	6751000	I just hope Microsoft has fixed the rep system because of sore losers and bullies abusing the system.
6752000	6757000	Ciala responds and says, sounds like a good idea and a bad idea, depending on how they determine if you're good or bad.
6758000	6764000	Also, do they have a system in play if you redeem yourself or are you doomed to be grounded by Microsoft forever?
6765000	6772000	CriticalMyth says, if they can apply the basis for the reputation changes correctly, sure, why not? But that's a tall order, I think.
6773000	6779000	And lastly, Burr on Facebook says, I think the only features that should be suspended are the ones that allow you to continue to grief others.
6780000	6787000	Twitch streaming arguably applies because you could be doing it just to attract more attention to your trolling, but that's about as far as I would stretch that logic.
6788000	6791000	So, it seems in general, the consensus, that was all our answers, by the way, this week.
6792000	6795000	If you want to answer us in a future week, add us on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLonsRadio.
6796000	6807000	I do want to apologize, I posted the question very late today, which is probably why we had fewer responses than usual, but I got back from San Francisco about 90 minutes before Bobby's show, so it didn't leave me a lot of time.
6808000	6812000	So, anyway, but in future weeks I'll be better about posting that question in advance.
6813000	6820000	But it does seem like the consensus overall from Facebook and Google is that people are like, okay, yeah, I'm cool with this idea, but they've got to show that they can execute it right.
6821000	6831000	Like everybody's got, or most everybody seems to have that side of, okay, I like this on paper, but is it really going to work like that or are we going to accidentally ban all these people that don't deserve it or what's going to happen?
6832000	6833000	So, we shall see.
6834000	6835000	Well, when we see, huh?
6835000	6839000	So, that's it for the FUBU Question of the Week. Let's get back to some news. Loki.
6840000	6853000	Alright. So, this is kind of interesting. You remember we talked a little bit about 3D Realms and how they were kind of getting in trouble with Gearbox, with the whole Duke Nukem trademark and stuff like that?
6854000	6859000	Well, here's an interesting, I don't know if it's interesting, but it's kind of maybe an expected twist.
6860000	6865000	Gear, or 3D Realms is saying, no, actually we do own the rights to Duke Nukem.
6866000	6876000	Basically, you know, was it on March 17th, 3D Realms filed its answer to the complaint by Gearbox, you know, because they have to do that when they get sued and stuff.
6876000	6878000	They have to kind of bring their response in.
6879000	6891000	And they deny all allegations set forth by, you know, in the complaint and basically said that, you know, 3D Realms has submitted evidence that shows that Gearbox at no point intended to enter into a good faith negotiation,
6892000	6901000	but instead fought to force former owners of the company to improperly surrender what rightfully belonged to 3D Realms.
6901000	6909000	And it's in the position that they retain the rights to Duke Nukem Survivor, which is, you know, the game that they're trying to put out right now.
6910000	6914000	It was the one that was previously called Duke Nukem Mass Destruction, but now it's Duke Nukem Survivor.
6915000	6923000	And furthermore, it's their position that the trademark for Duke Nukem was never assigned to Gearbox, but remains the sole property of 3D Realms.
6923000	6930000	So I'm guessing they're going to go to court. Or they're going to settle.
6931000	6937000	But it's definitely not going to be, yeah, we did that. Oops.
6938000	6939000	Hmm.
6940000	6950000	Honestly, though, in the end of all this, does any amount of Duke Nukem games coming out that are brand new even do anything for that franchise anymore?
6951000	6955000	Because I think that Duke Nukem Forever soiled that franchise so bad.
6956000	6957000	The Duke Nukem Steam version.
6958000	6959000	Well, that's just Duke Nukem 3D.
6960000	6962000	That was fantastic because it's an older game. That was awesome.
6963000	6965000	What's old is new again. Haven't you heard?
6965000	6975000	But taking anything brand new beyond Duke Nukem Forever is kind of like, eh, it's not that big anymore.
6976000	6984000	It's not really a franchise that I'm that excited about when I hear it and kind of go, eh, another Duke Nukem game.
6985000	6990000	If they had another developer come in and actually make a good Duke Nukem game.
6991000	6994000	How about back to a 2D platformer game? That would be kind of cool.
6995000	6999000	No, come on, the old school Duke Nukem. I want a Commander Keen game, for God's sake.
7000000	7003000	You know who needs their comeuppance that was kind of overshadowed by Duke Nukem anyways?
7004000	7005000	Jill of the Jungle.
7006000	7011000	No, but I guess you could go ahead and do one of those. I could see a mobile game out of that.
7012000	7015000	No, no fucking mobile games. Jill of the Jungle is better than that.
7016000	7026000	Halloween Harry was another shareware game and he had a fucking flamethrower and it looked awesome in VGA 256 colors.
7027000	7029000	So, that's what I want to see.
7030000	7032000	Have I had a ZZT rant in 2014 yet?
7033000	7034000	It's all about Megazooks, man.
7035000	7038000	Have we had our annual ZZT rant? Have we had that rant yet?
7038000	7045000	Has there really been a game creation game that's been as good as ZZT or Megazooks? I don't think so.
7046000	7052000	Okay, if you're new to OLR and you haven't heard me rant about ZZT before, then I need you all to take a moment to educate yourselves.
7053000	7054000	This goes far beyond-
7055000	7056000	Tell us a story, Teacher Rob.
7057000	7061000	This goes far beyond classic game of the week. This is like classic game of the ever, okay?
7061000	7073000	If you're into modding shit like Loki is heavily or even like lightly, you need to go research a game called ZZT that was out on the PC that you could create your own like ASCII art type games.
7074000	7078000	But they were like intricate little like roleplay sprite type games that you could make.
7079000	7082000	And I'm sure you could probably still download the shareware or ZZT or-
7083000	7084000	I think they have the full version.
7085000	7094000	And you could probably still check out a lot of those games. Like, I'm dying for something that easy and that friendly and that cool to like come out again.
7095000	7102000	You know what I used to love? And this was, you know, back early- this is early Maxis time. Click and Play. I don't know if you ever remember Click and Play.
7103000	7111000	It was a game creation thing for Maxis for Windows. And you could like, with the registered version of the game, you could make your own stupid Windows 3.1 games.
7111000	7115000	And boy did we ever make our own stupid Windows 3.1 games.
7116000	7126000	We need an OLR ZZT game. Like for real. Like I just- can we do like a listener contest of some value where we're OLR ZZT? Maybe I can give loot on VoG network for people to create a DZT.
7127000	7131000	We will be obtaining, by the way, swag from another source.
7132000	7134000	Okay. That we will have available for giveaways. Fantastic.
7135000	7137000	For whatever we decide not to keep for ourselves.
7137000	7143000	Fine. Then we need to like seriously pony up an OLR ZZT contest. Let's make ZZT cool again.
7144000	7146000	Thanks to a long time listener slash coworker.
7147000	7148000	Oh, okay. Awesome.
7149000	7150000	Who we spoke with last week.
7151000	7154000	Awesome. Can we get the people who made ZZT on the show? Can I have that?
7155000	7156000	You can probably just look it up. I don't know.
7157000	7158000	What are they doing these days?
7158000	7165000	Well, there's that. And like I said, Megazooks was pretty awesome. Remember Megazooks came out afterwards and it was kind of- they had Super ZZT, which was its own thing, but that kind of sucked.
7166000	7168000	But then they had Megazooks, which was kind of like the original ZZT.
7169000	7178000	Because Super ZZT, they took everything instead of making it ASCII. It was like the 64 by 64 blocks or something. They made their own blocks.
7178000	7186000	They tried to make it a little less rectangular and ASCII, but then Megazooks came out and added more ASCII features to it.
7187000	7192000	But you could create your own ASCII characters. I think you could have like mod music in there.
7193000	7203000	All sorts of crazy stuff. Scrolling backgrounds. I actually made some pretty awesome stuff with that and I had a cool game going, but God knows where that is. Probably on floppy disk somewhere.
7204000	7209000	So Tim Sweeney is who we can thank for ZZT. He made ZZT.
7210000	7212000	It's going to be a little hard to get an interview with him.
7213000	7219000	Yeah, probably, because now he's with Epic working on Unreal Engine is one of the big things. Why does that not surprise me?
7220000	7225000	Everybody's fucking using Unreal Engine, right? Why does that not surprise me that that all dates back to ZZT?
7225000	7234000	Well, let's get an interview with him and we'll just not ask him anything about Unreal. It'll all be about ZZT.
7235000	7238000	I don't give a shit about Unreal. Come on this show.
7239000	7246000	I gotta be honest, Tim. I don't give a shit about Unreal Engine. Unreal's awesome, but let's talk about your best game engine ever and that would be ZZT.
7246000	7257000	Actually, that's totally a lie. I do really want to know about Unreal, but fine. If that's off limits, I don't care. Let's just talk ZZT. Let's talk like it's 1995.
7258000	7259000	Let's port ZZT to the Unreal Engine.
7260000	7269000	I don't know. You know, he's only eight years older than us, so we're older than he was when he made that game. What have you done with your life?
7270000	7271000	I haven't made ZZT.
7272000	7273000	Don't I feel like a failure?
7274000	7275000	I played at Carnegie Hall.
7276000	7278000	I played with my friends. I made a game.
7279000	7282000	I would have to say that my accomplishments were really decent.
7283000	7288000	Alright. Oh, Bobby Blackwell says, I have contacts at Epic. I'll see what I can do.
7289000	7290000	We love you, Bobby.
7291000	7293000	Just flopping that internet penis around.
7294000	7297000	Yeah, I'll see what I can do and then the part that isn't on there to get him on my show.
7298000	7301000	If you can include tacos with that deal, I'll be happy.
7302000	7310000	Alright. I'm saying, Bobby, if you get that interview arranged, and it is for your show, you're getting a co-host that night.
7311000	7316000	Alright. Back to, in all seriousness, let's get back to some other gaming news.
7317000	7324000	And this is about these newfangled games on the PlayStation 4s and the Xbox Ones and yes, even the Wii U.
7325000	7330000	You know, I didn't realize this wasn't already happening, but apparently Redbox does not rent for those systems yet.
7331000	7333000	You know, and I should know that, but...
7334000	7341000	Yeah, no, Redbox does not rent those games on those machines yet. However, the rumors are out there saying that that will start in April.
7342000	7345000	And this is coming from NeoGaf, so here's your big salt lick to take this with.
7346000	7351000	But then again, is this something people would lie about? I mean, this is a little bit like, this is a very natural next step for Redbox.
7352000	7364000	And honestly, it's from, because I read the thread, it was, they were basically saying, oh, it had artwork on, you know, coming soon, artwork or whatever on the kiosk, so duh.
7365000	7376000	So yeah, so yeah, there's all these games that are rumored to come from this and yeah, so I mean, this is a big duh kind of natural next step for Redbox.
7377000	7381000	So I'm sure this is just a matter of when is this going to happen and it sounds like it'll be within the month.
7382000	7387000	This leads me to this question. Do you guys rent games anymore? I remember that used to be a big thing when I was a kid.
7387000	7399000	It was like, you would go to, it wasn't even Blockbuster for us, it was local stores here, like it was actually my first job I ever had and the chain isn't around anymore, so I can name it Plaster TV Video, right?
7400000	7411000	And we would go and we'd rent VHS tapes and we'd rent NES cartridges. And that used to be like, that was like every Friday night, that was a party right there, your VHS and your NES cartridge.
7411000	7420000	And now it's like, I don't really do that anymore, but I do use one of those mail order services that doesn't pay me to endorse them, but it's a very popular one, I'm sure a lot of you use.
7421000	7423000	They just started renting DVDs.
7424000	7436000	Yes, so who needs Netflix DVD when now you got that whole thing, right? But here's the trick with that, because DVDs are a lot cheaper, yet they still charge the same rate.
7436000	7440000	So it's cheaper for you to be paying that and have a DVD out than it does a game.
7441000	7443000	I think they're just trying to make it more diversified.
7444000	7453000	Sure, of course, of course. But anyway, that's what I use now. Do you guys use, what about chatters? Do you guys still rent video games? Would you use this feature if it came to Redbox?
7454000	7457000	I have an idea. You could put up an OLR quick poll.
7458000	7460000	I guess I could, well what would the question be?
7460000	7465000	Do you rent, I don't know. This is the part where you fill in with your knowledge.
7466000	7467000	Yay, nay, don't give a fuck.
7468000	7470000	Maybe we shouldn't do it, because the amount of effort to actually do that.
7471000	7475000	I'm tired, I'm a bit of a failure tonight, so no live poll.
7476000	7477000	Sounds like a plan.
7478000	7486000	Alright, I think, if you're dying to do a live poll, see we should have pulled them on something about the Rift on the Facebook thing earlier.
7487000	7492000	If we're going to play that card, save a video. Who rents video games?
7493000	7500000	Yeah, I don't, for me, I have a large backlog of games. I don't really need to rent anything.
7501000	7510000	Honestly, if I'm going to, I'm probably going to buy something. I'm more informed, I guess, on what's coming out and what it is and stuff.
7510000	7521000	Versus when I used to rent games, I didn't really, I kind of got magazines and stuff, and I saw pictures, but I didn't really know what the game was.
7522000	7533000	And so I'd be more curious to try it out, but now I think that there's so many options where you can download a demo, or you can watch videos on it, or you can just play it.
7534000	7538000	I just think that's why I don't rent anything anymore.
7539000	7547000	Interesting. I did learn something from that question I posed to Chad over at live.vognetwork.com. AkumaJP says, no renting games in Japan. Sad.
7548000	7556000	I did not realize that was not a part of the culture there. Interesting. Are there laws in place that prevent that, or is it just the culture kind of rejects that?
7557000	7564000	Let me ask this question, AkumaJP, do you rent DVDs and Blu-rays and movies? I'm curious to that.
7564000	7573000	Let's see, and Akdeft says, Redbox is getting PlayStation 4 and Xbox One games. 4 minus 1 equals 3. Half-Life 3 confirmed.
7574000	7582000	Alright, for that, I'm going to click on Akdeft's name and do a right-click slap, and slap him around with a trout in the chat room. There you go, Akdeft.
7583000	7588000	Yes, and I'm sure that we will see plenty of Half-Life 3 news come Tuesday.
7589000	7604000	Yes, right? Alright, let's move on with some more news. We'll come back to the question I asked AkumaJP in a little bit, because there's a little bit of a delay between the time we say things and when people hear and respond. So let's do Dark Sakura's story next.
7605000	7611000	Alright, I guess we can do mine next. This is actually about a group called the Fine Young Capitalists.
7611000	7619000	They're basically looking for anyone who identifies as a woman to take place in the Women in Video Games initiative.
7620000	7628000	So you have a pitch document about a game that would be, you know, maybe a 1500 word document about a game with a female protagonist.
7629000	7632000	And I'll go ahead and read what it says from their website.
7633000	7638000	A woman who identifies as a woman can prepare a proposal of up to 1500 words in length explaining their concept for a video game.
7639000	7646000	Each pitch will be judged on originality, financial viability, level of immersion, fun, aesthetic, and feasibility with the required budget.
7647000	7656000	The top five proposals will be given to professional concept artists and writers to create a fully realized pitch document that they can use to sell concept to third parties.
7657000	7664000	So, I mean, so basically it's really, I think, any type of game possible, but they want to support more women in video game design.
7665000	7674000	And then profits of the game, the sale of the game, would go to charity. So I'm actually considering an item already.
7676000	7681000	Like something that you would actually submit as a video game idea? Well, you have our OLR dream games list.
7682000	7684000	You could use this inspiration.
7685000	7687000	It's hard to make anything off of that, you know. I seriously, yeah.
7688000	7693000	What? You don't think they would take a proposal from Dark Sakura to make puzzle sluts? Seriously?
7694000	7695000	Why on earth not?
7696000	7697000	No.
7698000	7700000	Alright, I don't mean to belittle this story. It actually is a very cool thing.
7701000	7706000	But here's my honest, difficult question that I'm going to ask, even though you might not want to hear it.
7706000	7713000	Is it going to work? Because obviously we really do need, you know, we need more diversity in the industry.
7714000	7719000	We need those fresh ideas that come with the diverse cultures and opinions that form from those. We need that.
7720000	7721000	But is it really going to work?
7722000	7729000	See, I want to make a, I really don't want to, what, do you hear that too?
7730000	7732000	It's the fridge. It's the ice maker. Mine does that all the time.
7733000	7734000	Is something peeing in my kitchen?
7734000	7736000	It sounded like someone peeing in the kitchen.
7737000	7738000	No, it's something that hasn't...
7739000	7740000	This is great radio, I know, but...
7741000	7744000	No, I don't even care. Deal with it. Because I thought, like, the cat was peeing in the kitchen somewhere.
7745000	7747000	My wife always accuses me, she's like, check it, it sounds like the fridge is leaking.
7748000	7754000	No, it's just the ice maker. Or it's something that has to do with, like, it draining off, like, condensation or something in there.
7755000	7756000	But yes, it's the fridge.
7757000	7761000	Well, I'm going to tell you, Loki, my old apartment, we have plastic ice trays that we use to make the ice.
7761000	7764000	So this newfangle ice maker thing, I don't know if I can handle that.
7765000	7769000	It was funny, though, just because Rob starts looking, like, gets the peridog.
7770000	7773000	Is that even hooked up to the water line? Because you have a really old fridge now that I look at it.
7774000	7775000	Yeah, it makes ice. It's on the water line.
7776000	7777000	Okay, well that's what it is.
7778000	7779000	Where do we hear pee coming from?
7780000	7783000	I know. Let's call Alan. Alan, you come home and fix the fridge.
7784000	7796000	At any rate, you know, I was thinking about, you know, doing, like, just the ultimate gory, violent game, but having a very strong message of equality in it.
7797000	7807000	You know, or another one called, it's an idea I've been floating around and don't steal my idea, anyone, because I'm copywriting it right now, called Flamethrower Princess.
7808000	7812000	Which was a dream game I would like about just a woman running around with a flamethrower.
7813000	7816000	Okay, setting everything on fire. Why not?
7817000	7819000	Chasing down misogynists, setting them on fire.
7820000	7822000	But the only way to stop her is to give her a taco.
7823000	7825000	No, the only way to stop her is to promote ideas of equality.
7826000	7830000	And once, it's sort of like, okay, you know in Actraiser, how you build your villages and you protect your villages and everything?
7831000	7833000	Well, you create safe communities.
7834000	7835000	I see.
7836000	7837000	Of love and justice and peace and you burn out all the opposition.
7838000	7839000	And taco making?
7840000	7841000	I'm just going to call it Tumblr of the game.
7842000	7844000	That's it. Tumblr of the game.
7845000	7855000	No, seriously, my idea for Flamethrower Princess really is just basically being stuck, you know, like in a place and having to set stuff on fire to get out.
7856000	7857000	But you have to solve puzzles with fire.
7858000	7864000	Alright, Bobby Blackwolf in chat does bring up a point. He says, hey, there was a hit Xbox Live Indie game that came from the OLR dream games.
7865000	7866000	There was.
7867000	7869000	Well, let's talk about the word hit.
7869000	7878000	Look, what YYR did was brilliant and it's a great game. And if you don't have it for whatever reason, you should absolutely check out Bungie Ferret Tossing.
7879000	7888000	I'm not saying anything negative in that regard, but I mean, when I think of hit games on Xbox Live Indie games, I think a lot of them were Minecraft clones and fart simulators.
7889000	7894000	And unfortunately, and the game where you shoot a baby out of your vagina as far as you possibly can.
7895000	7897000	Have you played, there's one that.
7897000	7904000	I will say, Bungie Ferret Tossing didn't really have much on that. But my second favorite game on Xbox Live Indie game was definitely.
7905000	7917000	You know, for the record, when I was at my friend's picnic, was it last weekend? A few of the people there work at various game developers and I mentioned Bungie Ferret Tossing.
7918000	7920000	And they're like, okay, I have to find this.
7921000	7922000	So, there you go.
7922000	7932000	There's one that's also like, it's like where you stack like these guys with Speedos or whatever and you have to climb the, it's like almost like a co-op type game, but you have to climb the stack.
7933000	7934000	I forget what it's called though, but it's hilarious.
7935000	7936000	I think I've heard about that, but I haven't.
7937000	7944000	And they have penis physics. It literally, their junk swings back and forth in their Speedo while you're playing the game.
7945000	7949000	Yeah, I have to make a flamethrower princess.
7950000	7951000	Alright, sounds good.
7951000	7952000	And techno kitten adventure.
7954000	7958000	Black Wolf in our chat room says he's opening up a new Unity editor called Flamethrower Princess.
7959000	7963000	See, I have to decide if I want it to be a puzzle game or if I want it to be like Smash TV.
7964000	7969000	Can you just pitch flappy vog? No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding. Alright.
7970000	7972000	But it was a concept created by a man.
7976000	7977000	I don't see, I don't come up with-
7978000	7979000	Mount your friends is what it's called.
7979000	7982000	Mount your friends, thank you. Wow.
7983000	7990000	You know what, actually I suddenly want, but I'd have to harass Jamie Hewlett for it. I want a Tank Girl game.
7991000	7996000	You can play as Tank Girl or Jet Girl or Sub Girl and just like save the world.
7997000	8002000	That is amazing. That's on Xbox Live Indie games. I kind of want it.
8003000	8008000	But yeah, maybe I'd do a Flamethrower Princess in the style of Smash TV, but like more platformy.
8009000	8018000	Okay. And what would she be fighting in the game? Because like, you know, corruption is sort of a vague, you know, how does that manifest itself?
8019000	8020000	She'll be fighting corporate sponsors.
8023000	8026000	Big money, big prizes. I hate it.
8031000	8034000	I might combine the concept with the Running Man, maybe.
8035000	8038000	There you go. The Hunger Games, that's popular.
8039000	8046000	You know what, which bit off Battle Royale, so fuck it. I wish you had real copies of the books, Rob, so I could borrow them and not have to give them another thing.
8047000	8049000	I was about to say something highly offensive and I stopped myself.
8050000	8053000	You know what? Okay, should I say something highly offensive, yes or no?
8054000	8056000	Only if you pay me with a taco for my silence.
8057000	8061000	You're not going to be able to stay silent. Let's see if you can actually stay silent.
8062000	8064000	Bring it. This is like George Bush, bring it.
8064000	8075000	Well, if it's going to be a woman-inspired game, wouldn't it take its inspiration from such things like Fifty Shades of Grey and Twilight?
8076000	8077000	Bitch, no.
8078000	8079000	You couldn't stay silent.
8080000	8081000	So, I didn't bet any real money.
8082000	8083000	You lost the taco, Pinterest.
8084000	8085000	I'm going to go buy my own fucking taco, okay?
8086000	8087000	You lost the taco!
8088000	8091000	I'm going to go buy. In fact, it's going to be a fish taco.
8092000	8094000	It'll be extra feminine.
8095000	8096000	Ew. Alright.
8101000	8105000	Rob's red again. It's adorable. Everybody should see how red Rob is right now.
8106000	8107000	I just can't wait for what I just said.
8108000	8109000	Yeah, well, you know what?
8110000	8111000	Take it out of context and end up on Tumblr.
8112000	8113000	You know what? I just can't even.
8114000	8115000	Well, then don't.
8116000	8118000	Fine. I've forgotten how to can.
8121000	8123000	I literally and I'm able to, okay?
8126000	8127000	Let's relay.
8128000	8130000	Moving on. Loki.
8131000	8133000	Alright. I don't know how I follow that.
8135000	8138000	So, apparently, Microsoft, you know, because there's the whole thing.
8139000	8149000	This goes back to Fortizella, their little thing that leaked out, talking about the road plan, you know, what they're doing with Kinect and what's going to be next gen stuff.
8149000	8158000	Well, apparently, they've paid up to $150 million for augmented reality hardware or at least the IP for it.
8159000	8162000	So, I guess this is coming from TechCrunch.
8163000	8174000	They're saying that the ever popular unnamed sources are saying that Microsoft has purchased augmented reality IP or wearable tech from Osterhout Design Group.
8174000	8191000	And I guess this is going to somehow tie into that Fortizella stuff, which is supposed to be, you know, some augmented reality thing that's going to first integrate with Kinect and then eventually become some sort of Google Glass type thing.
8192000	8194000	At least according to their roadmap, if that is to believe.
8195000	8196000	But so far, it's been pretty accurate.
8196000	8209000	So, yeah, be interesting to see what comes out of that or kind of what they do that, you know, counter all of this, you know, VR stuff.
8210000	8222000	And will it be worth it? Because honestly, how many goddamn times have I bought a camera from Microsoft and Sony and it's been just like gimmick shit, more gimmicky shit.
8223000	8224000	But hey, the dance games work.
8224000	8227000	I am going to need to see that killer game.
8228000	8234000	You know, and I talked about this last week. We talked about Project Morpheus with Sony and it really goes on. I need to see that killer app. I need to see that Wii Sports.
8235000	8250000	And I need to see that killer app at retail working correctly because when they showed, what was it, first off, the Fable game, that looked kind of weird and then it ended up not working too well.
8250000	8260000	Or when they were showing, what the fuck was that? Game of the Giant Controller, Jamie. Xbox game, giant controller.
8261000	8262000	Steel Battalion.
8263000	8275000	When they showed the Steel Battalion for Kinect, when they showed that for Kinect and it was like supposed to really utilize all the sensors and stuff, that looked kind of cool and then it didn't work.
8275000	8284000	So I just wanted to see something that actually works as well as Dance Central did or the other dance games that used it.
8285000	8291000	Because it seemed like that was the only thing that worked well with it. Maybe fitness games, but I just don't see the point of doing voice commands.
8292000	8298000	Voice commands in games, it doesn't make any sense. Especially for stuff that I can just push a button and do.
8299000	8303000	Oh my god, I just thought of something. Voice commands for Space Channel 5.
8303000	8304000	Amazing.
8304000	8305000	Where you repeat her commands.
8306000	8307000	Amazing.
8307000	8308000	I know, right?
8309000	8319000	Going to Jason in the chatroom, by the way, he noticed that Xbox.com is telling him that he has $5.25 in his account, so he bought Mount Your Friends.
8320000	8322000	But he said it still charged to his card.
8323000	8325000	Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah.
8326000	8328000	Everybody's points converted to the money, right?
8328000	8338000	Yeah, exactly. And it said I had fucking $22 in credit. And what did it do? It fucking charged my account when I tried to buy some DLC for fucking DJ Hero because it was expiring.
8339000	8346000	Fuck you, Microsoft. Seriously. What is the point of having credit in my account if I can't fucking use it on your goddamn website?
8347000	8348000	You sound very upset.
8349000	8356000	It is. It's annoying because it said it's going to charge my account, but I'm like, oh well I have money, so it's not going to charge my credit card. Oh, but no it did.
8356000	8363000	Well, I was trying to tell all those people out there that have like $2 in their account now to go buy Bungie Ferritas. Everybody's like, what am I going to buy with $2? Go buy Bungie Ferritas.
8364000	8369000	Well, here's the other thing too. You better read that fine print because that money that they converted over from points is expiring soon.
8370000	8371000	It's like a year out.
8372000	8374000	No. Mine said it was expiring in March.
8375000	8376000	What?
8376000	8377000	But I don't think it's actually expiring in March.
8378000	8379000	My Xbox 360 isn't even hooked up.
8379000	8385000	You got to be careful because they're going to take all that money they have. But yeah, I have like $20 some dollars. You know why I have $20 some dollars?
8386000	8388000	Because I fucking bought Grand Theft Auto 4.
8391000	8399000	And you know why I have $20 some dollars in credit? Because it took it from my fucking credit card and not from the $20 worth of points that it put in the goddamn system.
8400000	8403000	It's why I have $22. Thank you very much, Microsoft.
8404000	8406000	Alright, have you calmed down? Are you calm?
8407000	8408000	I'm fine, yeah.
8409000	8422000	Let's talk about another story that might ruffle the feathers of some Nintendo fans, some diehard Nintendo fans I know, because Nintendo has a pretty cool new series on its hands that's very well received with Bravely Default on the 3DS.
8423000	8434000	But Silicon Studios, who is the makers of Bravely Default, their president, Takehiro Terada, said in an interview recently that this title could, quote, expand onto other platforms.
8434000	8443000	Quote, we may expand in the future, but we don't have a clear plan yet. We're talking about that, maybe using other devices, but we don't have a clear plan.
8444000	8449000	We're trying to make a stronger franchise, just like Final Fantasy. We plan to continue with numerous titles.
8450000	8453000	Because they've said before they want to try and get one of these games out of year.
8454000	8461000	Now, I know some people want to take this news to mean, ooh, it could come to PlayStation 4, ooh, Xbox One, or ooh, the Vita or something like that.
8461000	8466000	But why is it that when I hear this, I think, ugh, mobile?
8467000	8469000	Because that's usually what happens.
8470000	8471000	Because it's Square Enix.
8472000	8480000	So, let's hope not. That's all I'm saying is that when I read this, I kind of go, ugh, mobile. But we'll see.
8481000	8484000	But Bravely Default was really good, and I hope they do do well.
8485000	8486000	Did you finish it, Rob?
8487000	8488000	I am nowhere close.
8489000	8490000	Because I was going to ask you if I could borrow yours.
8491000	8492000	I'm going to borrow it, but I've got to get it back.
8493000	8497000	Okay, well, look, I still need to play more Zelda, but Dan wants to replay it, so...
8498000	8500000	Okay. Well, we'll talk off air.
8501000	8502000	Okay.
8503000	8507000	But we can talk on air right now about the folks that email us every week at participate at OrangeLawnTradio.com.
8508000	8509000	You mean singular folk that emailed us?
8510000	8511000	One person?
8512000	8513000	Yeah.
8513000	8517000	Alright, well, if there's only one voice that wants to be heard, let's let them have their say.
8518000	8522000	It's the mailbag. Participate at OrangeLawnTradio.com in our shiny, sparkly one email tonight.
8523000	8525000	Hi, OLR Caps, yelling!
8526000	8527000	That's what it says.
8528000	8537000	As you know, I can't shut the hell up about the Binding of Isaac Rebirth, so I wanted to tell everyone about the game's developer Tumblr at BindingOfIsaac.com.
8538000	8546000	The site has cool animated gifs showing off the items, synergies, and general samples of the new ambient style music from the game.
8547000	8548000	The site updates on Monday nights.
8549000	8555000	If you don't mind sparing a bit of time, could you please play a bit of the new and seriously goddamn creepy track?
8556000	8557000	One word, creepy track.
8558000	8562000	For one of the game's penultimate levels, Shale, you say it like soul but with an H.
8563000	8566000	Actually, you say Shale, as that was pronounced, because it's a Jewish word.
8567000	8570000	And Rob, it's in the email.
8571000	8572000	Thank you for the lesson, DarkSaga.
8573000	8576000	Please lower the volume of the YouTube player a little bit before listening.
8577000	8579000	Okie dokie. That means it's going to be really loud, right?
8580000	8581000	Yeah.
8582000	8586000	Ok, let me see here. Well, there's a couple. Oh, ok, I see. It's this one here.
8587000	8589000	Don't educate me on saying things like that.
8589000	8590000	I'm going to use some paper.
8597000	8599000	It sounds like Nine Inch Nails doing the soundtrack for Quake.
8600000	8601000	I like it.
8603000	8605000	It's very goth club.
8607000	8609000	Now here's something interesting to think about.
8610000	8612000	Shale is the Old Testament's version of Hell. No, it's not.
8613000	8614000	Which is a cold and dark place.
8614000	8619000	Since Shale is now a penultimate level in Rebirth, you have to wonder what's worse than Hell for poor little Isaac.
8620000	8621000	Sweet Dreams, and it's from The Nasty Canasta.
8622000	8625000	And Shale, by the way, was never actually defined.
8626000	8629000	It could have been a precursor to the concept of Hell.
8630000	8638000	But as far as I learned when I converted to Judaism, there is not an actual, legitimate concept of Hell.
8639000	8643000	And Shale was more just a dark place that souls would go to reside.
8645000	8649000	Different rabbis will do it in different ways, but please do not educate me.
8650000	8652000	I have spent a lot of time studying this.
8654000	8655000	Ok.
8656000	8658000	Hello, why do you think I converted?
8659000	8663000	Well, I'm sure many religions have many different theories on it.
8664000	8665000	Yeah.
8666000	8667000	You want to hear something completely random?
8668000	8669000	Yes!
8669000	8676000	So, I got a notification on Facebook, you know, that my wife and stuff, so she basically said that our son rolled from his tummy to his back, but that's not the important part.
8677000	8682000	The important part is, I read this little trending thing on the side here, completely wrong, it said Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
8683000	8684000	I did not read that as beasts.
8685000	8686000	Fantastic Bees?
8687000	8688000	No, I read that as Fantastic Breasts and Where to Find Them.
8689000	8691000	Tell me more, J.K. Rawlings!
8691000	8704000	Well, let's see, this is hopeful about the whole Oculus on Facebook thing, if Fantastic Breasts can be trending, you never know.
8705000	8706000	Alright, anyhow.
8707000	8708000	Alright, thank you for the one email.
8709000	8712000	So, mailbag, excuse me, God, it's going to take me a while to recondition myself, sorry guys.
8713000	8716000	Participate at orangesontraday.com if you want to send us an email for the future.
8717000	8719000	In the meantime, we have to get into the FUs of the week.
8719000	8720000	Why?
8721000	8722000	Cuz.
8749000	8755000	I'm giving in to Mel, but I could eat one of those platform shoes in the other room.
8756000	8757000	Well, I don't need them anymore, so you can-
8758000	8763000	I'm giving in to Mel, but maybe Sanrio could lose a few pounds.
8764000	8765000	I'll eat some pussy.
8769000	8771000	Wow! Alright, next up, Loki.
8771000	8778000	Uh, potential FU to the next eight weeks, because I will no longer be working.
8779000	8783000	During this time, I'm taking a leave of absence to take care of my son.
8784000	8786000	It's going to be very stressful.
8789000	8797000	Savage has stayed home and watched the baby before, so, you know, it's like, you know, he doesn't calm himself, I have to hold him all the time.
8797000	8802000	Trying to get programming done.
8803000	8804000	That's going to be annoying.
8805000	8806000	Babies, they're so needy.
8807000	8810000	I have to take them to my wife's where there's your breastfeed and they have to go to the Kaiser tomorrow.
8811000	8812000	It's like, God, this is just as much work as work.
8813000	8814000	It's more work than work.
8815000	8816000	Exactly.
8817000	8818000	Alright, let's see, my FU of the week.
8819000	8823000	My FU of the week goes to the continued haunting of the sinus infection in my body.
8824000	8825000	I feel like it's still not completely gone.
8825000	8827000	This is going on like two weeks now, right?
8828000	8830000	Like, this stuff is only supposed to happen to Jamie, not me.
8831000	8833000	Like, go away, you stupid sinus infection.
8834000	8836000	I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, die.
8837000	8838000	Is that about right, Dark Sakura?
8839000	8840000	Mmm.
8841000	8843000	I don't know, I can't hear you over the sound of my rumbles.
8844000	8846000	Aw, I offered you a cracker, goddammit.
8847000	8849000	You know what? I'm going to eat half of it.
8850000	8851000	There you go. Do it.
8852000	8853000	But only half of it, because I promised.
8853000	8854000	Let's do it.
8855000	8863000	Alright, let's move on, and just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to go to the Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8864000	8865000	Loki.
8866000	8879000	Alright, so, basically, Nintendo's got some cool stuff coming to the Wii U, and this is virtual console stuff for Game Boy Advance.
8879000	8891000	You know, shit, this stuff's been out for, what, how long now? On, you know, the 3DS, at least, if you got a, you know, one of those I-bought-it-full-price reparation things.
8892000	8907000	But, for North America, and I guess this is starting in April, April 3rd, the first batch of stuff, so North America and Europe are getting Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, Metroid Fusion and Advanced Wars on April 3rd,
8907000	8919000	followed by WarioWare, Inc., Mega Microgames, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror on April 10th, April 17th, Golden Sun, F-Zero, Maximum Velocity.
8920000	8921000	Hey, there you go, there's your F-Zero game on Wii U.
8922000	8926000	And then followed by April 24th with Yoshi's Island, Super Mario Advance 3.
8927000	8929000	And then in Japan, they're kind of getting a few different things.
8930000	8941000	On April 3rd, they're getting F-Zero, Maximum Velocity, Advanced Wars 1 and 2, Kirby and the Amazing Mirror, WarioWare, Inc., Mega Microgames, Golden Sun, and Super Mario Advance 2.
8942000	8955000	And then April 30th, they're getting Kirby and the Nightmare in Dreamland, Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, Metroid Fusion, Zelda, The Minish Cap, Mario Tennis Power Tour, and Wario Land 4.
8956000	8958000	Sounds like they're getting a better lineup in Japan, to be honest.
8959000	8961000	Isn't that always the case, though, with a lot of Nintendo stuff?
8962000	8966000	How long do they have EarthBound before us? A long time.
8967000	8969000	In other cases, too.
8970000	8971000	Mother 3.
8972000	8975000	Which still is probably never going to come out here, ever, ever.
8976000	8988000	Well, last but not least, a little bit of sad news here that doesn't necessarily relate directly to video games, but definitely something that inspired many, many, many video games.
8989000	9001000	We say rest in peace this week to David A. Trampier, who, and I probably mispronounced that last name, sorry, but he is the artist who actually created the look of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.
9002000	9003000	So, like, he did the illustrations on the books.
9004000	9005000	Oh, yeah, I know him.
9006000	9011000	Those are from, like, the deities and demigods book, wasn't it? Some of those?
9012000	9014000	Oh, yeah, some of that's, like, really old stuff there.
9014000	9022000	In fact, actually, I think that isn't that one the cover for the deities and demigods book? I'd have to check because, no, that's not. That's the one for the first player's guide.
9023000	9025000	Yeah, I don't play D&D or anything.
9026000	9029000	Which is funny because this really looks a lot like the early Ultima box art to me.
9030000	9031000	It does.
9032000	9038000	So, you see that inspiration in games where his stuff carried over to, you know, what you see on some old games box art, so.
9038000	9048000	Yeah, very sad, very sad. And, you know, keep in mind, I probably got, like, a crate full of books that has his art in it, so. Because I played D&D.
9049000	9057000	He was not very much a fan of the public eye at all. In fact, the last picture that they can even find of him for these memorial articles is from 2003.
9058000	9066000	He disappeared in 1998. His comic Wormy for D&D was unfinished and he retired from illustration and he drove a taxi.
9066000	9070000	Didn't he also do some of the illustrations in Dragon Magazine through the 90s?
9071000	9072000	Oh, probably.
9073000	9074000	Through the 80s and 90s, I thought so.
9075000	9077000	Maybe in the early 80s. Maybe continued through the 90s, yeah.
9078000	9092000	Well, I mean, Dragon was discontinued, I want to say, before 2000. But, I swear, awesome, awesome art. Just completely, you know, it's probably, he's one of the reasons why, you know, I wanted to get into art.
9092000	9106000	I used to draw my D&D characters and, you know, work that way. It was really, really awful back then, but, you know, him and, what was her name? Julie Bell, I think?
9107000	9111000	And Boris Vallejo and all of those. I was really into the fantasy art.
9112000	9123000	So, obviously, a very great artist who has passed on. So, a rest in peace, sir, even though it seemed like he kind of shied away from that public life.
9124000	9127000	You know, but people sometimes do. They're right.
9128000	9134000	Alright, we are going to open up the skype line. 1877 Game OLR or a username on skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call.
9135000	9142000	We can talk about anything we've talked about on the show tonight or maybe something we missed. You can go ahead and give us a call. It's your chance to participate with the show.
9143000	9153000	I will also be going to our Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR to pull some stories here, but I'll ask Loki as well if he has any last minute stories or DarkSakura if she should have any last minute stories.
9154000	9164000	CookieMama5, bon appetit, coming to the 3DS this holiday. They're going to have 60 recipes and, yeah.
9165000	9166000	If you fuck it up, mama will fix it.
9167000	9171000	And new household activities. So, I guess you've got to sweep now or something.
9172000	9173000	Alright. Nope, sorry.
9174000	9175000	She has a burger shop.
9176000	9177000	Oh, you can cook burgers with mama now?
9178000	9179000	Yeah.
9180000	9181000	Can you spit in the food like they do at Real Burger Choice?
9181000	9182000	No, don't say that while I'm hungry.
9183000	9188000	Alright. Let's go to the phones and take a call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9189000	9194000	God, don't say that when I'm waiting to be announced onto the show. Holy crap, Rob.
9195000	9196000	Sorry, Jason. How are you doing, Jason?
9197000	9201000	Especially since I just got back from dinner, too. That leaves it settling really, really well in my stomach now.
9202000	9203000	What did you eat? Chicken strips and snot?
9204000	9210000	No and no, and since you watched them prepare it, it's not so bad, but I ran down a Chipotle real quick.
9211000	9214000	There you go. That won't give you gas. Well, what's up, buddy?
9215000	9220000	I was just kind of reflecting on the episode and thinking about the things that have been covered tonight.
9221000	9225000	And I think the most interesting and fortunate one is the Humble Bundle key reselling.
9226000	9227000	Yeah.
9228000	9235000	There's not an answer to this. There's not a solution to this because it's literally the same cat and mouse game that piracy revolves around.
9235000	9236000	Yeah.
9237000	9247000	I as a kid, I was a huge fucking pirate. As soon as a buddy of mine turned me onto one of those mod chips that just hooks into the data port at the back of the original PlayStation,
9248000	9254000	I had a very massive collection of burned games by somebody who knew more than me at the time and knew what they were doing.
9255000	9257000	And that continued into my PS2 years.
9258000	9263000	Real quick, though, and I'm not going to say that this makes it right or that I'm going to excuse it or I'm defending piracy.
9263000	9271000	However, most people who have done that at one point in their lives, like I'm sure a lot of people downloaded CDs from Napster and all that stuff back in the day,
9272000	9278000	they weren't exactly A, taking money out of charity's hand necessarily, or B, selling them for profit.
9279000	9280000	Yeah, absolutely.
9281000	9286000	We can debate piracy and if that's a bad thing or whatever, but this is like super piracy.
9287000	9290000	We can agree that when you resell the shit, that's really bad.
9290000	9294000	It's one thing to be bad and it's another to be really, really bad, right?
9295000	9305000	Yeah, the law doesn't give a shit about the scales, but in my mind the scales really are this is something interesting and it's illegal to be doing,
9306000	9311000	but you want to check something out, you're on the fence about something, you find a way to do that.
9311000	9320000	The second tier, which is shady but not miserable, is that you only recoup costs for parts like physical media and that kind of stuff.
9321000	9326000	And then the third tier is the fact that you're straight up profiting from it and that's where everything enters douche town.
9327000	9333000	The other situations like this that I started thinking about when that article came up were I remember somebody,
9333000	9344000	like there was a mini outrage over Netflix because some imported movie had a subbing group's credits in either the start or the end of the movie,
9345000	9348000	but I'm pretty damn sure Netflix didn't steal the subs from the subbing group.
9349000	9360000	Some asshole publisher took that media and entered into an agreement with Netflix over it and probably somebody that was skirting by with a couple of titles to line their pockets a little bit more.
9360000	9378000	Yeah, it's a limit with everything and it would be nice to say that you shouldn't look for these deals that are unlawful because presumably they'll be better ones in the next steam sale for, I don't know, spring or summer or whatever the next one is that's even going to happen.
9379000	9389000	Because the whole point of it is the immediate satisfaction and the people that are in a position to be able to offer that just cheap enough, just good enough, somebody's going to take them up on it.
9390000	9401000	Yeah. I just kind of wish, you know, I wish that the buyers would not support that, but I realize not everybody's going to be clued in to necessarily what the Humble Bundle is,
9402000	9413000	especially in the worldwide marketplace where I think, you know, you could kind of tell from the broken English in the statement that these companies probably don't sell to a lot of people in North America.
9414000	9427000	Yeah. There's even another part of this that a friend of mine has been, like before the anime convention, a friend of mine was just kind of talking about stuff and asking me for help sifting through pages and pages and pages of products.
9427000	9446000	And there's, this is a whole other deal about like, I don't want to call them bootlegs because that's presumptuous, but people that can just take advantage of the massive amounts of transactions and, oh sure, these are, these have your favorite sports teams logos on there. No, they weren't iron on transfers.
9447000	9456000	This is, this is an everything problem and it's really, it's really, really unfortunate and it is an education problem, which means everybody's not going to get it.
9457000	9476000	Education isn't perfect. It's just that simple. People will draw their own conclusions and find their own things because of this vast internet and even just walking around freaking flea marts or anything, anything else where you're just in a mass of, a massive community of some sort.
9476000	9490000	People will come to the wrong solution. That's why, that's why fishing exists. That's why bootlegging can be so prominent in this sort of thing. It's unfortunate, but it's the case.
9491000	9501000	Absolutely. Well, before I let you go, what might be the answer to this? How do we get this to stop? And I'm sure you probably don't know, but what are your thoughts?
9501000	9521000	I absolutely don't have one. This is, this is the cat and mouse game. Like for the, the answer is nothing like we've done, but I don't think there is an answer because this is a, this is a social problem. This is a people problem and technology does not overcome people problems because people will always find the exception.
9521000	9527000	Hmm. You know, that whole statement you just said could kind of apply to the Facebook thing we were talking about earlier in the show.
9527000	9542000	It's funny cause I was going to say the Xbox, the Xbox live karma story as well. There's, there's going to be massive mobs of people abusing it because you take something out of context when you, when you deliberately make shit up.
9542000	9555000	Um, hell, let's look at the fricking Ubisoft losing the watchdogs patent, uh, trademark. Um, like there's, there's a way for a person to fuck this up.
9556000	9563000	Guys, you know, worst thing cause you don't, our chat room at live.vog network.com says we have to shut the internet off. It's the only way you can't do that.
9564000	9571000	That's going to take us forward. Oh wait. Backwards 20, 30 years. That's what causes civil unrest in some countries. You can't take away what people.
9572000	9580000	And the internet is to blame for the Boston tea party. Come the fuck on people, people. That's exactly the point that I just made.
9581000	9589000	But, but, well, but at the same time, I totally get what Kaiju does saying. I mean, he is right in a way you would, you would that you, you can't actually do that, but that's the only way you would end it.
9589000	9593000	No, you, you, you would end it on one medium and it would go somewhere else.
9594000	9599000	All right. Well, Jason, thank you very much for your thoughts. Uh, always exciting. Anything else you want to share with listeners before I let you go?
9600000	9604000	Uh, sorry about the bummer town guys. I just kinda, that's what came to mind tonight.
9605000	9608000	No, that's all right. It happens sometimes. Maybe somebody will call in next to the fart joke. We'll see. All right.
9609000	9610000	It would redeem a lot.
9610000	9613000	All right. Bye my friend. Have a good night guys. Later.
9614000	9625000	1877 game OLR or username on Skype, orange lounge radio. That of course is Jason who also produces the YouTube videos that you see at our YouTube channel, youtube.com slash orange launch radio, uh, which I still need to do.
9626000	9632000	A lot of you have no idea what this new studio looks like. I need to get that video done. So I'm going to try to work on that this week, but you know, no promises.
9632000	9640000	Cause again, I got to start the South park video game, you know, priorities, people priorities, but our priority right now is this next caller. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9641000	9643000	That's the one and only Ron man. Yes. You need to start on the South park game.
9644000	9650000	I know, I know. I've, I've been keeping myself relatively spoiler free, although everybody tells me I need to see the part in Canada.
9651000	9656000	There's something else that's spoiled for me too, but uh, I won't, I won't return the favor. So, but I'm very excited to play.
9657000	9658000	Good, good, good.
9659000	9660000	What's on your mind, buddy?
9660000	9669000	A few things. First things first, I'm actually dressed from the top up and you don't even turn the cam on. I'm insulted. I got dressed for no reason.
9670000	9676000	Well, here's the thing. Loki is back in studio, so I don't have to have that whole weird rig to have two people on Skype at the same time without doing a conference.
9677000	9682000	So video may return eventually at some point. I don't know. We'll see. No promises.
9682000	9687000	Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You said you're dressed from the top up. Is that why you're not wearing pants?
9688000	9689000	Maybe.
9690000	9693000	Don't stand up. Don't. You just, you stay seated, sir.
9694000	9701000	What? Here's, here's something that, you know, I know this is like nobody awesome is to get, to be capturing this video, capturing all this stuff.
9702000	9708000	So we could, you know, take video of Ron Ma talking or whatever and actually have that in the YouTube thing.
9708000	9715000	Funny enough, and I shouldn't say this because now Jason's going to want me to do it. I can actually do that.
9716000	9730000	I think, well, here's the thing. This computer that we use too is still like, it's a little bit older, so I don't know if it would have all that bandwidth to be able to encode and write a video to disk at the exact same time that we're doing, we're broadcasting the show and it's encoding the audio too.
9731000	9732000	There's a way around that.
9733000	9734000	There's a way around that. All right.
9734000	9735000	Well, there's a way.
9736000	9740000	Techmaster Loki, live up to your name. If you want to do it, we'll figure it out. Anyway, sorry buddy.
9741000	9742000	It's cool, it's cool.
9743000	9744000	What's up?
9745000	9751000	All right, I just want you to know, I listened to last week's show because I was out and about and I'm just going one week and shit went nuts.
9752000	9761000	Because first things first, the joke book was destroyed a couple of years ago. Me and Act F forced Drew to destroy the joke book. So I don't know how Rageinator got it.
9761000	9771000	Clearly he picked up the ashes and like a phoenix, it rose from the ashes. The joke book can't be destroyed. You have to cut off its head. It's like Highlander, okay?
9772000	9773000	Phoenix, Necronomicon, same thing.
9774000	9779000	No, I did actually pass on the joke book to someone else. Remember we have a new intern?
9780000	9781000	No, no, yeah, Rageinator.
9782000	9784000	Oh, I must have missed him mentioning Rageinator then.
9784000	9793000	Well, yes. That's what he's pissed about is that we gave away a book that apparently was destroyed. Well, you know what, sir? We made it and we'll make it again.
9794000	9799000	We found it, sorry. We did a temporal restoration.
9800000	9801000	You know what else we're going to make?
9802000	9803000	What?
9804000	9805000	Games that start chicks with flamethrowers.
9806000	9807000	Hey, I'm all for that.
9807000	9819000	All right, so you were filing a petition against Rageinator getting the joke book. Your case has been heard and we'll get back to you in eight to ten weeks. What else is on your mind?
9820000	9827000	Eight to ten weeks, dammit. Just so you know, Rob, I was the one that posted the Castlevania info on your Facebook. That was me.
9828000	9829000	Yes.
9830000	9833000	So you couldn't remember who it was, so I'm like, that was me.
9833000	9844000	I didn't have my Facebook in front of me. I just had the little show rule that we work from. It's been a long weekend, Rama. Did I mention I was up till 3 a.m. last night because drag queens? Did I mention that?
9845000	9851000	Yes, I know, and I understand because I've been so busy with work this whole week that I skipped out on a con on Saturdays. I just couldn't get up.
9852000	9857000	You missed it, and nothing dirty, people. Get your minds out of the gutter, for God's sake. I know I was hanging out with Grandpa, but it wasn't like that. All right.
9858000	9859000	Yeah.
9860000	9871000	So, you know, I'm coming in tonight from food shopping, and I catch onto the show, and I hear you going on this rant and tirade about that podcast is doing the Kickstarter.
9872000	9880000	My first thought was, if I was there in the studio, we'd be chasing them now with pitchforks and shotguns because I feel the same way.
9880000	9888000	You know what? I'm torn on this sort of thing because I'm not one to tell other people what they should and shouldn't do.
9889000	9896000	I know, and you're right, but it's like this. I would never put my podcast on because if I do all these promises, are people going to want them?
9897000	9903000	It's like, we can't go to half these conventions because some of us can't get the time off and this and that, and you're right.
9903000	9912000	I want to have that ability where if all of us sit down one day and be like, you know what? We're coming down to the end. Let's do our final episodes and just knock it out.
9913000	9915000	Just have at it, you know?
9916000	9925000	I don't know how we would ever do the last Orange Lounge Radio. I mean, obviously, that day will come eventually. We're going to have to do a last episode.
9926000	9932000	But I'd like to think we're somehow going to give it a Viking funeral where we set it on fire and set it out to sea.
9935000	9941000	I think that's the only appropriate way to end the show, but let's not talk about the end because whenever it happens, it happens.
9942000	9943000	But in the meantime, we're enjoying the ride, right?
9944000	9956000	And the whole thing about the whole piracy. Same thing in the anime fandom. It's like, they'll bootleg the episodes, but when it comes out commercially, even at a decent price, nobody wants to buy it for various reasons.
9957000	9968000	And I mean, I'm guilty of that too, but on the same token, when the price comes to the right, I will buy the box sets. I will buy the merchandise. I will support my fandoms one way or another.
9969000	9973000	It's just the current generation of spoiled brats that are mucking it up for everybody else.
9974000	9975000	Get off my lawn.
9976000	9977000	Exactly. That's exactly how I feel half the time.
9978000	9981000	Rama, anything else you want to share with us before I let you go?
9982000	9985000	Yeah, you forgot to tell everyone about the number one rumor about you for April Fools.
9986000	9987000	Uh oh. What?
9988000	9989000	You're actually straight.
9990000	9992000	Everybody knows that's a lie.
9993000	9995000	Straight has a three dollar bill.
9996000	9999000	If you fall for that one, you deserve it. Alright.
10000000	10002000	There's one person in the bunch.
10003000	10006000	Alright, Rama. Thanks for the call, buddy.
10007000	10008000	You got it. You got it.
10009000	10010000	Alright, later. Later.
10010000	10015000	Okay, just because like I've made out with chicks and y'all gonna bring my sexuality into question.
10016000	10017000	It was still weird.
10018000	10019000	Oh yeah, you saw me make out with the chick nuts, huh?
10020000	10021000	Oh yeah.
10022000	10023000	How old were we? Like 12?
10024000	10026000	It was the night that Shane and I invented Dunk.
10027000	10029000	I actually vaguely remember that.
10030000	10037000	We were sitting on AIM, chatting with people while you guys were all playing Spin the Bottle because we totally didn't want to.
10037000	10040000	And we invented Dunk instead of Drunk.
10044000	10046000	Shane needs to hurry the fuck up and move out here.
10047000	10048000	I think he's trying.
10049000	10050000	Will Shane move out here?
10051000	10052000	I don't think he's listening.
10053000	10054000	Too bad. Shane, listen.
10055000	10056000	Shane, listen.
10057000	10060000	You can sleep on the couch at my house if you need to. Although Rob has more room now.
10061000	10063000	He might take you up on that.
10064000	10066000	You can sleep with all of my stinky oil paintings.
10067000	10072000	Alright. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype. OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.
10073000	10074000	Let's see.
10075000	10078000	Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, I see Tigerclaw says,
10079000	10085000	Why would anyone want a bootleg copy of an anime when it's of poor quality? It's better having a pristine copy of it, especially if it's in HD.
10086000	10092000	It's the same reason people watch cam rips of movies. I think that's a horrible way to watch a movie.
10092000	10103000	But I have HD quality anime rips that I got off the internet for a series that I've been told I apparently have to watch.
10104000	10105000	That doesn't make it right.
10106000	10112000	So? Well then bring it out over here. Shit. And stop fucking up the Claymore translations. My god. Seriously.
10113000	10117000	Let me go to a couple tweets and then I'll check in one more time with Loki on the last minute stories.
10117000	10125000	sj100matt sent a tweet that says, Do you still have your Amiga 500 games but no way to play them? An Indiegogo project hopes to change that.
10126000	10133000	I actually never owned an Amiga 500. Although I know Amigas were super popular and I was certainly a fan of the Commodore 64.
10134000	10145000	But yeah, there's an Indiegogo project and he sent us a link there. It's an Indiegogo campaign hoping to provide Commodore enthusiasts and retro gamers with an authentic as possible experience to the original Amiga with an all-in-one enclosed package.
10145000	10152000	So I guess it's kind of like when they re-released the Commodore 64 that had like a Commodore emulator mode. They want to try to do something like that.
10153000	10160000	So that's pretty cool. And there were some really classic Amiga games we've talked about in the Classic Game of the Week and so forth before.
10161000	10172000	Our pal SFRedhead sent us a tweet talking about, Rob, Facebook buys Oculus for $2 billion. Yikes! And certainly there was a lot of tweets at us that day.
10173000	10184000	But yes, that was all over the internet. So I'm curious now though, now that y'all have had a week to marinate on the news and we've talked about it earlier in the show tonight, now how are you feeling about things?
10184000	10191000	Because I think this is another one of those reactions that was, da fuck? But now that you've had a week to marinate on it, what do you guys think at this point?
10192000	10195000	And a shout out to AscendedLeo who sent a tweet to the last show that said,
10196000	10203000	Ass bleach? Bacon beer? This episode is fucking hilarious. I'm at work laughing like an insane man. My, I think I've lost it.
10204000	10207000	Yes, you have lost it. Congratulations and welcome to the O.L. Army.
10207000	10218000	But you know what, I actually credit a lot of that to the energy that comes with moving to a new space and having Loki back with us. The Skype thing was a good band-aid, but having Loki back here is good.
10219000	10220000	It wasn't the same.
10221000	10232000	And also Jason had sent us a tweet earlier in the week that I want to give a shout out here too because apparently after the last show, he ran out and bought breakfast cereal and he tweeted us on his counter,
10233000	10237000	Honeycomb, Frosted Cheerios, Honey Nut Cheerios, Frosted Flakes, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
10238000	10240000	And no Captain Crunch. Don't get it.
10241000	10244000	If you're gonna get Captain Crunch, get Peanut Butter Crunch.
10245000	10246000	It's just like candy.
10247000	10251000	Alright, one last, one last shout out for phone calls. If we don't get any, then we'll wrap it up.
10252000	10256000	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10257000	10258000	Loki, any last minute stories?
10259000	10260000	Uh, nope.
10261000	10262000	That's it?
10263000	10265000	That's pretty much it, yeah. Nothing.
10266000	10270000	Well, and the phones aren't ringing so I guess that's that.
10271000	10274000	I guess everybody's probably too busy watching the stupid Walking Dead.
10275000	10283000	Well, I shouldn't call it stupid because I know a lot of people are really into it and so forth, but you could've DVR'd it and watched it tomorrow, but whatever.
10284000	10289000	Well, thank you to those of you that are here tonight and even those of you that chose to watch the Walking Dead tonight.
10290000	10294000	If you listen to us on the podcast feed, I forgive you because you're still supporting the show so I want to say a big thank you.
10294000	10302000	And yeah, support independent broadcasting. You know what, even if you didn't like this particular show, well A, thank you for at least listening all the way to the very end.
10303000	10310000	But B, just support other independent podcasters. There's so many out there who work very hard at what they do and people that have a real passion for this.
10311000	10317000	You know, just yeah, support your favorite indie podcast with your emails and your kind tweets and all that good stuff there.
10317000	10327000	Oh yeah, BlackWolf wanted me to point out this. He's in our chat room. He wanted me to point out this clarification here. This is something Loki brought up earlier in the show.
10328000	10336000	Okay, this is about the Xbox currency and this whole thing. The currency we add to your account at the time of the transition will expire on June 1st, 2015.
10337000	10344000	However, the currency you purchase and add to your account after the transition will not expire. But you had to initiate the transfer before March 1st.
10344000	10351000	So if you didn't transfer it to real money, you lost the points. So if you did, they'd go away on June 1st, 2015.
10352000	10355000	I think that'll... I've never transitioned the points. I just got...
10356000	10357000	They did that for you though, I thought.
10358000	10359000	Yeah, I just got it in my account.
10360000	10361000	But I think it's true.
10362000	10368000	I think you still have until June 1st to spend those points. But you're all going to go buy an indie game like Bungie Paratossing.
10368000	10373000	But that's the thing though, is they should allow me to spend my points. Like I should be able to choose points as an option.
10374000	10381000	And even still, even on the console, like when I bought that game, it defaults to your credit card and you have to manually like change it.
10382000	10391000	It doesn't just default to points, which is stupid. It's a good way though to get you to spend another $10 or $20 off your credit card instead of using the points that they're going to make expire at some point.
10392000	10393000	Yes it is.
10394000	10401000	Alright, well thanks again for listening to our show. And if you enjoyed the show tonight, or even if you hated it, I would appreciate it if you helped spread the word.
10402000	10404000	You can tell a friend or five about the show.
10405000	10413000	You can give us a nice review on a site like iTunes or Stitcher Radio. Those really do go a long way in helping the exposure on those various sites. So we really, really appreciate it.
10414000	10419000	The time has come for us to go around and get everybody's final thoughts. So Dark Sakura, please, your final thought tonight.
10420000	10421000	Food.
10421000	10423000	Food. Loki, your final thought tonight.
10426000	10437000	Next week's going to be interesting. That's all I got to say. I'm hoping to be able to play some games and code some stuff and hopefully I'm not going to be juggling Baby the entire time.
10438000	10440000	He does nap though for a few hours, so it'll be that.
10441000	10448000	And my final thought tonight is, I can't wait to sleep. Because sleep is awesome. I don't want to sleep forever.
10448000	10449000	I don't want to sleep forever. I'm not ready for that yet.
10450000	10451000	Oh my god, sleep sounds great.
10452000	10453000	I want to sleep for like 13 hours.
10454000	10455000	I want food first and then I can sleep.
10456000	10457000	And then sleep.
10458000	10460000	Because I think I have like the minor version of that crud. Of the tired crud.
10461000	10462000	That's no fun.
10463000	10464000	Don't you dare give it to me.
10465000	10467000	Rob! Jeez, how rude. Rude!
10468000	10471000	No, it's not rude. It's just selfish. There's a difference.
10472000	10476000	It's both. You should be like, oh, I hope you feel better soon. So don't get me sick!
10476000	10478000	Yeah, I hope you feel better soon. So you don't get me sick.
10479000	10486000	Pitch please. No, I think that I had already gotten it earlier and I'm just getting over it.
10487000	10492000	But I didn't even realize I was sick until I was at work and I was like, oh my god, I'm fucking tired.
10493000	10496000	Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, don't die.
10498000	10499000	Everyone dies someday.
10499000	10509000	That's one of the things that one of the drag queens said at the show last night. There was the drag queens comedy show in San Francisco and there was a lot of legendary.
10510000	10511000	What? Take me!
10512000	10520000	Blame Grandpa was his idea. So one of the drag queens was Coco Peru and she had this moment, you know, Coco Peru, which by the way, she has a hilarious YouTube of her playing Grand Theft Auto 5.
10521000	10522000	Oh, awesome.
10523000	10529000	But she kind of walked out there and she said, you know, I had this really interesting thought today that everybody in this room someday will be dead.
10532000	10533000	Love her.
10535000	10544000	By the way, Rob, you know what we have to do? We have to go to the Peaches Christ midnight mass, see Showgirls and live tweet it.
10545000	10546000	You know what they're doing in May?
10547000	10548000	Cereal mom.
10549000	10550000	I haven't seen that. Do you know?
10550000	10554000	What? Sally Struthers. This is my bad side.
10555000	10556000	Okay, we're going.
10557000	10558000	Sorry, Sally Struthers. Suzanne Summers.
10559000	10560000	So we're going.
10561000	10562000	Wow, I fucked up that quote.
10563000	10564000	We're going then, right?
10565000	10566000	Sure. I don't know. I have to check the calendar. I promise.
10567000	10568000	I'll fucking go.
10569000	10571000	I've got Rocky Horror season coming up again, so it's going to be a hoot and a holler.
10572000	10573000	You know what now you made me think of?
10574000	10577000	One day Grandma Grandpa gonna be dead.
10578000	10583000	Don't tell them they're going to die. They already know.
10584000	10589000	Wow, on that note, we really, now we're just stealing from comics.
10590000	10592000	So I think we really need to end the show tonight. Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
10593000	10594000	Oh, wait, wait.
10595000	10596000	He killed Fritz!
10597000	10598000	Bye.
10599000	10600000	Wasn't that from what? The Wizards? That was from the Wizards.
10601000	10602000	The Wizard. I love that movie.
10603000	10604000	He touched my breast!
10604000	10606000	The Wizards. That was the animation from the 70s or some shit.
10607000	10608000	Can I end the show?
10609000	10610000	Fine! Bye!
10635000	10637000	But you know they were all still true.
10640000	10641000	See you next week.
10664000	10674000	Thanks for watching!
