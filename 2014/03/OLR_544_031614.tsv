7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week, on the heels of Amazon's entry into game publishing, Google recently acquired a game peripheral company likely for use on a future Android device. Also, the first rule of DriveClub is do not talk about DriveClub's release date, because there isn't one. We'll tell you about all this and more on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	50000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio for this March the, not the 13th, the day we're recording, but March the 16th of 2014 with episode number 544 of our show.
50000	60000	Hello from the past, but I'll get to that in a minute. My name is Rob Roberts, joining you as always with my co-hosts. Say hello here with me in studio to Jamie Sommers for DarkSakura.
60000	62000	I live through the power of caffeine.
62000	63000	How are you doing?
63000	66000	Sup bitches who aren't in chat.
66000	69000	You're somewhere between caffeinated and coffee-nated.
69000	76000	I guess. I'd live on coffee since I work in tech support. My entire diet is coffee.
77000	84000	Is it instead of like, you know, the big jugs of water, you know, filtered water that most offices have, they just have jugs of coffee?
84000	88000	We have coffee makers in all of our break rooms that give us free coffee.
88000	89000	Nice. It's important.
89000	91000	With the option of a half-caf.
91000	92000	Okay.
92000	100000	So, the land of cubes in tech is equipped with coffee. It should also be the lands of cube tech in coffee, but that wouldn't make a good acronym.
100000	102000	It wouldn't be quite as good of an acronym.
102000	106000	We also say hello via the Skype line once again. He's with us this week. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
106000	107000	Hello.
107000	108000	Hey, how you doing, Loki?
108000	109000	Doing all right.
109000	113000	Yeah. How's being a dad going?
113000	115000	It's going okay.
115000	116000	Yeah.
116000	117000	Tiring.
117000	123000	Any new projects that you've been able to start while you've been trying to raise the kids in between?
123000	128000	I've been working in Unity. That's about it.
128000	130000	Were you inspired by FlappyVog?
130000	140000	Not necessarily. Well, sort of. Basically, I looked at the amount of cell phone games that are out there and how people make kind of a quick buck.
140000	151000	The way I look at it is if I put something together, even if it just does mildly okay, it's still more money than no money. So, you know, why not?
151000	154000	So, you just kind of want to throw something out there and see what sticks?
154000	159000	Well, originally I was going to do something like that.
159000	168000	But then I ended up going back to... Originally when I was trying to make games and stuff, I had a bunch of concepts I was throwing around.
168000	175000	And I actually had stuck with one. You're going to love this, except the fact that all the work is gone now.
175000	184000	I actually was working on an F-Zero GX clone at one time, and it was on my old laptop hard drive, and I lost everything.
184000	186000	No!
187000	192000	But that was really cool. I may go back to that someday, but all my work's gone there.
192000	198000	So I started a new project, and I've been kind of chugging along with it, and it's okay so far.
198000	206000	I'm just trying to get some of what I wanted out of the engine done, and then I kind of have a basic idea of what I want to do.
206000	213000	But I'm trying not to get, you know, they call it feature creep, where you start like, hey, I want to do this and this and this and this.
213000	222000	And it just gets overly complicated. But so far, because I've watched lots of videos and read things about Unity and programming and all that stuff.
222000	229000	And I just don't retain any of it unless I actually do it. So I've been doing it, and I've been learning a lot.
229000	231000	So that's what I'm kind of doing now.
231000	240000	That's very normal. I do the corporate training for a living, and we learn as trainers pretty early on that some people live by hearing, some people live by watching.
240000	246000	A lot of people learn by doing, and the best method of teaching people involves some combination of the three.
246000	252000	So by you kind of, you know, listening and hearing the YouTube and then actually getting the hands-on practice, I think, is the most important part.
252000	257000	But, you know, there was that big interview that came out with Dong Nguyen this week in Rolling Stone.
257000	261000	Somebody finally tracked him down and found him. He did that big interview to Rolling Stone.
261000	264000	And it really sounded like, you know, he never intended to make the type of money.
264000	268000	I think we kind of knew this anyway based on his tweets, but he never intended to make the kind of money off Flappyware that he did.
268000	275000	It just kind of took off and it went viral. So you never know what games are going to go viral or what games may not catch on.
275000	280000	It's cool that I kind of, you know, want to do that, but, I mean, I don't think you can really expect that.
280000	286000	And all I'm trying to do is I'm trying to do something somewhat unique, but I don't know.
286000	293000	I've already, in my process of, you know, researching stuff, I found one other game that's very similar.
293000	298000	But the style-wise is going to be completely different and the tone of it is going to be kind of different.
298000	306000	So, we'll see. But right now, I mean, I actually had some problems in the engine that I was trying to solve.
306000	311000	And I actually came up with a creative solution that worked. So I was like, wow, I actually learned something.
311000	320000	You know, there's a plug-in that I knew nothing about and I was just like, oh, I don't know how the heck to use this.
320000	325000	And, like, during lunch today, I figured out how to use it. I was like, okay, cool. So I'm actually going to be able to do this, I think.
325000	326000	Another little piece of the puzzle.
326000	327000	Yeah.
327000	333000	Well, good luck to you. We're going to check in on updates when we get over to our new studio, which, to kind of transition a little bit,
333000	338000	I think, unless this is your very first time listening to Orange Ons Radio, in which case, welcome.
338000	344000	And I warn you tonight is a very different sort of episode. But for those of you guys that do listen to Orange Ons Radio every week,
345000	352000	you guys know that we're actually not live on Sunday night this week because I am currently in the process of moving from the apartment that I'm currently in
352000	357000	into a house where our new studio will be at. So, therefore, we had to shut down the show for this week.
357000	363000	But we still wanted to, you know, those of you guys that rely on us to be there every week, we wanted to give you at least a little something,
363000	367000	even though the show tonight will probably be a lot shorter than what we're used to.
367000	370000	And a big part of that reason is that we do not have our chat room tonight.
370000	376000	But for those that are listening to the premiere on Sunday night, a big hello to all you guys in chat who stuck around after Bobby's show
376000	384000	because we do typically tape live on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network,
384000	391000	vognetwork.com. And we will be back there next week, barring any major malfunctions in the new studio.
391000	398000	Just a disclaimer there. We will be back in the next week with a brand new live show and look forward to having you guys there.
399000	400000	But not a dead show.
400000	407000	Well, let's hope. Let's hope. I don't want this to be our last episode ever. Although I'm sure it will be a fine episode.
407000	416000	We're gonna hit on some of the usual segments that we usually do here, just in a bit more speedy format if, for lack of a better term.
416000	421000	We don't really have a kickoff topic tonight, so I'm gonna get right into our gaming weeks.
421000	425000	So, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week? What kind of video games have you been playing this week?
425000	433000	I did play some Final Fantasy XIV, and I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing, which I just wrapped up doing, because these bitches keep inviting themselves to my house.
433000	440000	This is so funny. We were just about ready to record, and I'm coming out of the restroom, heading over to the coffee machine, and DarkSakura go,
440000	447000	I hate it! I hate it when people invite themselves over to my house. And I'm like, whoa, is somebody at your house? Do you, like, have to go?
447000	454000	And she's like, I'm talking about Animal Crossing. I'm like, oh. I thought maybe, like, somebody let themselves into your house, like they wanted to play pinball or something.
454000	457000	And she goes to my house. Just me and the cat.
457000	459000	I've been to your house. That's not true.
459000	460000	Yeah, like, four times.
460000	462000	That's a few times.
462000	464000	It's all good. It's all good.
464000	468000	I watched Showgirls with you. It was girl bonding.
468000	469000	That was awesome.
469000	474000	And then you got to try...
474000	476000	No, we had the bottle of Frivolo that night, didn't we?
476000	480000	No, no, no, no. You got to try the honey wine.
480000	482000	If it involved liquor? I don't remember.
482000	485000	I got to try the elderberry wine. That stuff was amazing.
485000	487000	Yeah, you, me, and Monet will have to get together and watch more scary movies again.
487000	488000	Heck yeah.
488000	490000	Anyway, sorry to interrupt your gaming week.
490000	491000	Girl.
491000	492000	Final Fantasy XIV?
492000	498000	Yeah, I played that. Played Animal Crossing. That's about it, because I've been working, working it.
498000	503000	But I am very sad, because I cannot do my birthday at Disneyland this year.
503000	505000	Because it's fucking Easter.
505000	508000	Oh, so it's going to be packed.
508000	511000	You always run into that danger around your birthday, though.
511000	516000	I do. And it's also the last weekend of Passover, so I have to observe and not have K go on my birthday again.
516000	520000	We all have these odd events that happen around our birthday. Like, you have Easter.
520000	523000	Sometimes there are mass murders on my birthday.
523000	529000	You know what's always around my birthday is the Gay Pride Parade in San Francisco.
529000	530000	Oh, that's right.
530000	533000	So that's where all my friends want to go. They're like, they don't care about my birthday.
533000	537000	Speaking of games and gay, I have my ticket to GamerX.
537000	538000	I heard!
538000	544000	Thanks to a lovely listener, which I don't know if he wants me to say it was him, but happy birthday.
544000	546000	You know who you are. Wink, wink.
546000	549000	Happy birthday to me. Thank you very much for the ticket. I greatly appreciate it.
549000	553000	That was really cool. Jamie told me who you are, obviously, and I'm like, that was so cool of him.
553000	558000	Yeah. So that means I get to go. So I'm not as depressed about Disneyland anymore.
558000	563000	So I'm actually probably going to be even canceling my time off request for work, so that I can take the time off for GamerX.
563000	568000	Hopefully it'll work out where we're going to have a panel again this year and this time you can be on the panel.
568000	569000	Cool.
569000	571000	And so some of our listeners can come meet you.
571000	574000	But now I have to cosplay and I have no time to make a fucking costume.
574000	581000	So anyone listening to this show, if you want to help me make a costume or, you know, I will buy fucking material and whatever.
581000	589000	I know some people here locally through the theater stuff I've done that can help you out, especially one girl I'm thinking of actually specializes in cosplay.
589000	592000	She would cost though. So it just kind of depends if you're willing to spend the money.
592000	600000	Well, the ideas that I have is just doing a, you know, a femme shop costume, just the pants and my hoodie, just because it'd be easy and quick.
600000	602000	Well, if you cosplay, I'm going to have to cosplay.
602000	606000	Hell yeah. My other one is wanting to do something Homestuck.
606000	610000	At least I could use mine at Dragon Con also, so it wouldn't be a complete waste.
610000	616000	I want to do a Silph of Heart costume for Homestuck, which actually looks really easy. It's just I don't sew for shit.
617000	625000	I have butchered and put together all of my last costumes from thrift store finds, which granted my Jill Valentine costume was really good.
625000	632000	Thrift stores where it's at, you don't know how many Rocky horrors and clues and repos, genetic operas and all that.
632000	634000	Do you remember my Shorty cosplay?
634000	636000	Oh god.
636000	638000	And my Emmy cosplay.
638000	639000	That was when I first met you.
639000	642000	That was. I wore it to AX 2000.
642000	644000	For those that don't know who Shorty or Emmy are?
644000	649000	Shorty from, I did the Bust a Move 2 version, or Bust a Groove.
649000	653000	And then Emmy was one of the characters, and I did the DDR fourth mix version.
653000	655000	But no one was my rage.
655000	657000	Sorry to hear it.
657000	658000	I also busted my knee-
658000	659000	You've got all the rage you need.
659000	660000	Oh, thank you.
660000	665000	I also busted my knee open doing a knee drop on a DDR fourth plus.
665000	667000	Fuck, that hurt.
667000	670000	No, I didn't do fourth mix version, I did third mix version.
671000	676000	Did I? I had the hat. I had to go out, I paid more for the hat than I did the rest of the costume.
676000	679000	Alright, anyway, we're sidetracking, we're getting away-
679000	680000	Yes, video games.
680000	684000	We're getting away from your gaming week. Let's go over to Loki. Loki, how was your gaming week?
684000	695000	I didn't play much, because I just don't have a lot of time, so I played a little bit of South Park, and then I played some Call of Duty Modern Warfare last night. Modern Warfare 1.
697000	698000	That's it?
698000	699000	That's it.
699000	706000	Oh, and I got a little sidetracked, and I played 2048 a little bit.
706000	713000	Oh God, that game came up on Hoard House this week, and Grandpa was quite angry that he got addicted. He said he spent like four hours playing that game the other day.
713000	716000	I played 2048 as well this week, a little bit.
716000	722000	You know what's funny? My highest score was just from making myself go in circles with the keyboard.
722000	725000	I was like, okay, screw this, I'm just gonna hit random keys.
725000	728000	And I'm like, oh great, yeah, I get the highest score from that.
728000	735000	Isn't that the same thing as that Threes game that's really big on iPhones? It's pretty much the same game, but just slightly different numbers or something?
735000	736000	Yeah.
736000	743000	Alright. So very similar games. Yeah, 2048. I don't remember the website, but I'm sure you guys can Google it and find it, just like 2048 game.
743000	751000	And yeah, it's this little free, simple little browser-based game where you try to match tiles together, and they create bigger numbers and powers of two.
752000	760000	Yeah, it's like Gabriel... just search for 2048. It's the first one that comes up. It's too hard to spell it.
760000	765000	Okay. Alright, well, that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, and I'll talk about my gaming week a little bit.
765000	775000	I actually, and I don't know if you got around to touching this game, you know on last week's show we had Seg here, and he was pimping Dominique Pamplemousse was the game. I'm totally mispronouncing it.
775000	776000	Dominique Pamplemousse.
776000	780000	Pamplemousse, which is French for cantaloupe or grapefruit or one of those, I guess.
780000	786000	But I did play a little bit of that because he was nice enough to hook me up, so I played a little bit of that on Steam. I didn't get very far.
786000	787000	I installed it.
787000	795000	Yeah, I can't give you like a full review of the game, but I just can say, like remember we played the trailer last week, and I was like, this is kind of like an art film.
795000	805000	It is very, it's very out there. That's not a bad thing. I'm just warning you. It's like black and white, this really weird like choppy stop motion animation thing.
805000	815000	But, and plus the game is created where the character sings everything and all the supporting characters sing all the lines.
815000	821000	And I'm really not sure what to think about that because it's not exactly melodic. It's a little bit out there.
821000	828000	But it kind of, you can tell it really comes from the heart for that reason. It's like I'm really getting inside like somebody's head.
828000	833000	Like I'm really playing somebody's like psycho, well I shouldn't say psycho dream, but playing somebody's...
833000	834000	You're playing their Silent Hill.
834000	839000	No, no, because that implies it's like, it's not even about like scary things at all.
839000	840000	It's neurosis, no.
840000	845000	Yeah, it's more like I'm getting inside, I'm literally feeling like I'm getting inside somebody's head and it's a little bit, it's a little bit strange.
845000	847000	It's, I think it's pretty cool.
847000	854000	Yeah, no, it's cool, but I'm just going to warn you guys, like when you hear point and click adventure game, you think, oh, it's like King's Quest or it's like Walking Dead or something.
854000	863000	No, it's not really like any of that. It's, it's, it's really out there, but it's, it's, it's a trip worth taking if you've got the five bucks to spare.
863000	874000	Um, other games that I've been playing this week besides things that we were pimping on last week's show, uh, more Final Fantasy 14, of course, and more Diablo 3, uh, still playing a bit of Diablo 3.
874000	881000	I also checked out a little bit because I hadn't played this game yet somehow, Bejeweled 3. That's right, I'm going, I'm kicking it casual.
881000	882000	Okay.
882000	889000	Uh, Bejeweled 3 from the PopCap bundle, which is available through the Hubble bundle, which by, by the way, um, I didn't see it in our list of news.
889000	890000	I guess I'll bring up here somewhere.
890000	892000	There's a Sega bundle.
892000	893000	Is there a Sega bundle?
893000	894000	I got an email today about a Sega bundle.
894000	895000	Yeah.
895000	905000	I'll have to look that up. Well, not to distract too much because this is actually pretty serious. PopCap, I guess, had some pretty serious layoffs today, which is a real bummer coming off of the, that bundle.
905000	919000	I mean, all of that was going to charity. It's not like that was to, to, but it's like, uh, it sucks when you've got a company like PopCap that makes these really cool casual games and, you know, at least up until the time they got bought by EA, really felt like they were doing everything right.
919000	930000	And even, even still, like, you know, people are excited about Garden Warfare and Plants vs Zombies 2 and Pagle 2, but it does seem like the PopCap factory isn't churning them out as fast as they used to.
930000	932000	And I'm not sure what's up with that.
932000	936000	Yeah. They're not popping those caps as fast as they used to. And I don't know what's up with that.
936000	943000	And now to hear about these layoffs and I don't, this isn't the first round I feel like that's been reported on for PopCap either.
943000	945000	So it's, it's a real bummer.
945000	960000	And, uh, I, I, I don't know. I don't know if something was mismanaged or what the hell's happened over there at PopCap, but I just, from the outside looking in, it really seems like y'all were better off before you got bought by EA, which is sadly a theme we've heard before.
960000	966000	Well, I've got the list of Sega games, by the way, which I might actually have to do this because there's something in here I want.
966000	968000	Are these classics games or new games?
968000	970000	Uh, some of them are classics.
970000	971000	They're older games.
971000	990000	Um, it's, uh, binary domain, renegade ops, 10 classic Sega Genesis games, medieval two total war, uh, shogun two, if you pay more than 15 bucks, um, hell yeah, wrath of the dead rabbit, Rome, total war.
990000	993000	What the hell kind of games is Sega making? I haven't heard of that one.
993000	997000	Um, company of heroes, alpha protocol and typing of the dead overkill, which is worth it to me.
997000	999000	Oh, that's worth it right there. Yeah.
999000	1004000	Yeah. That's if you pay more than six, but I don't care about getting shogun. So I'll pay six bucks.
1004000	1008000	Hmm. All right. Well, that's cool. I didn't know that that bundle was out. That's pretty cool.
1008000	1010000	It's worth it for typing of the dead.
1010000	1021000	So anyway, yeah, I played bejeweled three tangent, but, uh, which, you know, is not that dissimilar from bejeweled one and two, but there is a, like an interesting quest mode where there's all these different types of puzzles.
1021000	1032000	And like, so it kind of varies the match three format, which to be fair, candy crush saga was kind of trying to do that too with their game, but there, I really feel like there's so much, we weren't talking about them anymore.
1032000	1038000	We're not, but I'm going to say something negative. Okay, good. Okay. It's done a lot better in bejeweled three and it doesn't involve microtransactions.
1038000	1045000	And I donated to charity instead of this website, pop caps, not run by assholes unless you count EA. Yes, exactly.
1045000	1053000	Well now, and now it's kind of like they need the money except the humble bundle. I think a, the humble bundle thing's over and B it was all for charity anyway, but the charities need the money.
1053000	1062000	So yes, there are kids with cancer out there. Keep an eye, keep an eye on, uh, and leukemia and hemophilia, which is awful.
1062000	1073000	Lots of lots of houses. I don't want to talk about it right now. All right. Let's, uh, um, housekeeping real quick, of course, twitter.com slash O L R.
1073000	1084000	And you can also follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio. And, um, we will be back live again next week with our next episode, which would be five 45 if I haven't lost count.
1084000	1095000	So, all right. Uh, you can't count. We're going to get into some gaming news. This thing's cool. What thing? Oh, I'm playing with Rob's light because I'm distracted.
1095000	1102000	It's actually Allen's. It's like a little bookmark. This is awesome. It's like a, it's a reading light. Oh, great radio.
1102000	1110000	All right. Uh, we're going to get into the news a little bit free form tonight. We don't have like a really harsh like list of everything, but, uh, dark soccer, I guess we'll start with you.
1110000	1117000	What do you want to talk about? Sad stuff. All right. Stuff that makes my heart hurt because I love Namco and I love Homestuck.
1117000	1129000	Um, basically, uh, Shifty Look, which is a Namco subsidiary that's basically just out there to promote some sleeping Namco characters, is going out of business.
1129000	1137000	Um, they are completely closing down their game servers, closing down the, uh, the different, uh, comics.
1137000	1151000	Bravo Man, uh, which is the game that they had released, is going to still be out, um, via the App Store and Google Play and the Amazon App Store, uh, until March 30th and it will still support, uh, purchases through March 16th.
1151000	1159000	Namco High is closing down on June 30th, so that means I need to finish the game with everybody and then figure out how to save the Flash file because I'm going to keep playing it.
1159000	1172000	Um, they still are going to play through with, uh, the release of Wonder Momo, uh, for the digital downloads, um, but that's about it. It's going to be going away. I have, I have much cry.
1172000	1177000	And if you haven't played Namco High yet, freakin' play it. It's amazing.
1177000	1181000	And you don't have much time left? Yeah, you only have till June, so play it.
1181000	1185000	Although, you're right, somebody will figure out how to grab that Flash file and put it on their own site or something.
1185000	1186000	Yeah.
1186000	1191000	Uh, was that the only news you had? Yeah, but I have sadness in my heart.
1191000	1193000	Well, that's fine. You take some time to recover.
1193000	1203000	Um, let's see, I'm going to read one story here and then, then we'll let Loki do the rest. We'll give Loki all the hard work, but I was really excited to hear about this.
1203000	1211000	So, Loki, I'm sorry if I'm taking this from your list, but I am so excited to hear that they have started, I don't usually get excited about Kickstarters.
1211000	1218000	In fact, usually I, I kind of make a squinchy face at them, but I am very excited to hear that there is a Kickstarter for Frog Fractions 2.
1218000	1224000	Oh, Lord. No word if the subtitle is Electric Boogaloo, but I don't know if you guys have ever played the Flash game Frog Fractions.
1224000	1226000	It should be Electric Frog. I have not.
1226000	1235000	It's, it's hilarious. All I'm going to say is that stick with Frog Fractions, because a lot of people play it for literally 30 seconds, as sometimes our gamer ADD does.
1235000	1240000	Especially with older looking retro like type games will go like 30 seconds. Oh, remember this game? Haha.
1240000	1251000	But like people are like, I don't get just, I'm telling you, stick with it and watch the banana start to peel because it's a funny game and it's worth sticking with.
1251000	1262000	So yeah, Frog Fractions 2 is being Kickstarted and they're looking for $60,000 and the game is developed by Twinbeard is his name, although his name is actually Jim Crawford.
1262000	1267000	By the way, he totally stocks Twitter for mentions of Frog Fractions because I get my tweets favorited all the time.
1267000	1281000	Anytime I mention Frog Fractions in a positive light. But yeah, Frog Fractions is quote unquote edutainment, but it's so much more and you've got to see the video for the Kickstarter.
1281000	1284000	It is, Loki, did you watch the video for the Kickstarter?
1284000	1285000	I did.
1285000	1299000	Isn't it great? But what's also great about this, I think what's interesting about this, if I was reading it right, is that you don't get the game until the game is found.
1299000	1308000	Like the game has to actually be found, I think that was the impression I was getting, is that the game has to actually be found before everybody will actually get to play it.
1308000	1310000	Yeah, because it's not actually called Frog Fractions.
1310000	1322000	Yeah, it's something else. But yeah, in Kickstarter he talks about if you figure out what it's named before the jig is up, you email him and he'll give you a code immediately for the game.
1322000	1324000	I bet it's getting jiggy with it.
1324000	1327000	I don't know, it could be anything. It could literally be anything with this game.
1327000	1328000	It could be cowboy hat.
1329000	1334000	I'm assuming there's hints in the video, so you're going to have to watch it like 50 times closely.
1334000	1339000	But yeah, Frog Fractions 2 is on Kickstarter and I'm very excited about that.
1339000	1347000	I hope there's another, I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played Frog Fractions 1, but I hope there's certain modes that come back and certain ones that don't.
1347000	1352000	I don't ever want to play another text adventure game. Anyway, that's actually not true.
1352000	1354000	Alright, Loki, what do you have for us?
1354000	1358000	Okay, so let's talk a little bit about Drive Club.
1358000	1363000	Drive Club, unfortunately, was a game that was supposed to be out at the launch of the PlayStation 4.
1363000	1367000	And then it got delayed. And then it got delayed again.
1367000	1372000	And now it's been taken back to the drawing board.
1372000	1379000	It isn't ready to be shipped and they don't have any sort of release date for it.
1379000	1382000	That's too bad. It kind of looked cool.
1382000	1386000	That's really weird and alarming in a way.
1386000	1395000	Like, this game is going to come out! Oh my gosh, we're pushing it so far back we're not giving you a release date anymore.
1395000	1396000	Yeah, pretty much.
1396000	1398000	That almost talks about a full...
1398000	1402000	What studio was working on this game? Was it Santa Monica by chance?
1402000	1408000	No, it was a studio behind the Motorstorm series. I don't remember which one it was.
1409000	1412000	I was wondering if maybe it tied into the unfortunate news we had last week.
1412000	1420000	What's that old saying? You'll forgive a game that's good even if it's late, but a bad game will always be bad?
1420000	1423000	Something like that. I'm totally hacking a Miyamoto quote or something.
1423000	1424000	Good enough.
1424000	1426000	Yeah, good enough though. You get the point.
1426000	1428000	It was Evolution Studios was the one behind it.
1428000	1433000	Thank you. As long as the game is good, then people will forgive the delay, I suppose.
1434000	1436000	But if they release it bad...
1436000	1441000	Although, wasn't this game supposed to be a free thing for PlayStation Plus people?
1441000	1444000	Well, they were going to have a stripped down version that was going to be free.
1444000	1452000	It was almost like a free-to-play model where you could start off with a chunk of it and you can buy the rest if you want.
1452000	1455000	I wonder if that's all out the window this week.
1455000	1459000	It might not be. You never know.
1459000	1460000	Alright.
1462000	1467000	And then, let's see. Google, they just bought Green Throttle Games.
1467000	1474000	Now, if you're not familiar with Green Throttle Games, they put out these game controllers for Android.
1474000	1483000	And it's actually the founder is Charles Huang, who was the co-creator of the Guitar Hero franchise.
1483000	1486000	I want to say we met him. I don't remember though.
1486000	1488000	That name sounds very familiar.
1488000	1491000	Was that one of the people that came to your house, Jamie, that one time?
1491000	1495000	There was some guy. I don't remember if it was. I have to take away this guy.
1495000	1496000	I don't think so.
1496000	1500000	No, I think that was the guy that co-founded Red Octane, though.
1500000	1502000	Oh, Red Octane. Okay.
1502000	1505000	And you might have met him at E3, back when they would be in Kensha Hall and stuff.
1508000	1516000	Anyway, so they bought them up, so everyone's thinking, okay, what exactly do they need a controller company for?
1516000	1524000	Well, the thought is, perhaps, it's going to be going into a Google set-top box or some sort of Android console, if you will.
1524000	1528000	So it's very interesting to see what they're going to do with that.
1528000	1536000	Maybe they're just trying to beat Apple to the embedded console market.
1536000	1541000	Because I have a feeling everyone thinks that Apple's going to try to do something with Apple TV,
1541000	1547000	now that they have standardized controllers and stuff, that they're going to try to almost turn it into a gaming console,
1547000	1550000	that maybe they're going to try to beat them to the punch.
1550000	1552000	I'm getting a little worried there's going to be too many cooks in the kitchen, though,
1552000	1555000	because there's also the rumors that Amazon's cooking something up.
1555000	1563000	And one of the big news stories that came out the day that we're recording the show is that Amazon is bumping up the price of Prime to $99,
1563000	1569000	which, when you consider it, I don't know about you guys, but I use the shit out of that two-day shipping,
1569000	1574000	and that is really special. Again, it has to do with costuming shows and props and things.
1574000	1577000	I think it saved my butt so many times. I really enjoy having that.
1577000	1582000	But you've got to wonder if Amazon's not going to look to sweeten the pot a little bit and nullify that backlash,
1582000	1589000	because it is still, to go from $79 to $99, that's still a good, more than a 20% increase. That's a 25% increase.
1589000	1594000	Yeah, and we use it. We share an account that has it, but we use it.
1594000	1597000	Yeah, well, Alan and I get to share one, too, since we live in the same house.
1597000	1600000	But still, you've got to wonder, they're going to sweeten the pot with some other things.
1600000	1605000	And one of those is rumored to be some type of gaming-type service. Who knows? Who knows?
1605000	1609000	Maybe. I don't know. I could see them doing something like that.
1609000	1617000	But I'm just worried there's too many cooks in the kitchen, because obviously you're going to have your Nintendo, your Sony, your Microsoft.
1617000	1623000	They all make the big box systems. Well, actually, I would say Nintendo to a lesser extent, a little bit.
1623000	1634000	Sony and Microsoft really make those all-in-one hubs, whereas Nintendo's really trying to focus on their out-there hippie gaming system,
1634000	1642000	which some people love, some people hate, whatever. And then you have things like Ouya that are kind of like, I don't know,
1642000	1648000	they're sort of media hubs, but I don't even know what to define Ouya. It's cheap. It's a cheap alternative.
1648000	1658000	Yeah, Ouya is basically just kind of a tablet redesigned. It's almost like a case mod for a tablet with a video out on it.
1658000	1664000	I feel like that's what every other company wants to come after, is that cheap alternative.
1664000	1670000	And we're going to be looking at $99 boxes from Amazon, from Google, from maybe even Apple,
1670000	1674000	although they might kind of be injecting it into their Apple TV thing.
1674000	1681000	Still, it's kind of like, okay, I don't have room on my shelf for all this crap. Somebody's going to lose, ugly.
1681000	1686000	Yeah, I don't know how they're going to end up working that out.
1686000	1688000	We'll see.
1688000	1699000	And then, let's see. This was interesting. I actually saw this. I got a Kickstarter update from Kung Fury.
1700000	1708000	Apparently they are in talks with Tribute Games, the company that they do some really cool retro-style games.
1708000	1717000	They have that Mercenary Kings that's coming out, and they're in talks and maybe doing some sort of game tied in with Kung Fury.
1717000	1723000	Of course, it's still very early on that, but that'd be pretty awesome if that actually happened.
1724000	1738000	Hmm. Let's see. Now this was interesting. I saw that Phil Spencer had been responding to the complaints about Games with Gold.
1738000	1746000	Basically people comparing that service and their selection of games to Playstation Plus.
1746000	1755000	One of our issues with Games with Gold, not issues, but differences between the other system we get compared to,
1755000	1760000	is the fact that Games with Gold, you get to keep the game regardless of whether it continues to subscribe.
1760000	1766000	And the business around Games with Gold for us is just fundamentally different than some of the other programs that are out there,
1766000	1772000	which does put different financial picture on, you're going to go buy a game that's brand new,
1772000	1776000	the cost of putting it in, or just to be kind of blunt about it.
1776000	1787000	Now, here's the thing though. The reason that they're not being generous in the fact that they're giving you the game to purchase,
1787000	1795000	it's because they don't have the infrastructure in place to allow you to limit renting the game, I guess,
1795000	1797000	or being able to download the game only if you have gold.
1797000	1801000	There's nothing in place to do that right now on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1801000	1809000	That's why they give you the game as a purchase. Otherwise they would probably go that route that they have with Playstation Plus.
1809000	1817000	They just don't have that in place and they can't really, they're not going to pay you to add that in.
1817000	1822000	Wait, the structure is there to limit the download to somebody that only has gold,
1822000	1826000	but you're talking about the whole expiring and extending the license every time you sign in,
1826000	1830000	and the things that Playstation does, that you can't do.
1830000	1835000	Yeah, they have something in place where they can make something expire after a certain amount of time,
1835000	1839000	so like for rentals they can do that because they do that with their video service,
1839000	1841000	and I think they've done that with some demos before,
1841000	1846000	and they have the option to limit downloads to only gold subscribers.
1847000	1852000	However, they can't say that, oh, when you become a silver, if you've downloaded it once,
1852000	1855000	they can't say, oh, well, once you're silver you can't download that again.
1855000	1858000	They don't have that in place. That's the problem.
1861000	1866000	So I thought that was interesting that they're spinning it in a different way.
1866000	1871000	Well, we let you keep these games. Well, yeah, because you don't have an option.
1871000	1874000	Because you have to. That's kind of funny.
1875000	1876000	Interesting.
1876000	1884000	Yeah. Let's see. And then this was also kind of funny. I saw this and was like, okay, really?
1884000	1891000	Battlefield 4, you know, they've been having server problems since the game launched,
1891000	1897000	and it hasn't gotten any better, and it's been kind of terrible for the last, I don't know, however long.
1897000	1903000	Well, now, apparently, they're going to start offering dedicated server rentals,
1903000	1905000	like they did with Battlefield 3.
1905000	1906000	What?
1906000	1913000	Yeah, so, sure, our game's netcode's really terrible, but you can fix it if you pay us.
1913000	1919000	So I thought that was just kind of interesting. It's like, fix your game first, and then sell something.
1919000	1926000	Just like they've been working on the expansions, but still haven't finished fixing all their netcode problems.
1926000	1933000	Wow, that's so interesting that, you know, they're willing to just sell you a server when they can't.
1933000	1935000	It's kind of, it's a little shady.
1935000	1936000	Yeah.
1938000	1945000	And then, let's see, this is kind of cool. Smash Brothers, I remember that they were trying to get it into EVO,
1945000	1954000	and finally it's been confirmed that Smash Brothers, or Super Smash Brothers Melee is going to be in the 2014 EVO tournament.
1954000	1959000	And it's now officially in there, because I remember before they were having some issues with Nintendo,
1959000	1967000	that, you know, they wanted in there, and they were delaying stuff, and I think it last year had to be, you know, pulled from it or something.
1967000	1971000	But now I guess it's actually going to be in there, which will be kind of cool.
1971000	1975000	I don't know why they're, like, not supporting more of that type of stuff.
1975000	1979000	You would think it would be good coverage for, I don't know, the new Smash Brothers canvas coming out?
1979000	1984000	Yeah. But it just goes to show that complaining a lot will get you somewhere.
1984000	1987000	Because, you know, everybody complained about the lack of that last year.
1987000	1991000	So, bitching and internet petitions, sometimes they work.
1992000	1997000	Usually only in the world of video games, though.
1999000	2004000	And then there's a chance that Flappy Bird is going to be coming back.
2004000	2008000	Actually, the official Flappy Bird, not all the billions of clones that are taking its place.
2008000	2013000	You mean such as flappy.vognetwork.com? Wink. Sparkle.
2013000	2023000	Apparently, Dong Nian, he had an interview, I guess, and they were saying that he's not only possibly going to bring the game back with a message,
2023000	2028000	or I guess a warning message on it, but he is also working on three other games.
2028000	2034000	One of which, he says, a cowboy-themed shooter with simple controls.
2035000	2042000	There's a vertical flyer named Kitty Jetpack. Techno Kitten Adventure much?
2042000	2044000	Yeah, that was the first place my mind went to.
2045000	2048000	And an accident chess game called Check-A-Not.
2049000	2052000	That sounds at least original, but the other one, whatever.
2052000	2054000	Haven't we had battle chess before?
2056000	2058000	Am I the only person that ever played battle chess?
2058000	2061000	Oh no, I played battle chess, too. Chinese chess.
2061000	2065000	That was crazy, because it's totally a different game.
2065000	2073000	Sort of tangency. I always wished that they had made the 3D battle chess, you know, like the three-layer chess from Star Trek.
2073000	2074000	Oh yeah.
2074000	2078000	And a dental battle chess version of that with Klingons and everything. That would have been awesome.
2078000	2081000	They'd probably have something like it in Star Trek Online or something.
2081000	2085000	But battle chess could also be something like Archon, which I've done as a game of the week before.
2085000	2088000	It could be where the pieces actually battle, who knows.
2089000	2090000	Yeah.
2090000	2096000	That concept seems a little in-depth, though, for the types of games that Dong Luen's kind of been putting out.
2096000	2100000	Like, let's be real. Flappy Bird. Not a complicated concept.
2100000	2105000	A kitten with a jetpack. If it's anything like either Techno Kitten Adventure or Jetpack Joyride or one of those...
2105000	2110000	Not a totally difficult concept to execute, so we'll see.
2111000	2112000	Yeah.
2113000	2120000	Let's see. And then I was going to say, there's this brand new Nintendo console coming out.
2120000	2124000	Except it's not an official Nintendo console. It's actually a...
2124000	2126000	You know how they have all those third-party knockoff consoles?
2126000	2132000	Well, now they have one called Analogue NT that's supposed to be coming out that it doesn't actually emulate the Nintendo.
2132000	2140000	It actually uses real... I don't know if I guess real hardware to play the games.
2140000	2143000	But it also has some different functionality with it.
2143000	2149000	It's going to have an RGB output, so you're going to get improved visuals on everything, especially on newer TVs.
2149000	2159000	Four-player functionality, Hi-Fi audio, and it's going to come in an aircraft aluminum case.
2159000	2162000	So, it's kind of neat.
2162000	2172000	I know that there's ways you can hack RGB into an NES and stuff, but this will actually be something that's built into it as opposed to a hack.
2172000	2174000	So, looks kind of cool.
2174000	2180000	Bummer it can't be HDMI, though, because isn't the Retron 5 supposed to be HDMI whenever that finally comes out?
2180000	2188000	Well, RGB would be... you could do HDMI, because it would be like a VGA type of signal.
2188000	2194000	Oh, I thought RGB... I don't know why. When you say RGB, my mind goes to component, because they are literally red, green, and blue cables.
2194000	2198000	But why? It's an 8-bit system. Why?
2198000	2200000	Because newer TVs...
2200000	2201000	No, why?
2201000	2207000	Because it looks better. Because the colors are better, and it actually looks like it should look like.
2207000	2208000	But it doesn't matter.
2208000	2212000	Because you literally... like taking an Atari 2600, you cannot play on a TV these days.
2212000	2215000	Well, okay, you have to have a million adapters, and then they...
2215000	2216000	One adapter.
2216000	2219000	But it's going to lose quality. It's going to lose quality going through an adapter.
2219000	2229000	We hooked up our Atari 5200s to computer monitors with an S-video adapter that worked.
2229000	2234000	It's interesting, though, because you can talk about... do you really want to enhance the picture of a...
2234000	2241000	I think I kind of see where you're getting, Darsyra, because when you enhance the picture of a classic gaming console, is it really classic gaming?
2242000	2247000	Because some of our memories with the Atari 2600 was like you were plugged into Channel 4.
2247000	2252000	Channel 3 or Channel 4, depending on your neighborhood, and you always had that TV noise that interfered with your game.
2252000	2255000	But that's how it looked, man. That's how you played the game.
2255000	2260000	And on top of that, having a lower quality sort of blurs the lines around the pixels a lot better.
2260000	2265000	That's actually what some of the characters, their shape is programmed around TV blokes.
2265000	2268000	I can actually see that argument, actually.
2268000	2278000	So that's why I have a problem. I mean, we still have a 32-inch CRT, so if we want to, we can play our games on old systems.
2278000	2282000	We saved the TV for that purpose, so we can play it the right way.
2282000	2283000	Until it breaks.
2283000	2284000	Until it breaks.
2284000	2285000	Knock on wood.
2285000	2292000	Well, I was going to say, they actually have a website. The website that's selling has some side-by-side pictures of what it looks like.
2293000	2299000	The RGB output and just the standard NES stuff.
2299000	2307000	I was trying to see if I could find that so I could link it to you guys, because it looks really cool.
2307000	2313000	I just don't know. I don't know. I would have to see how expensive it would be or something, obviously.
2313000	2317000	But, I don't know. It's a neat idea, I guess.
2318000	2324000	It's still a way to get classic gaming back in people's living rooms, so it's cool.
2324000	2328000	I think I'm a little more interested in Retron 5, even if it does involve emulation,
2328000	2333000	but just because of the sheer volume of consoles that it does in one box,
2333000	2338000	and the fact that it's very easy to hook into my current TV is a little bit alluring.
2338000	2340000	Yeah. Okay.
2340000	2349000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, picture.
2349000	2353000	Oh, this is kind of neat. PlayStation Home's finally getting trophies.
2353000	2356000	Trophies for PlayStation Home?
2356000	2359000	Yeah, I guess you have a reason not to play PlayStation Home.
2359000	2365000	Oh, also they brought back that quest thing you can do to unlock those PlayStation 1 games.
2365000	2370000	They had something where you can unlock, what was it, Twisted Metal, Warhawk.
2370000	2372000	Oh, yeah. I remember that.
2372000	2377000	I don't remember what else, but they had done that a while back, but yeah, it's going to have trophies now.
2377000	2381000	Still weird to me that they never tried to do anything with Home on PlayStation 4.
2381000	2385000	Like, they're going to, if they don't announce something with PlayStation 4,
2385000	2390000	then they're clearly going to pull the plug on PlayStation Home in the next couple of years.
2390000	2392000	It's kind of interesting.
2392000	2395000	It would look cool. I mean, it would be pretty sweet if they did something like that.
2395000	2396000	Yeah.
2396000	2399000	Especially now with everybody, like, having cameras and broadcasting and stuff,
2399000	2402000	maybe you could have some sort of Twitch integration.
2402000	2407000	Well, hold on. Jamie's still hovering on the analog thing you were talking about a minute ago.
2407000	2409000	She's doing some research. How much are we talking for this thing?
2409000	2411000	$649.
2411000	2412000	What?
2412000	2413000	I know, right?
2413000	2415000	What's it made out of? Titanium?
2415000	2420000	This is analog CMVS. Oh, never mind. This is the Neo Geo thing. That's all they had at their range.
2420000	2421000	Oh, Christ.
2421000	2429000	They don't have the actual device up there for pre-order yet. It's supposed to be coming later this month.
2429000	2431000	Oh, well, $649 for a Neo Geo.
2431000	2432000	That's not so bad.
2432000	2434000	That's typical.
2434000	2436000	That's not so bad.
2436000	2441000	I'm actually going to email these people and see if they can give me any information.
2441000	2444000	Don't you know who I am? I want a discount.
2446000	2448000	Anything else, Logie?
2448000	2453000	There's one other thing. It's kind of sad.
2453000	2459000	You may remember there was an Ouya game or a game that was debuting on Ouya.
2459000	2466000	It was kind of like an art piece almost. It was called That Dragon Cancer,
2466000	2475000	which was basically this guy, Ryan Green, and kind of his way of coping with the fact that his five-year-old son had terminal cancer.
2475000	2478000	Well, unfortunately, this morning his son died.
2480000	2485000	But, yeah, quite sad. Actually, go check out the trailer and stuff.
2485000	2489000	It is supposed to be debuting on Ouya, but I think it's coming to other platforms at some point.
2489000	2498000	It was kind of they got in with that funding where they would back them double or whatever on Kickstarter.
2498000	2505000	Also, it debuted on Ouya and was exclusive for a while, so that will be coming out.
2505000	2509000	But it's basically, if you watch some of the development stuff about it,
2509000	2515000	it's kind of like the story of their son and all the stuff that he kind of suffered through and everything.
2515000	2519000	So, pretty depressing.
2519000	2524000	Oh my gosh. Go to Costco and get some Kleenex when you're going to play that game.
2524000	2526000	That's going to be a rough one.
2526000	2528000	That will be a rough one, yeah.
2528000	2534000	Well, I feel like I have to kind of try to end things on a little bit more of a lighthearted note,
2534000	2536000	although that was a very important story, Loki.
2536000	2542000	I'm going to try and give you one more thing that at least maybe we can all have a good laugh here with a different story,
2542000	2549000	and that is that the early reviews are in for Need for Speed, the movie, which comes out.
2549000	2552000	By the time you guys already hear this, it will have already been out for the weekend,
2552000	2554000	but for us it's out tomorrow.
2554000	2562000	And early Metacritic score shows a 38 with 3 positive reviews and 11 negative reviews.
2562000	2564000	Let's see. Let's see.
2564000	2566000	From the Austin Chronicles.
2566000	2570000	From the start, Need for Speed smells like a movie in search of a franchise.
2570000	2574000	On that count, it's somewhat fast, but seldom furious.
2574000	2578000	Rolling Stone says there's nothing to distract you from a plot.
2578000	2582000	So tired, there are tire tracks from other racing movies all over it.
2582000	2585000	So in other words, it sounds like this movie is just...
2585000	2590000	And again, for movie critics especially that probably don't give two shits about the game,
2590000	2595000	it just sounds like it's just a ripoff of all the other racing movies, notably Fast and Furious.
2597000	2599000	Which didn't we call that?
2599000	2603000	Well, I think anybody could have called that, Jamie, unfortunately.
2603000	2605000	Video game movies, I know we had a...
2605000	2606000	Who liked it?
2606000	2613000	We had a talk... The Dissolve is the name of the site, who gave it a 70, which is considered positive out of 100.
2613000	2619000	Need for Speed modifies its outlaw anti-hero with all sorts of unnecessary pain and backstory,
2619000	2621000	and the film is slow to leave the starting gate because of it.
2621000	2627000	But once it does, Need for Speed becomes a much fleeter vehicle, powered by impressive practical stunt work,
2627000	2632000	eye-popping cross-country landscapes, and the sparking chemistry between Paul and Poots.
2632000	2634000	Imogen Poots is their name, I guess.
2634000	2638000	It was kind of interesting that all the stunts in the movie are practical.
2638000	2643000	Yeah, and so The Dissolve is basically saying, you know what, the graphics are really good.
2643000	2648000	Let's see how many more racing metaphors we can fit into this review.
2648000	2650000	Lord.
2650000	2652000	Can we get a burnout movie now?
2652000	2657000	That would be... I want a good video game movie, is that too much to ask?
2657000	2660000	I just want a good one, I want one that's gonna get a good...
2660000	2662000	I've seen a good one, but it was animated.
2662000	2666000	The Animal Crossing movie was really good. It was super cute.
2666000	2669000	Silent Hill wasn't bad. I like that.
2669000	2672000	Probably Silent Hill had a pretty bad Metacritic as well.
2672000	2676000	So who knows, again, disclaimer, that's all Metacritic, and these are critics,
2676000	2679000	and popcorn audiences don't always agree with critics.
2679000	2682000	So who knows, maybe Needs for Speed isn't all that terrible.
2686000	2688000	I think what we're gonna get into now, let's do the classic...
2688000	2691000	If that was all the news, that was all the news, right, Logie?
2692000	2698000	Yeah, there's... Seriously, I don't understand what the drama is with resolutions
2698000	2701000	and downgraded graphics and stuff like that.
2701000	2705000	This week, with Watch Dogs, there was people complaining about downgraded graphics,
2705000	2710000	and now Dark Souls 2 saying that they were advertising this brand new lighting engine,
2710000	2718000	and it was in the reveal that they showed in 2013, and also the Tokyo Game Show demo,
2718000	2724000	and even what they were showing, I guess, prior to launch,
2724000	2726000	and then the game comes out and doesn't have it.
2727000	2730000	Well, maybe it was suffering performance.
2730000	2733000	Maybe it was one thing on the dev kits and another when the game played.
2733000	2736000	It's just lighting. Is the game fun, yes or no?
2738000	2739000	I don't know. I haven't played it.
2739000	2740000	I don't know.
2740000	2741000	But, you know, people bitch about it.
2741000	2744000	I installed lighting modes on Mass Effect 3, so...
2744000	2750000	They're even trying to get a Twitter campaign going to make Namco explain why.
2750000	2752000	A change.org petition.
2753000	2757000	Is that the White House one where they have to respond if they get 100,000 signatures?
2757000	2759000	I think that's whitehouse.gov.
2759000	2760000	Whitehouse.gov.
2761000	2762000	I don't know.
2762000	2763000	Just another internet petition.
2763000	2767000	But, as we talked about with Smash Brothers before, it works. Sometimes it works.
2767000	2771000	Hey, those petitions prove that there are people that work for this government that have a sense of humor.
2772000	2777000	Alright, speaking of having a sense of humor, let's go to the classic game of the week.
2778000	2780000	You know, back in the day, if a game sucked...
2782000	2785000	You were a sucker for buying it. There was really nothing you could do about it.
2786000	2789000	But, yeah, we're gonna take a step into the gaming vault.
2789000	2792000	Or maybe, actually, Dark Soccer might just reach into her pocket.
2792000	2794000	I'm gonna pick a game that's as old as me.
2794000	2797000	Alright. Dark Soccer's gonna pull a game out of her pocket.
2797000	2801000	And it's the classic game of the week, which, by the way, we have no video for this this week because...
2801000	2802000	Why?
2802000	2806000	Yeah, it's such an old game. Well, this makes Jason's job doing the YouTube very easy.
2806000	2807000	I don't know. He'll probably find something.
2807000	2808000	He'll find something.
2809000	2812000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
2812000	2815000	Snake. Just Snake.
2816000	2822000	Basically, Snake began with a game called Blockade, which was developed by a company called Gremlin in 1976.
2823000	2826000	And if I have to really fucking explain what Snake... Okay, fine.
2827000	2833000	Snake, you play a dot. And you move around, and you try not to run into your own ass.
2833000	2834000	Basically...
2834000	2839000	You don't want to eat your own ass, basically, is the goal of Snake.
2839000	2841000	Do not eat your own ass.
2842000	2846000	I'm sure somewhere out there, there is a human centipede clone of that game.
2846000	2850000	Hush, hush, hush, hush. No, no, no, no. Trauma. Trauma.
2851000	2859000	So basically, as you keep going through different points, your tail grows longer until you really can run out of places to turn, and then you eat your own ass.
2860000	2864000	And that's for failing the game. You die from ass overload.
2867000	2868000	So anyway...
2868000	2870000	Little bit of ass now and then.
2871000	2873000	Too much!
2875000	2879000	So anyway, as I said, it started with a game called Blockade that came out in 1976.
2880000	2883000	1978. Atari did an unofficial port.
2884000	2889000	And then they did a home console that's called Surround.
2889000	2893000	So it actually was one of the Atari 2600 launch titles.
2893000	2896000	And it was sold by Sears as Chase.
2896000	2899000	And then Bally did a version that's called Checkmate.
2900000	2903000	So the first personal computer version of it was called Worm.
2904000	2909000	And that was done by Peter Trefanis on the TRS-80 computer.
2909000	2914000	And then there were other versions that came out on the Commodore PET, the Apple II.
2914000	2920000	And then there was another version that that same guy did called Hustle.
2920000	2922000	And then Milton Bradley released it later.
2923000	2925000	There were versions on the BBC Micro.
2926000	2928000	There were versions for MS-DOS called Nibbles.
2929000	2931000	Then it was a Cubasic sample program.
2931000	2938000	We had an analog version called Anaconda that was included in Timesplitters 2.
2939000	2943000	And then there's versions in Neopets called Mirka Chase.
2943000	2945000	Rob, did you ever play Mirka Chase?
2945000	2946000	I don't think so, no.
2946000	2947000	I played some of those other games.
2947000	2949000	I mean, Surround on the 2600.
2949000	2953000	I'm dating myself, but I remember playing that as a kid.
2954000	2959000	Well, it also used to have, and this was in Gmail until 2012.
2959000	2961000	There was a version that was called Old Snakey.
2962000	2964000	And then came the Nokia phones.
2964000	2968000	So basically, thanks to Nokia, Snake made a huge resurgence.
2968000	2970000	Hold up, though. Hold up, though. This is very important.
2970000	2973000	Because you missed the most important version of Snake.
2973000	2975000	Shush, shush, shush, shush. No, I know.
2975000	2976000	Okay. All right.
2977000	2979000	I will go back to my text messaging.
2979000	2980000	Girl.
2981000	2984000	Anyways, so on the Nokia phone, there was Snake, which we all remember.
2984000	2985000	We had Snake 2.
2986000	2990000	We had Snake Xenia, or Xenzia, that was it. Snake Xenzia.
2990000	2992000	That was on some of the color ones as well.
2992000	2996000	Snake EX on the color phones that looked kind of like Snake for the SNES.
2996000	2999000	And you could play multiplayer through Bluetooth and infrared.
2999000	3000000	Ooh.
3000000	3002000	There was Snakey X2.
3002000	3005000	Snakes, which is a 3D version for the N-Gage.
3007000	3011000	Snake 3, which was another 3D version, where you played as a living Snake.
3011000	3013000	And then Snakes Subsonic.
3013000	3020000	Also, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City said that the Nokia port of Snake
3020000	3023000	was one of 40 games that they wanted to add to the museum's collection.
3024000	3028000	There are other games that are pretty similar, like the Light Cycles and Tron.
3028000	3031000	Uh, Nibbler Snafu for the Intellivision.
3031000	3033000	Thank you, by the way. That's what I was waiting for.
3033000	3034000	No, no. There's more.
3034000	3036000	You missed the really important one.
3036000	3042000	We also had Pizza Worm, Snake Bite for Apple II, Snake Ball on PS3,
3042000	3046000	and there was Space Ball on LG different phones.
3046000	3051000	We have Snake for iOS 7, Snake Classic for iOS.
3052000	3054000	So there's all these different versions, but now...
3054000	3058000	And the most important one that I can't believe you guys forgot.
3058000	3060000	No, I didn't forget.
3060000	3061000	Let her finish.
3061000	3062000	Good lord.
3062000	3063000	Let her finish.
3064000	3068000	We had Snake 360 and Snake 361 by YYR.
3068000	3069000	There you go.
3069000	3072000	Good lord, can't I sue my segment?
3072000	3073000	No.
3075000	3077000	You're not doing it fast enough, yes.
3077000	3080000	The most important one was next to Tron. Sorry, YYR.
3080000	3084000	You know we love you here at OLR, but I do rank Tron's Light Bikes
3084000	3090000	above Snake 360 and 361, but you get a nice, solid silver medal.
3090000	3091000	Just saying.
3091000	3092000	God.
3094000	3096000	Like I would fucking forget.
3098000	3099000	Oh my god.
3099000	3100000	Is that actually in the...
3100000	3101000	No, it's not.
3101000	3105000	So I had to go find it because stupid article didn't even mention it, bastards.
3105000	3106000	How rude.
3106000	3108000	Someone edit Wikipedia.
3109000	3110000	Alright.
3110000	3114000	By the way, I would also like to add a happy note that has nothing to do with Snake.
3114000	3115000	Okay.
3115000	3118000	Today my husband found out he was hired for a new job, so he...
3118000	3119000	Lord.
3119000	3121000	Did you just level up upon hearing this news?
3121000	3123000	No, that was Dan texting me.
3123000	3127000	Yeah, that's Dan's text message is the one-up sound from Super Mario Brothers.
3127000	3129000	My hubby got hired at a new job.
3129000	3130000	Congrats.
3130000	3133000	And he will be telling Radio Shack to bite his ass.
3133000	3134000	Just like Snake.
3134000	3135000	Like Snake.
3135000	3137000	Bite my snake, man.
3137000	3139000	I got a snake, man.
3139000	3140000	Nah.
3140000	3141000	Alright.
3141000	3143000	I'm not gonna be doing the Adam Sandler thing.
3143000	3144000	Is that it for the classic game?
3144000	3145000	Yeah, it is.
3145000	3146000	Now are you done?
3146000	3147000	Are you sure you're finished?
3147000	3148000	Have you...
3148000	3150000	You might be forgetting something.
3150000	3151000	Are you sure?
3151000	3156000	Do not make me pick up my iPad here.
3156000	3161000	My beautiful iPad of which I am loyal, loyal, loyal to.
3161000	3165000	Loki, are you satisfied with Dark Soccer's coverage of Snake?
3165000	3166000	I think it's fine.
3166000	3167000	Alright, it's...
3167000	3168000	You know what?
3168000	3171000	I'm a strong woman and I don't have to answer to any men.
3171000	3175000	It was like, this is nothing about women versus men, this is me versus you.
3175000	3177000	I know.
3177000	3180000	Hey, I can still pull the feminist thing on it.
3180000	3182000	Well, take your feminism and...
3182000	3183000	You know what?
3183000	3188000	Just for that, you have to buy me food.
3188000	3190000	How the hell does that work out?
3190000	3191000	Tacos, Rob, tacos.
3191000	3192000	I have to buy you food.
3192000	3193000	No, I'll buy...
3193000	3195000	Because you're feeling oppressed, so you want a taco.
3195000	3196000	I'll buy my own food.
3196000	3197000	Thank you.
3197000	3198000	Anyway...
3198000	3199000	I want Mongolian barbecue.
3199000	3202000	I want, I want, gimme, gimme, me, me, I, I.
3202000	3203000	I want the world.
3203000	3204000	I want the whole world.
3204000	3205000	Alright.
3205000	3206000	You know what I want?
3206000	3210000	I want people to send us emails because usually we would do the mailbag segment right here,
3210000	3212000	but our mailbag was dried up.
3212000	3213000	We got fuck all.
3213000	3214000	There was nothing there.
3214000	3218000	Uh, not even spam anymore, thank God, but if you want to send us an email for a future
3218000	3219000	show...
3220000	3222000	Tell us, tell us about your favorite snake memory.
3222000	3224000	I don't want to know about your snake.
3224000	3225000	Participate at Orange...
3225000	3227000	Keep it in your pants.
3227000	3231000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to email us.
3231000	3233000	I don't need snakes.
3233000	3239000	But what we do have this week is that we have somewhat of a Fugal Question of the Week.
3240000	3242000	Inspire your Google.
3247000	3252000	This week on our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and when you take those words
3252000	3255000	and you slam them together, you get Fugal.
3255000	3260000	Instead of doing a little bit of, uh, you know, asking our listeners a question and
3260000	3263000	them giving us their best answers, we figured since this week was a bit of a special show
3263000	3268000	and we had a little more time to do something more freeform, we would do some Ask OrangeLounge.
3269000	3270000	Yay!
3270000	3271000	Yay!
3271000	3274000	So, we allowed the listeners on our Facebook and Google Plus communities to ask us whatever
3274000	3278000	they wanted to, and we're going to read some of these right now and answer them.
3278000	3280000	So let's start with Google Plus.
3280000	3281000	Sure.
3281000	3282000	Alright.
3282000	3283000	Our friend Renee.
3283000	3284000	I love Renee.
3284000	3285000	She used to go by DNL.
3285000	3286000	Remember that?
3286000	3287000	Yes.
3287000	3288000	Love Renee.
3288000	3289000	DNL Dreams, right?
3289000	3290000	Ah, that's right.
3290000	3291000	DNL Dreams.
3291000	3292000	It always makes me think of the soda.
3292000	3296000	Renee wants to know, what are you looking forward to the most at GDC, and do you have
3296000	3298000	any predictions for announcements?
3298000	3301000	What are you looking forward to the most at a Game Developers Conference?
3301000	3306000	You know, I don't usually think of Game Developers Conference as a place for a lot of announcements.
3306000	3310000	I still feel like it's, you know, it's more for the industry to kind of get together and
3310000	3315000	network and, you know, talk about development on that kind of level, not necessarily talk
3315000	3316000	about news.
3316000	3319000	So my expectations are very, very, very low.
3319000	3325000	However, I'm sure we've all heard about that buzz that Sony might unveil their Oculus Rift
3325000	3330000	competitor or, fingers crossed, maybe partnership, probably not.
3330000	3335000	But there's that thought that Sony may announce something VR related, which wouldn't be out
3335000	3340000	of character for Sony to make a big announcement like that at GDC because Sony did announce
3340000	3344000	the move at GDC one year, and I think they've done something else there before.
3344000	3350000	So it would be neat to hear more about maybe how virtual reality will be coming to this
3350000	3355000	current generation of gaming, but I don't have that expectation because I'd be definitely
3355000	3357000	setting myself up for disappointment if I did.
3357000	3362000	So, Loki, anything quickly that you can think of for GDC, what are you looking forward to?
3362000	3365000	Sony VR and more footage of Goat Simulator.
3365000	3367000	More footage of Goat Simulator.
3367000	3369000	Good answer, good answer.
3369000	3372000	You know what, Rene, I have another answer.
3372000	3377000	I'm looking forward to some of my unemployed friends in the industry, especially after
3377000	3379000	all these layoffs we've heard about recently.
3379000	3382000	You know, we just had PopCap today and Sony Santa Monica.
3382000	3385000	I'm looking forward for them to be able to network and find themselves a new home.
3385000	3386000	That's what I'm looking forward to.
3386000	3388000	Getting more talent back in the pool.
3388000	3389000	That's my answer.
3389000	3391000	And Sony VR.
3391000	3392000	All right.
3392000	3393000	May I answer the question too?
3393000	3394000	Of course.
3394000	3397000	Maybe Mass Effect stuff.
3397000	3398000	The end.
3398000	3399000	Never mind.
3399000	3400000	And goats.
3400000	3401000	You can't answer the question anymore.
3401000	3402000	I also second goat.
3402000	3403000	All right.
3403000	3407000	Dark Soccer, you can start with answering this one from Rettertainment.
3407000	3408000	All right.
3408000	3413000	Rettertainment says, there are people who deride the Mario franchise as a series of
3413000	3415000	semi-vague drug references.
3415000	3420000	I am of the opinion that people who think that way are overly cynical and long out of
3420000	3421000	touch with their inner child.
3421000	3422000	Your thoughts?
3422000	3423000	Yeah.
3423000	3428000	They need to lighten up and stop being assholes.
3428000	3430000	Play some Mario and fucking like it.
3430000	3432000	The Mario games are awesome.
3432000	3438000	They are meant to stimulate that inner child in a non-perverted way.
3438000	3440000	Hand-eye coordination, right?
3440000	3441000	Yes.
3441000	3443000	Apparently your dream is to be a prince, by the way.
3443000	3444000	It is.
3444000	3446000	My hand-eye coordination.
3446000	3454000	Well, we don't care about that kind of hand-eye coordination.
3454000	3456000	People need to get off their high horse.
3456000	3463000	Just get off your high fussy flippin' high horse and just fucking let people enjoy a
3463000	3464000	damn game.
3464000	3467000	If you don't like it, don't be a bitch about it.
3467000	3470000	Stop fussing.
3470000	3473000	You can find drug references in anything if you want to look.
3473000	3474000	I wasn't talking about drug references.
3474000	3476000	Let's talk about being perverted.
3476000	3477000	But that's what he says.
3477000	3480000	He says that Mario is a semi-vague drug references.
3480000	3482000	I guess because, you know, mushrooms make you a bit...
3482000	3483000	Come on.
3483000	3484000	No.
3484000	3485000	You can find drug references in anything.
3485000	3487000	That has fucking nothing to do with drugs.
3487000	3488000	Mushrooms are good for you.
3488000	3491000	You know, the name Orange Lawns Radio, totally a drug reference.
3491000	3492000	Mushrooms...
3492000	3494000	Because, you know, we just lounge around and get high.
3494000	3496000	Mushrooms are high in protein.
3496000	3498000	They make you grow stronger.
3498000	3500000	Mushrooms are good for you.
3500000	3502000	Not to mention medicinal.
3502000	3504000	But that doesn't mean you pick them out of the backyard and eat them.
3504000	3505000	No.
3505000	3506000	That's gross.
3506000	3508000	I mean, you can if you want to die or something or hallucinate.
3508000	3510000	I don't fucking care.
3510000	3512000	This is what you get for getting me after work, Rob.
3512000	3513000	All right.
3513000	3514000	All right.
3514000	3517000	Loki, is Mario a bunch of drug references?
3517000	3520000	No, they're not that clever.
3520000	3524000	See, I was just focusing on the child thing.
3524000	3527000	By the way, Crazy Taxi is free right now on iOS.
3527000	3529000	Nice.
3529000	3531000	Let's make some crazy money.
3531000	3534000	Because that game wasn't drug influenced whatsoever.
3534000	3535000	All right.
3535000	3537000	We're gonna make some crazy money.
3537000	3538000	Take me to Kentucky.
3538000	3539000	Was it drug influenced?
3539000	3541000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was.
3541000	3545000	And look, all the passengers want to go to, like, KFC and Pizza Hut.
3545000	3546000	You know why?
3546000	3548000	Because they're high and they're hungry.
3548000	3551000	Because Pepsi paid for that.
3551000	3552000	All right.
3552000	3555000	New question from Flaco Jones.
3555000	3561000	What would be on your wish list of improvements for a sequel to one of your favorite games?
3561000	3568000	For example, I would like Ni No Kuni 2 to contain even more Ghibli animated cut scenes.
3568000	3572000	And it would be awesome if they added couch co-op, similar to the way it works in Tales of Celia,
3572000	3576000	where your friends can control the other party members during battle.
3576000	3578000	Isn't that kind of like Secret of Mana too?
3578000	3584000	But anyway, what is on your wish list of improvements to a sequel to one of your favorite games?
3584000	3587000	Better Riding for the Next Mass Effect.
3587000	3589000	And Bring Back Jennifer Hale.
3589000	3590000	Better Riding and Bring Back Jennifer Hale.
3590000	3591000	And Garrus.
3591000	3592000	All right.
3592000	3593000	Loki?
3594000	3598000	Saints Row. Saints Row 3 and Saints Row 4 were all a dream.
3598000	3600000	Go back to Saints Row 2.
3600000	3604000	Write Saints Row 3 and 4 out of the canon, all right?
3604000	3606000	How are they going to make a new game?
3606000	3609000	It's just so beyond ridiculous.
3609000	3613000	It's the classic Matrix problem.
3613000	3617000	You gave Neo two main powers too early, and now where do you go from there?
3617000	3619000	You don't. You end the series.
3619000	3624000	I would say Saints Row 5, Saints in Space, but I guess they really already did that in Saints Row 4.
3624000	3626000	They did that already. That was Saints Row 4.
3626000	3628000	I don't know then. I don't know then.
3628000	3631000	Let's see. My wish for improvements to a sequel for one of my favorite games,
3631000	3635000	I would like for The Guardian Legend 2 to exist.
3635000	3636000	That would be the list.
3636000	3637000	That would be fantastic.
3637000	3639000	That would be my improvement I would like to make, because I would like that game to exist.
3639000	3641000	It would still be fucking hard as fuck.
3641000	3646000	I would also like for maybe there to be like a Blaster Master sequel, like a proper one.
3646000	3651000	You go back and give me a real Blaster Master sequel, not like the Genesis thing or even that thing on the Wii,
3651000	3655000	which wasn't horrible, but it just wasn't as good as it should have been.
3655000	3662000	Oh, I know. How about for the next Castlevania sequel, you go back to your roots.
3662000	3668000	That would be a good thing too, because it doesn't sound like this new one is selling well at all,
3668000	3670000	and I think there's a reason for that.
3670000	3671000	Or how about a crossover game?
3671000	3674000	You steal men's souls and make them your slave.
3674000	3676000	Yes, I want bad voice acting in the next Castlevania game.
3676000	3683000	Why can't they have a crossover game with Samus and Simon Belmont, and then they can have Metroidvania?
3683000	3687000	It'd have to be Alucard, or Richter.
3687000	3688000	Why not?
3688000	3689000	All right, let's go to Facebook.
3689000	3692000	We have some of the questions on Facebook.
3692000	3698000	AZHP, you know him as our double gold star emailer, says,
3698000	3703000	DarkSakura may be able to spot spelling and grammatical errors in our emails,
3703000	3708000	but can she see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
3708000	3710000	No, because that shit's nasty.
3710000	3715000	DarkSakura is yet again wrong. That is my favorite breakfast cereal, Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
3715000	3719000	It's fake cinnamon. It doesn't have, it has some real cinnamon in it, but like,
3719000	3722000	okay, you know the problem I have with fake cinnamon, right?
3722000	3723000	What?
3723000	3726000	I can't deal with the smell, I can't deal with the taste,
3726000	3731000	and I actually think that I react, like, that's why I can't have that Fireball stuff,
3731000	3736000	because it's fake cinnamon, or those little red hots, I can't have them either.
3736000	3741000	I can't have fake cinnamon, and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch just was, it smelled wrong to me,
3741000	3744000	and it just didn't taste anything like Cinnamon Toast.
3744000	3746000	But it's like eating sugar cubes for breakfast.
3746000	3748000	I know, keep in mind when I was a kid-
3748000	3751000	The problem with Cinnamon Toast Crunch is it loses all the cinnamon in the milk.
3751000	3753000	It's just not good after, it turns into mush.
3753000	3754000	Dry though, fantastic.
3754000	3755000	When I was a kid-
3755000	3756000	I don't eat cereal with milk.
3756000	3758000	I ate Grape Nuts, in total.
3758000	3759000	Oh, you're weird.
3759000	3761000	And Cracklin' Oat Bran.
3761000	3764000	Those were my three favorite, I kid you not, those were my three favorite cereals as a kid.
3764000	3766000	Although, I do love me some Frosted Mini Wheats.
3766000	3770000	Now, I, okay, Frosted Mini Wheats to this day is my favorite cereal ever,
3770000	3776000	but when I was a kid, as much as I loved those, I loved eating fucking Total and Grape Nuts and Cracklin' Oat Bran.
3776000	3777000	Grape Nuts aren't bad, actually.
3777000	3779000	Grape Nuts is awesome. Have you had it hot?
3779000	3780000	No.
3780000	3782000	I finally got around to having it hot, and it was good.
3782000	3785000	Going back to what Loki was saying, remember, I don't eat cereal with milk.
3785000	3787000	Like, I don't do that. Like, I'm weird like that.
3787000	3790000	I'm not the only person I've ever met that does it that way, though.
3790000	3793000	You know what I do with the Grape Nuts? There's more tangent about Grape Nuts.
3793000	3797000	I actually mix a little heavy whipping cream in it just enough to moisten it up,
3797000	3803000	and then I actually do add legit cinnamon and sugar to the top of it, and then I nuke it.
3803000	3804000	Cinnamon Toast Grape Nuts.
3804000	3807000	But it's actually cinnamon in it, real legit cinnamon.
3807000	3810000	Alright, Loki, anything else on breakfast cereal, or can I go to the next question?
3810000	3817000	I was gonna say that Honey Grahams are pretty awesome. Or Golden Grahams, I'm sorry.
3817000	3819000	Oh, Golden Grahams are pretty good.
3819000	3820000	No, I also hate Cheerios.
3820000	3821000	Really?
3821000	3823000	The only ones I like are the Honey Nut Cheerios.
3823000	3824000	Yeah, the Honey Nut ones are really good.
3824000	3825000	But I, like, hate regular Cheerios.
3825000	3826000	Frosted ones are good, too.
3826000	3827000	I know, yuck.
3827000	3830000	You ever had Crispix? That's my other favorite cereal.
3830000	3831000	I like Crispix.
3831000	3832000	Anyway.
3832000	3833000	And Chex.
3833000	3834000	Now I'm getting hungry from some cereal.
3834000	3836000	You know what? I'm low-carbing, so no.
3836000	3837000	Alright.
3837000	3842000	We have a series of questions from Ospher, who tailor-made a question for each of us.
3842000	3843000	You ready for this?
3843000	3844000	Ooh.
3844000	3845000	Starts with Dark Sakura.
3845000	3846000	Of course.
3848000	3850000	Dark Sakura from Ospher.
3850000	3855000	Have you ever watched the anime Higurashi no Naku Koro ni?
3855000	3858000	It's pretty fantastic, and absolutely terrifying.
3858000	3861000	To be honest, I actually have it downloaded. It's on my list.
3861000	3868000	But right now, I am finishing up Gatchaman Crowds, and I have Kill La Kill on my list next.
3868000	3876000	I have just finished the first run of Shingeki no Kyojin and Claymore, so I'm sort of progressing.
3876000	3878000	But right now, Gatchaman Crowds is what I'm finishing.
3878000	3883000	Which, by the way, is fucking weird, and has really nothing to do with Gatchaman other than, like, odd references.
3883000	3885000	So the answer to your question is no.
3885000	3888000	No. But I have it. But I have it, and I will watch it.
3888000	3889000	It's on the to-do list.
3889000	3890000	It's on the list.
3890000	3893000	All right. You guys should have a Skype party. You can watch it together.
3893000	3894000	No.
3894000	3895000	That'd be fun. All right.
3895000	3898000	A question for me. Oh, boy.
3898000	3901000	Has your fear of dogs grown less over the years?
3901000	3904000	Also, do your hips not lie?
3904000	3907000	Do my hips not lie about what?
3907000	3909000	It's bigness?
3909000	3910000	It's bigness?
3910000	3913000	Dear Rob's Hips, tell me a story.
3913000	3916000	Hi, I'm Rob's Hips, and I only tell the truth.
3916000	3918000	Feed me a donut.
3920000	3922000	That's the truth.
3922000	3926000	Did you hear Dunkin' Donuts is coming to Sacramento? I'm so fucking excited.
3926000	3928000	I really like Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
3928000	3932000	Cinnamon Toast Crunch is my favorite.
3932000	3936000	I don't know why my hips sound like that, but...
3936000	3943000	And I'm... Thank God it's a radio show, because I'm actually shaking in my chair when my hips talk.
3943000	3945000	That's why I love you.
3945000	3947000	You okay?
3947000	3948000	Shut up.
3948000	3949000	Let me get to the other question.
3949000	3951000	I blame Oscar for all this.
3951000	3954000	My hips don't like to get bit by dogs either.
3954000	3959000	So, on a serious note, if you didn't know, I know I've talked about this on the show at some point before,
3959000	3964000	but I have struggled since a very young age. I have had a fear of dogs.
3964000	3969000	And it goes back to when I was five years old, I was actually bit by a dog.
3969000	3972000	I was doing the thing a five-year-old kid would do, and I was riding my bike around the neighborhood,
3972000	3976000	and I tried to pet the dog, and the dog took a chunk out of my leg.
3976000	3980000	I make it sound more dramatic than it was, but when you're a five-year-old kid, that's sure what it felt like.
3980000	3982000	Everything is dramatic. Everything is terrible.
3982000	3986000	My mom threw a fit, and I remember the whole, like, oh my God, you have rabies,
3986000	3989000	and just the whole fallout from that whole thing.
3989000	3993000	And granted, my mom's overreaction to the situation didn't help.
3993000	3996000	However, the dog...
3996000	4003000	Well, I mean, but at the same time, some neighbors' carelessness in letting their dog loose around the neighborhood biting a kid
4003000	4007000	probably drove her fucking nuts, so I do give her credit for that.
4007000	4013000	But anyway, so yes, I've had a fear of dogs. It's mostly big dogs.
4013000	4016000	I'm getting better with small dogs.
4016000	4018000	Little yapper types?
4018000	4020000	Little yappers actually annoy the shit out of me still.
4020000	4022000	So that's different than fear, isn't it?
4022000	4028000	No. If the dog shows their teeth, that's kind of the big fear for me.
4028000	4030000	So maybe your fear is dog dentistry.
4030000	4035000	Perhaps. I don't know. But, like, my grandma used to own poodles, and I didn't want to be near those things,
4035000	4038000	because they always kind of, like, growl, and they show their teeth a lot.
4038000	4044000	But then, like, my other grandma on my dad's side had a little dachshund, and that thing was sweet, and never, you know, it was very quiet.
4044000	4046000	Which is weird, because they're kind of yapper, too.
4046000	4051000	Yeah, no, not this one. And for real, I love corgis.
4051000	4053000	Corgis are the best.
4053000	4056000	So I'm getting better, especially with the smaller dogs.
4056000	4063000	I still, the big ones, like, for instance, you know, and I think she'd be okay if I talked about this on the air.
4063000	4068000	Jessica from Understation Live talks openly about her dog Chewbacca, which is a big, big doggy.
4068000	4069000	Big drooly dog.
4069000	4074000	Yeah. And I'm getting better with Chewbacca.
4074000	4079000	Like, she still has the courtesy to put Chewbacca away if she knows I'm coming over, which is very nice.
4079000	4085000	But, you know, and I always feel bad, because I'm like, oh, God, she shouldn't have to do that, just because I've got issues, you know, or whatever.
4085000	4091000	I'm getting better with that. And it's just, I think it's just about, you really just kind of have to...
4091000	4097000	I'm sure there's so many of you out there going, like, what, really? Rob's got, like, but I can't explain it to you guys.
4097000	4100000	Did you ever see One-Two, Will's dog?
4100000	4101000	Mm-mm.
4101000	4106000	Yeah, I usually make sure that if he's over, and I know you're coming over, that I warn you about One-Two.
4106000	4107000	Right.
4107000	4109000	But she's a half-pit.
4109000	4113000	But she doesn't bark. She doesn't...
4113000	4119000	She tried to bite Midna once, but actually it was more that she was trying to play with Midna's tail while I was carrying her.
4119000	4121000	Other than that, she's like a sap.
4121000	4129000	The thing that really set me back was about six months ago, when I was going out to my car in the morning, and there was a giant dog in the parking lot,
4129000	4135000	running around, not with a leash on, and of course, when a dog sees me, it runs up to me, and I literally flash back to being five years old.
4135000	4139000	And I thought the dog was going to attack me, and I, like, froze. I got, like, I freaked out.
4139000	4145000	I ran back to my apartment and slammed the door, and the dog was waiting outside for me, and it was like a scene out of a scary movie.
4145000	4152000	And I'm sure there's a lot of people sitting there going, this is ridiculous, but I can't tell you how much terror I felt that day.
4152000	4156000	And Tumblr listeners, I'm going to tell you right now, that's called a trigger.
4156000	4157000	Those things are legit.
4157000	4158000	Yeah.
4158000	4161000	Being mildly uncomfortable by something is not a fucking trigger.
4161000	4163000	Having a full-on anxiety attack.
4163000	4164000	Yeah.
4164000	4165000	Or a meltdown is a fucking trigger.
4165000	4167000	I had a panic attack that morning.
4167000	4171000	So, stop using being mildly uncomfortable to describe a trigger.
4171000	4174000	You perfectly described an actual legit trigger.
4174000	4186000	So, and for the record, if I may, parents, if you have children, teach them to extend a hand to be smelled before touching an animal.
4186000	4191000	All right. I got to move through this fast here, because we're running kind of late here, so I'm going to burn through the rest of these questions.
4191000	4193000	But Osford did have one more for Loki.
4193000	4196000	Loki, what would you say is your favorite alcoholic beverage?
4196000	4200000	Uh, probably a screwdriver. That's all I really drink.
4200000	4203000	All right. We're going to go lightning round with the rest of these questions. You ready?
4203000	4209000	KJ, dear OLR crew, I have a question for you. Worst game ever. Go.
4209000	4214000	Uh, I blocked it from my memory.
4214000	4215000	Loki?
4215000	4216000	Oh, I do-
4216000	4219000	Um, I'd probably say Yaris.
4219000	4223000	Um, I'm actually going to say WCW Thunder. That was really awful.
4223000	4225000	Candy Crush Saga.
4225000	4229000	Uh, Delvin, I would like to know the OLR's crew's thoughts on DLC.
4229000	4234000	Titanfall season passes $25. Ghost is getting a map pack for $15.
4234000	4237000	Is DLC becoming, starting to become a money grab?
4237000	4243000	A way for developers to make a $60 game and then charge you for more content that they could have included or given you for free anyways.
4243000	4245000	What are your thoughts?
4245000	4255000	Delvin, in all honesty, this debate done already finished because we're still buying the DLC and this is kind of not a new thing anymore.
4255000	4258000	I bought all the ones for Mass Effect because it actually added something to the game.
4258000	4266000	Yeah, that's the thing. What is the $60 really buying you? I think that's the question you really have to ask in evaluating a game.
4266000	4269000	All right, two more. Gaming Nerd says,
4269000	4276000	How long before we get a Rob and Jamie podcast all about your favorite places to dine and foods you love to prepare and diet choices?
4276000	4278000	Next week.
4278000	4280000	I've got three podcasts. Isn't that enough?
4280000	4282000	I might do one just called The Tangent.
4282000	4287000	All right, and lastly, and I'll throw this one to Loki because he hasn't got an answer on here.
4287000	4293000	Degenerate Johnny says, I would like to know if you have a preference towards red or white wine. If so, what is your favorite?
4293000	4295000	I hate wine.
4295000	4297000	White wine for me.
4297000	4302000	You know what? I would have said red until Frivolo. And now it just is Frivolo.
4302000	4306000	All right. All right. Well, we have to wrap up because it's getting late and it is a school night.
4306000	4309000	But we do want to thank you guys for tuning into the show tonight.
4309000	4313000	And even though it was kind of a shorter show, a little bit of an abbreviated show.
4313000	4316000	Thank you very much for your continued support of the show.
4316000	4321000	You know, we ask, guys, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrie, please tell a friend or two about the show.
4321000	4323000	Help spread the word about independent podcasting.
4323000	4331000	And even if, for whatever reason, you didn't like the show here or you need something else to listen to for the other hour and a half you're not getting tonight, go listen to other independent podcasts.
4331000	4333000	Support independent podcasting.
4333000	4335000	And if you really like us, buy us dinner.
4335000	4337000	We might go home with you.
4337000	4341000	All right. We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
4341000	4343000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
4343000	4345000	Potato bar tomorrow.
4345000	4347000	Potato bar.
4347000	4353000	My final thought is moving in two days. Oh, boy.
4353000	4355000	Darsaka, your final thought?
4355000	4358000	Question everything and Mongolian barbecue.
4358000	4360000	All right. That's going to do it for another week here of Orange Lounge Radio.
4360000	4364000	We'll be back live in just seven days to do it all over again.
4364000	4366000	Have a great week, everybody. Good night.
