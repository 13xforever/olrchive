0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, May 11th, 2014, we're joined by the Grammy Award winning Christopher Tin, composer of Baba Yetu on Civilization IV.
20000	27000	As if that wasn't enough, it's been a very busy week in gaming. From Tomodachi to Amplitude, we've got everyone's opinions on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live for this episode number 552 on May the 11th of 2014.
44000	50000	Happy Mother's Day to all you moms out there or motherly figures. Pets need moms too and so forth.
50000	55000	Step moms and god moms and all those moms. Happy Mother's Day to all you guys.
55000	68000	We are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys live as we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
68000	74000	My name is Rob Roberts here in studio with our co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
74000	75000	Hi.
75000	76000	Hi, how are you?
76000	77000	I'm alright.
77000	78000	You're alright?
78000	82000	We've been having some tech problems here in studio tonight. We're on take two of the show but these things happen.
82000	83000	Yeah.
83000	87000	Hopefully your tablet will stay connected throughout the show this time.
87000	91000	I'm considering taking a narcotic.
91000	95000	A narcotic? Is that how you cope with the program?
95000	96000	Cause my hip still hurts.
96000	98000	How'd you hurt your hip if you don't mind me asking?
98000	107000	It was already sore and a little bit out of alignment and then I reached over to pick up something and ended up pulling, it's called iliotibial syndrome.
107000	112000	Meaning that it's the muscle band going from the very top of the hip down to the knee.
112000	116000	Mine's on my right leg. It's not sciatica. Completely different thing.
116000	117000	Getting old sucks.
117000	122000	No, it has nothing to do with getting old. It has something to do with having, no.
122000	131000	It had to do with my old car accident and since my hip already goes out of alignment, bending over with my hip out of alignment.
131000	134000	Just sorta, and so I was told not to drive for the three days.
134000	137000	Are you able to sit for long periods and play video games at least?
137000	138000	No.
138000	139000	Uh oh.
139000	141000	I still have to get up and move it around or else it's a little good stuff.
141000	143000	Are you able to play some DDR once in a while?
143000	144000	No.
144000	147000	But today is the first time in two weeks I've done squats.
147000	148000	Oh, there you go.
148000	151000	And so that's fine. I'm back to doing yoga and squats. It just still hurts.
151000	155000	Alright. Well, hopefully you got to play some games. We'll check in with you on that a little bit later.
155000	156000	I'll play something.
156000	159000	But we also have, say hello in studio to Tech Master, Loki.
159000	160000	Hi.
160000	161000	Hi, Loki. How are you doing?
161000	162000	Doing alright.
162000	163000	Yeah? What's new with you?
163000	167000	Um, not too much.
167000	171000	So how goes the coding of Project Loki or whatever you're calling your game that you're making?
171000	176000	Um, okay. I kinda took a break from what I was doing because I have to make assets for things.
176000	178000	But, you know, I'll get into that later on.
178000	185000	But so I've been working on a, I don't know, editor if you will, I guess, to make my own 3D models.
185000	186000	Wow.
186000	187000	And it's coming along good.
187000	189000	Yeah? And that's like all you do now, right?
189000	191000	That's all I do in my free time, yeah.
191000	192000	Awesome, awesome.
192000	198000	You know, I tried to play Call of Duty, but people don't seem to line up as far as, you know, when they're online.
198000	201000	We have a scheduled time each week that we play and no one was there.
201000	205000	And they're like, well, I can't play until like 10. I'm like, well, I'm not waiting.
205000	210000	That's my problem too is one of the games, and I'll get into this a little more when we get into our gaming weeks later.
210000	214000	But one game I've been playing is the Heroes of the Storm Technical Alpha that Blizzard has out there.
214000	219000	And I have some friends that play it, but we can never seem to line up at the same time.
219000	224000	And a lot of that has to do with the fact that, you know, I have a lot of friends on the East Coast and I'm here on the West Coast.
224000	226000	And that screws things up more than you'd think.
226000	230000	So it can be tricky trying to schedule up that time to do things with friends.
230000	231000	Yeah.
231000	233000	So, all right.
233000	238000	We also have here in studio joining us, he's back, guys, after a few months break.
238000	240000	Say hello, everybody, to Jason.
240000	242000	I'm back.
242000	244000	Welcome back.
244000	246000	Well, then where is your voice at the top of the show?
246000	248000	I'm just kidding. I'm giving you a hard time.
248000	252000	One of those things where you pack everything except for one thing.
252000	260000	Because my mic is XLR, I have a converter to actually plug into my computer via USB.
260000	269000	And I'm pretty sure I put it in its case and then decided not to bring it with me because I didn't think I would need it for another audio obligation that I had as a part of this trip.
269000	272000	And I completely forgot about passphrase show roll.
272000	273000	It's fine.
273000	274000	Well...
274000	275000	It's fine.
275000	278000	Which is I had to dispel the rumors last week when he didn't do the intro.
278000	280000	It was like, was Jason sacked?
280000	282000	It's like, no, no, no.
282000	284000	Sometimes the kid needs a break.
284000	286000	So he's been working hard on the YouTubes and all that other stuff.
286000	292000	Last week I was driving and I didn't wake up early enough to take care of it before I had to check out of the hotel.
292000	295000	And I wasn't going to pull over on the side of the road.
295000	296000	And...
296000	298000	The signal on the radio...
298000	300000	Yeah, it wasn't going to happen.
300000	302000	Plus, I didn't have my converter.
302000	303000	Oh, geez.
303000	306000	Sorry, guys, and all of your speakers and possibly eardrums.
306000	310000	Yeah, last week I was driving out to Portland initially.
310000	315000	Today, like I said, I went to do it and realized I didn't have a required piece of audio gear.
315000	316000	So...
316000	318000	Well, that settles that one pretty quick.
318000	320000	Hopefully I'll have a solution for weekends going forward, though.
320000	325000	Well, going to our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
325000	326000	The now deaf chat room.
326000	329000	You can join us at live.vognetwork.com.
329000	331000	Oh, please, they're used to it by now.
331000	333000	Yeah, I know, they've heard Loki rant before, come on.
333000	336000	And we've got lots of Nintendo news tonight, so just you wait, y'all.
336000	337000	Just you wait.
337000	343000	In all seriousness, going to our chat room, we do have people welcoming Jason to the show.
343000	347000	Bobby Black Wolf, our buddy, saying Jason destroyed the internet.
347000	350000	Which could be the possibility for some of the internet...
350000	352000	I bring additional devices into the house.
352000	354000	For some of the internet issues we've been having in the studio tonight.
354000	355000	Can you believe that?
355000	356000	The destroyer of tech.
356000	359000	25 devices on our router, but it makes sense.
359000	365000	I mean, we have three nerds that live here now, and then you bring three more nerds in here on Sunday night.
365000	368000	I'm not surprised at all when you consider laptops and some phones and all that.
368000	373000	3DSs, and phones, and iPads, and multiple computers to a single person.
373000	374000	Exactly.
374000	375000	And gaming consoles.
375000	377000	We are a connected world, my friend.
377000	378000	Ain't we ever.
378000	379000	Oh my gosh.
379000	385000	Alright, let's get into, before we get into our gaming weeks, and our interview with Christopher Tin, as you heard in the intro.
385000	387000	We do have Christopher Tin on the show tonight.
387000	393000	He'll be joining us live in about 15 minutes to talk about his new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea.
393000	401000	As well as classic songs of his, including the one I think y'all know as Gamers Baba Yetu, which he won the Grammy for, from Civilization IV.
401000	405000	Our chatroom also asking, how many Final Fantasy XIV clients were online?
405000	409000	Just two. So I had to ask them both to take a little break.
409000	410000	Only two.
410000	411000	I feel bad.
411000	415000	Christopher Tin has one night off of work this week in celebration of Mother's Day.
415000	420000	And he can't play the game he wants to play because of his boyfriend's show, but it is what it is.
420000	427000	Anyway, before we get to our interview with Christopher Tin, before we get to our gaming weeks, I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic.
427000	431000	I'm actually kind of glad the time we get to spend on this topic is limited.
431000	434000	So I think this is a good reason that we bring this up first.
434000	439000	Jamie, if you wouldn't mind, let us know one of the big controversial things going on in the news this week.
439000	444000	Oh, yeah, it's a pretty big one. And it involves Pok√©mon. No, it doesn't.
444000	446000	But it does involve the...
446000	450000	That news was controversial too, actually. We'll get into that later.
450000	452000	But it does involve Nintendo.
452000	466000	Nintendo basically says that when Tomodachi Life comes out in the US, it is going to still not have same-sex relationships in them.
466000	476000	Because, as they say, and they are recognizing that it's not the best step, but they're saying that because of the programming of the game,
476000	483000	that it's not something they can patch out before it ships, that they're going to leave it intact.
483000	495000	But for future versions of it that come out, that they're going to, as they say, strive to design gameplay experience from the ground up.
495000	497000	That is more inclusive.
497000	501000	So basically they know, we done fucked up, but we're going to fix it.
501000	505000	Which, good on them for making the statement they needed to make.
505000	511000	And again, I don't want to dwell too much on this, so thank you to Christopher Tin for limiting our time tonight on this topic.
511000	517000	But I do want to make clear that there was two distinct statements that came out.
517000	523000	And, you know, what you're talking about here is kind of where we're at now, where all is kind of calmed down a little bit because Nintendo has acknowledged,
523000	528000	you know what, maybe this was not the best course of action for us and in the future we should consider this.
528000	534000	But what's going on is that the first time they put something out, it was really just tacky, like what they said.
534000	542000	And to back up even further, I think many of you that listen to this show are probably astute on what's going on because this has been everywhere.
542000	548000	This was one of those stories that had wheels that made it onto the local news in various places.
548000	555000	Like, does Nintendo hate gay people? That's like, you know, that's what the media does when it blows these things, you know, sky high and so forth.
555000	563000	And what happened is that in Japan, Tomodachi Life is out and it's kind of like, it's like a life simulator type game.
563000	567000	Like, think The Sims meets Animal Crossing meets Mii Plaza.
567000	571000	There's kind of all those things kind of thrown in a blender, a very Japanese twist.
571000	581000	Well, in the game, you can, you know, have a baby and all this, but you will have to enter in a relationship with somebody of the opposite gender, you know, in order to start that family.
581000	589000	Which, you know, as far as Japan goes and Japanese culture and so forth, and again, a big key word here is perception.
589000	591000	Remember that word, folks, perception.
591000	599000	The perception in Japan and everything, it's, you know, it's just accepted as this is the way the game is and it doesn't cause a lot of social ruffling
599000	613000	until a bug is found in the game allowing folks to get into same-sex relationships by basically registering the same-sex partner as somebody of the opposite sex the game thinks they are or whatever.
613000	617000	And so you get into a relationship and actually there was kind of a subculture in Japan.
617000	628000	Think like Japan's Tumblr blew up with these pictures and fans everywhere of like, look, I've got this same-sex couple in Tomodachi Life, isn't that rad and so forth, you know.
628000	634000	But then, because this bug also broke the game, Nintendo said, we gotta patch it out.
634000	639000	And I truly don't think Nintendo was trying to make a, oh, we gotta patch out the gay.
639000	643000	No, they had to patch out a mistake for something that truly wasn't intended.
643000	647000	You say that like it's also, you say the patch out the gay like the pray away the gay.
647000	648000	Kind of.
648000	655000	But I think, I think what really happened is that, you know, it was just ignorance, people.
655000	656000	That's what it was.
656000	661000	When the game was created, it was kind of ignorant in a way to a lot of the people that wanted to play it.
661000	668000	Now, I made the mistake when this, when this story went big, I made the mistake of logging onto websites and reading the comments.
668000	671000	Will people please remind me not to do that?
671000	673000	Hey, Rob, don't do that.
673000	675000	I can't fucking help myself.
675000	679000	I always want to go on and see, gosh, I wonder what the commenters on Joystiq have to say about this.
679000	682000	Gosh, I wonder what the YouTube comments have to say on this.
682000	685000	And I know what I'm going to fucking get and I get so angry.
685000	686000	Just do what I do.
686000	688000	Stop giving a fuck.
688000	689000	It's hard.
689000	691000	It's, Dark Sakura, it's so hard.
691000	693000	Run out of fucks to give. Use them up.
693000	696000	It's hard when on one hand you're really, really-
696000	698000	I said fucks and you said it's hard.
698000	705000	It's really difficult when on one hand you're really, really rooting for Nintendo and then on the other hand you're like,
705000	708000	God damn it, stop making it worse for yourself.
709000	712000	And I've used this comparison a lot in my broadcast days,
712000	716000	but one of my favorite television moments ever was on America's Next Top Model
716000	719000	when Tyra Banks started yelling at one of the contestants,
719000	721000	Be quiet, Tiffany!
721000	723000	Be quiet! We were rooting for you!
723000	725000	We were all rooting for you!
725000	727000	That's how I felt about Nintendo this week.
727000	729000	I just wanted to put my finger out and be like, be quiet, Nintendo!
729000	731000	Be quiet!
731000	734000	You're not listening to what the people are really saying.
734000	738000	And they put out this comment about the whole, oh well it's just this whimsy,
738000	741000	we're not trying to make social commentary, it's a whimsical world.
741000	745000	And I'm like, oh my God, be quiet, you're making it worse.
745000	750000	Because now you're basically saying, in our whimsical, magical world,
750000	753000	we've made a place where gays don't exist.
755000	756000	Perception-
756000	758000	Boy play girl!
758000	762000	Perception is everything.
762000	763000	The porn game.
763000	765000	And whether that's how they meant it or not,
765000	767000	that's how their statement came across,
767000	771000	is that, don't you want to buy this game where gays don't exist?
772000	775000	And you may not want to make social commentary,
775000	777000	but you can't sit there and say,
777000	781000	I'm Switzerland, I'm not making social commentary, I'm not being involved.
781000	783000	You don't get to say that.
783000	788000	By making a video game, which haven't we argued time and time again,
788000	791000	video games are art, right?
791000	794000	Haven't we tried to convince Roger Ebert and other critics out there,
794000	797000	haven't we tried to convince video games are art?
798000	800000	What is art supposed to do?
800000	801000	Provoke.
801000	802000	Provoke what?
802000	803000	Just provoke.
803000	804000	Provoke.
804000	806000	And one of those things it provokes?
806000	807000	Emo.
807000	808000	Social commentary.
808000	809000	Yeah.
810000	814000	So you can't come out and say a video game does not get into social commentary,
814000	815000	because it did.
815000	817000	And that's the problem, guys.
817000	821000	I'm telling you, like, I know many of you are out there listening to Orange on the Star.
821000	824000	Maybe we have some new listeners tonight, thanks to Christopher Tin being on,
824000	826000	and just everything else going on.
826000	828000	I just need to tell you something.
828000	830000	As a gay gamer, okay?
830000	833000	And I've made no secret about that over the time.
833000	837000	I'm not the type of guy that goes out there and is like,
837000	841000	I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay, and I play video games.
841000	843000	I'm not really that type of person.
843000	845000	I'm not ashamed of who I am, absolutely.
845000	848000	I put myself out there as, this is how I am, deal with it.
848000	851000	This is the way my creator made me, right?
851000	855000	And so I am a video game fan who happens to be gay.
855000	859000	And let me tell you what kind of goes through your mind when you see something like this,
859000	861000	is that it's...
863000	868000	Imagine if you're playing this game that's supposed to be fun.
868000	872000	Imagine you're a heterosexual male out there, because, you know, that's a big demographic,
872000	875000	and you're playing this game that's just whimsical commentary.
875000	881000	But that game forces you to enter into a relationship that maybe you don't want to get into.
882000	886000	And if you're trying to create a me that looks like yourself,
886000	890000	and you're trying to play a character with good values because that's how you feel about yourself,
890000	895000	and you're trying to create a character in a life simulation game that's a reflection on yourself,
895000	900000	but you hit a wall that you thought in many parts of society we've climbed over time and time again,
900000	905000	and you can't actually accurately reflect yourself, it's very frustrating.
905000	908000	And it's a huge setback, like emotionally.
908000	911000	Like, I play video games to escape this shit.
911000	915000	Now, some of you guys might bring up, well, in Mass Effect I can do this,
915000	920000	and, you know, in these other games, you know, in Dragon Age there's that one character who, you know,
920000	923000	maybe I didn't want to romance the same gender, but I have to.
923000	927000	There's a difference. Those games are storytelling.
927000	933000	You're not playing a reflection of yourself in a life simulator game or a reflection of a character you want to be.
933000	935000	You're playing somebody else's narrative.
935000	940000	There is a huge difference whether Nintendo wants to say there is or not.
940000	943000	Anyway, sorry, I'm hogging the conversation, but obviously I had a lot to say on that.
943000	947000	I do want to just say kudos to Nintendo. They realized the mistake.
947000	950000	They came out and they said exactly what they needed to say the first time.
950000	954000	They came out and said it was an oversight not to do this in the game.
954000	957000	We realize we made a mistake. In the future we'll try to do better.
957000	960000	Thank you. That's all I wanted the first time.
960000	963000	That's all I wanted was, like, you know, just acknowledge.
963000	967000	Don't put all this smoke and mirrors shit of it's a social whimsy world.
967000	971000	Just come out and say we are too lazy to reprogram the game because that's essentially what it is.
971000	974000	It's a port. They don't want to go back and recode the whole damn thing.
974000	975000	I accept that.
975000	976000	And I would believe that.
976000	977000	I do.
977000	980000	Too lazy to reprogram a game? Hmm, virtual console? Yeah.
980000	981000	Yeah.
981000	983000	It seems to have an accurate...
984000	989000	Going to our chat room. I'm sure the chat room is lighting up over at live.vognetwork.com.
989000	993000	And I apologize because I wasn't reading as I was ranting there.
993000	995000	So I'm kind of looking at some stuff now.
995000	997000	Bochikawa in chat says,
997000	1003000	Regardless of this news and outcry of this, I would have really liked to see this bug not affect the game in drastic ways.
1003000	1009000	Because that community that would have been born of this would be quite an interesting force to add to our gaming culture.
1009000	1012000	Might even be a subset of gamer, but we will never know.
1012000	1016000	Well, it could be the sequel. We'll see what happens.
1017000	1019000	Eric RPG says,
1027000	1029000	That's a really tough topic for me to get into.
1029000	1035000	And I am going to say I am not the most well educated when it comes to Japanese culture because I've never lived there.
1035000	1037000	So I'm not going to try to make a statement on that.
1037000	1040000	But I will just say from what I've gathered,
1040000	1045000	Japan is not as progressed as we are at this point.
1045000	1047000	But change is coming, folks.
1047000	1052000	Because more and more people are beginning to know somebody who is gay.
1052000	1057000	And the more you know people that are gay, you start to realize they're really not different.
1059000	1061000	Know what you know and know what you don't know.
1061000	1063000	Kinda. Kinda, right?
1066000	1068000	Anyhow, let's see.
1068000	1070000	Going to our chatroom as well.
1070000	1071000	ActDeft says,
1081000	1087000	I truly believe Nintendo did have the best intentions at heart, but it was just ignorance that came into play.
1087000	1090000	So let's use this to educate them a little bit.
1090000	1096000	But when they came out and released that first statement, it was like, it was kinda just gross and ignorant and so on.
1096000	1101000	Here's why I'm going to stick with Animal Crossing for my fun little cutesy sim.
1101000	1107000	And the actual sims for the adult angle.
1107000	1110000	For the maturity angle. How's that sound?
1110000	1112000	Because I can have alien babies.
1112000	1117000	What if Animal Crossing had forced you to get into a relationship with Ed?
1117000	1124000	That the only way you could have a baby in that game is to make a baby with Ed. How would you feel?
1124000	1128000	Well, that's what I feel about the only way to make a baby in Tomodachi Life is to get married.
1128000	1131000	It's the same thing to me.
1131000	1132000	Interesting perspective.
1132000	1138000	Marriage and having children have nothing to do with each other. I'm just saying this.
1138000	1143000	I've been married for almost nine years with my husband for almost 17 years.
1143000	1150000	And yeah, maybe I wanted a baby for a little while, but it wasn't the sole basis of our marriage.
1151000	1155000	You know, I see those assholes, oh my wife won't give me a baby, I'm leaving her.
1155000	1158000	Fuck you! You marry someone because you love them.
1158000	1162000	And that's the whole point. If you have the game and you have the ability to get married,
1162000	1168000	it should be because you are playing a relationship in that game, not just to fucking breed.
1168000	1174000	And sometimes difficulties come into play where mom or dad may not be able to have a child.
1174000	1175000	Exactly.
1175000	1180000	And so, you know, that's why I always get, like, I don't mean to get on a political tangent,
1180000	1183000	I'm going to take this tangent train on a very quick trip, okay?
1183000	1188000	That's why I always get really, like, my feathers get really ruffled when I hear the arguments about,
1188000	1193000	it takes a man and a woman to raise a baby and that's a proper family is to have a man and a woman.
1193000	1198000	What about that family where mom passed away during childbirth?
1198000	1207000	How offensive is a statement like that to that family where the dad is doing everything to raise that child appropriately?
1207000	1208000	Yeah.
1208000	1213000	Think before you open your fucking mouth. Why don't you just say, I think gay people are gross?
1213000	1216000	Because that's what I hear. Again, perception, folks.
1216000	1218000	They've got the cooties.
1218000	1224000	When you make a comment like that, Loki, you and I lived together for what, two and a half years?
1224000	1226000	Did you catch gay living with me?
1228000	1229000	Did you catch it?
1229000	1233000	No. But then again, you throw like a girl, so.
1233000	1235000	So do you.
1235000	1241000	Well, what about this too? I mean, I'll just talk about my, you know, my mom left my dad when I was a baby
1241000	1245000	because at the time my dad was not a very stable individual.
1245000	1248000	You know, she left because of domestic abuse.
1248000	1256000	Would we have all rather than that my mom had stayed with my dad and have him not get any better,
1256000	1261000	beat on her, beat on me and have that kind of a broken childhood as opposed to her,
1261000	1265000	you know, raising me with my grandmother and having me raised.
1265000	1268000	I was raised in a matriarchal house.
1268000	1274000	You're not, you know, I'm just saying, you know, look at these people who have to make tough decisions like this.
1274000	1281000	What about women or women who are raped and decide that, you know, because of moral reasons or whatever,
1281000	1282000	they're going to have that kid.
1282000	1286000	Do you want them to hunt down their rapist and say, help me raise this baby?
1286000	1291000	Well, I got to, we're getting, I mean, these, these are all very tough social questions.
1291000	1294000	Obviously, you're asking some very uncomfortable questions.
1294000	1299000	But I think what people have to realize is that, yeah, it might be just a video game,
1299000	1304000	but when it's supposed to be a life reflection, there's, life is a little more complicated than that.
1304000	1306000	It's a lot more complicated. Yeah.
1306000	1309000	So, and sometimes we play video games to escape life.
1309000	1314000	But then when the game sets down all these rules that seem very arbitrary, it can be very difficult.
1314000	1318000	That's actually why I really like the whole approach of The Sims to it.
1318000	1325000	Because you can, you can, you know, bang somebody, get knocked up and kick them out of the house if you want to.
1325000	1328000	You know, you can raise the baby by yourself if you want to.
1328000	1330000	I have had a character do it.
1330000	1339000	You know, I, you can have, you know, same sex parents, opposite sex parents, and aliens and vampires.
1339000	1344000	Basically, no one looks at you weird because no one gives a shit. It's not their business.
1344000	1350000	I like that approach. Don't make it anything that's, oh, weird. Just make no one care.
1350000	1354000	Because really, no one should care. It's no one else's business.
1354000	1361000	All right. Well, we've got to move on because it is about half past six, and I've got to move into our interview tonight.
1361000	1367000	You know, we've been talking a lot in this opening about how Civilization has changed.
1367000	1377000	And, you know, there is another simulator out there, one of my favorites of all time, Civilization, that is, that has existed through, through five different games.
1377000	1383000	And the third Civilization game, I'm going to be honest y'all, Civ III, not my favorite in the series.
1383000	1387000	It's still a good game. It's like, it's like ice cream. Even a bad flavor is still ice cream. It's still pretty good.
1387000	1395000	That's how I feel about Civ III. But then, you know, when I first played Civ IV for the first time, and I fired up that, you know, loading screen and saw that opening movie,
1395000	1404000	it was very much like, yes, this is a new, this is the rebirth of Civilization. This is a new game. This is going to be awesome.
1404000	1409000	And so Civ IV, you know, a lot of that is credited to the soundtrack of the game.
1409000	1415000	And one of the most influential songs in the game that had such an impact was a song called Baba Yetu.
1415000	1420000	And we are going to be welcoming the composer of Baba Yetu to the show tonight, Christopher Tin.
1420000	1424000	Before we give him a call, let's take a listen to a clip because it is an audio download.
1424000	1429000	I can't play the entire song for you because you got to, you got to go to Christophertin.com and get this album for yourself.
1429000	1437000	But we're going to play a clip here to set the mood of Baba Yetu from Civilization IV here on Orange Lounge Radio before we welcome Christopher Tin.
1439000	1444000	And we're going to play the song called Baba Yetu.
1469000	1471000	Baba Yetu
1499000	1501000	Baba Yetu
1501000	1503000	Baba Yetu
1503000	1505000	Baba Yetu
1505000	1507000	Baba Yetu
1507000	1509000	Baba Yetu
1509000	1511000	Baba Yetu
1513000	1518000	I still get chills listening to that. I don't know about you guys, but that's like such a great song there.
1518000	1522000	Again, that's a clip of Baba Yetu from Civilization IV.
1522000	1527000	And we are going to get the composer of Baba Yetu on the line right now.
1527000	1534000	We're going to do this live here. We're going to give Christopher a call and get him on the show to talk about Baba Yetu as well as his brand new album.
1534000	1535000	Hi there, is this Christopher?
1535000	1536000	Yes it is.
1536000	1539000	Hey Christopher, how you doing? It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio. You're on the air. How's it going?
1539000	1540000	Hi Rob.
1540000	1541000	Hi.
1541000	1542000	Welcome.
1542000	1543000	Hi.
1543000	1549000	Welcome to the show. Congratulations. You just released your brand new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea this week, right?
1549000	1552000	Yes I did. This Thursday in fact.
1552000	1558000	Wow, that's awesome. Now if people want to pick up a copy of The Drop That Contained the Sea, where's the best place to go to pick that up?
1558000	1564000	Well the best place is my own website, ChristopherTin.com. You can also get it at iTunes and Amazon.
1564000	1569000	But they take a big cut, so my website is definitely the best place to do it.
1569000	1577000	So if you want to make sure that Christopher is actually the one getting your money, because he deserves it for this soundtrack, check out ChristopherTin.com.
1577000	1582000	We see some folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw is asking, will you take questions from the chat room?
1582000	1588000	Absolutely. If you have a question for Christopher Tin, head on over to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.
1588000	1592000	I've also got some questions from social media we will get to in just a little bit.
1592000	1599000	But Christopher, if you don't mind, I want to take a step back, because we are a show primarily about video games and gaming culture.
1599000	1611000	So you have an awesome title by your name. You are the first person to win a Grammy for a song that was composed for a video game.
1611000	1613000	How does that feel when you hear that?
1613000	1624000	It's kind of cool. The history of video games is littered with all sorts of trivia, and it's kind of cool that I get to be a little footnote in that history.
1624000	1626000	So it's cool. I really enjoy it.
1626000	1629000	You might end up a Jeopardy question someday. That's pretty awesome.
1629000	1632000	That would be hilarious if that happened. I would love that.
1632000	1636000	Which would feel better? The Grammy or the Jeopardy question? No, don't answer that.
1636000	1639000	I don't know. That's a tough one, you know? Yeah.
1639000	1647000	Don't answer that. That was a dumb question. All right. Let's take a step back. Since we are a video game show, I want to talk about Civilization IV, obviously.
1648000	1656000	I'm a huge fan of the Civ series, and I just talked about how Civ III, for me, was not the strongest Civ game.
1656000	1663000	But Civ IV, that was such a rebirth for the series for me, and a huge part of that was the music.
1663000	1669000	When you fire up that game for the first time and you hear Baba Yetu and you see the full motion video of Civilization is being created,
1669000	1673000	it really sets the mood for this epic rebirth for Civilization.
1673000	1682000	I know you've probably been asked this question a million times, but for the sake of our audience, how did you end up being asked to do Baba Yetu for Civ IV?
1682000	1693000	It's a pretty funny story, actually. The lead designer of Civilization IV is a guy named Soren Johnson, who happened to be my roommate back in college.
1693000	1698000	I went to my five-year college reunion and I ran into Soren and I said,
1698000	1703000	Soren, what are you up to? He said, I'm a video game designer now. I was like, oh yeah, that's cool.
1703000	1708000	He said, I'm working on a game. Actually, he said he just finished a game. It was Civilization III.
1708000	1713000	I said, oh, fantastic. I love the Civ series. I grew up playing it. He said, that's great.
1713000	1717000	Well, I'm working on Civ IV. Have you ever considered writing music for video games?
1717000	1727000	I hadn't at the time, but obviously it was a thrilling idea for me because, like I said, I grew up playing Civilization.
1727000	1732000	Like many other people, I logged hundreds of hours playing that game.
1732000	1740000	A few months later, I got a call from him saying, hey, Chris, we took some of the music that you produced in college and we stuck it on the game and we really like it.
1740000	1750000	We were wondering if we could hire you to write a new piece of music that had an African influence as well as an orchestral influence with lots of big taiko drums.
1750000	1757000	I said, yeah, I'd love to do it. That was kind of my version of the breaking into the business story.
1757000	1765000	Just a pure chance encounter with my old college roommate, which led to pretty much the biggest break of my life.
1765000	1771000	It seems so crazy that they talk about sometimes, and I was just having a conversation with a colleague before the show tonight,
1771000	1774000	that a lot of the gaming industry sometimes is about who you know.
1775000	1781000	It's so interesting that, yeah, it was this chance encounter or whatever, but it worked out so perfectly.
1781000	1785000	You can't imagine Civ IV without that soundtrack now.
1785000	1788000	Yeah, it's kind of weird, isn't it? You think about it.
1788000	1795000	This was like 10 years ago that I ran into him at our reunion, maybe 11 years, something like that.
1795000	1800000	It's almost one of these things where it almost never happened for me.
1800000	1803000	My life would be very different now if I hadn't run into Soren.
1804000	1806000	It's a cool thing, I gotta say.
1806000	1812000	Well, congratulations. Your music is incredible, and you're very deserving of the success, so congratulations to you.
1812000	1814000	Thanks, Rob. I appreciate that.
1814000	1817000	No worries. Baba Yetu, it's had a lasting presence.
1817000	1826000	Here we are still talking about, they're on Civ V and talking about Civ V and a half now with the After Earth and all this or whatever they're making this year.
1826000	1831000	Yet, here we are talking about Baba Yetu. This song's had such a lasting presence.
1831000	1836000	How did it feel to win a Grammy for a song that you'd written years ago?
1837000	1848000	It was a great feeling. It was kind of surreal, and it actually didn't sink in for about a year until the following year when I went to the Grammys as a spectator.
1848000	1855000	I knew some people at that time who were nominated for Grammys, and one by one I saw them all not win.
1856000	1861000	At that point, I was just like, oh my god, I can't believe I managed to get through. I can't believe it happened for me.
1861000	1869000	That's when it really sank in. It was kind of a surreal experience when I actually got it, though.
1870000	1880000	Baba Yetu is really a staple of the Video Games Live Tour. I'm sure you're probably familiar with the Video Games Live Tour that Tommy Tallarico puts on, and he's still touring the world with this.
1880000	1888000	I was actually just telling a story to Bobby on the show prior to us tonight that when I went and saw Video Games Live, I remember them playing Baba Yetu.
1888000	1900000	That was one of the memorable pieces in the show for me. Have you seen or participated in Video Games Live, and how do you feel about your song being such a staple of the tour?
1900000	1909000	I love it. I'm very heavily involved in the show. I conducted it from time to time. I conducted the Canada Tour last year.
1909000	1914000	We went coast to coast in Canada and did the show for a number of different audiences.
1914000	1924000	I'm going to be conducting Baba Yetu again this June at the LA E3 Video Games Live Show.
1925000	1932000	I love it. They were the ones who premiered the song live. They performed it at the Hollywood Bowl back in, I think, 2006.
1932000	1948000	I got to give credit to Tommy and Jack Wall as well, who is conducting it. They really brought that song out of purely the video game world and into this new world that I'm connected to, which is the classical world.
1948000	1955000	Because of Video Games Live, the sheet music got published by Alfred Publishing, which is a large sheet music publisher.
1955000	1968000	Alfred issued it, and it became a hit amongst high school choirs. Suddenly, thousands of choirs around the world were singing this song, just for their spring concerts and whatever.
1968000	1980000	It introduced my music to a brand new audience. I like to think that this was a big step in me. I think it's kind of difficult for video game composers to hop over to the mainstream.
1980000	1992000	I think this was my particular way of doing so. It was purely through the fact that my music got performed so much, and the sheet music, that I found an audience outside of video games.
1992000	2011000	Wow, that's amazing. Do you still plan to work with video games composed for future video games? Now you're on this different path where you're able to express the world music on your own through these albums. Do you see yourself working with video games again in the future?
2011000	2029000	I actually have a new song coming out in a game that I can't tell you the game, but I can tell you that it'll be announced in a few days, actually. But if people like Baba Yetu, it's similar in terms of the style of it.
2029000	2042000	The game itself that it's coming out in, let's just say it's in that same world. There'll be an announcement pretty soon, within the next week, I think.
2042000	2058000	Well, I have a guess what that might be, but we'll see. That'd be awesome. I'm hoping it's true. I'm sure whatever it is will be awesome. Let's continue to talk about the future. I know that you have a new album that's out there, so I definitely want to let you talk about that new album.
2058000	2063000	So what do your fans have to look forward to from your new release, The Drop That Contained the Sea?
2063000	2080000	Well, it's a lot more epic, world-influenced, orchestral, choral music, I guess is the way to describe it. If people like Baba Yetu, then there's a lot of tracks on there that I think blow Baba Yetu away, but we'll see what other people think.
2080000	2095000	But I'm really proud of it, actually. I think it's been my way of maturing over the last couple of years as a composer. I think the level of writing is a lot deeper. My level of expression is a lot more personal and a lot more grandiose, I think.
2095000	2115000	I feel really good about it on a purely artistic level. So far, the response that I've gotten from people has been very positive as well. People have been saying that it's like the evolution of my writing. A lot of people have said it surpasses my previous album, so I feel really good about it, I gotta say.
2116000	2134000	That's a great point, because when you talk about that this is where you're at now and things have evolved and so forth, I think everybody always asks me, how can I go listen to Orange Lawn's radio episode 1? I don't know if you know, we're on episode 552 now, so we've been doing this a very long time.
2134000	2140000	And I'm kind of like, don't worry about episode 1, guys, it's not even as good as what we're doing now.
2140000	2158000	Yeah, totally. You always want to push yourself as an artist and you always want to evolve, right? And what's a little difficult sometimes is some people, especially if you're an artist that releases an album once every five years or something, they're kind of locked into a time capsule in terms of who you were five years ago and what you were writing then.
2158000	2182000	But you always do want to push yourself as a writer because you want to grow, right? And if people just want to listen to the stuff I was writing five years ago, there's already an album for that, but I do sort of want to bring people along for a ride and of course I hope to reward their participation on this journey by delivering a good product and I hope that I've done that.
2183000	2197000	I think you have. I think when people listen to The Drop That Contained the Sea, they will not be disappointed. We're going to play a track from that in a little bit at the end of the interview so people can get a little taste of that. But if you want to hear more of it, check out The Drop That Contained the Sea at ChristopherTinn.com.
2197000	2207000	Christopher, our chat room is lighting up with questions. In fact, I'm not even going to be able to get to all these. I feel awful. But I do want to ask you some of these questions that are coming from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2207000	2216000	I'm going to go with this one from Dark Tetsuya who asks, is there a particular genre of game you've always wanted to compose music for?
2216000	2239000	Hmm, interesting. A particular genre. I think it's a role-playing game of some sort. I think that would be great. Or an MMO actually. You know what, I love the idea of working on an MMO. Something where people give me kind of a world to populate with my ideas, so to speak.
2239000	2258000	Yeah, something like that. I'm not so drawn to things like first-person shooters. Whatever gives me the opportunity to write good music. But honestly, I just love working on games anyway. Whatever people ask me to do, I'm probably thrilled to do it.
2258000	2263000	Well, I was going to say, if Blizzard is out there listening, Christopher is waiting for your call. So just know that.
2263000	2268000	Yeah, I know all those Blizzard guys. And one of these days, maybe I'll come begging at their doorstep or something.
2268000	2271000	I don't think they'd mind.
2271000	2277000	No, I love them. They're a really talented bunch of guys. I have a lot of respect for them.
2277000	2291000	Let me do a question from Dungeonbuster, who saw your AMA recently on Reddit. Dungeonbuster asks, can he share what about Katamari Damacy's sound makes it amazing to him? I love the soundtrack too, but I'm curious to know what excites him about it.
2291000	2297000	Yeah, I gotta admit, Christopher, when I hear your music, I don't necessarily see Katamari Damacy influence. What's that about?
2297000	2305000	But it's so good. I don't know, I can't explain it, but I just love the energy and the zaniness of it.
2305000	2313000	We're not just talking about the main theme, which is fantastic, of course, but in my mind, the entire soundtrack to all the Katamari games is genius.
2313000	2315000	I second that.
2315000	2327000	There's a wide diversity of styles in there. I mean, some great vocal performances, some great tracks being produced by a number of different DJs and producers and so forth. I think it's just really, really cool.
2327000	2342000	And I think it takes a special, really quirky game like Katamari to pull off a soundtrack like that. You're never going to hear that in any other game. And I don't know, I think it's just fantastic writing.
2342000	2344000	And I kind of miss that series myself.
2344000	2359000	I have to say, though, it combines anything from old swing to jazz to the whole crooner style. My two favorite tracks are completely, stylistically different from each other. The Moon and the Prince and then Que Sera Sera.
2359000	2368000	Totally, right? I mean, it's all over the place. And I think that's why it's so fun, too, because it's like this giant amalgamation. It's like a Katamari in musical form.
2368000	2370000	It is. It really is.
2370000	2377000	It's like a giant amalgamation of random songs thrown together. And I just think it's fantastic.
2377000	2387000	Let's go to another question from our chat room from Gamer Girl, who asks, is there an influence outside of video games that you get your inspiration for the music you compose?
2387000	2389000	There's got to be plenty, right?
2389000	2398000	Oh, there's a lot. I mean, I'll tell you what inspired me to write the latest album is I got really turned on to the band Florence and the Machine a couple of years ago.
2398000	2400000	Oh, yes.
2400000	2409000	I totally dig her. And I, you know, this album was kind of inspired by that feeling that I got when I first listened to her debut album Lungs.
2409000	2419000	I mean, I was just, I just loved the rocket-ness of it. And I loved the lyrics and I loved her vocal performance and sort of the gospel influence.
2419000	2428000	She was, I mean, that album, you know, really, you know, there's absolutely no direct influence on any of the songs. I mean, they're so stylistically different.
2428000	2433000	But the energy that I got from her really made me want to create an album like my latest one.
2433000	2445000	And then, you know, there's all the other sort of influences that I have from being a classically trained composer and playing jazz and, you know, doing all these other different things growing up and listening to world music and performing in world music groups.
2445000	2449000	But honestly, the influence comes from all over the place.
2449000	2456000	That's amazing to hear because Florence is one of my favorites. I got to say Shake It Out is probably one of my 10 favorite songs ever written.
2456000	2458000	Oh, I know, right? Oh, my God, yeah.
2458000	2462000	She wrote it in like 15 minutes, apparently. She's like, like, she just literally-
2462000	2466000	I have one that I like better, though, and that's My Boy Builds Coffins.
2466000	2467000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2467000	2469000	That one I can just sing.
2469000	2470000	Yeah, so good.
2470000	2479000	But she's very diverse in her styles, too, if you really think about it. And I know on your albums, you have all these songs in different languages and it's very diverse as well.
2479000	2482000	I just, it's, I would have never made that connection to Florence. That's so funny.
2482000	2493000	Yeah, I mean, it's purely on a fan level that I'm connected to her. I mean, there's no sort of like, it's not like our music is related in any sort of level, but I just, I'm just a huge fan.
2493000	2495000	I understand the feeling very well.
2495000	2498000	If I may, actually, one tiny question for me.
2498000	2499000	Of course.
2499000	2505000	I did happen to notice it sounded like you had a little bit of a minimalist influence as well, like Philip Glass.
2505000	2519000	Hmm, actually, I was a big John Adams fan all through college, actually. That's well spotted. I'm not sure where you spotted that, but you know, that's woven into my DNA musically. So I mean, it's all this sort of stuff surfaces at one point or another, so good catch.
2519000	2529000	I just sort of got the feeling across the board, you know, it's like, you know, how there's just that, it'll start with one thing and then build and build and build, but it's so subtle that you don't notice it until one point.
2529000	2536000	Well, what were we talking about a minute ago? Art always provokes response, and it's always interesting how that response comes in all these different ways.
2536000	2547000	I actually, when I'm a designer, as my hobby now, I do it only for volunteer work now, but when I listen to you, actually, when I draw, I listen to Philip Glass.
2548000	2562000	And depending on the style of what I'm doing, depends the style of music I'm going to listen to. It's like, I will fully throw on, you know, Ella Fitzgerald if I'm doing, you know, 30s and 40s style, so.
2562000	2576000	All right, well, I just, I don't want to take up too much of Christopher's time. I just have a couple more questions from our chatters and our listeners. One more question from chat here, Christopher, from Tiger Claw, who asks, have you ever thought of composing, speaking of diversity, have you ever thought of composing for feature films or TV?
2577000	2590000	Yeah, you know, I've never really given TV much of a thought until recent years, and I think that's because, like, I think TV's gotten really good recently, and, you know, I've started to become more of a fan of TV.
2590000	2606000	Films, my original intent was to write for movies, but along the way, I sort of got sidetracked by commercials, games, and, you know, this career that I have now. I would love to write for films. I think collaborative work is a lot of fun, and films are a great medium to work in.
2606000	2615000	So, I mean, I have done a number of films, and I'd certainly like to do more. So, I mean, I'm just, you know, I'm keeping all my options open at this point.
2616000	2624000	All right, I'm going to go to one more question. This one's actually from Facebook, and I know this guy is a huge fan of yours, so he'd be so devastated if I didn't ask his question, and I'm going to.
2624000	2633000	So, Awesome Unicorn is on our Facebook and asked you this question earlier this week, who said, I'd like to hear about the process of selecting vocalists for the songs.
2633000	2641000	Some of your work seems very tailored to a specific type of performance or singing style, and then others seem like a wider range of vocalists would be able to perform the songs.
2641000	2648000	Do you tend to write songs with specific performers in mind to sing them, or do the songs come first and the quest for the vocalists later?
2648000	2659000	Well, hello, Awesome Unicorn, first of all. Yes, I do actually write specifically with vocalists in mind.
2659000	2669000	I mean, usually what will happen is I'll listen to a bunch of records, and I'll identify who I want to work with, and then I'll just track them down on the internet and write to them.
2669000	2683000	If they're game, I will write with them in mind. With a lot of the singers I've reached out to, they've totally been game, and so the songs were pretty much tailored to them.
2683000	2695000	I think there's a real advance to doing that. First of all, if you have a specific singer in mind, you can write to their strengths.
2695000	2703000	When you write to their strengths, they'll perform the hell out of it. When they perform the hell out of it, you get an immensely dramatic and gratifying performance.
2703000	2710000	You maybe won't always get that when you write something in the abstract and have someone else come in and sing it later.
2710000	2720000	There are times when I've done that as well, and it works some of the times, but generally speaking, I prefer to have someone in mind when I'm writing for them.
2720000	2725000	When I'm writing a song, I prefer to have a particular voice in mind. Let me put it that way.
2725000	2730000	Good to know. I'm glad we could resolve Awesome Unicorn's inquiry there.
2730000	2736000	Before we let Christopher go and get to the other song preview, Jamie, you mentioned you had one other quick question you wanted to sneak in.
2736000	2739000	What is your favorite non-standard time signature?
2740000	2754000	Probably, I don't know, maybe 7-8 or 5-8, something like that. I'm going to start exploring more and more complex ones as I get further and further into Bulgarian music and Bulgarian rhythms, which are very complicated.
2754000	2760000	7-8, 9-8, 11-8, 13-8, things like that. I'm just going to start exploring a little more.
2760000	2764000	But I think there's plenty of great music that can be written in 4-4, I gotta say.
2764000	2775000	I agree with that. I just keep thinking about the first time I ever, I was a band nerd, the first time I ever played Mars Bringer of War, and learning how to do 5-8, and I was like, I want more of this.
2775000	2782000	Yeah, right? Totally. There's a little bit of a Mars Bringer of War influence on one of the songs on my new album, too, actually.
2782000	2787000	Ooh, I'm excited, because that's like my favorite in the planets.
2787000	2798000	Oh my god, yeah, it's fantastic. Actually, the ninth track of my album, it's called Has Gengor Fridum, which is a sort of setting of an Old Norse Viking text.
2798000	2812000	I mean, that's one, there's a piece where, you know, there's a little bit of Mars Bringer of War, there's a little bit of Carmina Burana, there's a little bit of Nobuo Amatus, Liberi Fatali, you know, there's all these influences.
2812000	2828000	And, you know, I'm speaking to a gamer crowd here, but, and this is why I feel comfortable saying this, like, there's a lot of game soundtracks out there which have this sort of bombastic, you know, Gustav Holst, Mars Bringer of War sound to them, you know, these gothic choirs and things like that.
2828000	2836000	And I've never really had the opportunity to write for a game like that. And I sort of resisted writing a piece like that, sort of for my own projects.
2836000	2853000	So after I conducted Video Games Live, and after I conducted Liberi Fatali a number of times, I was just like, I want to write a piece like this, I, you know, screw it, I just want to do this, you know, I don't care, you know, if it's been done 1000 times, I'm gonna write my own version of this type of gothic bombastic thing.
2853000	2864000	And so, you know, I channel Stravinsky and Karl Orff and you know, all these other guys and, and, you know, crank up this big old Viking tune, which I was a lot of fun to do, you know,
2864000	2865000	Well, I'm sitting here excited now.
2865000	2875000	Well, only Dark Sakura would go there and take it to a whole nother music nerd level. But the chat room is eating it up. Just so you know, Christopher, chat room is Bobby Black Wolf saying 7-8 is my favorite too.
2875000	2881000	And kind of causing to a music nerd high five and they're they're they're music nerding out there. So that's
2881000	2883000	High five guys, high five.
2883000	2886000	My first major in college was a music major. So
2886000	2887000	Fantastic.
2887000	2890000	I was a band nerd and I was a clarinet player in high school myself.
2890000	2892000	Oh, fantastic. I was a trumpet player.
2892000	2895000	I was sax and contra alto clarinet just to be different.
2895000	2896000	All right.
2896000	2898000	Wow.
2898000	2906000	Music nerds and band nerds and video game nerds everywhere have a reason to check out Christopher Tin.
2906000	2909000	You can check check him out on his website, Christophertin.com.
2909000	2915000	And you can check out the new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea, which I'm sure many of you haven't heard yet because it just came out this week.
2915000	2918000	So no excuses. Go check that out at Christophertin.com.
2918000	2922000	Christopher, as we say goodbye to you, we're going to check out one of these songs from the new album.
2922000	2928000	This is track four. And I apologize if I horribly butchered the name, but it's Eza
2928000	2930000	Nomso, I believe.
2930000	2933000	It's Eza Nomso, which means come tomorrow.
2933000	2940000	And this is also performed by the Soweto Gospel Choir who performed Baba Yetu and a little bit of trivia about this song.
2940000	2946000	I wrote this at the last minute. I was on a plane to Johannesburg.
2946000	2952000	And it's a long story, but I was being flown around for this commercial project I was doing for Emirates Airlines and they're flying me all around the world business class.
2952000	2958000	So I had a very cushy seat and I was on my way to Johannesburg and I thought I need to write another song for these guys to sing.
2958000	2964000	And so I wrote this song and it's about clouds, which is kind of a fitting thing to write about when you're flying.
2964000	2970000	So it's got a sort of a brisk sort of breezy feel like you're sort of flying through the clouds.
2970000	2981000	And the lyrics are about, you know, the lyrics translate to things like, like a bird, I fly, I sing, like a bird, I'm holding on to the wind.
2981000	2985000	Very sort of poetic stuff about, you know, clouds and flying through the air.
2985000	2990000	Well, we're going to check this out right after I say goodbye.
2990000	2993000	Christopher, thank you so much for taking the time out today with us.
2993000	2996000	I know today is a big day for a lot of people with Mother's Day and everything.
2996000	2999000	So thank you for spending time with us and best of luck with the new album.
2999000	3002000	And I really encourage people everywhere to check it out on your website.
3002000	3004000	Thanks, guys. It was a lot of fun.
3004000	3007000	And I look forward to the surprise announcement this week.
3007000	3009000	Yeah, yeah. Keep an eye out.
3009000	3012000	All right. Take care, Christopher. It was a real honor.
3012000	3013000	Likewise.
3013000	3014000	All right. Bye bye.
3014000	3015000	Bye.

3023000	3028000	Again, I can't play the whole thing for you guys, but I think it's on his website if you want to check it out over at ChristopherTin.com.
3028000	3033000	This is a clip of track four from the album, Iza Nomso.
3033000	3036000	I think I said that right. Come tomorrow is what it means.
3036000	3037000	Nyomso.
3037000	3040000	Nyomso. Here it is. Come tomorrow. I'll just say come tomorrow.
3040000	3042000	Here it is, guys, at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

7962000	7965000	beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
7965000	7967000	This is a real game, people, only in Japan.
7967000	7970000	Omega Quintet, coming to you September.
7970000	7974000	It's Idol Master meets the beep.
7974000	7975000	Drop that beep.
7975000	7977000	All right, lastly but not leastly,
7977000	7980000	this made me exclaim a lot of excited things
7980000	7984000	that had to get beeped, because I was excited to hear that Tetsuya Mizuguchi
7984000	7986000	is back in game development.
7986000	7987000	That's right.
7987000	7989000	We thought he was taking a break
7989000	7992000	or was going long-term or whatever to focus on the college stuff,
7992000	7994000	but in the new issue of Edge,
7994000	7997000	which is available in print form and so on,
7997000	7999000	he talks about how he left Q Entertainment.
7999000	8001000	He took up a role as a lecturer,
8001000	8004000	but he is not giving up on video games.
8004000	8007000	So he's right now, quote, helping with a few games,
8007000	8009000	but they are not like his previous work,
8009000	8011000	like Res or Space Channel 5.
8011000	8014000	He says, I'm helping with some social games in Japan.
8014000	8015000	I'm just helping.
8015000	8017000	I want to start a new project on my own,
8017000	8020000	maybe this year or next year.
8020000	8021000	Yes.
8023000	8026000	Very excited, because I'm a Mizuguchi fanboy.
8026000	8027000	That you are.
8027000	8028000	I am, very much.
8028000	8029000	All right, Dark Sakura.
8029000	8035000	Well, there is a new comerage for the Left 4 Dead franchise,
8035000	8038000	and it is an arcade game that's planned for Japan
8038000	8042000	that basically it's going to,
8042000	8045000	I don't know if this is going to be something like
8045000	8047000	the Gun Survivor series,
8047000	8048000	if it's going to be one of those,
8048000	8051000	but it looks like Taito is working with Valve
8051000	8052000	to put this out,
8052000	8055000	and it's been thought of,
8055000	8057000	announced before as Project Z,
8057000	8059000	but now it's Left 4 Dead.
8060000	8062000	Next up, Shaq Fu, a Legend Reborn.
8062000	8063000	It got funded.
8063000	8064000	Next.
8065000	8067000	What an interesting world we live in,
8067000	8070000	where Amplitude probably won't get,
8070000	8071000	on its current path anyway,
8071000	8072000	won't get funded,
8072000	8075000	yet Shaq Fu got funded.
8075000	8077000	Just let that sink in for a minute.
8077000	8078000	But.
8078000	8079000	And then have a drink.
8079000	8080000	But.
8080000	8082000	There is something good coming out of this.
8082000	8083000	Okay.
8083000	8085000	Five percent of all the profits will be donated
8085000	8087000	to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
8088000	8089000	Okay.
8089000	8091000	Better than five percent going to Kickstarter,
8091000	8093000	but that's a great thing to hear.
8093000	8096000	Last but not least, we have,
8096000	8100000	you know how there's just two new tracks for Outrun?
8100000	8102000	Well, now there are going to be three
8102000	8104000	Outrun soundtracks coming out.
8104000	8108000	You can get them for $9.49 for each soundtrack
8108000	8111000	on Amazon or $9.99 on the iTunes store,
8111000	8113000	or you can just get them individual
8113000	8114000	in case you're like me
8114000	8116000	and only care about Magical Sound Shower.
8117000	8118000	Fair enough.
8118000	8121000	And don't already have other Outrun soundtracks.
8121000	8122000	Alright, fair enough.
8122000	8123000	Alright, we're going to move on.
8123000	8125000	There is no frugal question.
8125000	8127000	I was going to say, for the record,
8127000	8129000	one of my horses in Derby Owners Club
8129000	8130000	was called Magical Sound.
8130000	8131000	I remember that.
8131000	8133000	I think because there wasn't enough characters
8133000	8134000	to be Magical Sound Shower.
8134000	8136000	But you did have Beat Politary.
8136000	8137000	Just Politary.
8137000	8139000	No, Politary, so that you could whip Politary.
8139000	8140000	Yes.
8140000	8141000	And that Politary would cry.
8141000	8143000	Although it's kind of tasteless in retrospect,
8143000	8146000	but I don't really wish harm upon this individual,
8146000	8149000	but it was just a running gag with Bamani music
8149000	8151000	because her songs were really bad.
8151000	8152000	I had one called Just a Horse
8152000	8153000	that ended up being awesome.
8153000	8155000	Didn't you have one called Glue?
8155000	8156000	Yeah, I did have one called Glue,
8156000	8158000	and Glue ended up being my best sire.
8159000	8162000	I remember I think I had one called Briton Spears.
8162000	8163000	Yeah.
8163000	8164000	And then...
8164000	8165000	I missed Derby Owners Club.
8165000	8166000	That was the day.
8166000	8167000	I know it's still around, but it's not the same.
8167000	8168000	I found my folder.
8168000	8169000	Did you really?
8169000	8170000	It has my horses in it.
8170000	8171000	Anyway.
8171000	8172000	Alright, anyway.
8172000	8173000	No frugal question of the week this week
8173000	8175000	because I knew we would be running along
8175000	8176000	because of the interview
8176000	8178000	and I wanted everybody to ask our guest questions,
8178000	8180000	but it'll return next week.
8180000	8182000	So Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio
8182000	8184000	or Google.com slash plus Orange Launch Radio.
8184000	8186000	There is a game Sega should bring
8186000	8188000	to the Wii U.
8188000	8189000	What?
8189000	8190000	Derby Owners Club.
8190000	8191000	Hey, now you're talking.
8191000	8193000	Because then you can whip the horses
8193000	8194000	with the Wii remotes.
8194000	8195000	Yeah.
8195000	8197000	And Sega's in bed with Nintendo now.
8197000	8199000	And you'd use your little sub screen for training.
8200000	8201000	This is a good idea.
8201000	8202000	Why isn't this happening?
8202000	8203000	I don't understand.
8203000	8205000	I don't understand.
8205000	8207000	Because licensing everything that goes into that game
8207000	8209000	is actually kind of fucking expensive.
8209000	8211000	That's why the cabinets are premium.
8211000	8212000	That's true.
8212000	8214000	Aren't those like six digits for those cabinets?
8214000	8215000	I would not doubt it,
8215000	8218000	especially for that main screen that always shows the running race.
8218000	8219000	Crazy.
8219000	8221000	That alone is easily high fives.
8221000	8223000	All right, let's move on to some other
8223000	8224000	Take the card with you.
8224000	8226000	longer gaming news stories.
8226000	8228000	We'll get into maybe a little bit more in depth.
8228000	8229000	Loki.
8229000	8230000	All right.
8230000	8233000	So once again we're talking about Nintendo here.
8233000	8237000	They're planning to approach emerging markets,
8237000	8239000	you know, like China and stuff,
8239000	8241000	a little differently than they do the rest of the world,
8241000	8245000	including that they are going to actually target those markets
8245000	8250000	with different hardware or new hardware, I guess.
8250000	8252000	They're basically saying, you know,
8252000	8254000	we want to make new things,
8254000	8257000	you know, thinking rather a cheaper version of what we currently have.
8257000	8260000	The product and price balance must be made from scratch.
8260000	8264000	So if you kind of take it like, you know,
8264000	8266000	how they made the Wii mini, you know,
8266000	8270000	doing something like that for maybe like the Wii U or something.
8270000	8273000	Or, you know, 2DS or something like that.
8273000	8276000	Where it's slightly cheaper than the stuff that's out there,
8276000	8280000	you know, to help drive sales, I guess.
8280000	8282000	I don't know.
8282000	8284000	I mean, I guess that's a good idea.
8284000	8289000	I just, I can't imagine what they would strip out feature wise for like a Wii U.
8289000	8292000	You know, the 3DS obviously, the 2DS works.
8292000	8293000	NFC.
8293000	8296000	Yeah, I think with the handhelds it would be really easy to get.
8296000	8298000	The gamepad might be tethered.
8298000	8302000	Yeah, it would be really easy to get a lower cost console for the handhelds.
8302000	8305000	The other consoles, I mean, what about just a Wii?
8305000	8308000	Like, why the Wii U? Why not just a Wii?
8308000	8310000	Well, they have the Wii mini, so they could do that.
8310000	8313000	This is for other markets that don't have video games
8313000	8317000	as much as they do in Japan, USA, Europe as it is.
8317000	8322000	Well, as of recently, they haven't had any consoles because they were banned.
8322000	8325000	It's an interesting change in strategy for Nintendo,
8325000	8330000	especially considering a lot of the crap that we use getting here in the States and in Japan and so forth.
8330000	8335000	It's an interesting way to try to turn things around by taking a proven success and launching it in other places.
8335000	8338000	I mean, it's not like China is a small country, you know.
8338000	8344000	Something like the Wii has the potential to do very well there, so it's a very interesting strategy.
8344000	8348000	Maybe a good way to cut the losses in the home department.
8348000	8350000	I don't like that term.
8350000	8351000	What?
8351000	8352000	Proven success.
8352000	8355000	Well, what would you call the Wii in that regard?
8355000	8359000	It is. Come on, Wii Sports. Best video game ever, sales-wise.
8359000	8363000	I've, you know, saved the argument that I've made at least three times on the show previously.
8363000	8365000	I call it a lightning bolt.
8365000	8368000	It came, it landed, it's done.
8368000	8369000	Other markets, I don't know.
8369000	8374000	I truly don't know how could I know the state of gaming in China.
8374000	8378000	I really don't want to make any claims to that, but it's one of those things like,
8378000	8380000	it was truly media fervor.
8380000	8390000	It wasn't technically, low barrier to entry, gaming, games, games from real life that we all know,
8390000	8394000	and you can do, you can put to use with less investment.
8394000	8397000	It was a lightning bolt.
8397000	8404000	You are not guaranteed the success if you give it to somebody else with cultural differences.
8404000	8406000	Bowling isn't a worldwide thing.
8406000	8408000	Soccer, you probably know.
8408000	8414000	I don't know. I just, like that term has a place that we use, not it, in my opinion.
8414000	8417000	Alright, well, we will see what happens.
8417000	8420000	I think we'll get more information of this at E3.
8420000	8421000	Maybe, maybe.
8421000	8426000	In the meantime, as far as the Wii U is concerned, you know, I mentioned that one of the other markets,
8426000	8431000	besides just the US, is Japan, and Japan, some information for what they're going to be getting Wii U-wise.
8431000	8436000	Bayonetta 2 and Hyrule Warriors set for summer debuts in Japan.
8436000	8441000	This surprised me. I figured Hyrule Warriors was probably a summer, like, early fall game,
8441000	8447000	but the fact that Bayonetta 2, it's fucking happening this year, OMG, and it might even be summer,
8447000	8449000	especially in Japan, that's pretty exciting to hear.
8449000	8454000	So, yeah, finally we'll get to see what this, you know, hype with Bayonetta 2 is all about,
8454000	8456000	because the first game was pretty awesome.
8456000	8463000	Of course, Bayonetta 2 bringing a two-player mode into the game, analog and touch-based controls,
8463000	8466000	and, of course, new hair for Bayonetta, very important.
8466000	8469000	Yeah, that's really exciting.
8469000	8478000	The only other Wii U games confirmed for this year for the West, those games, Mario Kart 8, Smash Brothers,
8478000	8483000	X by Monolith Soft, which I'm actually very curious about that one, that looks like it could be a winner as well,
8483000	8486000	and whatever else they announce at E3.
8486000	8492000	So I'm fully expecting at E3, we're going to get release dates for Bayonetta 2 and Hyrule Warriors here in the US.
8492000	8497000	That's pretty exciting, so some things to get excited about on the Wii U.
8497000	8500000	Is it going to be enough to really push sales of that system?
8500000	8505000	I don't know, I think another price cut would go a long way in helping that, but we shall see.
8505000	8511000	Meanwhile, Dark Soccer are going to talk about a game that should be on the Wii U, but probably won't.
8511000	8518000	That isn't. Alas, Minecraft, specifically the PS4 and Xbox One versions,
8518000	8522000	they are not going to have the infinite world size that the PC version does.
8522000	8528000	It will have borders. You will find the end of the world, and then you'll fall off of it.
8528000	8533000	Basically, they are constrained for size limits so that you can't...
8533000	8538000	I mean, they have bigger worlds than the PS3 and 360 versions,
8538000	8544000	but they still are limited because there's only so much memory, only so much space.
8544000	8546000	Not infinite.
8546000	8553000	People make a big deal about the PC worlds being infinite and so forth, but it's really infinite in theory.
8553000	8558000	You get the equivalent of a kill screen, where the data starts...
8558000	8562000	Yeah, at some point you're going to run out of server space.
8562000	8569000	It's going to be forever. You would be challenged to ever be able to run from one end of the world to the end.
8569000	8573000	Well, people do actually make that look up. I think it's called the Endlands.
8573000	8578000	It's a thing in Minecraft where people basically go until the game starts having corrupted data,
8578000	8583000	and the calculations won't apply anymore because they've already used up what they can.
8583000	8586000	Wow. Has anybody found that on the VoG server yet?
8586000	8588000	Everybody stays in one little area on the VoG server.
8588000	8590000	Everybody stays in one area, and also...
8590000	8596000	I tried to go out a ways when I built my house, and to come to find out, it really wasn't that far.
8596000	8598000	That's why you fly.
8598000	8601000	The other thing, too, is I occasionally...
8601000	8604000	Well, I don't anymore, because I haven't really messed with the server in a while,
8604000	8610000	but I'd occasionally cut all the area that's around...
8610000	8614000	Because I did that so that new terrain would generate, because when we upgraded,
8614000	8619000	there's new biomes and stuff that weren't generating, so I did that.
8619000	8623000	And so I clamped it all down to where we were just at.
8623000	8630000	So if some idiot goes straight for a long ways away, I'm just going to probably...
8630000	8635000	Unless there's some interesting stuff over there, I'm probably just going to erase that terrain and...
8635000	8636000	Clip it out, yeah.
8636000	8637000	Yeah.
8637000	8638000	Okay, fair enough.
8638000	8641000	It's really boring, though. There's not a lot of terrain that's interesting over there.
8641000	8643000	There's a lot of great stuff on the VoG server, though.
8643000	8646000	I know we haven't talked about it in a while, but there have been people working hard on there
8646000	8648000	to connect everything with trains everywhere.
8648000	8651000	Seattle said it best, the Farlands. That was it.
8651000	8655000	Well, yeah, the problem right now is when they upgraded Bucket,
8655000	8659000	it's because they've added all this new stuff now,
8659000	8662000	because they're giving you the ability where you're going to be able to change your username,
8662000	8667000	and so they're tied into IDs now, and so all the systems that are based off usernames are all broken,
8667000	8671000	and so it's just a big ol' mess. The whole infrastructure is kind of being rewritten,
8671000	8674000	so a lot of those plugins aren't available.
8674000	8676000	And I've spent all my time programming, so I haven't really messed with...
8677000	8681000	Because honestly, I looked at the server logs and there's nobody on there, so whatever.
8681000	8685000	How do you guys feel about the limited space on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?
8685000	8689000	I kind of feel that even though it's limited, it's going to be very hard to push the boundaries of it.
8689000	8693000	It's going to be a lot of space to work with. I don't think it's a big deal.
8693000	8699000	Well, they're saying it was because of save file limitations, so how big of a save file are we talking?
8699000	8702000	Because save files aren't normally that big, at least on consoles.
8703000	8708000	I would imagine, even with a couple megs, which some games have 30-meg save files.
8708000	8710000	I mean, they're huge, some of them.
8710000	8713000	I'm surprised you couldn't just make an exception. I mean, come on, it's Minecraft.
8713000	8717000	They're like, nope, nope, nope, sorry, we have this rule in place here that we can't do this.
8717000	8719000	We're not flexible at all.
8719000	8721000	It might have something to do with the RAM or something. I don't know.
8721000	8725000	But I'm pretty sure those save files are going to be able to be pretty big.
8725000	8729000	You know, I was just thinking. Remember when 30 megs were hard drive limits?
8729000	8731000	Yes, right?
8731000	8733000	When we moved out here, we had a 60-meg hard drive.
8733000	8739000	Yeah. My first PC had a 40-megabyte hard drive. Like, that couldn't even fit an episode of this show.
8739000	8746000	The day the gigabyte was standard, I was like, ahhh.
8746000	8748000	Exactly.
8748000	8751000	My first computer had a 0-megabyte hard drive.
8751000	8760000	My first computer, mine, it actually was in my bedroom. It had no hard drive and two 5.25-inch flash drives.
8760000	8767000	Yeah, I remember when those 5.25-inch disks could hold, what, 720 kilobytes?
8767000	8769000	And when you measured your hard drive by height?
8769000	8771000	Yeah.
8771000	8774000	I used to use a full-height hard drive as a paperweight.
8774000	8776000	We're reminiscing again. Let's go do more news.
8776000	8778000	Because we're old.
8778000	8780000	I know. Low-key.
8780000	8785000	Alright. So, this is kind of, I don't know.
8785000	8788000	Everyone's been kind of wondering since they announced Unreal Engine 4.
8788000	8791000	Hey, so when do we get in the next Unreal Tournament game?
8791000	8795000	Because it's been like, what, six years since Unreal Tournament came out?
8795000	8798000	Maybe even more than that.
8798000	8806000	So, now Epic is going to put out an Unreal Tournament game, but they're kind of going a different route with it.
8806000	8808000	They're actually making it open source.
8808000	8812000	And so, they're going to be creating the game.
8812000	8816000	It's going to be on, I want to say it was going to be on GitHub or something like that.
8817000	8819000	Oh, that was fun.
8819000	8822000	Well, maybe not GitHub. I don't know.
8822000	8824000	Oh, it is on GitHub.
8824000	8830000	But it's going to be available to the people that actually pay for the Unreal Engine.
8830000	8833000	I don't know if I trust those crazy people at GitHub anyway.
8837000	8839000	I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
8839000	8848000	And apparently, there's going to be discussion with people that work at Epic developing the game and fans of the game.
8848000	8853000	And you're actually going to be kind of helping mold how the game is.
8853000	8857000	And they're going to have Twitch streams showing stuff like that.
8857000	8866000	Also, like I said, all the code that's created during the development of the game will be available on GitHub if you're an Unreal Engine 4 developer.
8866000	8870000	So, you need to pay that $19.99 a month or whatever it is.
8870000	8874000	So, that's kind of neat.
8874000	8879000	And when the game does come out, it will be free to play.
8879000	8881000	Interesting.
8881000	8885000	I'm sorry. Yeah. And not free to play as in you buy stuff. It's free.
8885000	8888000	Which is a shocking...
8889000	8898000	I really don't want to do Unreal a disservice because they have been a mainstay for so many important things for as long as they have.
8898000	8900000	And so, I really...
8900000	8904000	Very specific, the point that I'm trying to make.
8904000	8908000	I've always considered Unreal to be kind of second.
8908000	8910000	More engine, less game.
8910000	8912000	Exactly as Loki just finished saying.
8912000	8914000	Unreal Tournament, not so prolific.
8914000	8918000	But the games that have been built on Unreal Engine, far and wide.
8918000	8922000	Phenomenal. That's where their strength is and they make a good game on top of it.
8922000	8928000	The fact that they're going in the same direction that Valve has with Steam.
8928000	8933000	Steamworks and mods for their game aren't new.
8933000	8939000	But items and all of these other community-driven things that generate interest, revenue for everybody.
8940000	8945000	It's the right choice for them. It's the way the gaming has gone.
8945000	8952000	It enables them to do new things and open up Unreal to plenty more players that may not have been able to play it in the past.
8952000	8957000	Not condescendingly, welcome to this generation.
8957000	8962000	It seems like they did it right. They're here. Everything that they've done has been interesting.
8962000	8968000	The pool of available, capable games has only gotten bigger and it's exciting.
8969000	8972000	Some comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
8972000	8976000	Dark Tetsuya says, not gonna lie, super stoked for the new, free Unreal Tournament.
8976000	8980000	Tiger Claw says, Unreal Tournament had a huge mod community behind it.
8980000	8984000	It's where you can download lots of custom maps, skins, and all sorts of mods for it.
8984000	8989000	SHG100Matt says, I still have Unreal Tournament 2004.
8989000	8992000	Still my favorite Unreal Tournament game and I still play it occasionally.
8992000	8995000	Live.vognetwork.com. Those comments.
8995000	9000000	Yeah, they recreated the whole end of Hypercube in Gary's mod.
9000000	9004000	Yeah, you mentioned that. Crazy. Mod communities are something else.
9004000	9006000	But I mean that in the nicest way.
9006000	9011000	Anyhow, let's move on. One community that's on hold for a little bit.
9011000	9016000	Need for Speed. After 13 years of a new Need for Speed every year.
9016000	9019000	Really? I didn't realize that. My god.
9019000	9022000	Well, they took a year off this year.
9022000	9029000	It will be back in 2015 and this news was broken during an EA conference call about earnings.
9029000	9034000	Ghost Games in Gothenburg is working on an innovative new chapter of the Storied franchise.
9034000	9040000	We've planned an extended development window to ensure we're delivering a high quality experience for Need for Speed players next year.
9040000	9043000	That quote from CEO Andrew Wilson.
9043000	9048000	So, no other reasons outside of that, but you know what? That's alright.
9048000	9051000	Take the time to get it right, folks. There's nothing wrong with that.
9051000	9054000	And I look forward to playing this new Need for Speed game.
9054000	9059000	So, alright. Let us take a moment to go to our email bag.
9059000	9061000	You know, every week you guys email us.
9061000	9065000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
9065000	9066000	Yeah, boy.
9066000	9069000	Oops. Not that one. Sorry about that.
9069000	9074000	This is the song that we use for the emails every week when you guys email us.
9074000	9080000	Dark Soccer's gonna dive into the mailbag head first and find some emails worthy of reading on tonight's program.
9080000	9082000	All one of them.
9082000	9083000	Just one?
9083000	9084000	Yeah.
9084000	9086000	Hey OrangeLounge PokeMasters.
9086000	9090000	Let's create our own Pokemon on this week's show.
9090000	9092000	With exclamation points.
9092000	9094000	What would your custom Pokemon look like?
9094000	9095000	What are his or her powers?
9095000	9097000	Example, fire, ice, electricity, etc.
9097000	9099000	Don't forget to name it.
9099000	9100000	Great show as always.
9100000	9101000	Keep gaming dudes and dudette.
9101000	9103000	EA skeezy.
9103000	9110000	I would have a dark type that would be female and based kind of off of a fox.
9110000	9111000	Kind of.
9111000	9114000	Named Bob.
9114000	9116000	I don't even know where to go with this question.
9116000	9121000	I would want a kitty named Sanrio.
9121000	9122000	Like my kitty.
9122000	9125000	Well, Alan's kitty, but mine by association.
9125000	9128000	Do you have a Pokemon you would have, Jason?
9128000	9132000	I don't have the imagination for this anymore.
9132000	9138000	It's really strange to say, but like I said earlier, I've owned maybe three of them.
9138000	9140000	And I really appreciate the universe.
9140000	9142000	It's interesting, it's beautiful, and I love what they continue to do.
9142000	9146000	But Jason would like a brain for his Pokemon.
9146000	9147000	That's it.
9147000	9149000	Jason's Pokemon is going to be Mother Brain.
9149000	9151000	I don't have the courage.
9151000	9152000	I need a heart.
9152000	9154000	I want to go home.
9154000	9159000	Jason's is going to be Mother Brain.
9159000	9161000	Well that makes that battle very interesting.
9161000	9163000	That was a great Facebook meme I saw, by the way.
9163000	9165000	Happy Mother's Day with Mother Brain.
9165000	9167000	Did you see the Cubone one?
9167000	9169000	I forgot what side it was, but someone said,
9169000	9172000	Cubone's having the worst Mother's Day ever.
9172000	9174000	Because Cubone wears his mother's skull.
9174000	9176000	Awful.
9176000	9178000	I think it was Geekology or something.
9178000	9180000	Loki, do you have a Pokemon in mind?
9180000	9182000	I don't fucking know anything about Pokemon.
9182000	9184000	I don't care.
9184000	9188000	We have to do our various shows as Pokemon.
9188000	9190000	Where we only say our names the entire show.
9191000	9194000	Rah rah!?
9196000	9198000	Thank you for the email.
9198000	9200000	Team America. World police to me.
9200000	9202000	No. We love the random questions.
9202000	9204000	If you have some random questions for us.
9204000	9206000	Participate at Orangelawandtrady.com
9206000	9208000	I would think with the new-
9208000	9210000	I'm a Digimon fan anyway.
9210000	9212000	I would think with the new stories we've had this week
9212000	9214000	You all have some things to say, so participate at Orangelawandtrady.com
9214000	9217000	Why did you just make crossed fingers at Dark Soccer
9217000	9219000	when she said she liked Digimon
9220000	9222000	You don't even know Pokemon anymore
9222000	9224000	I know Pokemon a hell of a lot more than I know Digimon
9224000	9227000	Did you ever watch any of the Japanese Digimon?
9227000	9228000	No, definitely not
9228000	9231000	Digimon Zero 2 is like the best anime in the universe
9231000	9232000	I'm just going to say this
9232000	9234000	This guy I dated once
9234000	9235000	This is years before Alan obviously
9235000	9238000	This guy I dated once had me watch the Digimon movie
9238000	9240000	I thought you said Disgaea
9240000	9242000	Needless to say it didn't work out
9242000	9244000	No no no no
9244000	9246000	We have to have you
9246000	9248000	Whomp whomp whomp
9248000	9250000	You need to watch it in Japanese
9250000	9251000	It's actually a true story
9251000	9253000	But anyway
9254000	9257000	I am disappointed Rob, my heart is break
9257000	9259000	I'm just giving you shit
9259000	9261000	Although that is a true story
9261000	9263000	But that wasn't the reason
9263000	9265000	I won't go into the reasons here on this show
9265000	9267000	Because I'm classy
9267000	9270000	Let's get into the FUs of the week
9270000	9272000	Speaking of classy
9272000	9274000	It's time for us to say fuck you
9274000	9276000	To things that are pissing us off
9276000	9278000	Why do we do this on a video game talk show?
9278000	9280000	It's called tradition, deal with it
9296000	9298000	Dark soccer
9298000	9300000	This one is private
9300000	9302000	I'm leaving it at that
9302000	9304000	I actually know I have another one
9304000	9306000	Fuck you to my grandmother's doctor
9306000	9308000	Who thinks that people give a shit that he used to play
9308000	9310000	For the University of Alabama football team
9310000	9312000	And isn't actually taking care of her needs
9312000	9314000	So fuck you
9314000	9317000	With a sandpapery giant three foot dildo
9317000	9318000	Ouch
9318000	9320000	Uh, Jason
9320000	9321000	You wanna follow that?
9321000	9322000	No
9322000	9324000	I don't wanna come anywhere close to that
9324000	9326000	Uh
9326000	9328000	FU to highway construction
9328000	9330000	Oh god
9330000	9332000	Oh yeah
9332000	9334000	Oh you had to come through highway 50 to get here didn't you
9334000	9335000	Yup
9335000	9336000	Oh you poor bastard
9336000	9337000	You didn't warn me
9337000	9339000	That's my drive home from work every day
9339000	9341000	I forgot
9341000	9342000	It wasn't that bad
9342000	9344000	The good news is you don't have to go through it all the way back
9344000	9346000	Eh, I got more traffic in Berkeley
9346000	9348000	Shocking me on the way out here than that
9348000	9349000	Whatever, minor driver
9349000	9351000	I'm enjoying my time in San Francisco
9351000	9352000	Thank you France
9352000	9353000	Low key
9353000	9355000	I'm not a big fan of cyclists
9355000	9358000	And I'm really not a big fan of cyclists racing
9358000	9361000	And the fact that you know
9361000	9363000	They're shutting down Folsom
9363000	9365000	At least most of Folsom
9365000	9367000	For a fucking bike race
9367000	9369000	Yes we could have done this on the weekend
9369000	9371000	But no fuck you guys we're gonna do it on a Monday
9371000	9373000	And we're gonna shut down most of you know
9373000	9375000	The part that people actually drive through
9375000	9377000	Oh and it's gonna be during business hours
9377000	9379000	Wait they're shutting down Folsom on Monday?
9379000	9381000	Yeah they're shutting down like a good section
9381000	9383000	Of like Folsom Boulevard and stuff like that
9383000	9385000	So it's just like
9385000	9387000	I fucking hate you guys
9387000	9389000	So much
9389000	9391000	And now you know it's now they're doing it
9391000	9393000	Thankfully I don't
9393000	9395000	I'm not going to work right now so it's not a big deal
9395000	9397000	I just don't drive through Folsom that day
9397000	9399000	But you know it's still fucking annoying
9399000	9401000	I have to see if that's gonna impact my work tomorrow
9401000	9403000	I was just about to give an FU to the fact
9403000	9405000	I have to be up and in work early tomorrow
9405000	9407000	But now I'm worried about this
9407000	9409000	Stupid thing that Low key's talking about
9409000	9411000	Well it's just in like old Folsom
9411000	9413000	So I don't think it is
9413000	9415000	As long as it doesn't stretch out to
9415000	9417000	Rancho Cordova
9418000	9420000	Alright
9420000	9422000	Then in that case
9422000	9424000	My FU of the week would go to
9424000	9426000	I don't know I guess things have been
9426000	9428000	Mostly well this week
9428000	9430000	I've actually had a pretty good week all things considered
9430000	9432000	So my FU of the week would go to
9432000	9434000	Just the fact that
9434000	9436000	The year is going by so fast
9436000	9438000	Where did it go?
9438000	9440000	I know it's May 11th
9440000	9442000	It's crazy
9442000	9444000	Alright
9444000	9446000	FU to the fact that frappy hour is over
9447000	9449000	It's actually probably a good thing
9449000	9451000	Those things are a lot of calories
9451000	9453000	Alright that's it for the FU of the week
9453000	9455000	Just a couple more stories for you guys
9455000	9457000	And then we're going to open up the phones
9457000	9459000	At 1877 Game OLR
9459000	9461000	Our username on skype
9461000	9463000	Orange Lounge Radio
9463000	9465000	But a few more stories for you guys
9465000	9467000	I saw this news and I kind of giggled
9467000	9469000	Because I was like
9469000	9471000	Damn
9471000	9473000	But yes Elder Scrolls Online has been delayed
9473000	9475000	On consoles
9475000	9477000	Six months later
9477000	9479000	So uh
9479000	9481000	That's gotta suck
9481000	9483000	Considering that I don't think that MMO's
9483000	9485000	Done too well as far as like people being
9485000	9487000	Impressed by it or anything
9487000	9489000	The fact that now the
9489000	9491000	Console versions aren't coming out until
9491000	9493000	November or December
9493000	9495000	That's gotta hurt
9495000	9497000	Especially now that they're coming out instead of a dead period
9497000	9499000	Of releases it's
9499000	9501000	In the middle of the fucking 4th quarter
9501000	9503000	When no one's going to give a shit about your fucking game
9504000	9506000	That can have positives and negatives
9506000	9508000	Because it could come up on Christmas lists
9508000	9510000	And so forth
9510000	9512000	But Bethesda probably would have another game coming out
9512000	9514000	And it's either going to be maybe like
9514000	9516000	Doom 4 or a new Fallout game
9516000	9518000	So who's going to give a fuck about an Elder Scrolls Online game
9518000	9520000	Eh we'll see
9520000	9522000	I don't know
9522000	9524000	Unless it's Dishonored 2 maybe
9524000	9526000	I agree that the reception of uh
9526000	9528000	Prey 2 finally
9528000	9530000	I agree the reception of Elder Scrolls Online
9530000	9532000	Hasn't been the greatest
9532000	9534000	I know we're really into it but
9534000	9536000	It does seem like the other MMO's out there
9536000	9538000	Kind of eclipse it like nobody's really
9538000	9540000	Going after Elder Scrolls the hardest
9540000	9542000	People are playing it because WoW's boring right now
9542000	9544000	Or because WildStar's not out yet
9544000	9546000	You know I kind of fear for Elder Scrolls
9546000	9548000	Once everything else kind of gets up and going
9548000	9550000	But we'll see
9550000	9552000	It's not like there's not going to be
9552000	9554000	New MMO's coming out
9554000	9556000	Like there's going to be this game that's coming out from
9556000	9558000	I don't know just some no name company
9558000	9560000	Named Bungie that's
9560000	9562000	You know Destiny and
9562000	9564000	Oh I'm sure that game will affect the
9564000	9566000	Sales of that at all
9566000	9568000	Dungeon Buster in chat says
9568000	9570000	Delayed hopefully to fix all the broken
9570000	9572000	Stuff that should have been fixed in the beta
9572000	9574000	Welcome to the wide wonderful world of
9574000	9576000	Online games where they never work
9576000	9578000	To be fair though
9578000	9580000	It is an Elder Scrolls title so
9580000	9582000	A vast majority of bugs
9582000	9584000	Are to be expected usually with hilarious
9584000	9586000	Results but you know it is an MMO
9586000	9588000	Correct yeah and an MMO though
9588000	9590000	Things are different it's one thing to screw up your world
9590000	9592000	It's one thing to another to screw up everybody else's
9592000	9594000	Anyhow
9594000	9596000	Some news on Disney
9596000	9598000	Infinity which yes Disney
9598000	9600000	Infinity there of course there's the new ones
9600000	9602000	Coming out and it is a success
9602000	9604000	How much of a success?
9604000	9606000	Well Disney Interactive's decision
9606000	9608000	Had revenues increase 38%
9608000	9610000	During the second quarter
9610000	9612000	This means they have an operating income
9612000	9614000	Of 14 million this compared to a
9614000	9616000	54 million lost last
9616000	9618000	Year this business grew quote
9618000	9620000	Driven by the strength of Disney Infinity
9620000	9622000	And there's also growth in Japanese
9622000	9624000	Mobile markets
9624000	9626000	Unfortunately this isn't
9626000	9628000	All good news because they also
9628000	9630000	Had to cut 26% of the staff
9630000	9632000	And a 50% reduction in game
9632000	9634000	Development so they didn't just get
9634000	9636000	Those numbers at the strength of the game
9636000	9638000	Because they're not developing any other games other than
9638000	9640000	Disney Infinity yeah that's kind of the
9640000	9642000	Well I think that there's some mobile
9642000	9644000	Stuff too but yeah it's not quite
9644000	9646000	What it used to be so yeah Disney
9646000	9648000	Infinity sales over 3
9648000	9650000	Million starter packs and an
9650000	9652000	Estimated 500 million in global retail
9652000	9654000	Sales to date Disney
9654000	9656000	Infinity 2.0 this
9656000	9658000	September of course with the Marvel characters
9658000	9660000	Well yeah and then here's the other thing too
9660000	9662000	That Disney's doing why they
9662000	9664000	Probably laid off people is that
9664000	9666000	They are now outsourcing
9666000	9668000	Their games to be developed
9668000	9670000	You know for their movie titles
9670000	9672000	So like for example
9672000	9674000	They're not developing
9674000	9676000	Disney planes the sequel game
9676000	9678000	That's coming out the Disney planes 2
9678000	9680000	Or whatever Majesco's doing that now
9680000	9682000	Or I
9682000	9684000	Want to say like Tangled had like a
9684000	9686000	Third party doing that one
9686000	9688000	Harmonix is doing that Disney
9688000	9690000	Fantasia eventually
9690000	9692000	Someday yeah
9692000	9694000	I wish it was sooner than later but
9694000	9696000	Things happen
9696000	9698000	So well I mean
9698000	9700000	I'm glad to hear you know I'd like to
9700000	9702000	Hear about profitability in the gaming industry
9702000	9704000	Although I'm a little sad it
9704000	9706000	Came at the loss of jobs but
9706000	9708000	Hopefully it will lead to
9708000	9710000	Job creation in a year or two
9710000	9712000	So that would be some good news
9712000	9714000	Speaking of good news I
9714000	9716000	Can't think of a better thing to end
9716000	9718000	The show on than talk about
9718000	9720000	Free games right Dark Sakura? Yep
9720000	9722000	Plants vs Zombies is free on Origin this month
9722000	9724000	Go get it Well that's good
9724000	9726000	And bad news Bad
9726000	9728000	You have to get Origin good
9728000	9730000	Brains I don't know it wasn't so bad
9730000	9732000	I got it for the Titanfall thing
9732000	9734000	And you know it hasn't eaten my computer live
9734000	9736000	So whatever The good news about
9736000	9738000	All that despite all the shit we've given Origin
9738000	9740000	Over the years it has gotten
9740000	9742000	Better you know it's still
9742000	9744000	Kind of I don't think you really need it but
9744000	9746000	It's not quite the pain in the
9746000	9748000	Ass it used to be so
9748000	9750000	I'll pick up free games on it I'm not gonna
9750000	9752000	Buy games on it but I'll pick up
9752000	9754000	Free games Well actually I got
9754000	9756000	Dead Space for free on there too
9757000	9759000	I got Dead Space a long ass time ago for free
9759000	9761000	They've been giving away
9761000	9763000	They've been trying to entice people to come to Origin
9763000	9765000	By giving away free games in their catalog
9765000	9767000	So hey I'm not gonna complain
9767000	9769000	I got Populous for free too
9769000	9771000	I have quite the library there
9771000	9773000	Free games that they put out every now and then
9773000	9775000	I haven't played any of them but hey
9775000	9777000	What else is new? Steam
9777000	9779000	See but then you get that client on your desktop
9779000	9781000	And then good old games
9781000	9783000	Come out of nowhere and says hey we've got
9783000	9785000	Covert action available for five bucks
9785000	9787000	You know that Sid Myers game that you're like the only
9787000	9789000	Person on the planet that likes it Rob
9789000	9791000	So I had to buy it
9791000	9793000	I had to buy it it's covert action

9795000	9797000	And I don't know
9797000	9799000	Maybe I'll end up getting Titanfall
9799000	9801000	Too cause I kinda want it
9801000	9803000	But I'm trying to hold out for a sale
9803000	9805000	Trying really hard
9805000	9807000	We'll see Just wait
9807000	9809000	I'm trying Loki I'm trying
9809000	9811000	It's difficult
9811000	9813000	Alright that is it for our
9813000	9815000	Stories tonight but we are
9815000	9817000	Gonna go to the phones
9817000	9819000	The Skype line is open
9819000	9821000	1877 game OLR or a username on Skype
9821000	9823000	Orange Lounge Radio if you wanna give us a call to talk about
9823000	9825000	Anything we've talked about tonight
9825000	9827000	Or possibly something else
9827000	9829000	Maybe there's a story we didn't hit that you wanna talk about
9829000	9831000	Go ahead and give us a call right now
9831000	9833000	While we wait for some calls to come in
9833000	9835000	With a delay I'll ask Loki if there's any
9835000	9837000	Last minute stories and I'm gonna bring up our
9837000	9839000	Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR
9839000	9841000	Well real quickly we talked about a really
9841000	9843000	Expensive HD NES
9843000	9845000	Console that was supposed to be coming out
9845000	9847000	Yes
9847000	9849000	So now they're finally selling it
9849000	9851000	It's $500
9851000	9853000	And it will up- $599
9853000	9855000	US dollars
9855000	9857000	$599 US dollars
9857000	9859000	And it will up scale games to 1080p
9859000	9861000	Your old
9861000	9863000	Nintendo classics in 1080p
9863000	9865000	Of course you have to buy
9865000	9867000	Controllers if you don't have controllers
9867000	9869000	And it's
9869000	9871000	One solid piece of aluminum but
9871000	9873000	Fuck that
9873000	9875000	I don't need it to up scale that
9875000	9877000	And I think if you even
9877000	9879000	If you bought an NES and bought an
9879000	9881000	Upscaler it would probably be way
9881000	9883000	Cheaper than buying this thing so
9883000	9885000	I don't know
9885000	9887000	Some people
9887000	9889000	And just as reliable as it was back in the day
9889000	9891000	Do I have to blow in the cartridges to get them to work
9891000	9893000	For that authentic feel
9893000	9895000	Yeah actually you would probably
9895000	9897000	It's those cartridges still
9897000	9899000	Going to our Twitter
9899000	9901000	Twitter.com slash OLR
9901000	9903000	Some interesting tweets coming in
9903000	9905000	SSG100Matt sends a tweet
9905000	9907000	This is sure to be polarizing
9907000	9909000	But I'm going to read it
9909000	9911000	SSG100Matt sends a tweet that says
9911000	9913000	According to a study and survey
9913000	9915000	This is from Reason.com
9915000	9917000	More gamers politically align themselves with libertarian
9917000	9919000	I'm not super
9919000	9921000	Even though that's not where I personally necessarily go
9921000	9923000	I'm not super surprised to hear that
9923000	9925000	Could that potentially be because
9925000	9927000	Whenever we talk about these politics
9927000	9929000	About violent video games
9929000	9931000	They're trying to ban them
9931000	9933000	Does it drive people away from the two parties
9933000	9935000	That everybody talks about most of all
9935000	9937000	Well the two party system is shit anyway
9937000	9939000	So maybe people are actually just getting smart
9939000	9941000	You think?
9941000	9943000	Although I am actually turning my interest
9943000	9945000	Toward the after party
9945000	9947000	That's real
9947000	9949000	That's basically what's evolved out of the Occupy movement
9949000	9951000	Interesting
9951000	9953000	As long as it's not
9953000	9955000	A pee party
9955000	9957000	Anyway
9957000	9959000	Let's go to the phones
9959000	9961000	We do have a call coming in
9961000	9963000	Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio who's this?
9963000	9965000	It's the one and only Ronma
9965000	9967000	How is everybody in the studio tonight?
9967000	9969000	It would just not be Orange Lawns Radio without Ronma calling in
9969000	9971000	What's up buddy? We're doing great
9971000	9973000	We had a great interview tonight
9973000	9975000	And Jason's here, it's a full house tonight
9975000	9977000	We have 25 devices on the internet
9977000	9979000	It's great
9979000	9981000	Well there's 5 more devices I have wired up right now
9981000	9983000	Not much, couple of quick things
9983000	9985000	Number 1, I meant to mention last week
9985000	9987000	Where you were talking about that
9987000	9989000	Waffle place in New York City that we took you to
9989000	9991000	Yes
9991000	9993000	It was called Waffle and Dingles I believe
9993000	9995000	I think that's the name of it but the place is so good
9995000	9997000	So good, still there?
9997000	9999000	Yes, yes it is
9999000	10001000	So there's a possibility
10001000	10003000	I will be in New York very soon
10003000	10005000	We're going for Poutine
10005000	10007000	Gee I wonder what announcement this is related to
10007000	10009000	Because we may also go a weekend without a show
10013000	10015000	Potentially yes
10015000	10017000	I will know next week
10017000	10019000	Stay tuned
10019000	10021000	Rob you don't have to worry about not doing a show
10021000	10023000	I have a small studio here
10023000	10025000	We will jury rig something
10025000	10027000	We'll do an
10027000	10029000	OLR Unauthorized or something
10029000	10031000	There you go
10031000	10033000	Yeah there's a lot of interesting things that could be coming up
10033000	10035000	I don't want to say too much
10035000	10037000	But I will know for sure in 7 days
10037000	10039000	You can call it Marmalade Radio
10039000	10041000	Because it's Orange Jam
10041000	10043000	Tune in for next week's show
10043000	10045000	I'll definitely tune in for next week
10045000	10047000	The second thing
10047000	10049000	Not gaming related
10049000	10051000	Something I meant to ask you
10051000	10053000	I don't remember if I did
10053000	10055000	How do you feel knowing
10055000	10057000	That there's going to be Dunkin Donuts
10057000	10059000	In your neighborhood and if it's already there
10059000	10061000	Have you been there yet?
10061000	10063000	I'm so fucking excited I'm shaking and crying and screaming and convulsing
10063000	10065000	I'm just like
10065000	10067000	You guys don't understand
10067000	10069000	I know the rest of the US probably looks at me and goes
10069000	10071000	It's just Dunkin Donuts
10071000	10073000	Fucking shut up
10073000	10075000	Live in California and have no Dunkin Donuts
10075000	10077000	People even ask me
10077000	10079000	Where do you get donuts if you don't have Dunkin Donuts?
10079000	10081000	And I go
10081000	10083000	That's a great question
10083000	10085000	I want to see Tim Hortons
10085000	10087000	Yes
10087000	10089000	But for the record the grocery store and there's lots of mom and pop stores
10089000	10091000	There's no Winchells anymore
10091000	10093000	There's Winchells in LA
10093000	10095000	One Krispy Kreme
10095000	10097000	Actually I've found four Krispy Kremes in town
10097000	10099000	In the area
10099000	10101000	There's a couple in Roseville and one in Atomas
10101000	10103000	Everybody finally got off Atkins
10103000	10105000	But anyway
10105000	10107000	As far as Dunkin Donuts goes
10107000	10109000	There is one in California now
10109000	10111000	And I haven't been there yet
10111000	10113000	Because it's in Barstow
10113000	10115000	Barstow is between Los Angeles and Las Vegas
10115000	10117000	Known as Death Valley
10117000	10119000	Um
10119000	10121000	Yeah
10121000	10123000	So I'm not going there to get a coffee
10123000	10125000	However it is coming to
10125000	10127000	Our neck of the woods
10127000	10129000	I think they said 2015
10129000	10131000	So I think we're going to start seeing them next year
10131000	10133000	Which I'm excited
10133000	10135000	Their coffee is so flipping good
10135000	10137000	I have a reason I don't care
10137000	10139000	So terrible for you
10139000	10141000	I am not going to care because I can't
10141000	10143000	So you still need me to ship you
10143000	10145000	A few batches of coffee
10145000	10147000	I would love that
10147000	10149000	Yeah however we can get the K cups
10149000	10151000	But I'm going to be honest the K cups are not
10151000	10153000	Even as good as the real thing
10153000	10155000	We also can get the bags of coffee
10155000	10157000	Yeah I think there's better K cups out there
10157000	10159000	I thought it was really horrible when they had like apple
10159000	10161000	Whatever flavored fucking coffee
10161000	10163000	I was like what the hell were they eating but the coconut was really good
10163000	10165000	It does not compare to
10165000	10167000	That drink that they give you
10167000	10169000	That's like a little bit of coffee and then
10169000	10171000	Creamer and sugar
10171000	10173000	Amazing
10173000	10175000	Anyway
10175000	10177000	I guess you could bring the discussion on our video game show
10177000	10179000	To food but you know what donuts
10179000	10181000	Are a great
10181000	10183000	Great snack to game too
10183000	10185000	Not healthy but
10185000	10187000	Unless you're me you sit there and you
10187000	10189000	Make a batch of popcorn and you sit there and you
10189000	10191000	Eat it while you're playing Kingdom Hearts 1.5
10191000	10193000	Remix
10193000	10195000	Yeah something like that I'll usually play
10195000	10197000	Final Fantasy 14
10197000	10199000	And sob quietly to myself
10199000	10201000	Into my bowl of potato chips
10201000	10203000	But you know
10203000	10205000	Alright anything else you want to talk about tonight
10205000	10207000	Last thing I'm getting out of here
10207000	10209000	So yesterday I picked up my
10209000	10211000	Glorious Playstation 3 from the shop
10211000	10213000	And the guy told me that
10213000	10215000	It's working
10215000	10217000	I had it burn in for about 4 hours
10217000	10219000	So you're good to go
10219000	10221000	But I recommend getting a new one cause this one's going to
10221000	10223000	Die on you, may die on you soon
10223000	10225000	He pretty much told me don't use it for
10225000	10227000	Streaming of anything
10227000	10229000	Play a couple of games on it
10229000	10231000	Movies but don't use it
10231000	10233000	As a streaming device
10233000	10235000	He's like get an Apple TV and I'm like
10235000	10237000	What?
10237000	10239000	Was there a reasoning behind that?
10239000	10241000	Well
10241000	10243000	I took my PS3 in the first time because
10243000	10245000	When I was watching my Ronlef Blu-rays
10245000	10247000	It would lock up after about 10 minutes
10247000	10249000	And then
10249000	10251000	It would not read Blu-rays
10251000	10253000	Now it's working fine. The guy told me
10253000	10255000	I brought it in just in time before it started to
10255000	10257000	To yellow light out
10257000	10259000	He pretty much said he had to disassemble it
10259000	10261000	Clean all the thermal paste off
10261000	10263000	Put fresh thermal paste on it, reassemble it
10263000	10265000	And get it up and running
10265000	10267000	Wow
10267000	10269000	He said that the Playstation 3's were never designed for streaming
10269000	10271000	And I'm like
10271000	10273000	I've been streaming on this device for maybe about
10273000	10275000	2-3 years and I haven't had an issue with it
10275000	10277000	Maybe you should just flip it upside down
10277000	10279000	Like we used to do with the Playstation 2's
10279000	10281000	I fixed everything
10281000	10283000	We used to put them on their side
10283000	10285000	With my PS1
10285000	10287000	That's what I did
10287000	10289000	When this first started acting up I flipped it
10289000	10291000	Horizontal, vertical
10291000	10293000	I'm like, okay, let's see if it works
10293000	10295000	Still nothing
10295000	10297000	I always thought mine was going to be full of cat hair
10297000	10299000	Because it was like super hot
10299000	10301000	Heat coming out of that thing
10301000	10303000	And I took it apart and it was actually completely clean
10303000	10305000	If that Playstation 3 gets hot enough
10305000	10307000	Perfect for grilling chicken
10307000	10309000	Mmm, if I ever had one
10309000	10311000	It knows
10311000	10313000	And I remember
10313000	10315000	When you get the PS2's
10315000	10317000	Don't use it for playing DVD's
10317000	10319000	The drive was not designed for normal DVD's
10319000	10321000	Spinning, I'm like, well, let me go out and drop
10321000	10323000	50 bucks on a DVD player, you know
10323000	10325000	We used ours for years
10325000	10327000	Most of America used theirs for DVD players
10327000	10329000	That's why that thing sold so well
10329000	10331000	I don't understand how a DVD drive isn't used
10331000	10333000	For DVD's
10333000	10335000	You know how it is, somebody says something
10335000	10337000	And everybody follows along with it
10337000	10339000	But I think it was more of a heat issue
10339000	10341000	Because when I moved it to this new place
10341000	10343000	My PS3 sits on a little platform
10343000	10345000	Under the table
10345000	10347000	It's getting intercooler
10347000	10349000	I mean, my friend had a friend who had an uncle
10349000	10351000	Who told me that, you know, they buried
10351000	10353000	ET in the desert in the middle of New Mexico
10353000	10355000	So
10355000	10357000	And lo and behold
10357000	10359000	Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go to get more calls
10359000	10361000	But thanks so much for the call, buddy
10361000	10363000	Uh oh
10363000	10365000	Internet connection problem
10365000	10367000	We're losing Rama anyway
10367000	10369000	So thanks for calling, Rama
10369000	10371000	If you hear this and your internet didn't cut out
10371000	10373000	Boy, that was weird
10373000	10375000	Oddly timed
10375000	10377000	Alright, we're still connected
10377000	10379000	It looks like
10379000	10381000	So I'm hoping we're not having those same issues that we were having earlier
10381000	10383000	Rama's problem
10383000	10385000	Northeast problems
10385000	10387000	Oh look, and Rama just left IRC
10387000	10389000	So that's, well, there you go
10389000	10391000	He had to make an exit
10391000	10393000	He was just like, I'm out of here, bye
10393000	10395000	He was all, fuck it, pull the cord
10395000	10397000	Yeah, he just said, fuck it, and pulled the plug
10397000	10399000	But we do have another call coming in
10399000	10401000	Hey, one man's loss is another man's gain
10401000	10403000	Let's get to it, hi, we're just launching
10403000	10405000	Who is it?
10405000	10407000	Hey, you're lucky
10407000	10409000	That Rama just pulled the plug out of anger
10409000	10411000	Or something
10411000	10413000	What's up, buddy?
10413000	10415000	Well, I could talk about
10415000	10417000	A lot of stuff that happened
10417000	10419000	During the week and especially on Twitter
10419000	10421000	But I want to talk about
10421000	10423000	Team Fortress 2
10423000	10425000	Don't know why
10425000	10427000	Can we talk about Kirby Triple Deluxe
10428000	10430000	And you're gonna have to come up here and kick her butt
10430000	10432000	And by kick her butt, meaning give her a hug
10432000	10434000	And go out for Mexican food together
10434000	10436000	Wait, wait, wait, wait
10436000	10438000	Dark Sakura hates Kirby Triple Deluxe?
10438000	10440000	Not really
10440000	10442000	I haven't played it yet
10442000	10444000	It was a joke earlier in the show
10444000	10446000	Yeah, me neither
10446000	10448000	FedEx screwed up my order
10448000	10450000	It pretty much got lost
10450000	10452000	And I have to wait until Wednesday
10452000	10454000	To report it back to Amazon
10454000	10456000	And say it got lost
10457000	10459000	I'm kind of sad
10459000	10461000	I would be playing
10461000	10463000	I would be talking right now about Kirby
10463000	10465000	I am surprised you are not over there right now
10465000	10467000	Beating down the door
10467000	10469000	Showing your anger
10469000	10471000	It's very reserved of you
10471000	10473000	Anyway, I'm sorry
10473000	10475000	That's not what you called in to talk about
10475000	10477000	What did you want to talk about?
10477000	10479000	You want to talk about Team Fortress 2?
10479000	10481000	Yeah, basically
10481000	10483000	I got back into Team Fortress 2
10483000	10485000	After months of not playing
10486000	10488000	And still the game is pretty much the same
10488000	10490000	It hasn't changed that much
10490000	10492000	At least from what I've noticed
10492000	10494000	Aside from new hats
10494000	10496000	And some new stuff for the weapons
10496000	10498000	But
10498000	10500000	I don't know
10500000	10502000	I found a new enjoyment on it again
10502000	10504000	And pretty much
10504000	10506000	Where I'm going
10506000	10508000	Is if you have
10508000	10510000	Played a game recently
10510000	10512000	Or maybe not recently
10512000	10514000	But
10514000	10516000	That's a reason
10516000	10518000	That you haven't played
10518000	10520000	For many months or many years
10520000	10522000	Before
10522000	10524000	I actually do have an answer to this
10524000	10526000	But you guys are going to roll your eyes so hard
10526000	10528000	You can see your fucking brain
10528000	10530000	But it's my honest to god answer
10530000	10532000	And that is because I had the new computer
10532000	10534000	And all the new graphics and everything
10534000	10536000	The one game I had to go back and see
10536000	10538000	Was Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
10538000	10540000	And play that again
10540000	10542000	I totally did do that this week too
10543000	10545000	It was so sexy
10545000	10547000	The graphics were about the same
10547000	10549000	Because Mass Effect 3 was only set for a certain bench level of graphics
10549000	10551000	And I wasn't using HD textures or anything
10551000	10554000	So not to be all Jamie about my gaming week
10558000	10560000	But I definitely played some Mass Effect 3 multiplayer
10560000	10562000	And that was a sexy thing to revisit
10562000	10564000	I'm trying to think
10564000	10566000	Because I've had the new computer
10566000	10568000	There's been other things I've been revisiting too
10568000	10570000	Getting to go back and play
10570000	10572000	Some of the games I've had
10572000	10574000	Diablo and stuff was pretty cool too
10574000	10576000	But what about you guys?
10576000	10578000	Is there a game?
10578000	10580000	You've played for the first time in a very long time
10580000	10582000	You just kind of went back and revisited
10582000	10584000	It wasn't a long time
10584000	10586000	But I've had the conversation a couple times
10586000	10588000	About comparing Titanfall on the 360
10588000	10590000	Versus the Xbox One
10590000	10592000	And they're not terribly different
10592000	10594000	I think more of the differences that I see
10594000	10596000	Are the fact that I sit closer to the TV
10596000	10598000	At work than I do at home
10598000	10600000	And I think it may have those
10600000	10602000	120, 240 hertz features on
10602000	10604000	And not on game mode
10604000	10606000	Flat 60, etc.
10606000	10608000	I played
10608000	10610000	I don't know if this actually counts
10610000	10612000	But I did download Jetmoto 2
10612000	10614000	Onto my PSP
10614000	10616000	Not Vita
10616000	10618000	Onto my PSP
10618000	10620000	The other day
10620000	10622000	I bought it a while back
10622000	10624000	Graphically I don't remember anything
10624000	10626000	But not having all of the shoulder buttons
10626000	10628000	Completely fucks that game up
10628000	10630000	Because the R1, L1, and R2, L2
10630000	10632000	Do very distinct things
10632000	10634000	I really wish they'd bring that game series back
10634000	10636000	Jetmoto?
10636000	10638000	I saw what they did with 3 though
10638000	10640000	I played Fairy Solitaire
10640000	10642000	Fairy Solitaire?
10642000	10644000	Can't get it old school
10644000	10646000	I was bored
10646000	10648000	So I played Fairy Solitaire
10648000	10650000	Especially when you have some of those free games
10650000	10652000	I played Portal 2 not that long ago
10652000	10654000	And that was the first time since probably the game came out
10654000	10656000	It was kind of fun to relive that one
10656000	10658000	I should just give you my Portal 2 shirt that I don't wear
10658000	10660000	Cool, free clothes
10660000	10662000	I played
10662000	10664000	While I was restocking my 360
10664000	10666000	I downloaded and played Discs of Tron
10666000	10668000	That didn't look any different
10668000	10670000	My 360 hasn't been hooked up for like 6 months
10670000	10672000	I had so many downloadable games it was disgusting
10672000	10674000	So I should plug that in and play some of that old school stuff
10674000	10676000	I did have the Tron
10676000	10678000	They released that
10678000	10680000	The arcade Tron
10680000	10682000	4 minigames
10682000	10684000	The Overworld is a game
10684000	10686000	Although it's not
10686000	10688000	I can travel in 4 directions
10688000	10690000	Hey in the 80's that was modern stuff
10690000	10692000	Well there you go Act Deaf
10692000	10694000	There's some of our walks down memory lane
10694000	10696000	Yeah those are pretty cool games
10696000	10698000	Especially like Portal
10698000	10702000	It's a game I usually try to play at least a few times a year
10702000	10706000	Even I played Portal the first one a few weeks ago
10706000	10708000	I did a stream on it too
10708000	10710000	Good times
10710000	10712000	Good times
10712000	10714000	When these companies give away games for free
10714000	10716000	Even though they might be a few years old
10716000	10718000	They're always worth picking up
10718000	10720000	Let's say Plants vs Zombies being given away free
10720000	10722000	Right now on Origin
10722000	10724000	As long as you're cool and have an Origin on your computer
10724000	10726000	Most of you probably already have it
10726000	10728000	I would say go grab it while it's free
10728000	10730000	Because maybe you haven't played Plants vs Zombies
10730000	10732000	Since it was first out on the
10732000	10734000	IOS or Android devices
10734000	10736000	Or when it was first out on Xbox 360
10736000	10738000	It might be a whole different experience on PC
10739000	10741000	Definitely worth picking up
10741000	10743000	Especially if you don't have it
10743000	10745000	Because it's a really great game
10745000	10747000	Absolutely
10747000	10749000	I already have it on Steam
10749000	10751000	Act Deaf I'm going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls
10751000	10753000	Thank you very much for the call
10753000	10755000	Good question trip down memory lane
10755000	10757000	Hey thanks for having me
10757000	10759000	And I hope you get your copy of Kirby already
10759000	10761000	I can't have Kirby's number one fan here on OLR
10761000	10763000	Being robbed of his Kirby
10763000	10765000	It's not cool
10765000	10767000	It's sad
10767000	10769000	Oh FedEx we're coming after them too if they don't get it worked out
10769000	10771000	Alright
10771000	10773000	Take care
10773000	10775000	Alright
10775000	10777000	1877 Game OLR or username on Skype
10777000	10779000	OrangeLoungeRadio
10779000	10781000	We can probably squeeze in one more call if someone can get in here pretty quick
10781000	10783000	DarkTetsuya sends us a note that Fistful of Potions
10783000	10785000	Was taping from a comic shop during free comic book day
10785000	10787000	That was last week
10787000	10789000	But yes I read that one last week
10789000	10791000	That was during the
10791000	10793000	Wait did you?
10793000	10795000	If they tweet during the show I usually get to it
10796000	10798000	Jason if you let me do my segment
10798000	10800000	I'm just kidding
10800000	10802000	Well we are being invited to Concord Ontario
10802000	10804000	Being a Catholic school board trustee
10804000	10806000	What the hell is that?
10806000	10808000	We get all these random ass tweets that are like
10808000	10810000	Oh I went to church and I saw the
10810000	10812000	OLR and I'm like what the fuck is this
10812000	10814000	I've been trying to figure out who they are
10814000	10816000	I don't know who OLR is
10816000	10818000	It's a church I just don't remember what it was
10818000	10820000	I remember seeing that one time
10820000	10822000	Probably Ontario something
10822000	10824000	That's fine
10825000	10827000	But it just cracks me up
10827000	10829000	Because I'll see these random tweets
10829000	10831000	It's like somebody tweeting god dammit
10831000	10833000	I heard you talking shit about me on air
10833000	10835000	That was an actual tweet from Gemet this week
10835000	10837000	Or hey read only memories
10837000	10839000	Is on Steam Greenlight
10839000	10841000	Like Reddertainment tweeted us which is true
10841000	10843000	And then it'll be like oh the worship this Sunday
10843000	10845000	Was so good
10845000	10847000	It's Our Lady of Rosary Church
10847000	10849000	In Union City
10849000	10851000	Thank you
10851000	10853000	It's like my story that I've told
10853000	10855000	My coworker who has the Twitter name Dice
10855000	10857000	And he retweets
10857000	10859000	Everybody who bitches at him
10859000	10861000	For Battlefield
10861000	10864000	There's one it's www.OLR.net
10864000	10866000	And then
10866000	10868000	OLRSD.org
10868000	10870000	For the San Diego one
10870000	10872000	I think it's just a church there
10872000	10874000	Who owns OLR.com
10874000	10876000	Online residential New York source for real estate
10876000	10878000	Listings
10878000	10880000	I looked into that some time ago
10880000	10882000	But you know whatever
10882000	10884000	Anyway
10884000	10886000	Moving on to another tweet
10886000	10888000	Again this is the last chance to get called in
10888000	10890000	Or to call in 1877 game OLR
10890000	10892000	username on Skype
10892000	10894000	Orange Lounge Radio
10894000	10896000	I see some people talking about civilization in chat
10896000	10898000	Which ties into the interview we had earlier
10898000	10900000	And it just kind of makes me laugh
10900000	10902000	Because Civ is that game you can go back and revisit once in a while
10902000	10904000	But it's going to be a very long while
10904000	10906000	All night long
10906000	10908000	And it's going to look exactly the same
10908000	10910000	And play exactly the same
10910000	10912000	As long as you have the time to spend on it
10912000	10914000	With Civ they have the expansions and everything
10914000	10916000	I kind of hope
10916000	10918000	I have a funny feeling
10918000	10920000	When Christopher Tin was on the show earlier
10920000	10922000	Talking about that song of his
10922000	10924000	It might be for that new Civ game
10924000	10926000	Is that the impression you got?
10926000	10928000	Because that's the impression I got
10928000	10930000	I didn't
10930000	10932000	I was leaning towards some new title
10932000	10934000	I was going to make a tongue in cheek
10934000	10936000	Joke about Civ 6
10936000	10938000	Civ 5.5, Civ Next DLC
10938000	10940000	Well there's the whole don't call it alpha centari
10940000	10942000	Civilization game that's on its way
10942000	10944000	Not my world
10944000	10946000	That was going to be my
10946000	10948000	Tongue in cheek joke
10948000	10950000	I would kind of expect it to be a new game personally
10950000	10952000	A different company at least
10952000	10954000	I was surprised
10954000	10956000	It was next week because I would have thought
10956000	10958000	E3, but now is the time of year
10958000	10960000	Where all the companies are getting a jump on E3
10960000	10962000	To say here's the games to get excited
10962000	10964000	About E3
10964000	10966000	As big as some other companies
10966000	10968000	Right, yeah I know about that one
10968000	10970000	Or even just need to shove some of the news out of the way
10970000	10972000	Before what they're going to announce there
10972000	10974000	All these companies that weren't cool enough to get in the door
10974000	10976000	Anyway, going to another tweet
10976000	10978000	From 13X forever
10978000	10980000	Or cross forever, 13 forever
10980000	10982000	Who tweets us and says
10982000	10984000	Did you know that Kiro Blaster
10984000	10986000	A new game from Pixel from Cave Story fame
10986000	10988000	Is available right now
10988000	10990000	And tweets us a link to playism-games.com
10990000	10992000	I did not know that, but you have educated me
10992000	10994000	I've checked that out because
10994000	10996000	Pixel games, like all the
10996000	10998000	That stuff was great
10998000	11000000	With Cave Story and all that
11000000	11002000	So, excited
11002000	11004000	Hooray hooray
11004000	11006000	Unfortunately, Shane's not in the room right now
11006000	11008000	But I had to read this tweet from Andy Scout
11008000	11010000	Who tweeted at us saying
11010000	11012000	I can't trust game recommendations from someone who doesn't like
11012000	11014000	Ni No Kuni
11014000	11016000	Me neither, Andy, me neither
11016000	11018000	Alright, I guess that's it for tweets
11018000	11020000	How about any other last minute stories?
11020000	11022000	No
11022000	11024000	Well, I guess that means we're out of here
11024000	11026000	Because the phone is not ringing
11026000	11028000	So I'm going to go ahead and close that on up
11028000	11030000	And we're well past 9 o'clock anyway
11030000	11032000	I want to thank you guys for staying up late with us tonight
11032000	11034000	Really appreciate it
11034000	11036000	What a great show, thank you guys all for being a part of it
11036000	11038000	If you like what you heard here at Orange L'Antrado
11038000	11040000	Please, all we ask, tell a friend or two
11040000	11042000	About the show, help spread the word
11042000	11044000	Of the show, that's all we've got
11044000	11046000	Is word of mouth
11046000	11048000	We really appreciate a nice review
11048000	11050000	On a website where you found this show
11051000	11053000	Those reviews go a long, long way in helping us be visible
11053000	11055000	So please, help us out
11055000	11057000	Really appreciate it
11057000	11059000	Jason, I want to thank you for being here
11059000	11061000	Absolutely
11061000	11063000	I know we didn't get to talk as much tonight
11063000	11065000	Because I didn't get to budget you any stories
11065000	11067000	And we had another guest on tonight
11067000	11069000	Who, you know, with all due respect, Jason, you didn't win a Grammy
11069000	11071000	That's a tough act to follow
11071000	11073000	Maybe next year
11073000	11075000	I give him all of the accolations and lauds I possibly can
11075000	11077000	But it's a pleasure to have you here
11077000	11079000	And come back again sometime
11079000	11081000	You said you might be here next week?
11081000	11083000	Make a weekend of Scandia next week
11083000	11085000	And I can stick around here for the weekend
11085000	11087000	Then we can hear that schmexy voice of yours all over again next week
11087000	11089000	It'll be fun
11089000	11091000	I'll be here
11091000	11093000	We'll give you some stories
11093000	11095000	I can be here
11095000	11097000	It's like Jason the sequel
11097000	11099000	That'd make it sound like a Friday the 13th movie
11099000	11101000	Wasn't it?
11101000	11103000	The funny slash sad thing
11103000	11105000	That may turn out to be more accurate
11105000	11107000	Not the Jason movie part
11107000	11109000	You're going to be here for months and months again?
11109000	11111000	It's fucking possible
11111000	11113000	Oh boy
11113000	11115000	Keep that fourth chair nice and warm for Jason
11115000	11117000	Alright
11117000	11119000	Moving on, DarkSakura
11119000	11121000	Thanks for being here
11121000	11123000	As you always are
11123000	11125000	You're welcome
11125000	11127000	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11127000	11129000	I really want a burrito
11129000	11131000	A burrito?
11131000	11133000	I may go to Adelbertos
11133000	11135000	Do you want to get me a burrito?
11135000	11137000	I'm going in the opposite direction
11137000	11139000	I'm going that way, far away
11139000	11141000	Well, poop
11141000	11143000	Well, if you eat a big enough burrito
11143000	11147000	Jason, I didn't properly give you a chance to give your final thought
11147000	11149000	Did you have a final thought?
11149000	11151000	No, actually
11151000	11153000	I really don't
11153000	11157000	I have literally nothing left in my mind right now
11157000	11159000	Besides maybe telling your dryer to hurry up
11159000	11161000	Hey, it's got a timer on it
11161000	11163000	It'll tell you when it's done
11163000	11165000	Alright, my final thought
11165000	11167000	I love the fact too that you are literally on your last clean thing you own
11169000	11171000	It's a radio show
11171000	11173000	He can wear whatever he wants
11173000	11175000	But he's got pajama pants with little chilis on them right now
11175000	11177000	It's hilarious
11177000	11179000	This was a very explicit plan
11179000	11181000	I have more than a week's worth of pants
11181000	11183000	But I like having all of them just in case for some reason
11183000	11185000	I don't get a chance to do laundry
11185000	11187000	Because doubling up
11187000	11189000	Yeah, pajama life
11189000	11191000	Exactly, that's alright
11191000	11193000	It's radio, they don't look at us
11193000	11197000	The audience is lucky I'm wearing any pants at all
11197000	11199000	But you know
11199000	11201000	We're lucky you're wearing pants at all
11201000	11205000	I do that out of respect to you guys who come here in the studio
11205000	11207000	But trust me, the minute you guys leave
11207000	11209000	I did
11209000	11211000	Sorry, Jason
11211000	11213000	I did say as soon as I walked in here
11213000	11215000	That lounge has gotten more appropriate
11215000	11217000	Because we're not all crammed around a dining room table
11217000	11219000	And we're actually spread out
11219000	11221000	What do you think of Studio N7?
11221000	11223000	It's fucking open, there's space to move
11223000	11227000	And not have to shift and get out of people's way and contort
11227000	11231000	Most families would have a dining room
11231000	11233000	Well you do have a dining room, it's literally right there
11233000	11235000	You remember what we did with our dining room
11235000	11237000	Pinball
11237000	11239000	We called it Pinball Alley
11239000	11241000	I'm just saying, wouldn't a baby Pac-Man machine fit right here?
11241000	11243000	Just saying
11243000	11245000	Wouldn't it be great?
11245000	11247000	I'm gonna turn into Dark Sakura's house
11247000	11251000	Get a table, I have a freaking bar top cabinet that could go right there
11251000	11253000	Where's that in my video capture card?
11255000	11257000	You know, I thought about it before I came here
11257000	11259000	And I thought about it after I came here
11259000	11261000	And I was like, oh, forgot it
11261000	11263000	I'm messing with you
11263000	11265000	N7 is wonderful, that is my final thought
11265000	11267000	Alright, fantastic
11267000	11269000	My final thought tonight is
11269000	11271000	It is really stupid to drink a cup of coffee
11271000	11273000	At 8 o'clock in the evening
11273000	11275000	When you realize, oh yeah, I have to go to bed early tonight
11275000	11277000	Cause I gotta be up at 6.30 in the morning
11277000	11279000	That's not true, you have awesome dreams
11279000	11281000	When you're caffeinated
11281000	11283000	And they're weird
11283000	11285000	That's a good way of looking at it
11285000	11287000	Alright, last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight
11287000	11289000	My final thought is I hate my fucking touchpad
11289000	11291000	For some reason it keeps clicking the right button
11291000	11293000	Even though I'm not touching the right button at all
11293000	11295000	It's really annoying
11295000	11297000	And it's just some stupid
11297000	11299000	Aces gesture garbage
11299000	11301000	Which I disabled, but it's still doing it
11301000	11303000	You have a rough life
11303000	11305000	Yeah, and I'm trying to figure out
11305000	11307000	How to fucking do texture atlases correctly
11307000	11309000	Cause I don't want to buy this one program to do it
11309000	11311000	And it's just a pain in the ass
11311000	11313000	Alright, well that's gonna do it for another week
11313000	11315000	At Orange Lounge Radio
