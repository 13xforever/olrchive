Visual Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week Nintendo continues to stir the pot by confirming the new hardware is taking shape.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Microsoft's connected withdrawal continues with the announcement of a connectless Xbox to be released next month and the timing is suspicious.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The road to E3 continues tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May 18th of 2014, the 553rd episode of our show.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And it is a busy show tonight. With my co-hosts, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How are you, Jamie?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm fibrous.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Vibrous?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Fibrous.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm eating salad.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And that and your neighbors are jerks because they don't use their turn signals.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, that's not very cool.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Also, when we hit 555, we need to call that our preval show.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Our preval? You know actually my car hit 66,666 miles yesterday. I thought of you.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Your car's the devil.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I think it might still be at that in the driveway actually.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, also joining us as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hi.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm alright.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I want to say thank you, Loki, for... Loki gave me a new HD capture card before the show tonight so I can do some fun things.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Loned.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, you know, gave me for a little while.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, if I like it, I'll buy my own, honestly.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, exactly.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But, yeah, no, I'm like really appreciative.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, what's sad is that I bought one a while ago, but it's delayed, it's not very good, I couldn't get it to work.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't feel sad, I have like six capture cards, I've just not been satisfied with any of them, but this one's actually pretty good.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So I can hopefully do more stuff online and all that, so it'll be good.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So thank you for remembering that, I appreciate it.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How's, what's the status of your game, real quick?

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This week I've been working on an editor for making the ships in, like, well, because these ships actually eat parts of ships, so making all the parts out of my voxel stuff.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So that's what I've been working on, and I was working on a copy and paste function today, just for the fuck of it.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But it's pretty much done, I actually put up a new YouTube video last night, or Friday, so showing some of that, and I made the ugliest, I don't know, sort of spaceship, it wasn't really a spaceship video.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And what's your YouTube channel, if you want to check that out?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Just Loki O.L.R.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And Tigerclaw in our chatroom, because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at the Voice of Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And again, that's Sundays at 6 or 9, depending on what coast you're on, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Tigerclaw in our chat is asking what brand of capture card, it's an Elgato, right?

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's an Elgato Game Capture HD, I think.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And I don't remember the one I had, I want to say it was a diamond, and it does not shine bright like a diamond, let me say.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I shouldn't shade the company when I'm not 100% sure that was it, but yeah.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It has little pictures of video game, generic video game characters on it, and that should have been a sign right there.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Anyway.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright, also joining us in studio tonight, he pops in for a few months, and pops out for a few months, but luckily we're on an end cycle right now.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Say hello to VX JasonXVXYZ.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My trend of breaking speakers and overly loud audio segments continues tonight, as was evidenced by the intro.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's alright, it's because you taped it here and not on your to-go.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, very strange just to be, like literally everything was different.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I used your microphone, I used Windows, I used Audition, and none of these things I have touched in, well your microphone, never.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's amazing how differently balanced all these mics are.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Just a little behind the scenes thing, we actually use hand mics here at OLR, which is kind of frowned upon in the podcast scene,

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
but I'm just not set up, especially in this large space, to have these big honkin' stationary microphones, and we don't really do the sit around a table thing.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We just need to suspend them all from the roof.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh yeah sure, my rental home, suspend them all from the roof, sounds like a good idea.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The U2 music video from three or four months ago, I completely forgot what it was called,

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
but when I actually watched it, the swing microphone stand actually looked really amazingly cool.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Last week on the show, Shane was here in studio, we were talking about our trip to Scandia here locally,

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
which actually has just randomly a whole bunch of music-based video games.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's actually a pretty rad arcade, I gotta say.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm gonna give props where props is due.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I felt like arcades were kinda done.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I go to Scandia and I'm like, this is rad, I feel like it's ten years ago all over again.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So props. But Jason, you went today, what'd you think?

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's really familiar, you go in and you see modern games laid out with a reasonable amount of space,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
all things considered, on how big that building actually is.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It is a small arcade, yeah.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's nothing to scoff at, but you have all of the cheap redemption on one side,

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and a lot of good, modern, fun stuff off to the right.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You know what, Sunnyvale Golf Land was a huge arcade, and still is a huge arcade,

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
but they did a lot of fighting game tournaments and a lot of the Bomani stuff really took off there years ago.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And that was a really small ass arcade too, it's probably about the same size as Scandia.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I say yeah, as if I've ever been.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The only three golf lands I've been to are Mesa, Roseville, and now Scandia.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Over the span of 13 years, 12 years.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Alright, well I will talk a little more, we will talk a little more about those games

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
when we get into How Was Your Gaming Week a little later, but we've got to get to it.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There's too much news tonight, and believe it or not, tonight we start with breaking news,

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
which by the time a lot of you guys listen to this, it's probably not so breaking,

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
but it's Sunday night and this is what everybody's talking about right now.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Starting off tonight with a report from Variety, and I usually wouldn't talk about news this big

88
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
if it was coming from a site that has a bad reputation for rumors like Kotaku or Motley Fool

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
or one of those websites where when I read their articles my eyes roll to the back of my head so far

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can see my brain, but Variety, they don't really, I mean this is an industry-respected mag,

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
especially in the entertainment world, so the fact that they're running with this I think lends a lot of credit to this.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And the headline reads, YouTube to acquire video game streaming service Twitch for $1 billion.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's billion with a B.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Billion with a Dr. Evil in the 2000s.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes. Need I say much more than that headline?

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That is, according to sources, familiar, and then a lot of the rest of the report gives background information.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They do say that this is the most significant acquisition in the history of YouTube.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So Twitch, only worth a little over half of what YouTube was worth back in 2006,

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and then no comment obviously coming from YouTube or Twitch at this time.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I imagine it would be wait till Monday.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
YouTube, they say, is preparing for US regulators to challenge the deal, according to sources,

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
because YouTube is the number one platform for internet video,

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and the Justice Department may take a hard look at antitrust,

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because if buying Twitch could be those issues in the online video market,

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and I know in the past I've said on this show, where is our Twitch competitor?

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why is nobody stepping up the way that Twitch has?

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you had, you might have been bought for a billion dollars.

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There's livestream.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, it doesn't do, they ban gaming, don't they?

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
They do some gaming. I've gamed on livestream before.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But it's not really their big focus over there, and I want to say they have a lot of criteria too.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Twitch is really all about kind of the being open and everything with the livestreaming,

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
but the focus is on the game, and I guess you have Ustream,

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but again, Ustream isn't taken very seriously by a lot of the big gamer circles,

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
and I think a lot of that just has to do with their model and so forth.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ustream supports the Playroom boobies and butts channels just fine,

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
but that's pretty much all they do.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And I guess there's like Hitbox, there's some others,

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
but none of them have quite that share that Twitch does.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So it does raise an interesting question in that regard,

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but I kind of think it's not going to matter at the end of the day.

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I think if YouTube wants it, YouTube will get it, and this makes a very logical acquisition.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So what do you guys think in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm curious to see your thoughts in our chat room.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Those in the studio, what are your thoughts hearing this news,

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
which we've been marinating on for only about 90 minutes?

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
LedUpG actually says, is AT&T buying DirecTV or Comcast Time Warner antitrust?

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I was actually going to ask, has there ever actually been an antitrust lawsuit in gaming

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
since the third-party Atari Nintendo dispute back in the late 70s, early 80s?

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I really couldn't say. I don't know that there has been.

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's been a long time coming, but it's not the sort of thing that we deal with that often that we hear about.

133
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I want to say somebody went after Nintendo over the third-party cartridges.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I mean, when Atari sued Nintendo, but I don't remember if that fell under antitrust.

135
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But that might have been part of their argument in that whole situation.

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But still three decades ago?

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, it was a long time ago, for sure.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, Jason, what are your thoughts?

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All of my arguments stray on technical, so it's actually really weird to answer this.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't like YouTube's live streaming platform, and I think the technical marriage of what Twitch has done before

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and getting YouTube live streaming in order is going to come a long way.

142
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
YouTube commenting during YouTube live streams is a freaking joke.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The whole of the interactivity on YouTube live streams I dislike a lot.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
When you talk about YouTube streaming that you don't like, are you talking about Google Hangouts?

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Because I actually think that stuff's kind of amazing.

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've seen, actually, because there's a Unity show that I watch that does YouTube live streams twice a week or so,

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and they're talking about their chats and stuff, and sometimes their chats are several minutes behind.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's ridiculous, the amount of lag.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So there's two sides of it. There's the broadcasting side of it, which is Hangouts,

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
and there is a Hangout host-specific chat, and obviously the hosts that are actually talking voice and video.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But if it is doing Hangouts on air is the moniker that actually streams to YouTube.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You go to the YouTube interface and just as a viewer take in the Hangout.

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's no chat to speak of. It's basically YouTube comments bolted onto a live stream that are slow and limited to 180.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I think it's more than Twitter, like 200 characters or something like that.

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Live stream really does that a lot better.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, everything does it a lot better.

157
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
YouTube live streaming as it stands is terrible.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Having a technical marriage, even a little bit between the two services, there is a lot of good potential.

159
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But I think it's important to say nothing will happen overnight.

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Absolutely.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Nothing's going to happen tomorrow when they announce this.

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Those changes would be gradual.

163
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But you may see something happen around the holiday when more people are getting games that they want to stream online,

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
especially with the Twitch service built right into the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Loki, your thoughts?

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know. I mean, I guess it'll be alright.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know yet. As long as they don't force Google Plus on everybody.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They've already kind of done that.

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know. I mean, I use YouTube more than I use Twitch, so I don't know.

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm indifferent about it because it doesn't really affect what I do right now.

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've got to say, the news doesn't totally surprise me, honestly, because it makes a lot of sense.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Twitch TV was a privately held company.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There were investors that had invested millions of dollars into this company.

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Investors want to make money, so when somebody comes in offering a billion with a B,

175
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I mean, this is the kind of stuff that's going to happen.

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And, you know, it's not Comcast.

177
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I mean, there's that.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And it's not Facebook, I guess, because everybody got real mad when Facebook bought Oculus,

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
even though I don't think that's the end of the world either, but I digress.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
None of it's the end of the world. It's all corporate bullshit.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, the one thing that does kind of pop into my head is, you know, obviously,

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I have had some difficulty with YouTube, and it's probably some of the things that you all are thinking about,

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
is with the copyright claims and the things that they do.

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And just to put this into perspective, last week on the show,

185
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
and, you know, Jason, if you didn't know, Jason puts all of the OLR episodes onto YouTube.

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, not all of them, but ever since episode, what, like 5.03?

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
5.28?

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, really?

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I haven't been to that one.

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay, but, you know, the past-

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's been a good couple of months.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The past at least 25 episodes or so, you've been working on, you always put them on YouTube.

193
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It helps to kind of like get it out there and expand the audience.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And it's a really convenient way, because like everything has YouTube, right?

195
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So it's a really convenient way to find OLR.

196
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You want to get OLR on your 3DS? You can do it.

197
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Just go on the YouTube app, do Orange Ons Radio, you can get it.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So, I mean, we love it for that reason.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's why Jason does it and takes the time to do that.

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But to put it in perspective, last week's show, we had Christopher Tin on the show, right?

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So he's promoting his new album.

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And as part of the promotion, we agreed with his people that we would play two 90-second clips from his, you know, Baba Yetu,

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
because I knew you all would know this, and then a 90-second clip from the upcoming album.

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So we played those two clips on the show last night.

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think you guys all know, or last week, excuse me.

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And you'll never guess the message that I sent to Rob last night at about 9 p.m. when everything was going up.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So Jason puts the show on YouTube, and before the thing is even finished processing, copyright claim.

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Copyright claim hits our YouTube that it contains a recording from, and it doesn't even say, it doesn't even say it's Christopher Tin,

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
it doesn't even say that it's 2K, it's like P...

210
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was a really vague name.

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It was something vague that was a...

212
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
P-E-D-L.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, something like that that was a strike against the Civilization soundtrack.

214
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now, I could sit here and fight over the nickel of revenue that the OLR, you know, episode's going to make in ads or whatever,

215
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
but, like, I'm kind of over it at this point, but this whole fact that YouTube lets these troll companies,

216
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
and I had another, I had another one of my Let's Play videos get hit.

217
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It was my Super Hexagon video that I have on my personal channel where the creator of Super Hexagon has said,

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
you may place my videos up and monetize them, and then the guy who did the soundtrack, you may place my videos up and monetize them.

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It gets hit for the soundtrack because it's some third-party copyright troll.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
YouTube needs to fix this, or I need to be able to go after these guys in response when they're doing it falsely,

221
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
because, really, they always err on the side of the companies.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What fucking business does that?

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I thought the number one rule of customers...

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
All of them?

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What is the number one rule of customer service? The customer is always right.

226
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Actually, no, it isn't.

227
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Whether you believe it or not. I taught customer service for seven years. That is the rule. The customer is always right.

228
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's the foundation that we go on, whether we believe it's right or wrong or whatever, and I know there's situations and so forth,

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but YouTube does not believe that their customers are right, and that's very frustrating. That's why we're all mad.

230
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are you paying for it?

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I am giving them stuff that they are making money off of.

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But are you paying them out of your pocket?

233
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No, I'm not paying them out of my pocket.

234
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So I can go somewhere else, yes?

235
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You can go somewhere else.

236
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can.

237
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
To her point, affiliates are more like... Google's customers are advertisers.

238
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Above and beyond anything else, they are advertisers, and by extension, YouTube specifically,

239
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
when the copyright crackdown happened, the start of this year, whenever it was,

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,000
affiliates, those are the ones that have their own ad networks and agreements, and those are the ones where money is actually changing hands.

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Unfortunately, I agree with Jamie on this one. Not unfortunately, but I agree with Jamie on this one.

242
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And on top of that, you are also looking at potentially legitimate companies that do have the legal manpower to soothe the pants off of them

243
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
and get money out of them for allowing a copyright violation to go through.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Whether they're right or not, their first goal is to cover their own asses.

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, and this is why there's that hesitation big time amongst...

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You know, when you look at Twitter right now, and RIP Twitch is trending.

247
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is why people are upset about the buyout, because they know YouTube does not err on the side of the consumer.

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And so Twitch, if they go down that same path, everybody's just like, fuck it, then what am I doing on Twitch?

249
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Why don't I go somewhere else?

250
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh shit, there isn't anywhere else that's really usable right now.

251
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
So you gotta make your own video streaming thing or something, which I don't even know the first thing about doing that,

252
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
but maybe that'll be out there more and more as we look at the future.

253
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's gonna take something privately owned that isn't gonna go...

254
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Again.

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But that'll just get, again, exactly, that'll just get sold in seven more years.

256
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Unless you have somebody with the integrity not to sell.

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't know. I don't know how much integrity I'd have if someone's flashing a billion dollars in my face, but okay, sure.

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You know, I honestly don't think that I would.

259
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If I believed firmly enough in what I was doing, too many people are willing to be bought and sold, have their morals bought and sold.

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't think I could do that.

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Easy to say, difficult to do.

262
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I've passed it up before.

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
With all due respect, if somebody were to come in and offer a million bucks for VoG, probably do it.

264
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's a lot of money.

265
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This isn't morals, it's just a choice.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There are plenty of people that will not sell, there's plenty of people that will.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There's plenty of people that will never take VC money, there's plenty of people that will.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But if you're taking a stance against this kind of business practice, then you have to be able to stand by it.

269
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The more that they think that money's gonna work, the more they're gonna do it.

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The people that started these companies probably didn't come in with...

271
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Twitch did not come in because YouTube was bad.

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That was years and years and years ago.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If somebody is gonna say, hey, we're offering you an alternative to the corporate owned crap or whatever, we're offering you this.

274
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Which might happen.

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They'd have to also be willing to get their funding from, I'm gonna just use quoting fingers on this, a legitimate source.

276
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
As opposed to taking buyout money.

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
They'd have to be willing not to sell out.

278
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, I mean, if we look at Twitch's history, I mean, Twitch started, of course, as Justin TV.

279
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And I remember when OLR was broadcast on Justin TV because they were just starting to get their gaming content.

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We had that studio at the old house and all this stuff.

281
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But Justin TV, if you even go further back, I mean, literally that website started so that the dude, Justin, who owned the thing, could life cast.

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
He had a camera strapped to his head and life cast 24-7.

283
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And then it was him and then it opened up to more people and there was, what, Justine?

284
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I know it became like a big, like, no, literally her name was Justine.

285
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It was just funny that they were Justin and Justine.

286
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But, you know.

287
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Hi, Justine.

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And then everybody could pick up on this.

289
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I remember Scott Rubin at all games when we were a part of that network.

290
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He was really big on this whole thing.

291
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And he went to E3 one year with a camera on his head and this whole thing.

292
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I mean, that was, you know, the big thing.

293
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And then that all spun off into Twitch, you know, because the gaming content was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
More demand, more demand.

295
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So literally a guy with the idea to broadcast a camera next to his head just sold that for a billion dollars.

296
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
In a way.

297
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I mean, obviously I'm jumping A to Z a little bit, but it's crazy how that works, right?

298
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So.

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everything.

300
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The flow of business is not one way, but this is the way it works.

301
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You start with an idea.

302
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You implement it to the extent that you're able to.

303
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And then you start either if you, if your idea is great and you make money and you can hire people immediately for that reason.

304
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Great.

305
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
If not, you get what resources you can, both physical and people manpower.

306
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And then you start building up.

307
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Something's interesting.

308
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
People want to go in and fund it because they are investing.

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
They want to make their return too.

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah, this, this is not a bad thing.

311
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It is.

312
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:33,000
People have a bad taste in their mouth ever since the year 1999 and 2000, but investments are a good way to get liquid capital and infrastructure in much less time than being able to actually save up that money or even like standard credit lines or something like that.

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
MM2K in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

314
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't want to ignore our chat room.

315
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
MM2K says advertisers are the clients, quote, yet users of the service are the consumers.

316
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Um, SHU 100 Matt says at some point a company will end up becoming so big that they need to partner up with another company to improve its product.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Otherwise someone else could swoop in with an improved version.

318
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You know, well, Twitch did take a little bit of heat about three months ago when they had to, it's in order to accommodate the PlayStation four and the Xbox one, they had to kind of change their streaming, you know, from a tech side, they had to change things.

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And what the user saw is that now there was like a 30, 45 second delay between when they would stream things and when the chat would come in, which, Oh my God, like there was so much uproar about that.

320
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And people were really mad, which, you know, people had built their concepts around the instant ness.

321
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I mean, something like Twitch plays Pokemon would have worked even better had it been instant.

322
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Right.

323
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But obviously they were able to make it work anyway.

324
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Um, but I kind of look at it and laugh because we've been doing this show on a 45 second delay for about 12.

325
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean, that's just how it is.

326
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I've always just thought, okay, that's just built into the show.

327
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There's always going to be a little bit of a delay.

328
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's no big deal.

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You know, you work with it.

330
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Even right over the air radio has at least a seven second delay because heaven forbid somebody say, fuck, shit, cock, piss, cunt on the air.

331
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You know, they have to be able to bleep that.

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So I like see all his comment.

333
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We can make our own streaming site with hookers and blackjack actually well said, but how so.

334
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So, all right.

335
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Uh, anyhow, uh, let's see other comments in the chat room over at a live dot vog network.com.

336
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Dungeon buster says a lot of companies can choose to remain private and make money that way, but going public is something that many do in order to raise capital for further expansion.

337
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It also exposes them to many, many more investors that will want a return on the money.

338
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Uh, I'm probably going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.

339
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oleg Jank spirit says there is always the option for a public company to go private.

340
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's an expensive process, but it can be done.

341
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's true.

342
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I have heard of, um, some companies doing that in the past.

343
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yeah.

344
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So Dell bought back with, uh, with an investment from Microsoft to Dell bought out all their shareholders to go private, uh, mid last year.

345
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah, that's it.

346
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's that.

347
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I knew I'd read somebody about that news.

348
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's not frequent.

349
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It is a thing that can be done.

350
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
People get their money back at fair market value and status changes.

351
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I have more respect for the companies that stay private or have their shareholders be their employees because they're actually giving back to the people who work for them.

352
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's a far more ethical practice.

353
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And on top of that, they're guaranteeing that as far as I can say, they have a more satisfied worker base because the workers are actually getting a direct return from how well the company is faring.

354
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Um, well, that's not happening with Twitch or Google in this case.

355
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I mean, that's just, that's the, this is the reality of now where we're at and there is no gaming company that I can think of in this industry that does run this way.

356
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So now what?

357
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The clock continues.

358
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Next company will be in the news in two, three years.

359
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I kind of don't think they're on this.

360
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I mean, despite the fact that I just voiced the concern with YouTube and you know, Twitch, Twitch also has, you know, people play music in the background when they're streaming.

361
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That's very common.

362
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And I think it's a lot harder to police the live streams and so forth.

363
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And I'm not saying people should go out there and it should just be like copyright bonanza.

364
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We're just going to stream movies on Twitch.

365
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
No, no, no, no.

366
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
But like, you know, if somebody is going to play music and it's in the background and it's incidental, then it's like going to somebody's house and they have their boombox playing in the background.

367
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's not that big a deal.

368
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Right.

369
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
So I just hope we don't start to like over police this shit or that's where they're going to lose consumer confidence.

370
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And any of this pushback they're seeing right now is consumer, a lack of consumer confidence in, you know, YouTube or whatever.

371
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah, but they don't need consumer confidence because there's nowhere else to go.

372
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
That's, that's a very valid point.

373
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Kind of like Comcast.

374
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Well, and even, and I just want to make clear, despite the concern I just brought up with YouTube, you know, I'm not again,

375
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
nothing's going to change overnight.

376
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I just hope YouTube takes a cautious approach knowing that if they are a network populated with user content and a competitor could arise,

377
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and I guess there is Ustream and some other, you know, this hitbox and some of this other stuff out there,

378
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
YouTube will want to be very careful in what it does.

379
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's not unheard of for users to abandon a website and cause that website to lose oodles and oodles and oodles of money.

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
MySpace. Friendster.

381
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Orkut.

382
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Yahoo.

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I've never heard of Orkut.

384
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's Orkut. It's big in Brazil now, I think. Google. Google owns that too.

385
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah.

386
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, okay.

387
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Blogspot. That's still around.

388
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

389
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
LiveJournal.

390
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
LiveJournal is a good example too.

391
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So, you know, yeah, so that it's...

392
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Ass, cheese, Zynga.

393
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh, what was the...

394
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Zonga.

395
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
No, X...

396
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Zynga.

397
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
X-A-N-G-A.

398
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, Zynga.

399
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
So, anyhow.

400
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Alright.

401
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's see how one in chat says, boom box, how old are you? Shut up. Get off my lawn.

402
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They're not boom boxes anymore. They're jam boxes.

403
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Excuse me. Excuse me.

404
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Alright.

405
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That's not fair at all.

406
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Considering that most songs nowadays have a drop in there somewhere,

407
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
so I would think that describing the, you know, the thump of a bass, you know, would be, you know, more like a boom.

408
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Hell, there was a song talking about, you know, here comes boom bass.

409
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
There was boom.

410
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
There was a song called Drop the Bass as well.

411
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
They came out when I was in high school.

412
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Or as I just saw, like, you know, pretty much everyone's, you know, on Facebook and Reddit and all that stuff.

413
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Was it Lonely Island skit last night where...

414
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
SNL skit.

415
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah.

416
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Da Vinci.

417
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Da Vinci.

418
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

419
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Was it...

420
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
When's the bass drop or something like that or...

421
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It was pretty funny.

422
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'll have to check that out.

423
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Don't look up that clip. It was pretty funny.

424
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'll check that out.

425
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Alright.

426
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Final thought here from SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

427
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
We could get really deep or meta about this, but I still think it's too early.

428
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
That's right.

429
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
More news about this possibly to come out on Monday because, you know, and by the time people are listening to this show, we might even have more information.

430
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So I'm not going to run this topic into the ground.

431
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It's just going to be very interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks and months.

432
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Especially with, you know, Twitch is now the, you know, there's no more G4 or anything like that.

433
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So, well, I guess, isn't technically G4 actually still there, but it just...

434
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Esquire.

435
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Whatever. They might as well be gone.

436
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
G4 as it stands.

437
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
No, they're not Esquire anymore because Esquire became...

438
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It was a different station that became Esquire.

439
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, the style thing.

440
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Yeah.

441
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

442
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Alright.

443
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, G4's still around.

444
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Who cares? Nobody's watching any of it anyway.

445
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
More people are watching Twitch than any of that stuff anyway.

446
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So, but Twitch is the official streaming partner of E3.

447
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
So it's going to be interesting to see how this news could, you know, play into that a little bit.

448
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We'll see.

449
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Maybe this was something that was supposed to come out at E3.

450
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Who knows?

451
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So.

452
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Alright.

453
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
We are going to move on.

454
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
We had...

455
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
This was our breaking news topic.

456
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
We had another kickoff topic we were going to start the show off with.

457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
And I'm going to turn it over to Loki who's got a few news reports to go through here about this.

458
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Alright.

459
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
So let's see.

460
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Microsoft making some really interesting decisions earlier this week.

461
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:15,000
The big bombshell was that, hey, yeah, we're going to bring out an Xbox One at $399 without Kinect.

462
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And it will be coming out June 9th.

463
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
So, you know, everybody's been kind of saying, you know, hey, I don't give a shit about Kinect.

464
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Why am I paying an extra $100 for Kinect?

465
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Well, now they've done that.

466
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But at the same time it's kind of like, damn, now, you know, those people, since they were trying to justify the extra $100 with Kinect, now it's not a requirement.

467
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So there's probably not...

468
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
There's going to be as much support as there was on the Xbox 360 for Kinect.

469
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
So it is kind of a waste now for those people that bought the system early.

470
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Early adopter syndrome, I guess.

471
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And then, you know, to kind of go along with that, you know, one of the other gripes about Xbox Live has been that most of the entertainment apps are behind the Xbox Live Gold Paywall.

472
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You have to have a gold subscription in order to be able to, you know, watch Netflix or do any of that stuff.

473
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:17,000
So now, starting, I guess, in June as well, they're going to be removing some of those.

474
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So now you're going to be able to actually, you know, watch those apps and stuff for, you know, without having a gold subscription.

475
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And this is kind of interesting. I'm kind of surprised that they did this in the first place.

476
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But they are actually going to be offering refunds for people that may have had an Xbox Live subscription just to watch those apps.

477
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So, why you would want a subscription just to watch those apps is beyond me.

478
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The other thing, though, free to play games are still going to require Xbox Live Gold.

479
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So, whereas you can play an MMO for free on the PlayStation Network, you're still going to have to have Xbox Live Gold in order to, like, play, like, Elder Scrolls Online, for example.

480
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And then, on top of that, Games with Gold is going to be getting a little bit of a tweak.

481
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:20,000
They are doing pretty much like the PlayStation Plus program, where now any of those free games that you download aren't going to be yours to keep, like they have been in the past.

482
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But now, starting June, you're going to get games for, I guess, discounts for games. They're going to have stuff for Xbox One as well.

483
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And then, any games that are part of that program, you're just going to be able to have access to, but they're not going to be yours forever.

484
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:47,000
If you stop paying for gold, you don't get to play them anymore, much like the PlayStation Network.

485
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I got to say, though, what the hell? They just go, hey, let's copy everything Sony's doing, because it seems like they're copying everything Sony's doing.

486
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You know, they're making the tweaks exactly the same as, you know, the PlayStation Network, and that kind of seems...

487
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Well, because Sony's outsold them by at least two million.

488
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Well, I understand that, but that kind of smells of desperation, if you ask me.

489
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Next thing you know, their controllers are going to operate in 3D space with the camera...oh.

490
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The quote-unquote funny thing to me is that, didn't they come out...like, didn't Don Mattrick or one of those guys after E3 come out and say, oh, the Xbox One won't work without Kinect.

491
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It will not work. It does not function without Kinect.

492
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Well, and then they've also found out...

493
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Sorry, I have to say, all that...everybody saw through that corporate bullshit when those words came out of their mouth.

494
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That is Microsoft's problem.

495
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They were steadfast to that stuff, too. They were steadfast to saying, oh, listen, you know, this is a fact that this cannot work with it.

496
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The Sims will not run without an online connection, or SimCity, I'm sorry. The SimCity will not run without an online connection.

497
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
It is impossible for this to happen. Unless we want to, you know, do that.

498
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I think there's a huge alert memo, if we happen to have any gaming companies who happen to listen to the show, memo alert.

499
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:22,000
People see through that shit. You need to believe that your tech geek people, who are mostly pretty smart across the board, sees through a lot of that speak.

500
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Like, if this doesn't put an exclamation point on the end of that, I'm not sure what does.

501
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Now, to be fair, because I don't want to make it sound like we're taking a poop on Microsoft while they're down.

502
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I do feel like things have come a lot way for the better ever since they got that new guy in there that replaced Don Mattrick.

503
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Is that Aaron Greenberg that's in that position?

504
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah.

505
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yeah. So, you know, I feel like things have changed for the better since then, you know, and I do feel like there is more transparency happening.

506
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I feel like, you know, the direction seems to be better. So, hooray.

507
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But on the flip side, I get at the same time why they're the hardcore Xbox fans out there that are a little bit disappointed that maybe Microsoft didn't stick to their original vision in some ways.

508
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:15,000
But if you don't come, I mean, and this is true of Nintendo now, if you don't come out the gate swinging, you're going to be in trouble.

509
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Quick, named three Kinect games that are must-own on Xbox One.

510
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
That was funny.

511
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Exactly.

512
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm going to do it because I sell that stuff.

513
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Quick, do it. What are the three must-own Kinect games on Xbox One?

514
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The brand new Kinect Sports game that they have.

515
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Not out yet.

516
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
It is out.

517
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, is it now?

518
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, it was out in April.

519
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Okay, well it hasn't been out for a while, but okay.

520
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Okay. So, and then you've got Just Dance 2014.

521
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay, fair. Although that is on other platforms, yes.

522
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It is. And, sadly enough, I think.

523
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Ha! Ha! Ha!

524
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
That's because there's only three Kinect games out there.

525
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
See? That's my point, is that they didn't come out the door swinging.

526
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I mean, there's the Fighters on Cage, but that's absolute shit, so.

527
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This was the Nintendo issue as well, is that Nintendo did not come out swinging with the Wii U.

528
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yes, their lineup was impressive, but over half of it was recycled stuff from years ago with the Wii U injected into it.

529
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And the other half was delayed, or in some cases outright cancelled.

530
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Exactly. And that's the same problem they had.

531
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
So, you know, it's a bummer that Harmonic's Fantasia thing got pushed back as far as it did, because maybe that could have been a bit...

532
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's probably not going to sell as well anymore, either.

533
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Harmonic's not having a good week this week. They are not having a good week. I feel bad, I do.

534
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I hope Chroma makes you billions, Harmonic.

535
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Here's the thing. Okay, so, the stuff that they're talking about, at least on the games with gold stuff, it's not new, though.

536
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
They're saying that they're going to have free games and monthly deals and other benefits.

537
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That's the same shit they have right now. It's exactly the same.

538
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
In fact, the only difference right now between what it was and what they're announcing is that,

539
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
oh, by the way, you're not going to be able to keep those games.

540
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's really it. That is the only thing.

541
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There's not a... It doesn't say that they're going to be building this online library.

542
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Like, for example, these new games that are out in June or whatever, those aren't going to be there in July.

543
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You know, it's not like this virtual library that the PlayStation Plus has.

544
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's just, now, I can't keep those games.

545
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
That's really the only announcement.

546
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You know, the fucking deals that they have and shit, it's not new.

547
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
They already have that. It's already out there.

548
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
In fact, I'm not even sure if you have to have gold to participate in those deals in the first place.

549
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But that just seems really stupid.

550
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They're not differentiating themselves.

551
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
They're doing exactly the same as the PlayStation 4.

552
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
To be honest, Loki, a lot of that is secondary.

553
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm going to just keep it real. A lot of that stuff is secondary.

554
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And what it really comes down to is the games.

555
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And if Microsoft wants to differentiate itself from Sony, which I think they absolutely can do, and I think are doing in a way,

556
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
they did come out days later and confirm Halo 5 coming to Xbox One, which I mean, duh.

557
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But it is one of those things where, okay, if you buy an Xbox One, this is something you're not going to get on PlayStation 4.

558
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And I think you're going to see a heck of a lot of this at E3.

559
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I mean, isn't it always? The focus is going to be greatly on exclusives, exclusives, exclusives.

560
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
That's really what it's going to be.

561
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Because now they're the same price point, which, honestly, they came down.

562
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Isn't that funny that that price point drop is timed for the day before their press conference.

563
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
When everybody's going to be talking Microsoft.

564
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Originally, I don't think they were supposed to be coming out and announcing any of this stuff.

565
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think that they had to kind of announce it early in order to kind of...

566
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Prepare the retailers a little bit, probably.

567
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Well, not even that. They could do that anyways.

568
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But I think they wanted to come out and do that so that they have a little bit more...

569
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I don't know, get people excited about it and get pre-orders and sales up and stuff.

570
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Because they haven't been really working that well.

571
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,000
But I think, if anything though, now that they've come down $100, you're not going to see a price drop on that system.

572
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But I don't really think you're going to see a price drop on the PlayStation 4 since it's doing so well.

573
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But they could, if they wanted to wiggle the cost down a little bit, they could.

574
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
That's the thing. Sony could really kick Microsoft in the balls right now if they come out at E3 and drop the price of the PlayStation 4.

575
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm with you. I don't think they'll do that.

576
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But there are other ways they could beef up the PlayStation 4.

577
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
For example, a really killer bundle game, which I guess Infamous Second Son would be the prime candidate.

578
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Destiny in a couple of months once we get there.

579
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yeah, that's a good one too. But I could think that they could come out at E3 and say PlayStation 4 now has Infamous Second Son bundled in for free and a terabyte hard drive.

580
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And it's a shiny white or a red or a blue.

581
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And the camera!

582
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Or, yeah, they bundle the camera in.

583
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
There are other ways that Sony could sweeten the pot without necessarily just flat out dropping the price.

584
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
The same way that we use drop the price.

585
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And that could be a kick in the balls to Microsoft.

586
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But, you know, I'm still looking at this going,

587
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Hey, I kind of want to get an Xbox One because I know by next year I'm going to want to play Halo 5.

588
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm going to want to play Quantum Break. I want to play Sunset Overdrive.

589
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
There's enough games coming for Xbox One that are exclusive that I want to check out.

590
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
So I know I'll get an Xbox One eventually.

591
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
And this news about the Kinect, I'm like, great, I was over that Kinect shit.

592
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So I'm excited for that.

593
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Yes, how many times did they trick me into buying a camera?

594
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Hmm?

595
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
How many times did they trick me into buying a camera?

596
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Right. Which, you know, to be fair, I did search high and low to get a camera for the PlayStation 4.

597
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But it was, you know, something new.

598
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That whole live streaming with the camera.

599
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That whole experience that I hadn't been able to do before.

600
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That was my main motivator. Not any of the games.

601
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The games was just icing on the cake.

602
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So.

603
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But, you know, now that I have that camera on the PlayStation 4, that's even more like...

604
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Here's the thing, though. Like, their main thing with, you know, the Xbox One,

605
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
this is kind of one of the reasons why I'm not that into the Xbox One as I was with the Xbox 360,

606
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
is that, hey, look, it's like Windows 8 stuff.

607
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You can run all these Windows 8 apps in there.

608
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Okay, I got to tell you, I have Windows 8 on my laptop.

609
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't run any of the Windows 8 apps. Ever. None of them.

610
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I do not even touch that stupid Metro interface.

611
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Maybe I run Skype, and that is pretty much the only Windows 8 app.

612
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
In fact, anything that they have that's defaulted in there to auto-open with the Windows 8 thing,

613
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I find the older version that's on, you know, the laptop.

614
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You know, the stuff that's been around for ages now.

615
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Like, you know, any of the picture viewers and stuff.

616
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And I defaulted to that.

617
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's just, I don't think people are going to be using the Xbox One to Skype with each other.

618
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Can you just, I'm sorry, now I just can't get the image out of my head,

619
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and I just, can you imagine Jack Tretton coming out, which I know he isn't the Sony guy anymore,

620
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
but just bear with me here, because this is the image I have in my mind, because I go back to last year's E3.

621
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Can you imagine Jack Tretton coming out at E3, smug motherfucker,

622
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
coming out on stage and being like, PlayStation 4, we thought we'd bundle the camera with it,

623
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
give it the same price, like right after Microsoft test out.

624
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Can you imagine that?

625
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
We believe that the camera is an integral part of, you know, the PlayStation experience.

626
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
They should bring Jack Tretton back just to be a smug motherfucker, to get up on stage and be like,

627
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
we're going to give a camera away with every PlayStation 4.

628
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And hell, we can even get the actor playing Kevin Butler to come up.

629
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
He can give him a high five or something.

630
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You know, flip off Microsoft, you know, and just...

631
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Two years of Sony digs in a row at Microsoft would be pretty unreal.

632
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We'll see.

633
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I have to say, like, right now, like, if I had to choose, if someone said,

634
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
okay, here's, you know, $400, pick a system to buy, I'm going to buy a PlayStation 4.

635
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Just because, you know, spec-wise, between even the same games we're running on both platforms,

636
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
it runs better on PlayStation 4, and...

637
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I don't know, I'm not a huge Halo fan.

638
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Although, another Crackdown game.

639
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
That could be interesting.

640
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And I just want to be extra clear, because the chat room's like, I just want to be crystal clear.

641
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I do not expect Sony to actually do that with a bundle in the camera.

642
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That would be a huge cost.

643
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
No one would care.

644
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Yeah, I just, in my head, it's funny.

645
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
It's funny in my head.

646
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Because you know they've got to do something smug this year, like they did last year.

647
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So, I just, in my head, it's funny.

648
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
All right.

649
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Anyhow, going over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

650
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
sg100matt says, I'm sure they have several different plans that will be enacted depending on how the other responds.

651
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh, you bet.

652
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You know, there are rumors that Sony had three slides with three different prices for the PlayStation 4 ready to go.

653
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And they were waiting to see what Microsoft was going to do.

654
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So, I mean, rumors, but I wouldn't doubt at all that that's how the game works, folks.

655
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I wouldn't doubt at all.

656
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So, sg100matt also said earlier, to be devil's advocate, what if this new bundle is just an entry point for people who are on the fence?

657
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Maybe they want to get people playing the system to show them that a Kinect could improve their entertainment experience.

658
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Perhaps this might be a long-term strategy.

659
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I think, yeah, it's like the 4GIG system, basically.

660
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Kinect was a huge selling peripheral the past few years.

661
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So, I mean, there is credit to that line of thought, and I wouldn't discount it.

662
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
They always have a multi-skew strategy.

663
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And here's the other thing, too, to keep in mind.

664
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
The version that does have Kinect has a game bundled with it.

665
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It has fours of five, or it's got Titanfall.

666
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
This new one, I don't think has anything bundled with it.

667
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
So, you're kind of losing out on top of that.

668
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
You're losing out on a free game.

669
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Interesting.

670
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Interesting point, because I heard that one of our local retailers, Fry's,

671
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I saw Flaco Jones say something during Bobby's show that Fry's was selling the current Xbox Ones for $430 with Kinect.

672
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
But I wonder if that's the skew before Titanfall was bundled in with it.

673
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I wonder if that was the old skew.

674
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, it probably was.

675
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
So, very interesting.

676
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
All right, we'll see.

677
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
All right, well, I got a Dark Sakura.

678
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You've been quiet during that segment, but I know you're not the hugest,

679
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
just like, I've got to get an Xbox One right now.

680
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But any thoughts on the price drop and the value of Kinect to the Xbox One or any of that?

681
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's just more business.

682
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I mean, it's meant to fool people who are on the fence.

683
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That's exactly what it is.

684
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
In the end, if people want the system, they're going to buy the system.

685
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
It doesn't matter what the price point is.

686
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It depends on how much they want it.

687
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I think that on-the-fence statement is very important because it goes to show why,

688
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
two days later, they come out and say,

689
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Sorry, I know I'm jacking one of your news stories later, Loki,

690
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
but we all know Halo 5 was announced, too.

691
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Yeah, we're well aware that it was announced last year that it was coming out.

692
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's total shocking news that it was at E3 last year.

693
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
But why reiterate it now?

694
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Because, like Jamie says, it's to win the people that are on the fence.

695
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because now we know it's called Halo 5.

696
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh, my God, I couldn't figure out that the next Halo after 4 was going to be 5.

697
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Wait, wait, wait.

698
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Guardians?

699
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I love the Guardian legend.

700
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh, my God.

701
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Don't worry, it's not the last Guardian.

702
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
It's actually coming out.

703
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
The third Xbox is the Xbox One, so surely this is Halo 1 again.

704
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
No, but here's the thing.

705
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It's like...

706
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh, crap, I lost my train of thought.

707
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Whatever, who gives a shit?

708
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
If you have more thoughts on this, of course, we'll be taking calls later in the show

709
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
at 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

710
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and of course our email bag, always open to you.

711
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

712
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Meanwhile, we are going to move on to the show, because believe it or not,

713
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
outside these two huge topics, there's still plenty of other stuff going on in gaming

714
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
we had to get to.

715
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Outside this hour that we've already killed.

716
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I know, right?

717
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I knew it was going to be one of those nights.

718
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Well, let's try to go around quickly.

719
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
We always like to, at the top of the show, kind of establish the frame of reference

720
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
we're all in this week by sharing with you our gaming weeks

721
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
and the type of video games we've been playing this week.

722
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

723
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
What have you been up to?

724
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
It was actually...

725
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I've had another busy week, so I did play some...

726
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I actually haven't touched Animal Crossing.

727
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Can you believe it?

728
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Because I've been playing Bravely Default a little bit.

729
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
There's going to be weeds.

730
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Well, you know what, that's a good excuse.

731
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm not going to have weeds because I have the perfect village

732
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
and I have the pretty village ordinance.

733
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Which I guess I should check on my villagers and see if that diva bitch left yet.

734
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I played some Mass Effect just to find out that my mods weren't working again.

735
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Tried to play some Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm in the really shitty boring part

736
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
where I have to gain another level and a quarter before I can do more story quests.

737
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Something to try, because there is that big lull between 40 and 50,

738
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
something to try. See if you can trigger any of the dailies

739
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
because I want to say the Kobold dailies start at 41

740
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
and that's at least three more quests you can do.

741
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Oh yeah, I've got the soulless ones.

742
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Oh, there you go.

743
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The little soulless ones. I keep forgetting about them.

744
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I just hate that whole area.

745
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, they refresh every day so it'll help push you over the limit a little bit.

746
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Yeah, but mostly I've just been running around looking at fates and...

747
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Fates are good.

748
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Looking at fates and...

749
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I still find pretty areas in that game I haven't seen before.

750
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I was trying to finish my hunting log because I only have the last two, the 48 and 49.

751
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Nice.

752
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, the 49 and 50 I guess. Whatever the last two are.

753
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But they're in like, two of the critters are in this back corner

754
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
that you have to go through all of these things to kill before you can remotely get there

755
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and I think I just need to have someone covering my ass so I can get there and kill it.

756
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
If you need a bodyguard, Jamie, just remember...

757
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I...

758
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
No.

759
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Will always cure you.

760
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
You know what?

761
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Please don't do that.

762
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Nobody does that song like Dolly Parton.

763
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So stop it.

764
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
They need a little more country twang next time.

765
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Nobody can touch Dolly.

766
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Not even dead Whitney.

767
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Aww.

768
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Unless Dolly was crack, in which case...

769
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Y'all are disrespectful.

770
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Alright.

771
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

772
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Oh come on, who was the people who had RIP Whitney as a death knight?

773
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That was not me, I have RIP Betty White.

774
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That was me actually.

775
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
RIP Betty White I have on hold just because we all know it's going to happen.

776
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I think I actually had RIP Whitney now that I think about it.

777
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Oops.

778
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Alright.

779
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
By the way, we had all these death knights on World of Warcraft and we were all playing that.

780
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And like one day somebody thought, oh would it be funny to roll all these RIP characters for people that aren't dead yet but will probably be dead soon.

781
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And of course, Jamie, anyway.

782
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I think somebody had RIP Lindsay, but I don't know.

783
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Anyway.

784
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Jamie won the lottery on that one.

785
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Jamie won the lottery.

786
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Alright.

787
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Loki.

788
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I've only played a little bit of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, in which case I kicked everybody's ass in multiple games several times over, score capping everything.

789
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,000
I have to say from chat, live.vognetware.com, Dark Tetsuya is like, wow, that took a dark turn.

790
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Did a little bit.

791
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It was a little bit of a dark place.

792
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Dark Sakura, hello.

793
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Alright, sorry, Loki.

794
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But yeah, mostly it was just programming.

795
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Like I said earlier that I was working on my object editor, which I just finished building a copy and paste function.

796
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So that's cool, I guess.

797
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:12,000
The only thing I have to do left on that, I guess, is actually have to replace all the prefabs I have with ones that are split up by triangles so that I can run a script in there to detect which pieces of geometry are actually hidden inside the object so that it removes all the end nodes.

798
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So that it removes all the unnecessary faces off there.

799
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That's about it, I think.

800
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah.

801
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Isn't programming fun and exciting?

802
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Yeah, I enjoy it.

803
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I'm actually learning quite a bit.

804
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And a lot of it I'm kind of like, oh, okay, well, how do I do this?

805
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And then I look it up and I figure that out.

806
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:38,000
And then a lot of times now, even with some of these things, I'm just kind of figuring it out on my own now.

807
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I'm able to solve my own problems in here.

808
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And it's like, I don't actually know how to do this now.

809
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
But then again, I kind of have to wonder, you know, how limited C Sharp is in...

810
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I mean, it's not limited in Unity, but a lot of it's just kind of just, okay, pointing variable to variable and stuff like that.

811
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I don't know.

812
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm sure it's way different, you know, outside of Unity.

813
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
All right, I'll do my gaming week and then we'll wrap up with Jason.

814
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
My gaming week, not really a lot of new games, but I've been playing a lot of old standbys.

815
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Diablo 3, I've been playing a lot of this week.

816
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
We'll talk about this a little more in detail later in the show, but they're having like a weekend where you can get increased legendary drops.

817
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So of course, you know, I had to check that out and a lot of my friends are playing that right now too.

818
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
In the Blizzard camp, I've also been playing the Heroes of the Storm alpha.

819
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I've unlocked the daily quests.

820
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So I actually like, I have that thing where I can get gold by playing as a Starcraft character today or playing as a support character today.

821
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Kind of encourages you to try new things.

822
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But look, I know Heroes of the Storm is an alpha, so I don't want to be too critical of it because there's a lot in testing.

823
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But I really need a way to report players.

824
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Most of the players in the game have been really good so far.

825
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:55,000
But once in a while, and last night I had a real jerk off that was playing the game, that just flat out called me out, was like, you suck, you're awful at this.

826
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And I said, wow, you're really motivating me to do better.

827
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And I just followed him the entire rest of the match.

828
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And I still participated. I did, you know, stuff. I just followed him the entire rest of the match.

829
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I just, you know, call me a troll or whatever. That's fine.

830
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But it's kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, when you're negative to people, you're going to lose.

831
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And I tell you what, every instance I've had in that game so far, if somebody is negative, we lose.

832
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
If everybody's like positive, like, hey, I mean, I'm not talking about like you have to be like, I love you so much.

833
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
OMG, you guys are the bestest ever. It doesn't even have to be like that.

834
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Just like, hey, how's it going? You know, going top. We need more on mid.

835
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
You know, if people like play that way, win every time. Every time.

836
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So, but right now, because it's an alpha, we don't have a way to report people.

837
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And it kind of, it really like grinds my gears because, you know, it's really hard to get in the hero's alpha.

838
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You basically have to win the lottery right now.

839
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So why there's these toxic people that are being let in when there's other people I know that really want to play,

840
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
and really want to test, and really want to get the most out of the game.

841
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
They can't get in. It's very frustrating.

842
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:02,000
So, hopefully Blizzard's going to pull back the curtain a little bit and show us what they plan to do to quell the, you know,

843
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
MOBA trend that unfortunately has taken hold of a lot of those games.

844
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And that is that most of them are pretty toxic.

845
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So, don't be a dick, you guys.

846
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Alright, and let's see. Otherwise, more Final Fantasy XIV.

847
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Although, I really hit a wall with Endgame this week.

848
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
It was like, I really don't want to pull this boss anymore.

849
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I am so, I'm so over it.

850
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Overit.com.

851
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
So, I kind of need a new patch to get here soon, but it's coming.

852
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
So, I don't know how the Warcraft people are doing it.

853
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
They're on the same raid and they're going on like nine months now.

854
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Although, I will say.

855
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We've done it.

856
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I will, well, yeah.

857
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And I will say, funny enough.

858
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Okay, here's what's really weird and I'm totally going to get judged for this.

859
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,000
But, like, I've kind of been flirting with the idea of going back to WoW just for a little bit.

860
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Just because I haven't played for a few months.

861
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So, all that stuff is kind of new to me.

862
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And it's like, well, when I've kind of hit the end of my creative juices with this MMO.

863
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Kind of makes me want to go back and see my old MMO and check in with all the people I still know that are over there.

864
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I don't know.

865
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Such is the life of an MMO player, I guess.

866
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Then I wonder why I don't get any other games played.

867
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So, alright.

868
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You can help me finish my levels.

869
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
That would be fun.

870
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I offered to be your bodyguard, but then everybody was like, shut up, Rob.

871
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
No, they were telling you to stop singing.

872
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I will only bodyguard if I can sing.

873
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
You can sing, but I don't have to have the mic on.

874
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I am a bard, you guys.

875
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That's what we do.

876
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Alright.

877
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Jason, how was your gaming week?

878
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I feel strange because I actually had quite a prolific gaming week.

879
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Which is against the grain of everything you guys have said before.

880
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And also against the grain for me while I'm out here.

881
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But, I actually played quite a couple of interesting things.

882
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
A little bit more Titanfall.

883
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I streamed a little bit on Saturday.

884
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I don't think I have announcements set up, so you just kind of have to know to look.

885
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And that's obviously not the easiest thing.

886
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Unless somebody's actually subscribed to me, which would surprise me a lot.

887
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I made a couple of clips.

888
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I recorded a couple of local clips and then I clipped one of the streams from Twitch onto

889
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
onto Twitch's recorded videos that isn't the entire stream.

890
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Whatever.

891
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Anyways, Titanfall is fun.

892
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That's the story here.

893
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I started into Crypt of the NecroDancer that I've been meaning to for a little while.

894
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And after getting acquainted with the way that that game worked, I proceeded to go to

895
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
the forums.

896
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I was thinking about reporting a bug, but it's something that's going to be fixed in

897
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
a future release anyways because the game is still being active developed.

898
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Whatever.

899
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I am fucking terrible at Crypt of the NecroDancer.

900
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I pay so much attention to the rhythm of the game that I know I understand the patterns

901
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
of the enemies, but they still just completely destroy me.

902
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Jamie in her classic game of the week last week was talking about Rogue.

903
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rhythm roguelike.

904
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I didn't know that game was out.

905
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Is that on Steam?

906
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Pre-order.

907
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Pre-order Alpha.

908
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Oh, okay.

909
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
And you actually can't buy it right now?

910
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Pre-orders were open for a certain amount of time.

911
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
All of those players have Alpha.

912
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
You should have pre-ordered it when I talked about it on the game three months ago.

913
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I just forgot.

914
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
So shoot me.

915
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It'll be out.

916
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
And I'm starting to look at how custom songs are going to work to make things really fucking

917
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
crazy.

918
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So I go on the forums to report a bug and I'm just kind of poking around looking at

919
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
other threads and there are people that are already just completely destroying the game.

920
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
There was a forum post titled Hardcore Shmardcore, something silly like that, that somebody has

921
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
already thoroughly decimated Hardcore with no, you know, without dying all of the powerups,

922
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
all of the items and all that kind of stuff.

923
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I can't even get past the fucking second dungeon of that game.

924
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
It's the exact same thing as Binding of Isaac and it's the weirdest thing.

925
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
But yes, Script of the Necrodancer is quite fun.

926
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I have high hopes for it and I'm going to keep continuing to play it because it's worthwhile.

927
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
A little bit more Hearthstone but nothing particularly interesting to say about that.

928
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And then there was something else on something that I played but nothing new and I don't

929
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
think, obviously there wasn't anything interesting to say about it if I can't even think of it.

930
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Probably FTL, which I am also still completely terrible at.

931
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You might be proud of me a little bit.

932
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I didn't talk about it during my game of week because I literally played like five minutes

933
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
of it but I did buy Titanfall this week on PC.

934
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Yeah, because Origin have that Please Play Origin sale where like a lot of their games

935
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
are 40% off so I picked up...

936
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
We still exist!

937
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Please Play Origin.

938
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So I picked it up for like 35 bucks.

939
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I was like, all right, I want to...

940
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I need something that will really push my new computer to its limits.

941
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So I only played through the tutorial and then I tried to do a match but I was having

942
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
connection problems.

943
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It was like Origin can't connect.

944
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Which, you know, as much as I want to come on here and go, LOL Origin, our internet was

945
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
acting a little wonky so I'm going to give it a pass this time.

946
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But I'll try to get in there later.

947
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
It is weird though how you can only play campaign multiplayer.

948
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
It's a little weird but all right, I'll try it.

949
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And if you win or lose it doesn't actually change the flow of the campaign.

950
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
That's good.

951
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah, you just...

952
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
The mech battle stuff is interesting.

953
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's interesting.

954
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
They're kind of a lot of fun to control.

955
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
The tutorial was neat.

956
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
The agility in that game, like all of the agility and all of the stunts really, really

957
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
do it for me.

958
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Because Mirror's Edge was fun but it was a little bit heavy.

959
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And you get all of the benefit of all of this fancy...

960
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
You know, it's faster than Halo.

961
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:18,000
And there's more maneuverability on building sides and double jumping and grappling up

962
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
the corners, all that kind of stuff.

963
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
And I don't call titans down very often in that game.

964
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I just kind of stick to my guns, literally and figuratively.

965
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I stay on foot and I do what I can.

966
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Rodeoing a titan is fucking fantastic.

967
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't know what it is but that really, really makes the game for me.

968
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,000
If I don't doom a titan when I'm rodeoing it, if that's even proper conjugation.

969
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
When I rodeo a titan, if I don't doom it, I'm not pissed off because the whole process

970
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
is just fun.

971
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The ability to just kind of be on a rooftop, see that an enemy titan's coming that way.

972
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Banzai!

973
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Right on top of it and into it just...

974
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't know.

975
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I fell out of first person shooters more or less a while ago.

976
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I enjoy Titanfall thoroughly.

977
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
That's quite the endorsement.

978
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I still think a PS4 is the better investment in the first place.

979
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And I have Titanfall on the 360 but all of my friends that do as well have it on the one.

980
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Well, besides you.

981
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But I don't have a PC.

982
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I think it's just because I have access to an Xbox One and I have literally, still, never played a PS4.

983
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But I'm getting very, very...

984
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
There's one in the other room.

985
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I made time for Scandia today and the show and not the PS4, unfortunately.

986
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah, I still to this day have not touched a PS4.

987
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And the Xbox Ones that we have at work, I played with a friend in person.

988
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,000
We have two of them at work now and so we both had our dedicated TV and Xbox One.

989
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I didn't really chime into the Kinect argument because I was just going to say the same thing.

990
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I don't mind the Kinect being around.

991
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I'm signed in instantly as soon as the console is warmed up.

992
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
There's still some weird flow-y things with the way that the console operates.

993
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:13,000
But the Kinect, the Xbox One, live streaming Titanfall, having a pretty fucking good time.

994
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Kind of really like it.

995
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But that's the only thing I'm doing besides Peggle to cool down anything else until...

996
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't even know.

997
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Sunset Overdrive is probably the only other game on the Xbox One that I'm specifically fixated on.

998
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Just to be fair, PlayStation 4 also has the instant sign-in if you have a camera.

999
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Because it'll see you.

1000
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It'll see you and you hold the controller up.

1001
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Like when I go sit on the couch and I turn it on, it draws a box around my face and it goes,

1002
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Rob Roberts! And then I hold up the controller and it flashes and it knows what controller I'm holding.

1003
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Why can't they just have a default to one user profile like the Xbox and the PlayStation 3 did?

1004
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
You would think.

1005
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's so difficult, this technology.

1006
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
If you don't have the camera, it will come up and you can pick.

1007
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And I like having my own profile.

1008
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I've always been annoyed that Nintendo, the Wii so specifically, only has one profile.

1009
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And you have to choose a different character.

1010
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Even multiplayer games fixate around one profile.

1011
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Anyways, I definitely want to make an investment in something soon.

1012
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Obviously I can get by with Titanfall on the 360.

1013
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
But I don't know.

1014
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
We'll see once the money is actually there to be able to do it.

1015
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Which is not going to be anytime soon.

1016
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Yeah, speaking of which, I want to get into housekeeping here real quick.

1017
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Before we get into the rest of the news tonight.

1018
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
For housekeeping tonight, we will be here for the next few weeks.

1019
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I mentioned that we might be off.

1020
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
That is not going to happen after all.

1021
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So we're going to be working pretty hard over the next few weeks.

1022
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Part of that reason is that VoG will be represented at E3 this year.

1023
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
We're going to have 2.5 times the manpower this year that we had last year.

1024
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
So that's going to be great.

1025
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So check that out.

1026
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
You can see what we did last year.

1027
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
E3.vognetwork.com.

1028
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And we plan to do something very similar this year.

1029
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
We'll have more details probably next week or the week after.

1030
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Either on Bobby's show or here on OLR.

1031
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But I'm going to be there.

1032
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Bobby's going to be there.

1033
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Jason's going to be there.

1034
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So unfortunately Dark Sakura and Loki cannot be there.

1035
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But they'll be watching from home.

1036
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
And we'll give their commentary that Sunday on the program.

1037
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
And we will be back.

1038
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I will be back from E3 in time that Sunday.

1039
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
We will have a proper wrap up show.

1040
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
We don't want to commit to doing anything from E3 as far as broadcast goes.

1041
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Because we're trying to keep ourselves pretty busy.

1042
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
What we're trying to do is we're trying to line up people for the shows for the coming months.

1043
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
So although you may feel like I wanted to get my E3 shows during the time.

1044
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Well you will have all the information on the website where you can ask questions.

1045
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And we're hoping to really bring content to the shows over the coming months.

1046
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So it's kind of an investment sort of thing.

1047
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
But we're really looking forward to that.

1048
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So I'm excited.

1049
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Also I know some of the other VoG people.

1050
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I keep focusing on us.

1051
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But I do know Electric Sisterhood is going to be there too.

1052
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I don't know who else from the network.

1053
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I think that's it from our network that's going to be there.

1054
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But I don't want to leave out ESH.

1055
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
They are going to be there.

1056
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
But they do because they do a lot of written content for their own site.

1057
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
They kind of focus on that.

1058
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So we don't rope them into the VoG coverage.

1059
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
But you'll hear stuff on their show for sure.

1060
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So shout out to the lovely ladies at Electric Sisterhood Tuesdays on VoG.

1061
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I think that's it. I think that's all I have.

1062
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,000
So let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

1063
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Loki.

1064
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So there's a rumor.

1065
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I mean, you know, originally it was going to be that I thought they were talking about Halo 2,

1066
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
the anniversary edition of that coming out on Xbox One or something.

1067
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Well now they're going to have apparently this rumored Halo Master Chief collection that's going to be coming out Xbox One.

1068
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I don't know if you can call it HD remaster, but HD remastered versions of Halo Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo 4.

1069
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
HD-er.

1070
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And apparently it's not going to include Halo Region and Halo 3 ODST.

1071
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:17,000
And I guess that's supposed to be coming out maybe on Xbox One at some point in time for Halo 5 Guardian,

1072
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
which they announced the title and have a little picture.

1073
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It's supposed to be coming out in the fall of 2015, though.

1074
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So if you were thinking that's going to be the big fall title for Xbox One, nope.

1075
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
No, sounds like this Halo 1 through 4 compilation.

1076
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:43,000
If it's true, which, you know, again, you kind of have to weigh what's the source it's coming from and how much do I kind of put credit in it.

1077
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
It definitely sounds plausible. It doesn't sound illogical.

1078
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,000
We've already heard rumors before about a Halo 2 HD, so it being expanded to include 3 and 4.

1079
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Technically, it's possible that they will still do the Halo 2 HD for the Xbox 360, and then the Xbox One, which would make sense.

1080
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Xbox One would contain the Xbox 360 Halo anniversary, Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3 and Halo 4, since it would be harder to redo all the visuals for 2.

1081
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I would have thought it would have just been an engine like Halo 4, since it's the newest, maybe up-res for Xbox One, and then it just has all the old maps.

1082
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I kind of thought that's where it would end up going, but I guess if they really do put all four complete games in there for $60, that's a pretty darn good deal, especially to catch people up.

1083
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And on the Xbox One, Halo 2 on Xbox Live now would be a great asset.

1084
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:49,000
It's too bad, though, that the multiplayer in that game wouldn't beat all of the Halo maps in the Halo 4 engine or something like that. That would be pretty awesome.

1085
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Kaijuto in chat at live.fognetwork.com says, isn't Halo 3, Reach, and 4 already all HD?

1086
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Now remember, Loki said HD-er.

1087
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
HD-er.

1088
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
HD-er.

1089
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I don't know. See, that's the thing. I don't understand.

1090
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
1080p, 60fps, OMG.

1091
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Well, no, no, hold on, hold on. This is the Xbox One we're talking about here, so that's not a guarantee at all.

1092
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I mean, there's no guarantee that's going to be 60fps or 1080p, native 1080p.

1093
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:26,000
So, I don't know, but, yeah, Halo. So expect some Halo in your future.

1094
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:33,000
But really, is a compilation of games that they've already put out really going to sell you on Xbox One? I don't think so.

1095
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
It wouldn't, go back to Jamie's On the Fence comment from earlier.

1096
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It definitely sways somebody who's on the fence like me.

1097
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Like, it's another one of those things where I'm like, well, if I get it, I'm not going to get an Xbox One just for this.

1098
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,000
But, if I get an Xbox One and I want to play Killer Instinct and I want to play Quantum Break, shit, now I can get Halo 1 through 4 as well?

1099
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Ooh, that's a pretty good argument.

1100
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
You know, that's kind of what it does.

1101
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I think they'll sell a lot. The Halo 2 part of that, I mean, like Kaijuto said, Halo 3 and 4 are already HD. What's the big deal there?

1102
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
For me, it's the Halo 2 end of it is really the centerpiece of that whole collection.

1103
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
What if you get extra pink armor?

1104
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
More pinker?

1105
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
More pinkier.

1106
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
What if it's like in multiple hues of pink and purple?

1107
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
I would so be there.

1108
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
What if you can add sparkles?

1109
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Collect hearts and bunnies and all the little symbols.

1110
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
What if you can have bling armor?

1111
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Oh, now sparkles, you had the symbols in Halo, but you never had the sparkles.

1112
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I thought they had something, it was burning. They had fire, which was a special bungee Halo 3 helmet that you could get.

1113
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Somebody did a mod for Mass Effect 3 where all the armor is sparkly and blinged out, like it's made out of jewels.

1114
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:00,000
They should do that for Halo, and then I would buy it.

1115
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Ikuma JP in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Hello Kitty Halo.

1116
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Alright, you guys are...

1117
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
I'm interested in it, but it's one of those things where it's like, well, if I get an Xbox One, I'll just pick this up too.

1118
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I like your bear pants.

1119
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I was wondering if anybody was going to bring up the PJs again this time.

1120
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Okay, so Jason's here because he is visiting California. He's doing laundry outside during the show.

1121
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I'm going to take a picture of your bear pants, your bear leg.

1122
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Last week, Jason had these like chili pajama bottoms that he was like, like little, like the restaurant chilis, like pepper chilis.

1123
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Whole chilis, not cut chilis.

1124
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Yeah, that was where they had, and this week he has the bears or whatever.

1125
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It's just really funny to me because he had pants on when the show started, so he changed pants in the garage into these bear PJs and then came back in the studio.

1126
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Right on the other side of the wall from your head.

1127
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Gross, but...

1128
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Hey, who was the one that was talking about the short situation?

1129
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
The fact that I'm sewing...

1130
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
As soon as the show's over, woo!

1131
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
You know with Horde House, I don't have to wear pants.

1132
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Hey, do you know how many times I've done remote ends for OLR, like when I've been on the show on my house, where I've had no bra?

1133
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Seriously, who wants any of that crap on when you're at home?

1134
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Dark Sakura's not wearing pants right now.

1135
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Actually, I'm wearing shorts under my skirt. I'm wearing an amazing floofy skirt.

1136
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
She's wearing a floofy...

1137
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
The very Renaissance festival.

1138
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
That's actually what it's from. This skirt is now four sizes too big for me.

1139
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I feel like you should do some twirl dancing in that skirt or something.

1140
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I might catch fire and turn into a Mockingjay.

1141
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Alright, let's move on to some more news. So, we'll see what happens with the Halo.

1142
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Hey, I mentioned earlier in the show, Diablo 3 was having a very special weekend this weekend, and it is the legendary event to celebrate the second birthday of Diablo 3.

1143
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Or for many of us, the rebirth of a game that was mediocre the first time, that after some patching and removal of the auction house and so forth, now kicks a lot of ass after its latest expansion.

1144
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
So, 100% increase to legendary drops. That's going on right now, and it runs through Thursday.

1145
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
So, if you haven't checked out Diablo 3 in a while, now's a good time to get back on there.

1146
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You do not have to have the expansion for that, although you do have to have the expansion for Adventure mode, which is really all I ever play now.

1147
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
That means now I have to install that on my computer.

1148
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Actually, there's plenty of people at Locat who are playing it on their computers at work during lunch.

1149
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:35,000
You know, it's funny because you brought up roguelikes last week in Rogue in your Classic Game of the Week, and this is like one of the kings of roguelikes, really.

1150
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And it really is just such an easy game, especially with Adventure mode, to just kind of go in and do a rift, mindless, get some upgrades, and then I'm done.

1151
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It's a great little time killer. So, yeah, that's part of it.

1152
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:56,000
But the other part of this is that maybe if you don't want this on PC or whatever, you're more of a console gamer, maybe you've been wondering when is this coming out on PlayStation 4 because they talked about this a long time ago.

1153
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Well, guess what? They finally announced Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls The Ultimate Evil Edition is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as 360 and PS3, which already had Diablo 3.

1154
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:17,000
The release date? August 19th. This will include the Reaper of Souls expansion, and this will be Diablo 3's first foray on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1155
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Now, you might be thinking, well, do I have to own Diablo 3 on 360 or PS3 to have this?

1156
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And the answer is no, you don't. And then the second thought is, well, great, I'm screwed because now I already bought Diablo 3, I gotta buy it again.

1157
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yes, but the good news is that it will be cheaper. It will be only $40 on the 360 and the PlayStation 3.

1158
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Or as it will be the full 60 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but it will be game plus expansion.

1159
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, but you know what? $40 buys lunch for two weeks.

1160
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And it buys the PC version too, so something to think about.

1161
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Inferno Pauldrons will be granted to your account if you pre-order now, so there you go.

1162
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:04,000
And Diablo 3 currently running on patch 2.0.6, although it should be noted that the PC and the console versions run independently sometimes,

1163
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,000
because the console version runs loot very differently because you don't really have the inventory the same way.

1164
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
The legendary event I just spoke of actually doesn't apply to the console version.

1165
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Console versions are running on version ERR37.

1166
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Don't be a jerk. Alright.

1167
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Bochikawa in chat playing a lot of Diablo apparently. Bochikawa says, got like 20 legendary todays, only using three of them.

1168
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You know, I've been getting legendary patterns out the wazoo.

1169
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Lots and lots and lots and lots of patterns, so that's exciting for the crafty side of me.

1170
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1171
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I'm sorry, I'm just a little horrified about IkumaJP suggesting that all the guys here wear fundoshi.

1172
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Is that like what the sumo...

1173
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, kinda. The ancient Japanese banana hammock.

1174
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Ancient jockstrap, basically.

1175
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1176
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I was just mildly horrified.

1177
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Maybe I'm wearing one of those under my pants.

1178
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Does that explain your no panty lines?

1179
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
No, that's just my big butt.

1180
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Anyway, Path of Exile. That other game.

1181
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Well, it actually has been running a charity for Child's Play and raised $20,000 for Child's Play.

1182
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:29,000
The event started on May 10th and went on until yesterday. Not me yesterday, next Saturday, May 24th.

1183
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Basically, it has an in-game item on sale, the angelic mask that has sold 3600 units.

1184
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:47,000
There's also prizes in there for different drawings. There's a level 15 one that's 100 stash tab bundles.

1185
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It goes up to 35 gets an Nvidia performance card.

1186
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:59,000
The 85 one is an hour private Q&A on Skype with the game makers, so pretty cool deal.

1187
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Not too late to check it out.

1188
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Not too late to buy stuff for kids.

1189
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
That's really neat that they're turning that into a charity. Those are the types of things that sound like Kickstarter rewards, but it's all going more to a charity benefit.

1190
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:21,000
If you don't like the $40, you just joked earlier, $40 could buy a heck of a lot. Path of Exile is free to check out.

1191
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
If you like it, you can give $40 to charity.

1192
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Buy your $5 item and help out some kids.

1193
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
There you go. I think that's great. That's a great use for Path of Exile. Kudos to you guys over there.

1194
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Do you remember kudos, Rob?

1195
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Like the candy bar?

1196
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
They were granola bars, right?

1197
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Those are good.

1198
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Chocolate covered granola bars.

1199
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Every time I hear kudos, I think of those now. Ever since the 80s and I want one.

1200
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
That's funny.

1201
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
They don't make them anymore.

1202
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Every time I hear Oreo, I think about cookies too.

1203
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
You know what? You can bite my big toe.

1204
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Because I stepped in grass today and got a nice big hive on it so you could bite it.

1205
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Oh, you must have been in our backyard.

1206
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
No, I was actually in my front yard because I left my phone at Charlie's.

1207
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Nope.

1208
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
At the restaurant around the corner from my house.

1209
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Nope.

1210
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Thank goodness they found it because I was like, lost mode.

1211
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Have you told all the listeners where you live?

1212
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Don't fucking care.

1213
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Come over and party with Dark Sakura, guys.

1214
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I didn't say what Charlie's exactly was.

1215
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I didn't say exactly where it was.

1216
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I just said it was Charlie's.

1217
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Don't fucking care.

1218
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
If any of you people show up at my house, I'll throw my cat at you.

1219
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Somebody came on here the other day and said,

1220
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Oh, we went to the gym boys down the street.

1221
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I'm like, give away where I live.

1222
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Luckily, there's like 40 gym boys.

1223
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
There's a million gym boys in Sacramento.

1224
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Anyhow, which by the way, that was a good taco.

1225
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And they're not paying me to say that.

1226
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
All right, Loki.

1227
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yuck.

1228
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,000
All right.

1229
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Well, back on the subject of Halo.

1230
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Halo Collector's Edition, I guess, or Combat Evolved on PC.

1231
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Remember it ran on GameSpy.

1232
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Well, it's actually being taken over now by a third-party company, Game Ranger,

1233
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
who is going to be doing support for that

1234
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
and allowing that to continue on multiplayer-wise

1235
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
because I know a lot of people are fans of Halo.

1236
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Also, I guess, Lost Planet 3 is also moving to a new service

1237
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
to retain its multiplayer.

1238
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Also, Street Fighter 3, third Strike Online Edition,

1239
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,000
and Marvel vs. Capcom Origins are all migrating away.

1240
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
But Age of Booty and Flock, not so much.

1241
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And then, let's see, Mortal Kombat also is going to be moving off of GameSpy servers.

1242
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Of course, that's the last Mortal Kombat game to come out,

1243
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Mortal Kombat 9, I guess, if you would.

1244
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And although after, I guess, May 31st, the Vita version, though,

1245
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
is only going to support ad hoc multiplayer,

1246
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
that is not getting its multiplayer fix.

1247
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But for all the other versions, though, they are migrating away from GameSpy.

1248
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It's interesting to hear about all these games that are frantically trying to fix themselves

1249
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
to get around GameSpy, which ones have the big enough bases to do it,

1250
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
and which ones are just like, eh, fuck it, it ain't worth the trouble.

1251
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
If you like your games, play them online regularly, or it might happen to you.

1252
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Reminds me, I need to go play more Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.

1253
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
The whole rumor about the trilogy holds true.

1254
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I want there to be a multiplayer renaissance. I hope so.

1255
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Moving on, Jason.

1256
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Quick little fun one.

1257
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I think we've referenced a couple of times about flashing back to the 80s already in this episode.

1258
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
But do it again.

1259
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Go get out your cassette tapes and bring up your VHS players and put on Cyndi Lauper.

1260
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
The Goonies is back.

1261
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Well, sort of.

1262
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:53,000
The game, quite possibly the first game to accompany a film's release in the same year,

1263
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
The Goonies, was updated by Team Sloth recently.

1264
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I'm sorry, Sloth Team, the original Goonies game made by Datasoft,

1265
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,000
has been updated for Windows and Linux with new graphics and sound, and even a couple...

1266
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
It sounds like lowercase from what I remember.

1267
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I should have played the Goonies theme when I played Pop, and it's gonna be a day, if it's even on there.

1268
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
It might not be on there.

1269
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I did get it. Anyways.

1270
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Any excuse to play this song. It's one of my very favorite 80s songs.

1271
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah, it's worth it.

1272
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
And the game has like an 8-bit version of this, which is amazing.

1273
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Well, the old one did.

1274
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I wonder if I have that one. I'm gonna dig for that while you...

1275
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Modern graphics, well, newer graphics, newer sounds, and as I said, a couple of additional levels.

1276
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
All of 20 megabyte download can be yours.

1277
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
So is this a remake of the NES version, or is this like the...

1278
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Oh, they had an arcade version, I thought.

1279
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Was this like a PC only thing?

1280
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,000
This was specifically a PC version that was brought into actual modern compatibility.

1281
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh god, Bobby Blackwolf in chat said,

1282
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
TwitchTube just emailed their copyright strike.

1283
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Yeah, what do you wanna bet? What do you wanna bet?

1284
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That little interlude I just played is gonna strike the episode.

1285
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I'll talk to you in six days then, I guess.

1286
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
God.

1287
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Well, here, let's go for strike two with the 8-bit version.

1288
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Yes.

1289
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Yes!

1290
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
This game, this song actually had a third channel.

1291
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You know, you hear kind of the backbeat.

1292
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah.

1293
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
And the main, but right here...

1294
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Splits into the two harmonies.

1295
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Very fun.

1296
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Love it.

1297
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Love Me Some Goonies.

1298
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
We actually watched that.

1299
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
We've been starting to do a thing at work called Third Thursday,

1300
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
where we all just, all the remote people get together and watch a movie via one of our live streaming sources.

1301
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And I take it back, Goonies wasn't related to that,

1302
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
but The Office watched Goonies in the last two or three months or something like that.

1303
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
It was really fun.

1304
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
I missed Goonies as a kid.

1305
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I've only seen it since I was at least a teenager, or possibly even a young adult.

1306
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
But I've seen it a couple of times in the last decade, and good movie.

1307
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Always good to catch back up with that.

1308
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
I like this story because it always reminds me that there's a scene for these remakes,

1309
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
and there's a lot of very talented people that remake a lot.

1310
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I was looking at the comments, and apparently somebody else had done a Goonies remake not that long ago, too,

1311
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
and had all these MSX game remakes.

1312
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I'm always blown away by the talent of people that take these old video games and remake them just as hobbyist projects.

1313
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I truly don't even understand how it works.

1314
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I get mods, I get game development, not to say I could do it,

1315
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
but I truly do know the pieces that go in together,

1316
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
but to take something like that and completely modernize it,

1317
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I suppose I'm comparing it to how modding worked in the PlayStation world,

1318
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:56,000
where DRM and tricky things to weight off hackers and copiers or anything like that actually became a thing,

1319
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
but back then they were probably really, really raw assets

1320
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
that they could literally just take the time to make look better, slap it into place.

1321
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:11,000
The game's fucking 20 megs. This isn't bolting it onto the Unreal Engine and starting over.

1322
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Good on them. I will have to check that out at some point, because I do like the old games.

1323
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Even the reference to Truffle Shuffle. How could I go without a reference to this article to the Truffle Shuffle?

1324
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Luckily, it's a radio show, so we don't have to see it.

1325
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
What are you insinuating?

1326
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Dark Sakura.

1327
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Well, we do have some good news for our friends in the UK.

1328
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Some good news.

1329
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Well, there is, actually it's already sold out now, but UK...

1330
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Bad news.

1331
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Yeah. Well, there's UK retailer John Lewis selling the Wii U for 112 pounds.

1332
01:19:49,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Marked down from two... going from the 234.95 ones went to 159.95, and the 149.95 ones went to 112.

1333
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
If anyone's curious, 112 pounds is just shy of $200.

1334
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:18,000
So, yeah. That was... it was 8 gigabytes Wii U with New Super Mario Brothers U, and also an 8 gigabyte SD card.

1335
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That is dirt cheap for all that.

1336
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
That is dirt cheap.

1337
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
For the complete bundle and everything else for sub $200, that is fantastic.

1338
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And now they're gone.

1339
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,000
We haven't seen it that low in the US, have we? Craziness.

1340
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Now they're gone.

1341
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Good on you to get to it in time.

1342
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Wow. All right. Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out this week as we look at release dates, and hopefully things that you'll be able to get your hands on before they sell out.

1343
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Yes. Well, this week there's actually not a whole ton coming out, but some good games, starting off with Wolfenstein The New Order, which will be out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC.

1344
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Drakengard 3 on PlayStation 3, and Mugen Souls Z on the Vita. That's it.

1345
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
That's it?

1346
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Yeah. Not a whole ton.

1347
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I guess waiting for summer to officially start before you...

1348
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
But the week after next, Watch Dogs.

1349
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Oh, yeah.

1350
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
That'll be pretty big.

1351
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,000
The Mario Kart 8 right behind you, right?

1352
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Yep. Mario Kart 8 that same week as well, so, yeah.

1353
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
All right.

1354
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Well, let's check out what's coming out in Japan. On the PlayStation 4 this week, Infamous Second Son gets its Japanese release on May 22nd, so you can check that out if you're a PS4 owner in Japan. It's a pretty good game.

1355
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I've only played little bits and pieces of it, but I got into it more than I did the other Infamous games, so there you go.

1356
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:58,000
On the PlayStation 3, it's a soccer full week as World Soccer Winning 11 2014 that comes out this week from Konami, as well as a specialized soccer controller from Hori who does a bunch of those peripheral things, so if you need the ultimate in controlling your soccer games, you have that on the PlayStation 3 this week.

1357
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Nothing on the Xbox 360, but what else is new as far as Japan is concerned?

1358
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:11,000
On the Vita, you have a few things to look forward to, like Amnesia World and To Love Rue Darkness, Battle Ecstasy.

1359
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
To Love Rue Darkness.

1360
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:21,000
To Love Rue Darkness. Well, I keep wanting to say To Love Rue Paul, but that's actually not the case whatsoever, although I don't know, they could be Drag Queens.

1361
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
No.

1362
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
No, it's not. I think it's based on anime, right?

1363
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Yes.

1364
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Yeah, very much so.

1365
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Yes.

1366
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Well, in this one, it's like, you can almost see right up this girl's skirt, it's a little scandalous.

1367
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,000
You are filled with the unsurprising statements of the day in these last two minutes.

1368
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Right?

1369
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I seem to remember that...

1370
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Have you played this game at all?

1371
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I want to say I might have seen an episode or two of the anime. I probably didn't. I'm sure I just saw a reference to it in general.

1372
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Well, the back of the box emphasizes communication, battle, and adventure. So, there you go.

1373
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
In other words, anime girls in hilarious situations?

1374
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
In another anime adventure game. I think you kind of know what you're in for on that.

1375
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Alright, and then on the Wii U this week, well, nothing, but you do have Mario Kart 8 to look forward to worldwide.

1376
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
So, when we get it, you guys are getting it in Japan as well.

1377
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
And last, I was just going to check out the 3DS, because they get some regular releases.

1378
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
World Soccer winning 11 also on the 3DS this week.

1379
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
That's it for Japanese releases.

1380
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1381
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:32,000
In the UK, there is on the 20th of May, there is a transistor for PS4, PC, Wolfenstein The New Order for everything.

1382
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,000
On the 21st, Always Sometimes Monsters on PC.

1383
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
The 23rd, Killer is Dead.

1384
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
And Tropico 5.

1385
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And since this will come out after the 25th has already hit, the 25th has already hit, in the UK, I'll go ahead and say The Inner World will be out on Android.

1386
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Alright.

1387
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:00,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio on Bognetwork.com, use the passphrase, D.A.L.L.

1388
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

1389
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Alright, well this is kind of exciting, but Far Cry 4 has been converted, and ironically enough, it was pretty much what was leaked out months ago.

1390
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Regarding, you know, it's going to take place in the Himalayas.

1391
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Sorry about that, I tried to bring up an article and it played a video. I hate that shit. Sorry about that.

1392
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It will be coming out November 18th on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC.

1393
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And I guess they're saying that, well they haven't really talked too much about who the main character is and stuff.

1394
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But it looks like this very flamboyant dictator of some sort, so...

1395
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Kafka.

1396
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Could be cool.

1397
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Yeah, so I guess they're going to have some pre-order bonuses and that fun stuff.

1398
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Of course.

1399
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
To be continued at E3, I'm sure.

1400
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Alright, one other story here, and that is rumors about the PlayStation 4 camera price going up. Isn't this ironic?

1401
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Through all the joking we were making earlier in the show about, oh, wouldn't that be funny if they gave it away now?

1402
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
There's actually rumors out there that the price is going up.

1403
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Well, what this is coming from is, I guess there was a contest giveaway, and unfortunately I can't bring up that site, because they're one of those horrible sites that has the autoplay videos.

1404
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:28,000
But they had some sort of contest reference, that there was a contest that showed that the approximate retail value of the camera that they were giving away in the contest,

1405
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:35,000
this was some type of official Sony contest, was $69.99, whereas the retail price of those cameras right now, $59.99.

1406
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:43,000
But as we know, a while ago, GameStop, for whatever reason, because those cameras were hard to find for a short time, GameStop jacked up the price $10.

1407
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Was the contest in America?

1408
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I believe so, because I don't think the values would have reflected it otherwise. It would have reflected the local currency.

1409
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But anyway, as we all know, GameStop had jacked up the price $10 for a time. I don't know if they're still doing that.

1410
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'm really not surprised.

1411
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But I will tell you this, I think it could be the case that somebody was just lazy and Googled the price when they were writing those contest instructions.

1412
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:19,000
I don't think they have insider information or something. And I will say this much, I just went to Amazon and looked up a PlayStation 4 camera, and you can even give it for $59.96!

1413
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Three cents off, bitches!

1414
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But yeah, at Amazon.com right now, they're still selling that, and I'm sure lots of other retailers.

1415
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:35,000
So nothing that we've heard of yet regarding the price officially going up. I would just chalk this up to some bad Google foo at Sony.

1416
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And in case you're wondering, yes, it is still $69.99 at GameStop. Or pre-owned for $54.99.

1417
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Well...

1418
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Such a deal.

1419
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Fuck that. It's right there, PlayStation 4 in stock. Is Amazon themselves selling it, or is it one of their retailers?

1420
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
It's ships and sold by Amazon.com.

1421
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And I'm picking on Amazon here, but I imagine Best Buy has them, and maybe Target, and a lot of those other retailers probably have them too.

1422
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:11,000
They're not hard to find anymore. It was the Japanese launch that made them hard to find for a while, and now that's not a problem.

1423
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:18,000
So go get them, if that's what you want. But if you don't, well, you still have a pretty good gaming console.

1424
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane, you guys. We're gonna take a trip back to when you didn't need fancy cameras to play video games.

1425
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:35,000
You didn't need to broadcast yourself online playing a video game, because you know what? Nobody needed to see you swearing like that.

1426
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Or any other part of you on camera.

1427
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:46,000
It's the classic game of the week, and every week Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1428
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Hey, you kids should be playing this game right now, and if you're not, I'm gonna kill you.

1429
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
No. I'm gonna shoot your food.

1430
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Or the lack of eating food will kill you.

1431
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Okay, first I have to tell you what inspired this.

1432
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Okay.

1433
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So I did pick Gauntlet.

1434
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I was playing D&D last night. Yes, I played D&D. Second edition in the house. At my friend's house, technically.

1435
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So anyway, we had zombies coming, and somebody just kept asking,

1436
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Okay, where's the monster generator?

1437
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And I was like, it's fine as long as no one shoots the food.

1438
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And then I started playing this on my phone, and I got 50 experience points. It was awesome.

1439
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Nice.

1440
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
So anyway, yeah, the game is Gauntlet, which I was actually surprised I have not done before.

1441
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And also since the arcade one, as I recall, did not have music, I picked the NES Gauntlet one for having background music.

1442
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:47,000
So you can play as Thor the warrior, Merlin the wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Quester the elf.

1443
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
They have their own powers, their own strengths.

1444
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:58,000
And so you have the warrior, who is the strongest hand-to-hand. The wizard has the best magic, of course.

1445
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
The elf is the fastest, and the Valkyrie has the best armor.

1446
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,000
So basically, you have to go through giant mazes and kill a bunch of creatures.

1447
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
And you have to destroy the generators in them, so that they just don't keep throwing shit at you.

1448
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
There are no bosses, but you do have an enemy that is just called death.

1449
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:23,000
That will drain your health, but is... you can kill it. You can kill death. You can kill death in the face.

1450
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:32,000
So basically, when your health reaches zero, you die. You can put in another coin and get another life.

1451
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:43,000
So basically, it's just a really... I'm not the biggest Gauntlet fan, I will admit this, but it is a pretty fun game if you've got other people playing it with you.

1452
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It also had a narrator that used the TMS-5220C speech chip that would say things like,

1453
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Shots do not hurt other players, yet.

1454
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Remember, don't shoot food. Elf, shot the food.

1455
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Remember, don't shoot food.

1456
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Yes. Warrior needs food.

1457
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Valkyrie needs food badly.

1458
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Yes. Things like that.

1459
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,000
I've not seen such bravery.

1460
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
It sounds almost like the Speak and Spell 2.

1461
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Or when you're playing with Dark Sakura.

1462
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Someone shot the food.

1463
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Bitch, I will cut you. I will shoot your food.

1464
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Okay, that's it. We need the new OLR dream game. It's called OLR Gauntlet.

1465
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Someone make OLR Gauntlet. I will figure out a way to rom-hat Gauntlet.

1466
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:49,000
So it's OLR Gauntlet, and it would be what? Me, you, Loki, and I guess Jason would be the fourth, or Bobby.

1467
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:52,000
You guys have to pick if it's going to be Jason or Bobby as the fourth.

1468
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I say they're all ferrets scurrying around the dungeon.

1469
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
And the clips vary between the voices.

1470
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
No, it would be us. It would be us.

1471
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Or it could be Shane, who attacks with the power of apathy.

1472
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:11,000
No, I think Jason has put in enough hours on air that Jason will have earned his...

1473
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
His stripes as the fourth, yeah.

1474
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
His semi-official fourth host.

1475
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Or we have a giant chat room just following along that looks like an IRC window.

1476
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Well, that's what we're doing. We're going through this giant chat room, and it's all trolls that are in the chat room trying to kill us.

1477
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
And rabid ferrets.

1478
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:35,000
And the game says things like, bitch, I will cut you.

1479
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And you have the secret goal of finding Sanrio under our bed.

1480
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Retreat to Pinkberry.

1481
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Yeah, all of our food icons are Pinkberry.

1482
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Don't shoot, Pinkberry.

1483
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, can we get Loki as Tingle to be the elf?

1484
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Sure.

1485
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
No.

1486
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Loki is definitely the elf.

1487
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I was actually thinking that Rob would make a good elf, because you're fast.

1488
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
I want to be the wizard.

1489
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I'd have to be the Valkyrie.

1490
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,000
You have to be the Valkyrie.

1491
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
You have to be the Valkyrie.

1492
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And Jason could be the warrior.

1493
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
And I could be the, there you go.

1494
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Loki's the, come on.

1495
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Loki's the elf.

1496
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Come on.

1497
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Are you the fastest Loki?

1498
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I don't know.

1499
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Sadly out of this group, probably.

1500
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I don't know.

1501
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Dark Soccer might be a little faster, but she has to be the Valkyrie.

1502
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
So.

1503
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
But you got to say Shane.

1504
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
No, I don't want to get the food.

1505
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
See, I'm talking about OLR gauntlet.

1506
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
If we did VoG gauntlet, then it would be a little bit different.

1507
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,000
You'd actually be able to, you'd have multiple choices of characters or like skins for your

1508
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
characters.

1509
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
There you go.

1510
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,000
We'd have the special Tingle skin for Loki.

1511
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Unlocked when you choose green.

1512
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Any other color can be something else.

1513
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:44,000
There is a game out there where you can play Loki as Tingle.

1514
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
It's just a lot of you'd never found it.

1515
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So I'm just saying maybe you want to go revisit a game we were selling the shit out of on

1516
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,000
this show about two months ago and go see if you've missed something.

1517
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Anyway.

1518
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So basically, the game could be very, very, very difficult.

1519
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And as you got further into the game, you actually did have, you could actually hurt

1520
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
your other players with friendly fire.

1521
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
It used a joystick and it had two buttons.

1522
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
One for fire, one for magic.

1523
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Magic also starts the game because the magic.

1524
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Ooh.

1525
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,000
There were some people who were very, very good at the game until they did a ROM update

1526
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
that reduced the extra shot and extra shot power and extra shot speed for Warrior and

1527
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Wizard and added a point-based difficulty system so that it made it really hard to get

1528
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
from one to seven without dying.

1529
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And level four was actually designed so that the food drops would block monsters from

1530
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
swarming on the player.

1531
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So that got removed out of that because then you could just sort of bend the game over.

1532
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Gauntlet II came out and Valkyrie and Elf did not receive extra food removal penalties.

1533
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Only Warrior and Wizard would do that.

1534
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Valkyrie and Elf would receive all of the default food that their difficulty allowed them to.

1535
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:12,000
There was also a big dispute going on about this where for the port that came out that

1536
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
basically Ed Log, who was a co-creator of Asteroids and Centipede, was credited for the

1537
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,000
game design for the arcade version and the NES version.

1538
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And John Palovich, who was I believe another, was actually against that, saying that the

1539
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
original concept came from a game called Dandy that was for the Atari 800 computer and the

1540
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
game that he designed.

1541
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
So yeah, big bunch of crap out of that.

1542
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
There were tons and tons of ports.

1543
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:53,000
We had a DOS, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, MSX, NES Atari Lynx, Apple IIGS, Master System,

1544
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Mega Drive, Genesis, as Gauntlet IV, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum.

1545
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:08,000
There also was at least on the arcade, Midway Treasures for GameCube, PS2 and Xbox and Windows.

1546
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Gauntlet II sometimes was the only one converted for some of those as well.

1547
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
There was a Game Boy version of Gauntlet II.

1548
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:24,000
The NES version was the big one that it was pretty much the big departure from the way

1549
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
the arcade version worked.

1550
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It kept the formula and the cast of characters, but it did new levels and had a different quest.

1551
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
You had to actually retrieve the sacred orb from the 100th level.

1552
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,000
You could get portions of a password in certain clue rooms throughout the first 99 levels.

1553
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,000
It was also one of the few licensed Tengen cartridges.

1554
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:00,000
The only other ones that were officially licensed Tengen releases besides Gauntlet was Pac-Man

1555
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
and RBI Baseball.

1556
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
It actually was re-released as an unlicensed game after the split from Nintendo.

1557
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
The Mega Drive version was Gauntlet in Japan and in the US it was released as Gauntlet IV

1558
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:16,000
with a new soundtrack and original game modes.

1559
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
It had quest mode, battle mode and record mode.

1560
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
There was a DS version that was developed by Backbone.

1561
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I forgot about that.

1562
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
There was the DOS version like I said, the Spectrum.

1563
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
There were a bunch of other versions.

1564
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,000
There's even a cell phone version that's for Java, ME and Brew that was done by TKO Software.

1565
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:42,000
There's also Gauntlet The Deeper Dungeons that was an expansion pack for the original Gauntlet

1566
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:48,000
with 512 new levels and required the original game.

1567
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
There might be a such thing as too many levels.

1568
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
You know what, yeah.

1569
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
But people are basically agreed that it is not as great.

1570
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And then of course we've had sequels.

1571
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:02,000
There was the Gauntlet Dark Legacy and all that.

1572
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
But nothing I think touches the original.

1573
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,000
But still.

1574
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Oh, Gauntlet Legends is a hell of a lot of fun.

1575
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
That was one of my favorites.

1576
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Dark Legacy specifically wasn't as much.

1577
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I don't even remember what they tried to change.

1578
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I remember I didn't like it.

1579
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
But Legends I did enjoy very, very much.

1580
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
This reboot where they've kind of Diablo-fied it a little bit I'm really looking forward to.

1581
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
It should be interesting.

1582
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I mean, would we have had a Diablo if not for Gauntlet?

1583
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Would we have had a Gauntlet if not for Rogue?

1584
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Who knows?

1585
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Hard to say.

1586
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Is that it?

1587
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Um, actually it also, just something that's funny that I think is great.

1588
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
You remember when Dragon Magazine used to review fantasy video games?

1589
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I do.

1590
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Well, I mean, I wasn't around at the time.

1591
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
The Mac version.

1592
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
You were around in 1989, Rob.

1593
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Oh god, I thought it was earlier than that.

1594
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
But the Mac version was reviewed in Dragon 150.

1595
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Huh.

1596
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And it got a 4 out of 5 stars around the time.

1597
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Computer and Video Games did the Amstrad version and said it had great graphics, great sound, and perfect playability.

1598
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
So, yeah.

1599
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
The multiple ports of this game have gotten very high reviews.

1600
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
So, there you go.

1601
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Alright.

1602
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Gauntlet.

1603
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
There it is, ladies and gentlemen.

1604
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Your classic game of the week.

1605
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Gauntlet.

1606
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Alright.

1607
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Didn't time as well as I hoped.

1608
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
It was a little bit delayed, but whatever.

1609
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Soundboard's a little slower.

1610
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It worked.

1611
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Alright, final word.

1612
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Alright, we got plenty more show to come.

1613
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
See, you know what?

1614
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
What?

1615
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:39,000
If it was, if we were gonna do our own voiceovers, you know, for our version, it'd be like,

1616
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Look at that warrior.

1617
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Bitch, don't shout the food.

1618
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
You shout the food?

1619
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Bitch?

1620
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I know, right?

1621
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Alright, anyhow.

1622
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
We're gonna take a break, guys.

1623
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
When we come back, there is plenty more OLR to come.

1624
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Lots and lots and lots of news.

1625
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
The FUGO Question of the Week comes back this week.

1626
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And the emails, FUs of the Week, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on

1627
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Skype, ORANGE LOUNGE RADIO, at us now so you can get through a little later in the show

1628
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1629
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening.

1630
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:23,000
May the 18th, 2014, episode number 553 of our show.

1631
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
And thanks for joining us.

1632
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You know, whether you're here live or whether you're here via the podcast feed or Stitcher

1633
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
or whatever service it is you use to listen to internet radio shows, we really appreciate

1634
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
your support.

1635
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And, you know, I do just want to say thank you.

1636
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
You know, earlier in the show, I talked about how we are gonna be covering E3 this year,

1637
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
and it looked a little grim at one point that we might not be able to do that because, you

1638
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
know, the folks at E3, they use some really weird methods to gauge, like, how big sites

1639
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
are.

1640
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
They use Alexa, which I kind of thought, like, didn't Alexa toolbar kind of go out of style

1641
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
with GeoCities?

1642
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
So I always thought that was, like, really weird.

1643
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
But, you know, we were able to kind of show them some other things, like, you know, our

1644
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
ranking on Stitcher and some of the other, you know, ways that, you know, we do kind

1645
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
of have...

1646
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
You do realize we've been doing this for, like, 12 years.

1647
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
They don't care.

1648
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:06,000
They don't care, right?

1649
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
It's all about how many people, right?

1650
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
So I just want to say, you know, your guys' support has really helped us be able to do

1651
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
that.

1652
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
So I just want to thank you guys.

1653
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
You know, those of you that have left reviews on Stitcher and iTunes, you know, that really

1654
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,000
does help.

1655
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
So thank you very much.

1656
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
So, yeah, I hope we make you proud.

1657
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
I don't want to just go to E3 and play everything and then come back the next week and be like,

1658
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
hey, guess what, guys?

1659
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I just...

1660
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I played all this stuff at E3 and, oh, this is good and this is good.

1661
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I kind of hear a lot of that and what I really want is to try and, you know, not everybody

1662
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
does this at E3 because there's just a lot of, like, very publicist types of people.

1663
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
But if there are designers that we are able to connect with, especially...

1664
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Think of it this way.

1665
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
We probably won't get the AAA people, but we'll probably get the B people, you know,

1666
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
that are kind of in that line between indie and big game.

1667
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
We can probably get those people pretty easy.

1668
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So if you have questions about the games, we want to take your thoughts directly to

1669
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
those people.

1670
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,000
It is the Voice of Geeks Network.

1671
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
So we look forward to, you know, presenting your voices at E3.

1672
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And Oculus does have a booth.

1673
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
They sure do.

1674
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
And you know Bobby's all over that.

1675
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,000
So...

1676
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And we will try to be the voice for you guys at E3.

1677
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
So, you know, just appreciate all the support.

1678
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
That's why it's 2.5 people.

1679
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I'll be playing enough games for all three of us.

1680
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
If you don't have to wait in all these lines and whatever.

1681
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
You can be the designated wait in Nintendo line person.

1682
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Yeah, right?

1683
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,000
So I hope you enjoy standing for eight hours.

1684
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Come on, come on, come on.

1685
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Get back to this hall.

1686
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Let's go.

1687
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Although I can't...

1688
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I don't imagine what they would be showing that would have such a giant line unless it's

1689
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
like a Zelda...

1690
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Zelda...

1691
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
A playable Zelda is the only thing I can think of.

1692
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Smash Brothers.

1693
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Eh...

1694
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I don't know.

1695
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Well, they're having a Smash Brothers tournament, so obviously Smash Brothers is going to be

1696
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
finished.

1697
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I don't think I'd wait in a huge line to play it.

1698
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I could watch it and get a pretty good grasp of what's coming.

1699
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
You know what I mean?

1700
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Probably Zelda.

1701
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
But I'm not going to come on the show and be like, I played it, if I didn't play it.

1702
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
One can dream of a new excite truck that doesn't involve, you know, mini games in the middle

1703
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
of the race.

1704
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
But I think that's just a pipe dream.

1705
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Hey, but...

1706
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
But if I learn enough programming...

1707
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Someday.

1708
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Someday.

1709
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
SSJ100Matt says, fully expect Jason to get my NHL questions answered.

1710
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
So, you better get on that.

1711
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Yes, there will be an NHL 15.

1712
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Yes, it will be hockey.

1713
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Yes, they will update the roster.

1714
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Yes, there will be fights.

1715
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Yes, you will be able to customize it.

1716
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I mean, I don't be the poo-poo.

1717
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Every year they have refined something to be a lot better.

1718
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,000
It's just...

1719
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I don't know, I guess I'm not into the game enough to know what to ask for the next year's game.

1720
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Yes, there will be a zombie mode.

1721
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Yes, there will be a puck.

1722
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
A zombie mode.

1723
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Bochi Kawa in chat at live.fognetwork.com says,

1724
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
the B people tend to be enthusiastic, right?

1725
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
That means good answers instead of form question answers.

1726
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Absolutely right.

1727
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
So, you know, I don't want to disappoint you guys.

1728
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
If you have questions about the big stuff, we'll try.

1729
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
But I'm just saying, you're going to be more likely to get it from the...

1730
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Remember that one time we sat down with the Madballs guys?

1731
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Yeah, they were very cool.

1732
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
We could ask them anything and they would have answered it.

1733
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,000
So, you know, it's those guys that are going to really want to talk about their games.

1734
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
They need help with the coverage.

1735
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
There's some games that aren't going to need help with the coverage.

1736
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:12,000
So they just bring out a press release and everybody copy paste it on their site as exclusive, exclusive, you know, and all this stuff.

1737
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
So, you know, anyway, I don't want to spend too much time on this topic.

1738
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
We'll kind of get into it more as E3 quickly approaches, but I'm looking forward to.

1739
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
And I just want to, again, thank you guys.

1740
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
It wouldn't be possible without your guys' support.

1741
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
So, you know, as we always say at the end of the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

1742
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
That's all we want.

1743
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And hopefully they have Alexa toolbar installed.

1744
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I don't see how we can be surprised about what's going to be at E3.

1745
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I mean, after all, the official E3 roster list came out.

1746
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
So what is up with all that crap?

1747
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
They do this every year and every year some dumb ass falls for it.

1748
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Oh my God, it leaked out.

1749
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
No, it didn't. It never fucking leaked.

1750
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:51,000
No one has on a piece of paper of what is coming out for like everything.

1751
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
That's just stupid. Nobody has that.

1752
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Yeah, no, nobody has that.

1753
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Too much. Keep in mind, guys.

1754
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Nintendo, a few years ago, they wouldn't even tell the people that made the signs what the new Wii was called.

1755
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
It just said, new Nintendo console experience on the signs.

1756
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Nowhere was the Wii U branding to be found.

1757
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
That's how few people really knew what was going on.

1758
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
So you think they're just going to have some word doc out there that has everything listed?

1759
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Come on.

1760
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
But it has the header.

1761
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Oh, it has the logo. It's official.

1762
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,000
It's an Ariel Black. I mean, you know, how common is that font?

1763
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Please.

1764
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Dark Sakura just had a moment where she rolled her eyes to the back of her head.

1765
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
That was awesome.

1766
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
That was Ariel Black.

1767
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I should have just said Comic Sans and then had to clean up vomit.

1768
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Papyrus.

1769
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
All right, let's clean up our act a little bit with some rapid fire gaming news.

1770
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
It better all be set in Helvetica.

1771
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
All right, well, Loki, start us off and use a pretty font.

1772
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:04,000
A game I actually backed on Kickstarter, Among the Sleep, is actually going to be coming out on PlayStation 4,

1773
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
and it's going to have support for Morpheus.

1774
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Remember, that's Sony's VR thing.

1775
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:21,000
In fact, actually, it makes sense because they have support for Oculus, so why not support for Morpheus,

1776
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
whenever the hell that's coming out.

1777
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
That's pretty interesting. If you're not familiar with Among the Sleep,

1778
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Among the Sleep is a survival horror game set from the perspective of a toddler.

1779
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
So you're crawling around on the ground and stuff like that,

1780
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
and all this creepy shit happens in your house, and your parents are gone,

1781
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
and you're trying to figure out what's going on.

1782
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I wonder if it'd have uncontrollable sobbing in it because that's what toddlers do, too.

1783
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
I kind of want to play it.

1784
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:58,000
You can walk around, but you're not as fast as you are if you crawl, so that's kind of interesting.

1785
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
I don't know. It looked cool. It looked kind of creepy.

1786
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:08,000
The game does sound like a legitimately creepy premise, and you're literally defenseless, probably defenseless.

1787
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:14,000
I guess Amnesia was the most popular recent memory game to follow that trend,

1788
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
but to have anything else like that, this game sounds really fun. I'm looking forward to it.

1789
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Yeah, in fact, they sent me an update the other day about the game, and I never actually checked it.

1790
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But yeah, it looks cool, so I can't wait to check that out.

1791
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Also, this weekend, there was the Mario Kart 8 test drive, I guess, at certain, well, 2700 retail GameStop locations.

1792
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I went to a GameStop just out of complete randomness, and you guys know I don't usually shop there,

1793
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
but I was that bored, okay?

1794
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
We were going to Target, and there was one right next door, and I was like,

1795
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:52,000
maybe they've got another buy-two-get-one-free-used game sale, and maybe I could be suckered into it this time.

1796
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Let's go look. So I go over to GameStop, and then I see the Wii U thing set up,

1797
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
and I'm like, oh yeah, the Mario Kart thing was supposed to be this weekend.

1798
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
I'm like, why is nobody here? And then I look at the thing, and there's nothing.

1799
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
It says pre-order it now, coming out May 30th, but nothing on the thing.

1800
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Nope, just a normal kiosk that has screenshots and videos.

1801
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Yeah, I was a little disappointed about that. Way to go, GameStop.

1802
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Best Buy had no problem having stuff available to play.

1803
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Actually, are they doing that at Best Buy again?

1804
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I believe so. Oh, actually, I don't know. I don't know if they did come out and say that yet.

1805
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I thought they did, because I thought that was, it was Smash Brothers, maybe.

1806
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think they did say that some of that was going to be playable.

1807
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
I think they did come out and say that already.

1808
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
And then also it was confirmed, I guess, that Mario Kart 8 voice chat in lobbies

1809
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:44,000
is only going to be in lobbies and only available if you're playing in, well, I'm sorry,

1810
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
it's available in friend-only lobbies.

1811
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So, I don't know if that means that it's actually in the lobby itself,

1812
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
or only in matches that you have that are private matches with your friends.

1813
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
That's, yeah, I would assume it's just the private matches.

1814
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And that's, you know what, that's okay, because I don't need to hear the strangers

1815
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
and some of the 12-year-olds that are probably going to be playing the game

1816
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
that'll get on there and go, I'm going to whoop your ass, bitch.

1817
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Some of that stuff, I don't need to hear it.

1818
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
But it'll be fun when I want to hop online with some of my podcast frenzies

1819
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,000
over at Koopa Club and Bobby and some of the other people I get to play online games with

1820
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
and hear them all in the lobby. It'll be a lot of fun.

1821
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Of course, then I'll have to hear Bobby, I'm going to kick your ass, bitch.

1822
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1823
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Booby Black Wolf.

1824
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Yes, that's what I'll do in retaliation. I'll just keep messing up his name. It'll be fun.

1825
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:46,000
But also, I guess, they announced that in Smash Bros. they're going to be having

1826
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,000
female Animal Crossing villager characters that'll be playable.

1827
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
In fact, there's going to be four villager characters available.

1828
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Two female, two male. So, yay.

1829
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
And I'm sure they control all the same.

1830
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
And why this needed to be an announcement, I don't fucking know,

1831
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
because it's just padding the fucking roster.

1832
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Well, it's kind of cool, though, that they're using the different skins

1833
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
to make things a little more diverse. I think that's cool.

1834
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Okay, where's my female Mario, then?

1835
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Well, see, here's the thing. Mario is a character as a singular.

1836
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
But you do get the Wii Fit trainer as a male. Like, they have that.

1837
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
You know, and they've mixed it up a little bit.

1838
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I know, it's just, it's dumb. Whatever.

1839
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I think it's dumb. It's like, okay, cool, let's put out a press.

1840
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
It's not like the OMG News of the Century.

1841
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
There will be different skin colors for the characters.

1842
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Let's put out a press release for that one.

1843
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,000
But as far as your weekly Smash Brothers update, it's fine.

1844
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,000
It's fine. It's not a huge deal, but it's cool.

1845
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
I like how the other male character looks even crazier than the first villager,

1846
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:55,000
so maybe there'll be more memes created from it.

1847
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I wish you'd be able to import your own villager.

1848
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Now, that would be awesome.

1849
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Have they announced, can you use your Mii in Smash Brothers?

1850
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Yeah, no, they haven't announced that.

1851
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
You know, I think amongst all the character wank we've talked about on this show,

1852
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
the whole Pac-Man and everything, the most obvious thing that's sitting right in front of us is your Mii will be in the character.

1853
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Nope. A Mii doesn't have an obvious moveset where everybody else has a game, a cannon.

1854
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Unless your Mii is a...

1855
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Not even gonna go there.

1856
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Create your own character.

1857
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Not gonna go there? Well, it's character, but...

1858
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Because with Miis you can draw a penis on their face if you really want to.

1859
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
But you can play your Mii in Mario Kart, so wanna race my penis kart?

1860
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
I understand that, but I'm just...

1861
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Things I will only say to Loki one time in my life for $200.

1862
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
It's the Daily Double.

1863
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Whatever. Cool that they have a female kart.

1864
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Cool that they're representing all genders.

1865
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
All two genders.

1866
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
There are multiple genders.

1867
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Oh god, Loki.

1868
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
No, no, I understand that. That's why I said all two genders.

1869
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Because they're only representing two genders in the game.

1870
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I didn't say all...

1871
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
It was a highbrow joke.

1872
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Apparently that went over your head.

1873
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Maybe because you're sitting down.

1874
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
On the heels of Tomodachi Life.

1875
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Yes, I'm so ignorant out there that I don't realize that people identify with other genders other than male and female.

1876
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Gee, really?

1877
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
What year is this? I mean, seriously.

1878
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Come on.

1879
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Get with the times, Nintendo.

1880
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I'm just saying.

1881
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Yes, okay.

1882
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
And if you want, I mean, they kinda look like dolls anyway, so they're not really...

1883
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
It's a skin, okay?

1884
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It's a skeleton of a character with a skin.

1885
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Loki, next time, just come out and say,

1886
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
you can play a female Animal Crossing villager.

1887
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Woohoo. And then done. You're done.

1888
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
No! Here's what they need to do.

1889
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I'm sorry, here's what they need to do.

1890
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Instead of just playing as the villagers.

1891
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
They need to fucking have all the characters from Animal Crossing in it.

1892
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Like, all the different villagers.

1893
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Because you want Jamie to be able to kick the living shit out of Ed, for real.

1894
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Yeah, exactly.

1895
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
And punch that diva bitch in the face.

1896
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Because that would be awesome.

1897
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Alright, anyhow.

1898
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
You know how they have the Pokeballs and stuff?

1899
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
They should have a hole you can dig in the ground and dig somebody up or something.

1900
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Jason, please help.

1901
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
You have to dig up Resetti.

1902
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Jason, save us.

1903
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Dig up Resetti? Well, I guess I get it.

1904
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
And then he yells at the other person until they fall off the screen.

1905
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:30,000
He's an assist character.

1906
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Continuing on with the Nintendo news,

1907
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,000
brings word that Nintendo of America has updated its rewards

1908
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
for you to spend your hard-earned coins.

1909
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,000
You know, I've been maxed out since I started walking after getting back home.

1910
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I have been maxed out at 300 coins for a very, very long time.

1911
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
And I'm never going to use this on the StreetPass minigames.

1912
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Why the hell don't I pick myself up a game?

1913
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
That would just be genius.

1914
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:57,000
And on that note, what I can pick up this month with said hard-earned coins

1915
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
is the Super Metroid on the Wii U specifically for 200 coins.

1916
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Kirby's Adventure for the 3DS on 200 coins.

1917
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
These are all, of course, virtual console games.

1918
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
You can pick them up on the platform that I'm listing.

1919
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
So on the Wii U, you can pick up Super Metroid for 200 coins.

1920
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
On the Wii or the Wii U, you can pick up Mario Kart 64 for 250.

1921
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
And on the Nintendo 3DS, Kirby's Adventure for 200 coins

1922
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
and Brain Age Express for 200 coins.

1923
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Wasn't that bundled on...

1924
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Kirby time.

1925
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
That was DSI. That wasn't 3DS. Never mind.

1926
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Dart Tetsuya is saying,

1927
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
wait, you can use the pedometer coins on Nintendo rewards?

1928
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Is that not the same thing?

1929
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Oh, no, it's not.

1930
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Sorry. Oh, sorry.

1931
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I just get a 3DS and stick it in a paint shaker forever.

1932
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
You only get 10 coins a day, isn't it?

1933
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
No, no, you're mixing up the coins with what you get at Club Nintendo.

1934
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
With the rewards where you register the code in the box.

1935
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
My bad. I am so sorry.

1936
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
This is why he's 0.5.

1937
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm just kidding.

1938
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I'm kidding.

1939
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
I'm being a bitch. I'm kidding.

1940
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Yes. Yes, you are.

1941
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
He's a stupid bitch.

1942
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,000
You know, it's funny.

1943
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I had that misconception like a year and a half ago,

1944
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
and because I never actually went to buy anything, it just stuck.

1945
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Well, maybe Nintendo needs to explore other forms of currency

1946
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
than that same 8-bit coin they've had.

1947
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
They're not going to let you have games.

1948
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,000
What about rupees? Can't one be coins and one be rupees? Come on.

1949
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Rupees representing dollars and coins representing coins.

1950
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Alright, next story.

1951
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Fine.

1952
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Fine. Continuing on the Nintendo news, as I said,

1953
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:36,000
and taking it to E3, as we speculated.

1954
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Nintendo is going to hold two developer discussions.

1955
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
The first one, perhaps unsurprisingly, for the new Smash Brothers,

1956
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
and a second, as of yet, unannounced 3D title

1957
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:50,000
will be discussed specifically on June 11th.

1958
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And then, of course, June 10th is going to be a developer discussion

1959
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
involving Super Smash Brothers.

1960
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
What could it be?

1961
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
Who knows? We'll find out in like two and a half weeks.

1962
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Well, I have this document here, and it's printed in papyrus,

1963
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
so you know it's legit with a Nintendo logo on it.

1964
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And it says it's going to be Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2.

1965
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
You know that's a legit thing on one of those rumored documents.

1966
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Yeah, back in 99.

1967
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
You know what? If that was going to be the case,

1968
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
because if you think about it, the first one was Dracula X.

1969
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
In Japan, not turning the moonlight was called XX.

1970
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
So if we were going to continue the X series,

1971
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
we would have a Kumato Dracula XXX,

1972
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
which would have extra succubus action.

1973
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Of course, we're going to all feel like fucking assholes

1974
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
if this turns out to be true.

1975
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I'm not going to feel like an asshole because I didn't condone or deny it.

1976
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
You give very good evidence as to why they would not call it

1977
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Symphony of the Night 2. You're right. Symphony of the Night was too.

1978
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,000
It would have another name of something.

1979
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
It would be, okay, we had Rondo of Blood,

1980
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
we had Nocturne in the Moonlight, or Symphony of the Night.

1981
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
So it would have...

1982
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Let's call it We Love Bram Stoker and get it over with.

1983
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Dance in the Dark with Lady Gaga.

1984
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Yeah, Dance in the Dark with Lady Gaga would be replacing Shaft.

1985
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:16,000
It would be a brand new game in the lines of, what was it, Winx?

1986
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Where they're going to be sparkle vampires, so yeah.

1987
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Moving right along.

1988
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Wait, comment from the chatroom.

1989
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Come on, we love the chatters.

1990
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Live.vognetwork.com.

1991
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Dark Tetsuya says, Symphony of the Night 2.

1992
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Yeah, not without Koji Igarashi, they're not.

1993
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Look, again, I don't want to give credit to this rumor,

1994
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
but that's the time when they do that shit,

1995
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
is when it's like, oh, so-and-so's not here to stop me.

1996
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Bitch, it's on.

1997
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
So I just, like, yeah.

1998
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Oh, Ikuma JP.

1999
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Alright, moving on.

2000
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
regulate x Triple X.

2001
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
BMX Triple X, that's what Dracula Triple X was.

2002
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:00,000
See, it would be Maria running around naked with an even worse accent.

2003
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

2004
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
That's what it would be.

2005
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
That's just because she swallowed.

2006
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Ah, let's go to the next story.

2007
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Please.

2008
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
A recent and ongoing chick.

2009
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Rob. Rob!

2010
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Get a hold of yourself over there.

2011
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:25,000
A recent and ongoing charity event for deployed Marines and other enlisted servicemen,

2012
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Operation Supply Drop, which gives games to servicemen and women deployed overseas.

2013
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:41,000
And in an unfortunate, unsurprising article, in all of 26 minutes, the website was brought down by attackers.

2014
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Because, so that the direct route going to operationsupplydrop.com is obviously,

2015
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:53,000
could be impacted at times, but they do have a Facebook account you can go to,

2016
01:57:53,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and their address that you can donate, that you can make PayPal donations to is donations at operationsupplydrop.com,

2017
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
if you feel so inclined.

2018
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
You can go to PayPal, which presumably will not be down, and send money directly to that address,

2019
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:16,000
and help out, because of all of the things to attack, attacking people whose primary connection,

2020
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:25,000
not to their loved ones, is actually the new releases going on back home, is certainly a worthwhile event to contribute to.

2021
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
And this is taking games that they're sending to military folks?

2022
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Yeah.

2023
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
So, these guys are out there fighting for your freedom, your freedom to troll, basically,

2024
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
and your freedom to be an asshole, and those are the guys you're going to go after.

2025
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:40,000
Like, what a bunch of fucking cowards.

2026
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:47,000
So the interesting thing about this one is that the article is particularly small, and I don't think anybody's claimed responsibility.

2027
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:54,000
This is very, very quickly, likely, overseas hacktivism.

2028
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Like, these aren't United States trolls, but they're people that, whether in our country or not,

2029
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
are probably causing this to happen, as are you.

2030
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
A very logical answer, unfortunately.

2031
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Or people that are in the West that are mad.

2032
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
A very shitty, but logical answer.

2033
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Yeah.

2034
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
So.

2035
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Help them out.

2036
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Everybody deserves to play the game.

2037
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Everybody should be able to play the games they want to, and if you're willing to help out, absolutely do so.

2038
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Alright, there's Sakura.

2039
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Well, we have a few things, if they would ever load.

2040
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
So, um.

2041
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
God, I hate this.

2042
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Sorry about that.

2043
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
I'm going to go to the ones that actually do load.

2044
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:44,000
There is a confirmed game called Pokemon Art Academy.

2045
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:49,000
And it's basically, from what I can see, it's drawing Pokemans.

2046
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Learn to draw Pokemans.

2047
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,000
How hard can it be to draw a Jigglypuff? Christ.

2048
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Even I could probably draw a Jigglypuff.

2049
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
That swirl is difficult to get straight.

2050
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,000
The swirl is a poly-whirl, Jason. God damn it, learn your Pokemon.

2051
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Jigglypuff has the little hair swirl.

2052
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Jigglypuff.

2053
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Anyway, also, um.

2054
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I'll never admit I'm wrong.

2055
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Kim Jong-un, who is the current asshole in charge of North Korea, is in a side-scrolling shooter game called Glorious Leader.

2056
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Tell us how you really feel.

2057
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Well, his dad was probably a bigger asshole.

2058
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:33,000
And it's supposed to be released on PC and mobile devices.

2059
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:37,000
But it actually has him and Dennis Rodman.

2060
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Who are the main characters.

2061
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,000
The Glorious Leader there is on a unicorn and shoots down paratroopers.

2062
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
And...

2063
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Why do they have to make him awesome?

2064
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Like, he rides on a unicorn.

2065
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Like, that's awesome. Why do you have to make him awesome?

2066
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I think it's a big parody.

2067
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Do you know who should be in that game? Me.

2068
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I'll be Glorious Leader.

2069
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I'm not as big of an asshole.

2070
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Also, Gung-ho is bringing out six more Japanese PS1 classics to the PlayStation Network.

2071
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,000
And I hate the way these sites load on my iPad.

2072
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
But there will be Sarara's Little Shop.

2073
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
That's basically what Wrecked Here was before there was Wrecked Here.

2074
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Tokyo 23-ku Safe-ku War.

2075
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:32,000
It's in a world where school uniforms have been banned.

2076
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:38,000
There's Dragon Beat Legend of Pinball, Heroin Dream 1, 2, and Neo Planet.

2077
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
So there you go.

2078
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
All right.

2079
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Destructoid Fix Your Webpage.

2080
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Make it mobile-friendly.

2081
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:52,000
There's a lot of sites out there that need a little help in the mobile department, isn't there?

2082
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,000
There's so many people that view things on tablets these days, too, you know?

2083
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
All right.

2084
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
We are going to go over to our Facebook and our Google Plus fan communities.

2085
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
And go to our question of the week.

2086
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,000
When you take Facebook and Google Plus and slam them together, you get foogle.

2087
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Or, starting next week, the fwitch question of the week.

2088
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:26,000
On this week's fwitch question of the week, we asked about rumors.

2089
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Rumors and scuttlebutt and things overheard in a hair salon.

2090
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
It is about E3.

2091
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
So, E3 is just around the corner, which kicks off a flood of E3 rumors en masse.

2092
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:46,000
One such rumor, which we gave our listeners, was the story about the Halo 1 through 4 compilation that Loki talked about earlier in the show.

2093
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:51,000
There's also another rumor involving a Nintendo lineup and, you know, big games for all the companies.

2094
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
So, which rumors do you believe?

2095
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Are there any E3 rumors that you are positive are true at this moment?

2096
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Why?

2097
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
So let's see what the listeners have to say about E3 rumors.

2098
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:06,000
So going to the Facebook, or as we call it now, Foculus.

2099
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Going to Foculus, we have Andy R, who quite simply says, and even got some likes for this, Andy R just puts it bluntly,

2100
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:20,000
I believe none, none shall pass.

2101
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I take every E3 rumor with a bag of salt.

2102
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Awesome Unicorn says, I treat E3 rumors like fan fiction.

2103
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Totally fun.

2104
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Awesome Unicorn being written by Kim Jong Un.

2105
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Dennis Rodman.

2106
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
That's an awkward visual. Let's not go there.

2107
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Alright, totally fun to think about, but reality starts to seem too boring if you spend too much time on them.

2108
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
That's one of my favorite answers ever.

2109
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Blood Drunk says, E3 2014.

2110
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Gavin rolls on stage.

2111
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Giant Orange 3 appears in the background.

2112
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Crowd tenses up.

2113
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:04,000
People burst into tears of joy as Gabe announces Half Life 3, part of the Orange Box 2,

2114
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:10,000
which includes Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Hat Fortress 3, and Ricochet 2.

2115
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Gavin drops the mic and walks away.

2116
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Gaben.

2117
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I always say Gaben.

2118
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I know it's Gabe Newell, but I just say Gaben, because I think of Yo Gabba Gabba.

2119
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I don't know, it's just weird.

2120
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I thought you were thinking of What's His Face from...

2121
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I'm not going to think of the band.

2122
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Blood Drunk says, I want to believe.

2123
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:32,000
You know, wasn't that the winner of our, and we'll do this in two weeks,

2124
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:36,000
we'll do our annual list list of E3 Rumor I want to come true.

2125
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:43,000
And last year we had, Gaben or whatever comes out on stage and says, Half Life 3 available on Steam now.

2126
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Drops the mic.

2127
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Alright, here you go.

2128
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:53,000
To kind of go back to what we were talking about earlier, about that ridiculous dream scenario, it's Sony.

2129
02:04:53,000 --> 02:05:00,000
So you have Jack Trenton on there, you have the actor playing Kevin Butler,

2130
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:07,000
and then Gabe Newell walks out on stage, says, not only will Half Life 3 be on Steam,

2131
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
but it will also be exclusive to the PlayStation 4.

2132
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:13,000
They all jump in the air, do a high five, slow motion, done.

2133
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
And then they make out awkwardly.

2134
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Okay, you had to take it there.

2135
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Alright, Red the Haze, it's like a congratulatory thing, like the European soccer players do.

2136
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:29,000
It's like the MTV Music Awards.

2137
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And then Christina Aguilera comes out and talks about how we're all going to get dirty.

2138
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:40,000
Alright, Red the Haze over on Focculus says, not really a rumor,

2139
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:47,000
but I am all conspiracy theorist mode with a lot of signs point Sony announcing support for the Vita and Vita TV at E3.

2140
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
By signs, I mean references to Vita TV support for games like Killzone Merc,

2141
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:55,000
timing of PS4 remote play on Vita TV recently coming out,

2142
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:59,000
cheap $30 pricing for a first-party title like Freedom Wars on Amazon,

2143
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
and even that recent enabling of all PS1 and PSP titles on Vita.

2144
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Of course, I'm taking it with a grain of salt, but I'm optimistic.

2145
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
I'm optimistic too, Red the Haze. That seems very logical that would happen.

2146
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I'd rather be Optimus Prime than optimistic.

2147
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Nemesis 47 says, I'm seeing all the rumors from Sony. Among them I'm hoping isn't true is God of War 4.

2148
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:25,000
A fourth game isn't needed since part three ended on a good and sensible note that made sense,

2149
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
and a part four to the game isn't needed.

2150
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Halo is knocking down your door saying, what up?

2151
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Because you could say the same thing about the Halo franchise, but they did it anyway.

2152
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Not to discount your opinion though, because I understand when you kind of want a developer to just,

2153
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:45,000
it's time to stop and move on to something else, but I'm sure there'll be an Uncharted 4 as well.

2154
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I'm still holding hope for Beyond Good and Evil 2 since that game needs a part two.

2155
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I'm also hoping for a new Hitman, news on Kingdom Hearts 3.

2156
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Ooh, that's one we're not talking about enough.

2157
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I'd like to see some Kingdom Hearts 3, a little more of that.

2158
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
That's because Final Fantasy 15.

2159
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
That's because we're still waiting for the HD remake of the second one.

2160
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Ooh, do you think Final Fantasy 15 will be playable on the show floor?

2161
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Oh, my body is ready.

2162
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Speaking of making out awkwardly.

2163
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,000
And news on WWE 2K15.

2164
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Those are our answers from Facebook.

2165
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,000
So let's go over to Twitch Plus and some of the answers over there.

2166
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
To ActDeft Plus?

2167
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Well, we do have our first answer from ActDeft, GoogleDeft, who says,

2168
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I try not to believe any rumors out there unless they're truly from a trusted source that I know of,

2169
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
but I can't help to get excited for some of them,

2170
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:41,000
like the supposed list of titles shown for Nintendo Digital Event thing that features GameCube Virtual Console titles.

2171
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Granted, the list was too awesome to be true,

2172
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:47,000
but it did get me excited for a slim chance to see something like that on Nintendo's side.

2173
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
To play Devil's Advocate for a minute, though,

2174
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
like, why the fuck not would GameCube games not show up on Virtual Console?

2175
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
It's a logical conclusion.

2176
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Can't Wii U games play Wii games?

2177
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Yes.

2178
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Couldn't the Wii play GameCube games?

2179
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Because they've been using the same hardware for like ten years now.

2180
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
But, I mean, couldn't it happen easily?

2181
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
The excuse might be that it's emulating an emulator.

2182
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Um, you know, I don't know...

2183
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
But I'm telling you...

2184
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
I think it should be feasible, they're pretty close.

2185
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,000
People forget, F-Zero was like, it wasn't true HD, but it was progressive scan,

2186
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
and it looked really fucking good.

2187
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Or just re-release the GameCube games like they did with the new Wii control things,

2188
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:33,000
but just do like some new HD thing where they upscale older titles like F-Zero, GX.

2189
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Maybe not Mario Kart Double Dash, because one, it's Mario Kart Double Dash,

2190
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:43,000
and two, Mario Kart 8's coming out, but, you know, release them, re-release them.

2191
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,000
At least they would pad their release schedule, that would help them a little bit.

2192
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
If I remember correctly, GameCube support is...

2193
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Excuse me.

2194
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:57,000
GameCube support is not possible natively, but it's because it's just a part of the Wii.

2195
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Homebrew unlocked it within months of the Wii U's release, if not much, much quicker than that.

2196
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I got the truth.

2197
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I heard Jennifer about Sally and Brad getting together at the Winter Formal.

2198
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Aren't they just totes adorbs?

2199
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Also, I heard Jennifer Aniston's pregnant and getting married, or is not pregnant, or just broke up with Brad.

2200
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Isn't that sad, funny, tragic, awesome?

2201
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Yeah, I don't put much stock in rumors.

2202
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,000
The only rumors I listened to was by Fleetwood Mac in 1976.

2203
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Best answer to Andon, thank you very much.

2204
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Great answers there.

2205
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:50,000
From our Focculus and Twitch Plus communities.

2206
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:57,000
If you want to pay attention for future questions, check us out over on Facebook.com or Google Plus, of course.

2207
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Alright, let's move on.

2208
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
What about our answers?

2209
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Oh, do you have some answers? Yes?

2210
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
No.

2211
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
My answer is green.

2212
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I think the Fleetwood Mac rumors answer is good enough.

2213
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
That's a good enough note to end on.

2214
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
It is a great enough note to end on.

2215
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Now Rhiannon is stuck in my head.

2216
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I need to get rock-banned out. We're going to play a Don't Stop after the show.

2217
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Alright, Loki, let's get back into some news.

2218
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Alright, so it's another week, so another lawsuit.

2219
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
And this time, of course, Nintendo is being targeted again.

2220
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:43,000
It is due to, I guess, a complaint by Philips, patent 379, Virtual Body Control Device.

2221
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:51,000
And I guess they're saying the Wii, the Wii Remote Plus controller, Wii Remote controller, Wii Nunchuck,

2222
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:02,000
MotionPlus, Balance Board, Wii U, Wii U Gamepad, and Wii Mini, all infringing on that.

2223
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:14,000
And I guess they sent a notice back in December of 2011 and provided Nintendo with, I guess, Nintendo's null,

2224
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:17,000
or with the evidence that they were infringing on that.

2225
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:22,000
And now, I guess, there's a second instance of that.

2226
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Was it user... I hate these really, like, generic patents.

2227
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
User interface system based on pointing devices.

2228
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Okay.

2229
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
And their infringement has been deliberate and willful, apparently.

2230
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
And so now they're seeking trial by jury.

2231
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
That's dumb.

2232
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
That's dumb.

2233
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
They're just mad because those Philips CDI games didn't turn out very well.

2234
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
That's what I think.

2235
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
This little lawsuit is awfully late.

2236
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Like, isn't there, like, limitations on how... I mean, I guess there's not.

2237
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
But usually more than a decade.

2238
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Like, come on!

2239
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
This seems very desperate.

2240
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And it is kind of amusing that it's Philips, considering the history.

2241
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
But even outside of that, it's like, how many people have tried to sue Nintendo over the Wii, and did any of them win?

2242
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Actually, I take that back. I think one of them did.

2243
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
There was the one that was suing everybody over their controllers.

2244
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
I just... well, the whole power system's all messed up anyways.

2245
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:23,000
The fact that you can, you know, patent things like, you know, whatever this...

2246
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
User interface system based on pointing devices.

2247
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Like a computer with a mouse that's existed in a concept since the fucking 70s.

2248
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:37,000
There's even a buddy of mine, a co-worker of mine, has a TV that you actually...

2249
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:45,000
I don't know where the camera is, but you take the remote, and if you pull the trigger, you actually get a pointing device.

2250
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure it's a Philips.

2251
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:52,000
It could be a Sharp or something like that, but shockingly, you have a remote, you point it to the screen,

2252
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:59,000
and a little finger shows up that allows you to choose the smart TV elements, and change your features, and toggle settings.

2253
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Yeah. So, I don't know. I don't know if they're gonna... I doubt they're gonna win.

2254
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
And it's not gonna, like, stop the sales of, you know, the Wii or anything.

2255
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:15,000
If anything that stops the sales of Wii U, it's gonna be the lack of games on the console, or the fact that it's underpowered, or that, you know, other stuff.

2256
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Alright. Well, moving on to a game that was actually our Classic Game of the Week a few weeks ago when Shane was with us.

2257
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Dark Soccer wasn't. And then Loki loves this game and wishes it would go free.

2258
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Well, I do have some news about Final Fantasy XI for its 12th anniversary.

2259
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:37,000
The game is going to be... getting a new update. Not going free, sorry.

2260
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:45,000
However, on May 15th, a new patch is coming out to Final Fantasy XI that will be adding new weapons, missions, a new campaign, and more.

2261
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:50,000
There's a whole teaser video out there, which apparently just shows some of the stuff in the game.

2262
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I know Shane was getting really excited about this, so it's pretty cool.

2263
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Some of the add-ons, I guess, are now free, like the Visions of Abyssia and the Heroes of Abyssia.

2264
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:07,000
You can access all this content if you have the expansions with Rise of the Zilert and Wings of the Goddess, so that's pretty cool.

2265
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:15,000
So there's a lot to still experience in the game for a pretty low cost, but it does still have a monthly fee, which does continue to be the barrier for some people to do it.

2266
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Yeah, like I think the base game now, like with all the expansions, is like $10. It's like super cheap.

2267
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Super cheap. A lot of MMOs are pretty cheap to get into.

2268
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Unless you get 30 days free, so it's almost cheaper to buy the game over and over and over again, except they don't let you do that, unfortunately.

2269
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
What's the subscription on it now?

2270
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
On XI? Oh, same as it always was.

2271
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Well, it didn't go up, but no MMOs have that I can think of.

2272
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:52,000
They just think of other ways to get money, like Warcraft will start selling you cosmetic armor or something, you know?

2273
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Alright. Well, there you go if you want to check that out in Final Fantasy XI.

2274
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Dark Soccer.

2275
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Well, this is a good thing. I don't know how many people have heard of Women in Games International, but basically it's an advocacy group, and they've just announced the new members on their advisory board.

2276
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,000
There's a statement that's said by their president and CEO, Belinda VanSickle.

2277
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Everyone involved with WIGI is passionate about making the video games industry more inclusive.

2278
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,000
We have all amazing ideas about outreach programs we can create to make that happen.

2279
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:32,000
So, basically, just some of the different people on here.

2280
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:38,000
There are people that have been in the industry for a while, but the big thing to take from this, too,

2281
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:46,000
is that it's a group that I think definitely more gamers need to support, need to participate in their outreach programs,

2282
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:51,000
need to bring more out so that we can see more inclusiveness and equality in games.

2283
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And the men in the room are quiet.

2284
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Well, to be fair, I was multitasking a little bit, as I sometimes do during the show, so I apologize.

2285
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I was also kind of reading our chat room to see if they were saying anything on it,

2286
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:13,000
but I think they're still hung up on some of the 3DS versus 2DS and some of the emulation stuff that's going on there.

2287
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Oh, I'm sorry a woman was talking. I guess no one was listening.

2288
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
It's delayed. 45 seconds. Stop it.

2289
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
I'm jumping, Rob.

2290
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:20,000
All right.

2291
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:23,000
But there is actually a good quote from one of the new board members.

2292
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:27,000
This is Wesley. I'm trying to see if I can find her name through the list.

2293
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
But she says, I want to continue the support of inclusion within the global gaming community,

2294
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:36,000
and I admire WIGI as an organization that does just that.

2295
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,000
And if you want to find out about them more, it's GetWIGI.com.

2296
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
You can learn more about the group.

2297
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Well, and I see that part of their mission is to promote diversity and so forth,

2298
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
and obviously that's a good thing.

2299
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:56,000
We need more diversity in all different aspects of the gaming industry, absolutely.

2300
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Oh, God. What?

2301
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
So they have this advisory board. Will it be the WIGI board?

2302
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Actually, probably. That's clever.

2303
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Except it doesn't steal your soul.

2304
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Like, I want to punch you in the face, but that was actually really smart, so I can't.

2305
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
It doesn't. They don't steal souls. They add souls to the gaming industry.

2306
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Good call.

2307
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
What do you think, though? I mean, in all seriousness,

2308
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I'm going to ask a tough question that you might not like Dark Sakura, but I've got to ask this.

2309
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
What can an advisory board really do?

2310
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Okay, so they get together and they form up and they say, we're going to promote this.

2311
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
What can they really do?

2312
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Well, if developers actually give a shit about women, they'll speak with the advocacy groups.

2313
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Say, hey, here's our idea. This is what we're going to put in this.

2314
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Do you have any input? What can we do to improve?

2315
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:51,000
And on top of that, they're doing things besides just acting as an advisory board.

2316
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,000
They're doing sponsorships.

2317
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
They're actually having a party at E3 this year.

2318
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:05,000
They have a female game artist for Google Hangouts as an industry discussion.

2319
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
So they're not just doing things, you know, they're putting the word out there.

2320
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
They're making sure that the idea stays public, and they're educating people out there.

2321
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:20,000
There's even actually a Girl Scout patch that they've created for girl gamers.

2322
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
It looks like a Zelda heart.

2323
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Now, that's kind of cool.

2324
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Like, at a younger age, kind of get people thinking like, you know, this is a career option for you.

2325
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
You can do this. That's pretty cool, I got to say.

2326
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
They have another group that's called DLC Events, Drinks, Lectures, and Community

2327
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:44,000
that they do quarterly to create, you know, just discussion about what's going on in the industry

2328
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:50,000
in, you know, a really, I guess, laid-back arena.

2329
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:56,000
There's also another group called Women and Men where, and I'm trying to see exactly where this is located.

2330
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Okay, this is on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles and another one in San Francisco at Julian's Billiard Club.

2331
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,000
They do this the first Monday of every month from 7 to 9 with Happy Hour

2332
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,000
where you basically meet and talk about, you know, business.

2333
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:16,000
It's just a casual place to talk about the industry.

2334
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000
You said Julien's or Julien's?

2335
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Julien's Billiard Club.

2336
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Okay, then I don't know where that is, but there's a place.

2337
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
4th Street, San Francisco.

2338
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Then they got the name wrong.

2339
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Yeah, they got the name wrong. It's Julien's.

2340
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
That's the Metreon.

2341
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Yeah, right next to the Metreon has like eight tables.

2342
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:34,000
I'm just reading up the thing because the only place I go to over there is the Metreon.

2343
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:44,000
For the folks in LA, the place is Bubsy's West, 3110 Santa Monica Boulevard.

2344
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Again, that's the first Monday of every month from 7 to 9

2345
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:53,000
for people in the industry to get together and talk about what's going on in games.

2346
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Raven's Dolphin in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

2347
02:19:56,000 --> 02:20:03,000
I like the Girl Scout patch. My sister is a pack mother, but my nieces suck at games, so they're out.

2348
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Well, you know what? All the scouts can't do everything.

2349
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
You guys know this. I was actually a Cub Scout.

2350
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I was a Cub Scout, and I got patches too, but I didn't get patches for football or any of the sports-related ones.

2351
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:20,000
My patches were like, I don't know. Do they get patches for...

2352
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Riptieing.

2353
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Actually, you know what I did? They used to have these little events where you would build the little cars,

2354
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:31,000
and they would race them. They'd have the Derby, and then there's the boats.

2355
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Like the pine...

2356
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Pine wood Derby.

2357
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Pine wood Derby, those things. That was the stuff I would get into, actually.

2358
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
So I probably had badges for that.

2359
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
There's an old man in our chat room now.

2360
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Is there really?

2361
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
There is.

2362
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:47,000
By the way, I saw Grandpa join the chat room, and I did want to just give a quick happy birthday shout-out to Grandpa.

2363
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:52,000
He turned 68 over the past... No, he's 34. But he turned 34...

2364
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:57,000
I can't wait till he's 37, because then I can give him the year of jokes that I had in a row.

2365
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:01,000
But he celebrated today, even though his birthday was a couple days ago.

2366
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Actually, if I can make another congratulations.

2367
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And I know a few of them may be listening, so to the adult B'nai Mitzvah class of Temple Orishon Mazel Tov.

2368
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Mazel Tov!

2369
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
To hit major milestones at a later age.

2370
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Alright.

2371
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Yeah.

2372
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,000
To which I got a nice hearty fuck you ginger in return.

2373
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Well, you know what? Undo those birthday wishes. I hope your birthday sucked, Grandpa.

2374
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:29,000
I hope it absolutely was awful. I hope that food thing you went to today, I hope you get diarrhea.

2375
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Bobby had his wriggling day.

2376
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:37,000
That's right, Bobby Blackwell had a birthday last Monday.

2377
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And apparently Ron Charles is coming up.

2378
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:44,000
But see, here's the thing with Bobby. He chose to stop having birthdays at the age of 29.

2379
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
So no more birthday for you.

2380
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:49,000
That's why I'm calling them wriggling days. Because of Homestuck.

2381
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Oh my god, everybody's having birthdays.

2382
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
It's his sixth 29th birthday.

2383
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Rama is turning 36 on Saturday. Everybody's having a stinking birthday.

2384
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Yeah, well my birthday was last month and that was the most important.

2385
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Alright. Loki.

2386
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Actually, one thing to see y'all. My husband also gets white hairs in his beard. He makes me pluck them.

2387
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I've exposed this now on the internet.

2388
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
You pluck mine too?

2389
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
No, I'm not marrying you.

2390
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
And now you know.

2391
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
No more you know.

2392
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Alright.

2393
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Grand Theft Auto 5.

2394
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:25,000
So back when we last checked on Grand Theft Auto 5, it was selling a ton of copies.

2395
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,000
And it's still selling tons of copies.

2396
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
In fact, it has sold 33 million units.

2397
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
So that's a lot of copies.

2398
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:40,000
And Rockstar is promising a next-gen release this fiscal year.

2399
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:45,000
So they will have a next-gen game sometime between now and March 2015.

2400
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:55,000
If I were to be a betting man, which I am, I'm going to say that it's probably going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2401
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
And on PC.

2402
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Just saying. I think that's possibly what it's going to be.

2403
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
I think that's definitely what it's going to be.

2404
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Yeah. Just guess.

2405
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:10,000
But then again, I'm just some random dude on Twitter.

2406
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
You're just some dude. You don't know what the hell you're talking about.

2407
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
I don't know anything.

2408
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
That's right.

2409
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:20,000
And then of course, Take-Two had a pretty good fiscal year.

2410
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:24,000
And one billion dollars in revenue.

2411
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:31,000
In fact, it was a net revenue of 2.35 billion for fiscal 2014.

2412
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:40,000
And with a 94% growth in revenue over its last year, which was 1.21 billion dollars.

2413
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
So, not bad.

2414
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:46,000
And it would be interesting to see what else they have come out of this year.

2415
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
God damn it! And put out the god damn Grand Theft Auto 5 single-player patch.

2416
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I'm ready for that.

2417
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
We need some more content there.

2418
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Not necessarily online. Because I've kind of given up online for now.

2419
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
TigerClaw in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com asks,

2420
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,000
What if Rockstar announces a new Red Dead Redemption?

2421
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
I'd still be fine with that. That's a win-win too.

2422
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
No complaints?

2423
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I just think that Grand Theft Auto 5 is incredibly popular.

2424
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:12,000
And that it's kind of...

2425
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:17,000
They have the higher quality assets because they've kind of showed those off in screenshots and everything.

2426
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:21,000
So, it's kind of a given that they're going to probably do that.

2427
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:28,000
But yes, I could see them later on coming out with a Red Dead Redemption 2 with an improved version of the engine that they're running right now.

2428
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
But I think it's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5.

2429
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
And I would probably buy it again.

2430
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Of course you will.

2431
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
I'll probably buy it for the first time.

2432
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Yay!

2433
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Because I knew they'd release it on PlayStation 4 eventually. They just have to, right?

2434
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I think we'll see that at E3. That announcement will happen.

2435
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
We'll see.

2436
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Jason!

2437
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:52,000
I'm fairly certain I remember hearing this.

2438
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:57,000
If not, it certainly was news last year, July specifically.

2439
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:04,000
But, yet again, Square Enix is considering the expansion of Dragon Quest X to overseas markets.

2440
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Says David Gibson,

2441
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Square Enix is considering expansion of Dragon Quest X to overseas market.

2442
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Says its profit guidance range is reasonable.

2443
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Square thinks that if they bring it here, enough of their loyal fans could buy it to presumably at least break even and hopefully actually make a profit.

2444
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Great for those fans that haven't already imported it.

2445
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:32,000
That, you know, I guess consoles are still rather heavily region locked.

2446
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
But it would be a nice thing to continue to see the series stateside.

2447
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
These guys keep fucking teasing me.

2448
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Like, I really want to play Dragon Quest X.

2449
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Although, just what an MMO fan needs.

2450
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:44,000
And I'm whiffly waffling between XIV and Warcraft.

2451
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Now, let's tempt me with Dragon Quest X.

2452
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,000
So, maybe it's not the best idea.

2453
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
This game came out early last year, right?

2454
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
It's been a while.

2455
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Oh no, it was out on the Wii originally.

2456
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Which makes it even before 2012.

2457
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:04,000
No, it was like right before the Wii U came out when it came out in Japan originally.

2458
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
So, that's how long we haven't had it.

2459
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I mean, you never know.

2460
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
That could be one of Nintendo's little surprises.

2461
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Something to bolster.

2462
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Because they did have a version specific for the Wii U.

2463
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,000
So, they could always bring that over to the US.

2464
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,000
And I would bet Nintendo's probably lobbying them hard for it, you know?

2465
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:25,000
It would be their answer to like Elder Scrolls Online or Final Fantasy XIV.

2466
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
You know, it would be something that would be exclusive to Nintendo Wii U.

2467
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,000
But, I don't know. I don't know.

2468
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Show your support. Let them know you care.

2469
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:34,000
That's right.

2470
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Alright, you can let us know you care by sending us an email every week.

2471
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:41,000
You guys send us emails to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2472
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And DarkSakura, she dives into the mailbag head first.

2473
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:49,000
And, you know, catches some letters in her floofy dress that she has.

2474
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Bitch, I might.

2475
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And she picks...

2476
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
It's big enough to just kind of let him off.

2477
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Just kind of scoops him up and picks him up.

2478
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:00,000
This skirt really could be made into maybe about three total skirts.

2479
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
But I love it.

2480
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
And have room.

2481
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,000
I love it. It's cute.

2482
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I'll vouch for that.

2483
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:08,000
So, DarkSakura, why don't you pull out some emails and read them for us here on air.

2484
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:12,000
This one has been labeled skeezy silly question of the week.

2485
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
What's up, everybody? Except Loki.

2486
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
So much Pokemon on last...

2487
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Rude. I'm totally rude.

2488
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:21,000
So hilarious.

2489
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:25,000
So much Pokemon on last week showed that my question was pretty damn relevant.

2490
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Nice.

2491
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Oh, because Loki refused to answer. Remember?

2492
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
He asked a question about Pokemon and Loki was like...

2493
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Anyway.

2494
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
What about Pokemon?

2495
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Exactly.

2496
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I don't know. It was like, if you could make a Pokemon, what would you make?

2497
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:39,000
And you were like...

2498
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Bitch, I'm trying to read.

2499
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
That's a dumb question.

2500
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Hearts.

2501
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Yes. Sorry.

2502
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Take yourselves back to the old days when everybody thought the world was flat.

2503
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
Yes, Rob.

2504
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Time to bust out the knickers and bifocals.

2505
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Lol.

2506
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Would you have traveled the great journey to find out for yourselves?

2507
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
How close to the imaginary edge would you get?

2508
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Who the hell would captain the OLR ship and why the heck do we make him or her captain?

2509
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Would you go discover the world?

2510
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Would you go discover the world? I'd probably...

2511
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Actually, if I were going to go backwards in my ancestry, I'd probably be a court lady in France.

2512
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Just saying.

2513
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:18,000
And I don't want it to be in France when some people are getting their heads chopped off because that time sucked.

2514
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:26,000
This might be a little too pop culture heavy for some people, but if I were to travel the world to see if it's flat or not,

2515
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:33,000
if I really believed that it was flat, I would want my co-pilot or my co-captain or whoever to be Sherry Shepherd because she believes it's flat too.

2516
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:36,000
So, there you go. Maybe we'll find it together.

2517
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I don't get it.

2518
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:40,000
People actually didn't think the world was flat by the way back then.

2519
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Because the horizon line was curved. They just didn't know what was out there.

2520
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Yeah. The unknown. The great unknown. It's just like us beyond certain ends of our universe. How big is the universe? Big.

2521
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
That's all we know.

2522
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Somebody tell Loki that he needs to use his frickin' imagination and create himself a Pokemon.

2523
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Love you guys. EA skeezy.

2524
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:03,000
So, wait. What did the ultimate question end up being in there?

2525
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
What would we do?

2526
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:09,000
What would we do if we were given the option to explore the world?

2527
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
To explore the world.

2528
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
To discover what the world is like.

2529
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Can I just go back to Hawaii for a little while? That would be kind of awesome.

2530
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:19,000
I would like to discover my bed where my naps are.

2531
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Actually, you know what? Who wouldn't want to travel? And I would like to do more traveling around the world. I really would.

2532
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:27,000
I'd like to get paid to travel. If someone wants to pay me to travel, I'll do it.

2533
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
A travel series podcast or something?

2534
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Heck yeah.

2535
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
That'd be fun.

2536
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Gaming around the world.

2537
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,000
No, it'll be called, Jamie judges shit around the world.

2538
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Gaming around the world? Hey, you know what?

2539
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Jamie judges the world.

2540
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:56,000
There's a lot of people that don't realize, especially when we talked about how the Wii is, or sorry, not the Wii, but Nintendo is putting something out that's probably like the Wii into countries that aren't as heavily saturated with gaming consoles like we have here in other countries.

2541
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:00,000
I think it actually would be pretty interesting to see how gaming really is perceived in other countries.

2542
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
See how they're still playing the master system in Brazil?

2543
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Well, yeah, and we have Act Deft that calls in sometimes to tell us how things are different in Mexico, you know, and there's some things that we take for granted.

2544
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Where are Swedes?

2545
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:12,000
Yeah, we had Aki Ripper from Sweden. He hasn't listened in a while, I don't think.

2546
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Swedes call next week.

2547
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:17,000
And then we have our guy from Belgium that emails us once in a while. We love the international books.

2548
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,000
We have Sil.

2549
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000
And Sil.

2550
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,000
We love Sil.

2551
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Sil is absolutely gorgeous. Did you see her picture? She's so gorgeous.

2552
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I do.

2553
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I have a girl crush on Sil.

2554
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I do.

2555
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,000
I have a girl crush on Sil, too.

2556
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:30,000
All right. Anyhow.

2557
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Yeah, we had another email.

2558
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Thank you, EA Skizie. You have a great name, but not as great as Awesome Unicorn.

2559
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Or Serious Turtle.

2560
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Or, um, oh, God, now I forget the name. Oh, well, never mind. Sorry, Derailed.

2561
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
Sorry, whoever's name he can't remember.

2562
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Sorry, whoever's name I can't remember.

2563
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Dark Sakura.

2564
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
Nasty Canasta. That was it.

2565
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Nasty Canasta.

2566
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Nasty Canasta.

2567
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:59,000
So this one's subject is Takata in Rogue Number 3.

2568
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I see what you did there. Musical jokes.

2569
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:09,000
I realize time was limited for last week's Classic Game of the Week, but I would have liked to hear more about the games directly inspired by Rogue,

2570
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:16,000
including Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon series or Fatal Labyrinth on the Genesis, although not necessarily action roguelikes.

2571
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Also, per your discussion of Holst with Christopher Ten, do you agree that Airship's theme from Super Mario 3 and perhaps the March of the Meanies from Yellow Submarine has strong influence from Mars Bringer of War?

2572
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Oh, that is a good point.

2573
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I could actually, with the Mario 3 warship theme? Oh, absolutely.

2574
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Yeah, I could totally hear it.

2575
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Absolutely.

2576
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Yeah, cue that up sometime.

2577
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Because I'm actually running through, I think that it really does have the whole, at least the beat to it and the sort of crescendo that the background music makes.

2578
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I'm wondering if any of the people in the chat room have ever heard Mars Bringer of War and if you haven't, why not?

2579
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Yeah.

2580
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Can you imagine, this would have been a great question for Christopher Ten, we'll have to get him back, but what kind of music would Christopher Ten have made on the NES?

2581
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:20,000
You know, where you're so limited. It's really amazing what these game programmers back then were able to do.

2582
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Have we had the NES sound chip discussion?

2583
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Between the Famicom disk and the...

2584
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:35,000
No, just literally the limitations of the Famicom, of the NES sound chip.

2585
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,000
By the way, for comparison, Rob, you should pull up Mars Bringer of War.

2586
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Well, he does that. I'm extrapolating a little bit from the bit of chiptune composition software that I've seen, but an NES has four channels.

2587
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Two wave, one pulse, one noise. Noise is usually sound effects, basic crashes.

2588
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:07,000
The wave channels actually have a fair amount of extensibility in them and then the pulse channel I've actually kind of forgotten.

2589
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:24,000
But four channels to be able to play any music that the game has and any and all sound effects, that's why classic games more often than not, some sound effects just fail to fire because there wasn't, you know, whatever the sound effects being stacked couldn't play at the same time.

2590
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Here's Mars Bringer of War, or at least a YouTube labeled as such, so I'm going to hope it's right.

2591
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Yeah.

2592
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:49,000
You can't really hear the drum in the back. It's very faint, kind of, but you can definitely hear the big swelling.

2593
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Keep in mind, this is like 30 seconds out of a seven minute piece. And as Bobby says in the chat, content ID strike number three, probably.

2594
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
No, that's five.

2595
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
We're doomed.

2596
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:03,000
We're doomed. Oh, now we'll never make that nickel off the 12 views we get of the show on YouTube.

2597
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:04,000
We're spreading culture.

2598
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
We brought doom upon ourselves.

2599
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I do want to say, isn't it by now the works of Holst in the public domain?

2600
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,000
You'd think, you'd think.

2601
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:14,000
It doesn't matter. Somebody is claiming the rights of their own.

2602
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Yeah. If some troll claims the rights, it's not going to matter at the end of the day because that YouTube sites on their site.

2603
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.

2604
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Exactly.

2605
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,000
P.S., what would you say to be the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament?

2606
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:31,000
What would I say to be the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament?

2607
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Like a game?

2608
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,000
I would say, can I go to bed? Because I don't play either.

2609
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:53,000
So they're saying the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament, they're saying from Half-Life and its type of standard kills deathmatching, what Unreal Tournament game mod would be cartoonish, exaggerated.

2610
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Honestly, I'm going to say that the to-be-released Unreal Tournament is going to be the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament because somebody is going to bring that style of game to it with the announcements of the modability that we covered last week or two weeks ago.

2611
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:18,000
I'm going to be honest. I agree with Akhdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com. The Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament is Team Fortress. I'm kind of on that page, I think.

2612
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Yeah.

2613
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Unreal will get something very good.

2614
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:28,000
I realize Team Fortress was born of Quake originally, but, I mean, anyway.

2615
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Alright, that's it for emails?

2616
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,000
That's it.

2617
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Well, there are only two emails.

2618
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Yep.

2619
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:43,000
You can do better than that, people. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com. You know, it is a show where every gamer has a voice, but only if you use it. So, send us more emails.

2620
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Alright, this is a good time for us to get a little bit ranty in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.

2621
02:35:50,000 --> 02:36:06,000
This is fucked up.

2622
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Um, FU to the people in your neighborhood who don't use their turn signals because they're buttholes. Like stinky crusty buttholes.

2623
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Ew.

2624
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
With a couple of hemorrhoids.

2625
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
That's so weird.

2626
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Yeah, but that's how I feel about them.

2627
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Um, and uh, um, FU to being warm. Yeah, I'm done.

2628
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
I turned on the AC.

2629
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,000
That's okay. I think I'm still just kind of out of it.

2630
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Okay. Uh, Loki.

2631
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Um, I don't know. FU to my feet hurting. I don't know why.

2632
02:36:49,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Um, my FU of the Week goes to the fact that Loki gave me his french fries. Actually, I'm very thankful that Loki gave me his french fries. Don't get me wrong, but my FU goes to the fact that I ate them all. I ate them all.

2633
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
FU to the fries and not the Loki.

2634
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
They were delicious. Yeah, exactly.

2635
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:10,000
FU to myself for not showing restraint is what it really is because I need to be showing a little more restraint.

2636
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I totally showed restraint with my 4x4 with soda and fries and a milkshake.

2637
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,000
E3's coming up. I've got to lose 25 in a week.

2638
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Do you realize they will not do more than a 4x4 anymore? Because I wanted more than a 4x4 and it would only do a 4x4.

2639
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I thought they would if they weren't too busy or they do it at certain times. I thought 7x7 was as high as you could go.

2640
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Oh, maybe. Well, they said they won't do more than a 4x4.

2641
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,000
What did you ask for?

2642
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:41,000
It was actually a 5x5. I wanted to do a 6x6, but I thought that would be too much.

2643
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Might be a little much. Oh my god. That's too much. Oh my god.

2644
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Their patties are really small. Their double is just like, it's nothing.

2645
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:56,000
I have a single hamburger when I go to In-N-Out and that is plenty. There's so much butter on that fucking thing.

2646
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
It's like, oh my god. Anyway.

2647
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
FU to so much butter. In-N-Out burgers.

2648
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
I think you could get him to cook it without the butter.

2649
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:04,000
Jason, did you give an FU?

2650
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,000
I did not. Thank you for considering me.

2651
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Once in a while I do.

2652
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:14,000
I guess since this is probably the only part of the show where it's relevant. FU to the Ford Focus.

2653
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:23,000
I don't remember what year it is, but whenever I don't have my own car accessible I use Zipcar to get up here to Sacramento from San Francisco.

2654
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:30,000
And I try out new cars. I try out different cars because I'm curious. I'll be in the market again for one eventually.

2655
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:35,000
And my car is 2006 so why not see what's changed in the last couple years shy of a decade.

2656
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:43,000
There's no switch for locking and unlocking the car doors in the car that I can tell.

2657
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I'm assuming, unlike my Civic that has the button on the key and doesn't work if the engine in,

2658
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:53,000
you can only use the buttons on the key. Presumably it works when the car is started.

2659
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:01,000
As Rob, when we were on our way to Scandia, Rob was living the reclined life the whole way because we couldn't find the handle.

2660
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,000
What the hell was that?

2661
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:08,000
It's not on the floor, on the bottom seat. It's on the back, on the side of the back seat.

2662
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:16,000
The Ford Focus because I had a Ford Focus. I believe that the lock mechanism is just if you lock the driver's side door.

2663
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:22,000
But there's not even a manual tab either. I can find nothing involving the locks in that car.

2664
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Besides on the key.

2665
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Really?

2666
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
It's weird.

2667
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I had a 2001 or a 2000. This is 2013 or something like that. It's also a hatchback.

2668
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
It's also a Ford Focus.

2669
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:43,000
And most of all, I've never had a problem, a meaningful problem with sync before nowadays.

2670
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Microsoft, actually it was just sync. Microsoft kind of distanced themselves.

2671
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
F you to sync. Fucking frustrating.

2672
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
You'll notice the music stopped five minutes ago, Jason.

2673
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Excuse me.

2674
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:56,000
You have a laundry list you've built up over the past few weeks.

2675
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Well, I also have laundry, so my brain's just in that mode right now.

2676
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

2677
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,000
All right.

2678
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
We just have a couple more stories for you guys.

2679
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Then we're going to open up the phones and take calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2680
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:11,000
And if you want to be on the show, you better call quick.

2681
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Because we are already, we just hit 9 o'clock Pacific and midnight on the East Coast.

2682
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
So we're not going to go all night.

2683
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
I'm sorry my F. You ran so long.

2684
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I know, right?

2685
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
All right. Let's get through a couple more stories here quick. Loki.

2686
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:26,000
All right. So this is kind of neat.

2687
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
You know, there's a lot of entrepreneurs out there.

2688
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:34,000
And this IndieGoGo campaign is for an interactive toothbrush.

2689
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
It's a video game toothbrush.

2690
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Is it a decision, Mark?

2691
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
It's called Grush.

2692
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I don't know what the fuck that's, I guess, game brush.

2693
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
I got my joke.

2694
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Gruel.

2695
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
You got my joke?

2696
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
No.

2697
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:48,000
The Citadel DLC?

2698
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Oh, yeah. Okay. I get it now.

2699
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:54,000
They're seeking, like I said, they're seeking funding on IndieGoGo.

2700
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,000
It's, I guess, the idea of some guy that used to be an exec at EA.

2701
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:05,000
And what it is, is it has a 3D accelerometer built into the toothbrush and a gyroscope.

2702
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:10,000
And apparently with it, it sends a signal to a mobile phone.

2703
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
So it's kind of a peripheral for, like, an iPod or something like that.

2704
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:18,000
And it includes, you know, a case that you can hang on your mirror that's waterproof.

2705
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:22,000
And they kind of show some concepts of it.

2706
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
It's totally built in Unity, the little thing that they designed.

2707
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
And kind of derpy looking.

2708
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
But I think it's cool.

2709
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Whatever gets you to, you know, incentivize kids to brush their teeth, I guess, would be good.

2710
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:41,000
But I haven't even seen what exactly they're looking, how much funding they need for this thing.

2711
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Let's find out.

2712
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Well, they were-

2713
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Four hundred thousand dollars.

2714
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:52,000
They were seeking fifty thousand dollars, and they just made it.

2715
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
They just made it.

2716
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
With three hours left.

2717
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
They're just over that, so.

2718
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Congrats.

2719
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Yeah, so that's kind of neat, I guess.

2720
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:05,000
And you can still get in on the action if you're listening live.

2721
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:09,000
But, honestly, it looks kind of derpy.

2722
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:14,000
I remember games, like, in the 80s that would teach you, like, hygiene things, like brushing teeth.

2723
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Like, there was a game called Plaque Attack, where you had to, like, floss on Commodore 64.

2724
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
I fucking loved Plaque Attack.

2725
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:23,000
You had to shoot down the candy canes and chocolate things.

2726
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Wait, I think we're mixing two games, because there was one on Atari.

2727
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I think that was Plaque Attack, but there was one on Commodore 64 as well that was, like, another one.

2728
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:36,000
And you can also- they also have a parental dashboard where you can see which kid, you know, brushed their teeth and which kid didn't.

2729
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:40,000
So you can stalk them and go, like, fucking David has him brush his teeth.

2730
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Charles, that was awesome.

2731
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
David, though, he's gonna get grounded.

2732
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
He's an unhygienic motherfucker.

2733
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,000
That's right.

2734
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Unhygienic motherfucker, that should be the exact phrase on there.

2735
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:57,000
You get that gold star in the comic sans font that says unhygienic motherfucker.

2736
02:42:57,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Alright, anyhow, I know a few people at anime cons I'd put that on.

2737
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:04,000
And I love- wait, and this is not Rama.

2738
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
Not Rama, not Rama, I love Rama.

2739
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:12,000
And this is the best- they have, like, you know, that goes down the list with all the different, like, press quotes and stuff like that.

2740
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:18,000
You know, they have, like, stuff like, this is a brilliant way to show one where to brush your teeth while providing fun.

2741
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:21,000
And then Kotaku's, here's the next gen gaming toothbrush!

2742
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:25,000
That's, like, the fucking most useless phrase I've ever seen.

2743
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
It's like, okay, yeah, I'm sorry, what was the previous gen gaming toothbrush?

2744
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
There wasn't one.

2745
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Alright, well, speaking of just crazy new devices, there's something called CleverPet.

2746
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:44,000
And we end tonight talking about CleverPet, which is producing a game device for dogs.

2747
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Yes, the CleverPet is a dog game console.

2748
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:57,000
It is supposed to engage and educate dogs by challenging dogs with puzzles and rewarding treats if successful.

2749
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Oh, this is a- this could be cruel.

2750
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:06,000
It's three touch-sensitive light-up pads that sit at the front of the console, and the dog can use the paws or the nose to interact with them.

2751
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:10,000
CleverPet has algorithms so you can change the difficulty of the puzzles.

2752
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Owners can track your dog's progress.

2753
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:18,000
One of the games is like a DDR game that has the dog touch pads as they light up in a particular order.

2754
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:27,000
The device can hold as much dog food as the standard dog bowl, and it all runs on a system known as SparkCore, and you can build custom software for it.

2755
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:35,000
It was a 34-day Kickstarter campaign. The funding has already reached its $100,000 goal. The CleverPet will be $279.

2756
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Meanwhile, Amplitude's probably not going to make its goal, but the CleverPet made its goal.

2757
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:45,000
For the record, people are saying they should do ones for cats. They've already made video games for cats.

2758
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Yeah, on the iPad, right?

2759
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
On iOS.

2760
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Frisky has some games that they put on there.

2761
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I haven't even tried to see if Minda will play them yet. I'm afraid because she's the claw queen.

2762
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I mean, it's a neat idea. I just hope no one actually uses it as their primary feeding device for their animals because they will die.

2763
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,000
I shouldn't laugh at that.

2764
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
They will not live. They will be dead.

2765
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Bochi Kawa in our chat room at live.voguenetwork.com says,

2766
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Video game dog sitter? It sounds like it. I can entertain the dog while I'm away.

2767
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Well, people do that with their children. Why not?

2768
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:25,000
And doggy, I'm going away for a week, and if you can figure out this video game, you'll get to eat. If not, good luck.

2769
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:33,000
And I'm going to tell you this much, you know, just having had pets before, they're going to lose interest in this immediately.

2770
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:40,000
All right, let's go to the phones. It's that time. 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.

2771
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call. And look at that, the Skype line already lighting up with calls.

2772
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
So let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2773
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
It is the one and only Raven's Dolphin.

2774
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Raven's Dolphin! Long time no speak, buddy. Always good to hear from you. What's up?

2775
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Do you see me?

2776
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:00,000
Yeah, I see you, and it's so, like, don't take this the wrong way, but it's so interesting to me to see you get older.

2777
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Because I remember when, no, no, no, no, you, okay, look, I'm an old motherfucker, Raven's Dolphin. Let's get that out of the way.

2778
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:12,000
But you listened to this show, like, back in, like, 2006 and stuff, and I remember you calling into the show then.

2779
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:17,000
And you were a lot younger, so it's just, I'm watching you become a man before my eyes, Raven's Dolphin.

2780
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:21,000
You want to know something sad? I just turned 27.

2781
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:26,000
Christ. And how old were you when you first heard OLR?

2782
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
I swear I was 19.

2783
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Oh my God. Oh my God.

2784
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:37,000
And I was listening to you on, like, PSP Drive, downloading it on my PSP, now I listen to you on your iPhone live.

2785
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
I was like, holy crap, this is the future.

2786
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
He couldn't even drink.

2787
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
And now he's 27.

2788
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
I couldn't drink the first time I was on the show.

2789
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Oh God. I'm so sad too.

2790
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Oh, I wanted to show you my Yoshi 3DS and then get to the topic at hand.

2791
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
That is a cute little 3DS, I love it.

2792
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:59,000
If I had the webcam, I'd show you my Zelda one, which is better.

2793
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Oh, I have that one as well.

2794
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,000
What? What? Wait a minute.

2795
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
He's as cool as Shane rocking the dual 3DS.

2796
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
What do you need multiple 3DSs for?

2797
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:12,000
At least Shane can say he worked for Nintendo at one point. What's your excuse?

2798
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
It was cute and I needed it.

2799
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Okay, valid response. I stand corrected. Sorry.

2800
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the weight of the Twitch as we know it.

2801
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Oh yes. Oh yes.

2802
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Now, I don't know if you know this, but I got into the Let's Play begrudgingly.

2803
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Begrudgingly got into it. I'm not a big fan of it.

2804
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:42,000
I think a lot of people just scream a lot and just say horrible things.

2805
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:46,000
But here I am and I've been streaming on other sites and all that stuff.

2806
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:51,000
I think it's a very good idea for Twitch to go with YouTube.

2807
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:55,000
The big site that people generate money in ads, Machinima's there.

2808
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:00,000
All these big sites are there so they're going to meld these two together.

2809
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Twitch is all about the games and YouTube is all about the personalities.

2810
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:08,000
So now you're going to have the games and the personalities.

2811
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:14,000
What about the whole copyright thing that a lot of us are hung up on, including myself, a little bit?

2812
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
I totally agree.

2813
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:19,000
I'm not sitting here going, the sky is falling. I'm deleting my Twitch account.

2814
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
I'll probably do streaming later tonight.

2815
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:24,000
But it's kind of one of those things where I'm like, God damn it, don't fuck this up.

2816
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Do not fuck this up, Google.

2817
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For them, it's like they just started their live thing.

2818
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
And Twitch owns 40% of the market.

2819
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:36,000
So for them, it's like we need to do something.

2820
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:39,000
We need to address the gaming market that they have.

2821
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:45,000
I just think buying Twitch will give them the absolute advantage over anything.

2822
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:49,000
You stream, be damned, everyone else can go die.

2823
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Do you worry that it could start this whole antitrust thing?

2824
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I don't know. I don't know if that carries a lot of weight.

2825
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Well, there's so many companies being bought right now.

2826
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I mean, AT&T with DishNet, with DirecTV, it's like everyone's getting bought.

2827
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:11,000
But there wouldn't be antitrust in that situation because there is still a huge satellite competitor.

2828
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Although, well, I don't know.

2829
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:16,000
Well, it's tricky because Comcast just bought a huge, I don't know.

2830
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Time Warner.

2831
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
I mean, it's tricky.

2832
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
You know what's interesting, though?

2833
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:25,000
What's interesting, though, is that we talk about these big companies get bigger and they get bigger and they get bigger.

2834
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
You know, what's ever going to happen?

2835
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:32,000
But it does seem like then this new company, you know, Comcast didn't exist 20 years ago.

2836
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
You know what I mean?

2837
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:39,000
There will always be innovation, as we learned with Oculus Rift.

2838
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
There always will be someone out there.

2839
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:46,000
It just seemed like it's either they're going to be bought up or nurtured enough to be bought.

2840
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
That's what it looks like.

2841
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
That's a very good point.

2842
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:53,000
And Rama reminds us the Comcast Time Warner thing isn't final.

2843
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Well, we'll see. We'll see.

2844
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Well, right now the Twitch thing is not final, but it will probably come out.

2845
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:05,000
I mean, YouTube probably needs it for their infrastructure, for their video stuff.

2846
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
They're probably betting hard on it.

2847
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:08,000
True.

2848
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:13,000
I'm curious to see technologically what might come of this.

2849
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:20,000
It could be a very neat thing, but, you know, again, I really hope the principles that guide it don't screw it up.

2850
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
We're all a little nervous about that.

2851
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,000
No, I agree.

2852
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Not a prominent Let's Player, but someone that watches the space.

2853
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Yeah.

2854
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Because now I watch the space.

2855
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:35,000
Before I used to do the podcast thing, and I still do, but the Let's Plays scare me because the people on there scare me.

2856
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Wait a minute. I'm on there sometimes.

2857
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Well, you do good work.

2858
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:46,000
And I seen you on there go like, hi, I'm Rob Roberts. I'm playing Donkey Kong 3. I watched a few things.

2859
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Thank you.

2860
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:48,000
I know.

2861
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:52,000
And like you say, you believe in the games, but some of these people are looking for a paycheck.

2862
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:59,000
They're like, oh, man, fuck you, Nintendo. Fuck you, Nintendo. You know it belongs in the trash.

2863
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Yeah, I don't like to get super-duper negative.

2864
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:06,000
I mean, sometimes I get a little... I think there's a difference between negative and sassy.

2865
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,000
I'll get a little sassy, but I don't like to get just full-on negative.

2866
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:13,000
There's a difference between insulting and criticism.

2867
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Well, as my mother RuPaul says, and this is something that we should all live by, throwing shade takes creativity. Being a bitch takes none.

2868
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:27,000
There's a lot of bitches out there.

2869
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Ain't that the truth.

2870
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
You ain't one of them.

2871
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,000
What's that?

2872
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
You ain't one of them.

2873
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:34,000
No, I try not to.

2874
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,000
You throw shade.

2875
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:36,000
I try not to.

2876
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:44,000
I think some people basically turn into virtual panhandlers with that stuff.

2877
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:47,000
It's always like, pay me, pay me, pay me, pay me.

2878
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I don't know. I don't like to play that game.

2879
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,000
One last thing. I know this is running a little long.

2880
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:58,000
For me, I want to respect the game because I know that you guys do your work.

2881
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:02,000
We wouldn't be here without the game or the games.

2882
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:03,000
That is very true.

2883
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:06,000
That's where I come from. I have to respect where it came from.

2884
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
That is very true. It is about the games.

2885
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Go play the games and don't be a dick.

2886
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Not that I'm saying you're a dick, Ravenstaufen.

2887
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:17,000
You're a fine young man who's grown up before my eyes.

2888
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Exactly.

2889
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Alright, Ravenstaufen. Take care, buddy. Thanks so much for calling the show.

2890
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Oh, you're welcome. I just want to shed some light.

2891
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Alright, sounds good. Take care.

2892
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,000
Bye.

2893
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Bye.

2894
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Always good to hear from that kid.

2895
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,000
For the record, Comcast was founded in 1963.

2896
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Was it really?

2897
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Yeah.

2898
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
I had no idea they were that old.

2899
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Well, look at Facebook.

2900
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Okay? Facebook.

2901
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
2004.

2902
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Oh my god, the guy who invented it is only 30, so it isn't that old.

2903
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Oh, anyway.

2904
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Let's go to the phone so we have another call coming in.

2905
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Hi, you're on Originals Radio. Who's this?

2906
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Hey, this is Zach Def.

2907
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Hey, Zach Def. What's up, buddy?

2908
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Well, remember last week that I talked that I didn't have a trivia trip to the Lux because it got lost in the mail?

2909
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
You sound a little down. What happened?

2910
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:05,000
No, I'm actually happy because, well, first let me tell you a story.

2911
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:14,000
I contacted Amazon on Thursday to talk about my last game and Amazon was pretty quick.

2912
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:25,000
The customer representative that spoke to me pretty much helped me in less than five minutes, so it all got fixed.

2913
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:30,000
And by Friday afternoon, my copy of Triple Deluxe got delivered.

2914
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Jesus. That is a turnaround.

2915
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Yeah, it got here in a day, though I had to pick it up until Saturday because my friend, who helps me with shipping and all that, goes to pick it up the next day.

2916
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:49,000
But basically, yeah, I got Triple Deluxe now and I have played it and I love it.

2917
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Hooray. Does it do justice to your favorite video game mascot?

2918
02:53:55,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Yes, it's pretty much your typical Kirby. You suck enemies and you either suck them out or copy their abilities.

2919
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:20,000
It's pretty much the main gist of it, but it does have the Hypernova ability now that makes you pretty much suck everything and it's pretty much literal.

2920
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:29,000
That's awesome. I'm glad to hear it. How's the music in the game? Because I'll tell you what, the thing I always remember about Kirby is the freaking infectious soundtrack to those games. Oh my gosh.

2921
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Superstar, Kirby Superstar, still has an absolutely amazing soundtrack that I adore to this day.

2922
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
So how's the music?

2923
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:52,000
The music is fantastic. Even though it doesn't have that many new tracks, though some are new, it has a really great soundtrack that is a staple from all the Kirby series.

2924
02:54:52,000 --> 02:55:03,000
It's something I have to thank for if I'm into video game music because Kirby is pretty much the game that brought me into it.

2925
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:15,000
So what do you look forward to now? Now that Kirby is in your possession and you're playing through it, what do you have to look forward to now at this point? At E3 this year? What do you hope Nintendo is going to do?

2926
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Well, first of all, Mario Kart 8, I also have it pre-ordered so hopefully we can look forward to that.

2927
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Yes, and to all the people asking if there will be something with VoG playing, of course there's going to be. I don't know if they're going to have the leagues like they had on Mario Kart 7, but we'll try to take advantage of whatever systems they offer and absolutely we'll do a VoG night or something. Absolutely that will be a thing.

2928
02:55:44,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Definitely, that should be a thing. It's going to be awesome. Though for E3, at least for Nintendo, I hope that there's some of the old franchises back like Star Fox and F-Zero, that's the main two I can think of.

2929
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Other than your typical games that we're going to get like Zelda and New Mario and all that. But yeah, those are the two that come to mind. Even though I do have some old classics like Uniracers that nobody remembers but me.

2930
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:26,000
No, I love that game.

2931
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Maybe on the 3DS or something like that. But yeah, it was the Tony Hawk before the Tony Hawk games. Basically, it was fun.

2932
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Very true. Yeah, I love that game. It's great. Yeah, I'd love to see Nintendo try to go to the vault and get another great franchise. Like when they did Sin and Punishment 2 on the Wii, that was a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, the game I don't think sold as well as they'd hoped.

2933
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:36,000
But it was still a pleasant surprise and maybe they'll try it again with something different. But we do know there's a lot coming out from Nintendo this year. As much as the Wii U is having its issues, those of us that did plunk down the money for one, we got Bayonetta 2, we've got the Monolith Soft game, the X or whatever it ends up being.

2934
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Obviously, there will be a Zelda in the cards at some point. We have Mario Kart 8. There's still a lot of stuff to get excited about on Wii U. So, it's not all bad news.

2935
02:57:45,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Yeah, there's tons of games that are coming out from Nintendo and especially for the Wii U. So, hopefully it will get better. As for Xbox One and probably PlayStation 4, though PlayStation 4 right now probably I don't have anything to look forward to or at least that I can think of.

2936
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:11,000
But for Xbox One, Forza Horizon 2, that's basically it.

2937
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Yeah, that's probably something that's going to make me get an Xbox One as well as I've been talking about the whole on the fence thing and it really seems like as we start to get to the end of the year, Microsoft's just going to have the lineup I can't say no to.

2938
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:29,000
Alright, anyway, ActDeaf, I've got to let you go to try and get at least one more call before we finish up tonight. But thank you so much for the call, buddy. And I'm glad to hear you got your game.

2939
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2940
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:33,000
Alright, no problem. Anytime. Bye.

2941
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Alright, glad to hear he got us good. That's great that he got the great customer service and that's, you know, what we should expect that they get that game out to him. Silly that it got all held up.

2942
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:49,000
We'll try to fit in one more call if anybody else wants to call us. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2943
02:58:50,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Uni Racers was sued by, should I say DMA Design, was sued by Pixar, not Disney, which was a separate company obviously at the time in the early 90s and I was right 300,000.

2944
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:12,000
It's, you mentioned Zuckerberg right before his call and it's kind of funny. I was talking to the friend of mine a week or two ago and he mentions, you know, old quotes, 640K of memory ought to be good enough for anyone.

2945
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:20,000
I countered with the fact that in 2002 or something like that, Bill Gates said spam was going to be solved in three years. Yeah, tell me about it.

2946
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,000
Whoops.

2947
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Email spam specifically was the context but he mentioned that Zuckerberg had this quote to never, if you want to be an upstart, interesting, if you want to make a good product, do not take advice from anyone over 30.

2948
02:59:39,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Zuckerberg's 30 years old and is funny, in context, rather in hindsight, is funny because of poke, you know, poke versus, it was in Snapchat. Wasn't there some other third party like really, really absurdly simplistic thing that you just kind of poked someone about and I don't know.

2949
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Facebook has made very, very good, very, very interesting purchases in the realm of Instagram and Oculus and I'm sure there's another one that I'm forgetting.

2950
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:24,000
But that quote to be used against him now that he's reached that magical age is kind of hilarious to think about and we'll see what happens with Facebook in the next, I don't know, however long it's still around and relevant.

2951
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Well, thank God I didn't make a statement like that when I first started doing OLR, right? All right, I'm still waiting to see if we get any calls on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio and dark to see and chat telling us that the 877 number doesn't seem to work all of a sudden, so I don't know what's up with that.

2952
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:53,000
So we may not be able to take phone calls tonight. So sorry about that, guys. But we can still get your calls on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word. Meanwhile, Loki, is there any last minute stories?

2953
03:00:53,000 --> 03:01:08,000
There's one, it's apparently Target doing a triple trade-in deal thing where they give you triple value for whatever you trade in, which leads to some wonderful ways if one were to exploit said thing.

2954
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:18,000
For example, you could trade in your copy of Titanfall, get $54 and then rebuy it for $40. Repeat forever.

2955
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:26,000
And it's only going on through this week, from the 18th through, I forget what the date was.

2956
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Yeah, so if you're looking to trade in some games and not necessarily just selling or planning on exploiting everything, it might be a good idea just to check out Target and see what they'll give you for them.

2957
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:48,000
That's it.

2958
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
All right.

2959
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:52,000
It's through the 24th, so the 18th through the 24th.

2960
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:55,000
I didn't see any particular tweets, unfortunately, either.

2961
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:02,000
You know what it is? I think that should actually fix things a little bit there.

2962
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:10,000
You know what it is? I had to disable the phone number during the week, and I forgot to enable it before the show tonight, because we get all these frickin' spam calls on the line.

2963
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:14,000
So, but it should be open now. Oh, did it just get through for you?

2964
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:17,000
That was the direct line. I'm actually gonna test the total for you.

2965
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Yeah, that was my bad. Sorry about that.

2966
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:20,000
She's wrong.

2967
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Oh my god, you were-

2968
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Yeah, fact spam and all that other shit.

2969
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:30,000
Oh my god, we get so much of that stupid fact spam and stuff, so I just shut it off, because if they get enough busy singles, maybe they'll, you know, stop wasting the money on calling us.

2970
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
You bitch, they're robots. You think they would really-

2971
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:33,000
Yeah, that's true, that's true.

2972
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:40,000
All right, well, since we are out, I'm gonna go ahead and shut it down, because we aren't really getting any, um, we aren't getting any other calls.

2973
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:44,000
Oh no, is this you? No? This is, this is probably Dark Tetsuya.

2974
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Hi, you're on Orange Home Radio, who's this?

2975
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Oh hey, it's DT.

2976
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Hey, was I right or was I right? There, I fixed the phone, just for you, buddy. What's up, buddy?

2977
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:58,000
So apparently, Dungeon Fighter Online reopened in the US.

2978
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Yes, I saw this, and we didn't fit it in the show world, but I'm glad you called in to talk about it.

2979
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:08,000
What's- I know you were excited about this. What's going on with Dungeon Fighter?

2980
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:13,000
Yeah, I guess, uh, who was that, uh, Neopole?

2981
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Mhm.

2982
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:21,000
I guess they decided to reopen the game in the US. They're, they're doing an alpha test right about now.

2983
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Are you, uh, checking it out, or?

2984
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Oh yeah.

2985
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:26,000
What do you think?

2986
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:31,000
It's a little rough, it's not going at first, but, I think they got all the bugs worked out, for the most part.

2987
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:37,000
Well, alphas usually are a little bit challenging, but, uh, I'm glad to hear they've, they're, they're working on it.

2988
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:41,000
So, so you were a fan of the original, and then they just, they did just disappear, didn't it?

2989
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:42,000
Yeah.

2990
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:49,000
So, are they talking about any ways to improve it, or make it different, or are they just focused on bringing the game back as it was right now?

2991
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:57,000
I think they're just leaving it as it is for the moment, but, I'm sure there'll probably be a beta, maybe some new features down the line.

2992
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Awesome. That'll be awesome. Well, what else have you been playing lately?

2993
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:05,000
Oh, what is that, uh, on Epic, on Wii U.

2994
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
Oh yeah, what do you think of that?

2995
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:15,000
Oh, it's pretty cool, it's kind of like, uh, Metroidvania, with a little bit of World of Warcraft, or Diablo type elements.

2996
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:20,000
I think that's on my Steam wishlist, I think I've seen that one, and I've heard about that, and that's definitely a game I want to get.

2997
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
I did not realize it's on Wii U, but that's awesome.

2998
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:24,000
Oh yeah.

2999
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:29,000
Very cool. I might have to check that out. You know how much that is? Probably about $11.99 or something?

3000
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,000
Uh, $10,500.

3001
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Oh, wow, that's a pretty darn good deal. I'll have to check that out.

3002
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:34,000
Alright.

3003
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Very cool.

3004
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
Alright, DT, you want anything else on your mind tonight?

3005
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:39,000
Uh, nah, that's it.

3006
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Alright, well, check out the revival guide at Dungeon Fighter Online, because, you know,

3007
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:49,000
DT, you know, when he loves a game, he really loves a game, like La Mulana or something, so he really believes in it, so.

3008
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:54,000
Alright, so check it out, guys. Well, thanks for calling, DT, I'm glad we could fix the phone for you.

3009
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:55,000
Yep.

3010
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Alright, take care, buddy.

3011
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Yep.

3012
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:58,000
Alright, bye.

3013
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:02,000
Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of OLRC.

3014
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:09,000
Now, now I can go in, and now I'm going to disable the calls, because I don't want the frickin' fact spam this week.

3015
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Because every time they leave a voicemail, I get an email. I think it's really annoying.

3016
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:20,000
And you hit play, and if your headphones are up very loud, you scream, much like the sound that's coming over the, yeah.

3017
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
Exactly. Not having that. Alright.

3018
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Well, thank you guys very much for listening to another episode of Orange Lawn Radio.

3019
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:31,000
We are going to go around and wrap it up, but as I always say, if you like what you hear here at Orange Lawn Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.

3020
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:37,000
Help spread the word about Orange Lawn Radio, because, you know, we don't have a huge site corporate backing us.

3021
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:43,000
We literally have built this from the ground up over the past 12 years, so, you know, your support means the world to us.

3022
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:46,000
So, yeah, that's that. Jason, thanks for being here tonight.

3023
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:47,000
As always.

3024
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:51,000
It's a pleasure to have you here. I don't know if you're, are you back next week, or not for two weeks?

3025
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Nope, next week, not neither, actually. This wraps it up.

3026
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
Possibly, actually.

3027
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,000
Tell you three, right?

3028
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:06,000
Because we were, yeah, we were talking about whether I'm going to go home for a week and come back until two weekends, which sounds like a terrible idea, but I'm crazy enough with it.

3029
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:07,000
You are.

3030
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:08,000
I'm crazy enough to do it.

3031
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:09,000
In a good way.

3032
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Yeah, next week, next week is Fanime. My DJ set is technically Sunday at midnight, the actual Saturday night events in the Ed J.

3033
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Right, it's Memorial Day next weekend.

3034
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:21,000
Yup.

3035
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Forgot. That's awesome.

3036
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:25,000
It'll be a good time. It was last year, and I'm looking forward to it again this year.

3037
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:26,000
Great.

3038
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:37,000
Scandia had, I just realized I didn't mention this. When Rob played Poppin', I played Poppin', we looked over and there was somebody playing 2DX with headphones on.

3039
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:53,000
I remember friends asking me, a decade ago, if the 2DX machine, if I've ever seen a 2DX machine with a headphone port, and because the old school sick style videos of, not Yasu, that was a DDR guy.

3040
03:06:53,000 --> 03:07:01,000
Oh man, I forgot his name. All of the old 2DX, like, Perfect Player, Lisu?

3041
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
None of our listeners are going to know these people.

3042
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:04,000
I think so.

3043
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:11,000
At any rate, the people that made these Amazeballs 2DX videos.

3044
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:12,000
The Tatsugin videos.

3045
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Yes, thank you. Tatsugin videos. You could see a headphone cable some of the time. I'm assuming that that was a custom job to make it easier on them, but we saw someone playing 2DX with a headphone port on, or with headphones on, and I kind of looked under the machine and saw that there was a little tiny, tiny mixer adapter under there.

3046
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:40,000
I tried it for myself and my headphone cable was much too short, so I didn't get to try it out first hand. But it was nice. It looked nice.

3047
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:44,000
It's hopefully something that a lot of other machines I play on from now on have.

3048
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:47,000
Any quick final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3049
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:50,000
No.

3050
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
Alright, fair enough.

3051
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:58,000
I think that was my final thought. Scandi is amazing. I didn't even play Technica, but the machines worked out well.

3052
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Yeah, they were in very good condition.

3053
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:07,000
My final thought tonight is, I think I am going to check out that Unepic game after the show. Another listener recommendation success story. Here you go.

3054
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:11,000
Dark Sakura.

3055
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
No, I'm not saying anything.

3056
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:19,000
Except, if someone wants to sell me a fairly recent Mac Mini for 100 bucks, I'll buy it.

3057
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Girl, I gave you a Mac laptop.

3058
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:23,000
Yeah, that's 10 years old.

3059
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
Well...

3060
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:25,000
It won't run crap.

3061
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:26,000
Well...

3062
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:27,000
It runs Tiger, Rob.

3063
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
You could get Linux on it. Alright.

3064
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:30,000
Not really.

3065
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

3066
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
Trying to figure out how to save these triangles.

3067
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Triangle man, triangle man.

3068
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:39,000
By the way, thank you.

3069
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:40,000
What?

3070
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:43,000
Because I actually still use it. I'm learning terminal.

3071
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:44,000
You're welcome.

3072
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
I'm actually using it to practice terminal commands.

3073
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:51,000
That's fine. My other laptop, I might get rid of that one too, so we'll see.

3074
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:54,000
I didn't hear Shane come home. Shane's here.

3075
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,000
He's been here for a while.

3076
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
Shane's been here for a while. I didn't even hear him come in.

3077
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:58,000
I heard him when I was in the bathroom.

3078
03:08:58,000 --> 03:08:59,000
Creepy.

3079
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
I was coming out of the bathroom.

3080
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
Wait, did you... Shane, come here. We're still live.

3081
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
Shane, did you have a lot to drink today?

3082

Shane went to Grandpa's birthday party, just so you know, which I was unable to go to.

3083
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
So he's making the drive that I'm about to drive.

3084
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
At like 7 sangrias.

3085
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
I hope you were safe to drive, young man.

3086
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:19,000
You look like you need a nap.

3087
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:21,000
He needs a nap. Alright.

3088
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:22,000
Go nap.

3089
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:25,000
That's it. We all need a nap. Go nap. You earned it, everybody. Have a good night.
