Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, May 11th, 2014, we're joined by the Grammy Award winning Christopher Tin, composer of Baba Yetu on Civilization IV.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
As if that wasn't enough, it's been a very busy week in gaming. From Tomodachi to Amplitude, we've got everyone's opinions on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live for this episode number 552 on May the 11th of 2014.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
Happy Mother's Day to all you moms out there or motherly figures. Pets need moms too and so forth.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Step moms and god moms and all those moms. Happy Mother's Day to all you guys.

00:55.000 --> 01:08.000
We are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys live as we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
My name is Rob Roberts here in studio with our co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Hi.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Hi, how are you?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I'm alright.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
You're alright?

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
We've been having some tech problems here in studio tonight. We're on take two of the show but these things happen.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Yeah.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
Hopefully your tablet will stay connected throughout the show this time.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I'm considering taking a narcotic.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
A narcotic? Is that how you cope with the program?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Cause my hip still hurts.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
How'd you hurt your hip if you don't mind me asking?

01:38.000 --> 01:47.000
It was already sore and a little bit out of alignment and then I reached over to pick up something and ended up pulling, it's called iliotibial syndrome.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Meaning that it's the muscle band going from the very top of the hip down to the knee.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
Mine's on my right leg. It's not sciatica. Completely different thing.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Getting old sucks.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
No, it has nothing to do with getting old. It has something to do with having, no.

02:02.000 --> 02:11.000
It had to do with my old car accident and since my hip already goes out of alignment, bending over with my hip out of alignment.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
Just sorta, and so I was told not to drive for the three days.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
Are you able to sit for long periods and play video games at least?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
No.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Uh oh.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I still have to get up and move it around or else it's a little good stuff.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Are you able to play some DDR once in a while?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
No.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
But today is the first time in two weeks I've done squats.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Oh, there you go.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
And so that's fine. I'm back to doing yoga and squats. It just still hurts.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
Alright. Well, hopefully you got to play some games. We'll check in with you on that a little bit later.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I'll play something.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
But we also have, say hello in studio to Tech Master, Loki.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hi.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Doing alright.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Yeah? What's new with you?

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Um, not too much.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
So how goes the coding of Project Loki or whatever you're calling your game that you're making?

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
Um, okay. I kinda took a break from what I was doing because I have to make assets for things.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
But, you know, I'll get into that later on.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
But so I've been working on a, I don't know, editor if you will, I guess, to make my own 3D models.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Wow.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
And it's coming along good.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah? And that's like all you do now, right?

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
That's all I do in my free time, yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Awesome, awesome.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
You know, I tried to play Call of Duty, but people don't seem to line up as far as, you know, when they're online.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
We have a scheduled time each week that we play and no one was there.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And they're like, well, I can't play until like 10. I'm like, well, I'm not waiting.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
That's my problem too is one of the games, and I'll get into this a little more when we get into our gaming weeks later.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
But one game I've been playing is the Heroes of the Storm Technical Alpha that Blizzard has out there.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
And I have some friends that play it, but we can never seem to line up at the same time.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
And a lot of that has to do with the fact that, you know, I have a lot of friends on the East Coast and I'm here on the West Coast.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And that screws things up more than you'd think.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
So it can be tricky trying to schedule up that time to do things with friends.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Yeah.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
So, all right.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
We also have here in studio joining us, he's back, guys, after a few months break.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I'm back.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
Welcome back.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Well, then where is your voice at the top of the show?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm just kidding. I'm giving you a hard time.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
One of those things where you pack everything except for one thing.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.000
Because my mic is XLR, I have a converter to actually plug into my computer via USB.

04:20.000 --> 04:29.000
And I'm pretty sure I put it in its case and then decided not to bring it with me because I didn't think I would need it for another audio obligation that I had as a part of this trip.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
And I completely forgot about passphrase show roll.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It's fine.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Well...

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
It's fine.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Which is I had to dispel the rumors last week when he didn't do the intro.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
It was like, was Jason sacked?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
It's like, no, no, no.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Sometimes the kid needs a break.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
So he's been working hard on the YouTubes and all that other stuff.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
Last week I was driving and I didn't wake up early enough to take care of it before I had to check out of the hotel.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
And I wasn't going to pull over on the side of the road.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
And...

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
The signal on the radio...

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah, it wasn't going to happen.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Plus, I didn't have my converter.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Oh, geez.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Sorry, guys, and all of your speakers and possibly eardrums.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Yeah, last week I was driving out to Portland initially.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Today, like I said, I went to do it and realized I didn't have a required piece of audio gear.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
So...

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Well, that settles that one pretty quick.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Hopefully I'll have a solution for weekends going forward, though.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Well, going to our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
The now deaf chat room.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
You can join us at live.vognetwork.com.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, please, they're used to it by now.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Yeah, I know, they've heard Loki rant before, come on.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
And we've got lots of Nintendo news tonight, so just you wait, y'all.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Just you wait.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
In all seriousness, going to our chat room, we do have people welcoming Jason to the show.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Bobby Black Wolf, our buddy, saying Jason destroyed the internet.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
Which could be the possibility for some of the internet...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I bring additional devices into the house.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
For some of the internet issues we've been having in the studio tonight.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Can you believe that?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
The destroyer of tech.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
25 devices on our router, but it makes sense.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
I mean, we have three nerds that live here now, and then you bring three more nerds in here on Sunday night.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I'm not surprised at all when you consider laptops and some phones and all that.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
3DSs, and phones, and iPads, and multiple computers to a single person.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Exactly.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
And gaming consoles.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
We are a connected world, my friend.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Ain't we ever.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Oh my gosh.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Alright, let's get into, before we get into our gaming weeks, and our interview with Christopher Tin, as you heard in the intro.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
We do have Christopher Tin on the show tonight.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
He'll be joining us live in about 15 minutes to talk about his new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea.

06:33.000 --> 06:41.000
As well as classic songs of his, including the one I think y'all know as Gamers Baba Yetu, which he won the Grammy for, from Civilization IV.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Our chatroom also asking, how many Final Fantasy XIV clients were online?

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Just two. So I had to ask them both to take a little break.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Only two.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I feel bad.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Christopher Tin has one night off of work this week in celebration of Mother's Day.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
And he can't play the game he wants to play because of his boyfriend's show, but it is what it is.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
Anyway, before we get to our interview with Christopher Tin, before we get to our gaming weeks, I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm actually kind of glad the time we get to spend on this topic is limited.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
So I think this is a good reason that we bring this up first.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Jamie, if you wouldn't mind, let us know one of the big controversial things going on in the news this week.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Oh, yeah, it's a pretty big one. And it involves Pokémon. No, it doesn't.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
But it does involve the...

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
That news was controversial too, actually. We'll get into that later.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
But it does involve Nintendo.

07:32.000 --> 07:46.000
Nintendo basically says that when Tomodachi Life comes out in the US, it is going to still not have same-sex relationships in them.

07:46.000 --> 07:56.000
Because, as they say, and they are recognizing that it's not the best step, but they're saying that because of the programming of the game,

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
that it's not something they can patch out before it ships, that they're going to leave it intact.

08:03.000 --> 08:15.000
But for future versions of it that come out, that they're going to, as they say, strive to design gameplay experience from the ground up.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
That is more inclusive.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
So basically they know, we done fucked up, but we're going to fix it.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
Which, good on them for making the statement they needed to make.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
And again, I don't want to dwell too much on this, so thank you to Christopher Tin for limiting our time tonight on this topic.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
But I do want to make clear that there was two distinct statements that came out.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
And, you know, what you're talking about here is kind of where we're at now, where all is kind of calmed down a little bit because Nintendo has acknowledged,

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
you know what, maybe this was not the best course of action for us and in the future we should consider this.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
But what's going on is that the first time they put something out, it was really just tacky, like what they said.

08:54.000 --> 09:02.000
And to back up even further, I think many of you that listen to this show are probably astute on what's going on because this has been everywhere.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
This was one of those stories that had wheels that made it onto the local news in various places.

09:08.000 --> 09:15.000
Like, does Nintendo hate gay people? That's like, you know, that's what the media does when it blows these things, you know, sky high and so forth.

09:15.000 --> 09:23.000
And what happened is that in Japan, Tomodachi Life is out and it's kind of like, it's like a life simulator type game.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Like, think The Sims meets Animal Crossing meets Mii Plaza.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
There's kind of all those things kind of thrown in a blender, a very Japanese twist.

09:31.000 --> 09:41.000
Well, in the game, you can, you know, have a baby and all this, but you will have to enter in a relationship with somebody of the opposite gender, you know, in order to start that family.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
Which, you know, as far as Japan goes and Japanese culture and so forth, and again, a big key word here is perception.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Remember that word, folks, perception.

09:51.000 --> 09:59.000
The perception in Japan and everything, it's, you know, it's just accepted as this is the way the game is and it doesn't cause a lot of social ruffling

09:59.000 --> 10:13.000
until a bug is found in the game allowing folks to get into same-sex relationships by basically registering the same-sex partner as somebody of the opposite sex the game thinks they are or whatever.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
And so you get into a relationship and actually there was kind of a subculture in Japan.

10:17.000 --> 10:28.000
Think like Japan's Tumblr blew up with these pictures and fans everywhere of like, look, I've got this same-sex couple in Tomodachi Life, isn't that rad and so forth, you know.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
But then, because this bug also broke the game, Nintendo said, we gotta patch it out.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.000
And I truly don't think Nintendo was trying to make a, oh, we gotta patch out the gay.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
No, they had to patch out a mistake for something that truly wasn't intended.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You say that like it's also, you say the patch out the gay like the pray away the gay.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Kind of.

10:48.000 --> 10:55.000
But I think, I think what really happened is that, you know, it was just ignorance, people.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
That's what it was.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
When the game was created, it was kind of ignorant in a way to a lot of the people that wanted to play it.

11:01.000 --> 11:08.000
Now, I made the mistake when this, when this story went big, I made the mistake of logging onto websites and reading the comments.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Will people please remind me not to do that?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Hey, Rob, don't do that.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I can't fucking help myself.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
I always want to go on and see, gosh, I wonder what the commenters on Joystiq have to say about this.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
Gosh, I wonder what the YouTube comments have to say on this.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And I know what I'm going to fucking get and I get so angry.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Just do what I do.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Stop giving a fuck.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
It's hard.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
It's, Dark Sakura, it's so hard.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Run out of fucks to give. Use them up.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
It's hard when on one hand you're really, really-

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I said fucks and you said it's hard.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
It's really difficult when on one hand you're really, really rooting for Nintendo and then on the other hand you're like,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
God damn it, stop making it worse for yourself.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
And I've used this comparison a lot in my broadcast days,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
but one of my favorite television moments ever was on America's Next Top Model

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
when Tyra Banks started yelling at one of the contestants,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Be quiet, Tiffany!

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Be quiet! We were rooting for you!

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
We were all rooting for you!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
That's how I felt about Nintendo this week.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I just wanted to put my finger out and be like, be quiet, Nintendo!

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Be quiet!

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
You're not listening to what the people are really saying.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
And they put out this comment about the whole, oh well it's just this whimsy,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
we're not trying to make social commentary, it's a whimsical world.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
And I'm like, oh my God, be quiet, you're making it worse.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
Because now you're basically saying, in our whimsical, magical world,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
we've made a place where gays don't exist.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Perception-

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Boy play girl!

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Perception is everything.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
The porn game.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And whether that's how they meant it or not,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
that's how their statement came across,

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
is that, don't you want to buy this game where gays don't exist?

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And you may not want to make social commentary,

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
but you can't sit there and say,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
I'm Switzerland, I'm not making social commentary, I'm not being involved.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
You don't get to say that.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
By making a video game, which haven't we argued time and time again,

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
video games are art, right?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
Haven't we tried to convince Roger Ebert and other critics out there,

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
haven't we tried to convince video games are art?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
What is art supposed to do?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Provoke.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Provoke what?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Just provoke.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Provoke.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
And one of those things it provokes?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Emo.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Social commentary.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
So you can't come out and say a video game does not get into social commentary,

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
because it did.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
And that's the problem, guys.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
I'm telling you, like, I know many of you are out there listening to Orange on the Star.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Maybe we have some new listeners tonight, thanks to Christopher Tin being on,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
and just everything else going on.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I just need to tell you something.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
As a gay gamer, okay?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
And I've made no secret about that over the time.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm not the type of guy that goes out there and is like,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay, and I play video games.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I'm not really that type of person.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I'm not ashamed of who I am, absolutely.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
I put myself out there as, this is how I am, deal with it.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
This is the way my creator made me, right?

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
And so I am a video game fan who happens to be gay.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
And let me tell you what kind of goes through your mind when you see something like this,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
is that it's...

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Imagine if you're playing this game that's supposed to be fun.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Imagine you're a heterosexual male out there, because, you know, that's a big demographic,

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
and you're playing this game that's just whimsical commentary.

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
But that game forces you to enter into a relationship that maybe you don't want to get into.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
And if you're trying to create a me that looks like yourself,

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
and you're trying to play a character with good values because that's how you feel about yourself,

14:50.000 --> 14:55.000
and you're trying to create a character in a life simulation game that's a reflection on yourself,

14:55.000 --> 15:00.000
but you hit a wall that you thought in many parts of society we've climbed over time and time again,

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
and you can't actually accurately reflect yourself, it's very frustrating.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
And it's a huge setback, like emotionally.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
Like, I play video games to escape this shit.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Now, some of you guys might bring up, well, in Mass Effect I can do this,

15:15.000 --> 15:20.000
and, you know, in these other games, you know, in Dragon Age there's that one character who, you know,

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
maybe I didn't want to romance the same gender, but I have to.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.000
There's a difference. Those games are storytelling.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
You're not playing a reflection of yourself in a life simulator game or a reflection of a character you want to be.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
You're playing somebody else's narrative.

15:35.000 --> 15:40.000
There is a huge difference whether Nintendo wants to say there is or not.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Anyway, sorry, I'm hogging the conversation, but obviously I had a lot to say on that.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
I do want to just say kudos to Nintendo. They realized the mistake.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
They came out and they said exactly what they needed to say the first time.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
They came out and said it was an oversight not to do this in the game.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
We realize we made a mistake. In the future we'll try to do better.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Thank you. That's all I wanted the first time.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.000
That's all I wanted was, like, you know, just acknowledge.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.000
Don't put all this smoke and mirrors shit of it's a social whimsy world.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.000
Just come out and say we are too lazy to reprogram the game because that's essentially what it is.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
It's a port. They don't want to go back and recode the whole damn thing.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I accept that.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
And I would believe that.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
I do.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Too lazy to reprogram a game? Hmm, virtual console? Yeah.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Yeah.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
It seems to have an accurate...

16:24.000 --> 16:29.000
Going to our chat room. I'm sure the chat room is lighting up over at live.vognetwork.com.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
And I apologize because I wasn't reading as I was ranting there.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
So I'm kind of looking at some stuff now.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Bochikawa in chat says,

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
Regardless of this news and outcry of this, I would have really liked to see this bug not affect the game in drastic ways.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
Because that community that would have been born of this would be quite an interesting force to add to our gaming culture.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Might even be a subset of gamer, but we will never know.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
Well, it could be the sequel. We'll see what happens.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Eric RPG says,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
That's a really tough topic for me to get into.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
And I am going to say I am not the most well educated when it comes to Japanese culture because I've never lived there.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
So I'm not going to try to make a statement on that.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
But I will just say from what I've gathered,

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Japan is not as progressed as we are at this point.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
But change is coming, folks.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
Because more and more people are beginning to know somebody who is gay.

17:32.000 --> 17:37.000
And the more you know people that are gay, you start to realize they're really not different.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Know what you know and know what you don't know.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Kinda. Kinda, right?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Anyhow, let's see.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Going to our chatroom as well.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
ActDeft says,

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
I truly believe Nintendo did have the best intentions at heart, but it was just ignorance that came into play.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
So let's use this to educate them a little bit.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
But when they came out and released that first statement, it was like, it was kinda just gross and ignorant and so on.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
Here's why I'm going to stick with Animal Crossing for my fun little cutesy sim.

18:21.000 --> 18:27.000
And the actual sims for the adult angle.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
For the maturity angle. How's that sound?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Because I can have alien babies.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
What if Animal Crossing had forced you to get into a relationship with Ed?

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
That the only way you could have a baby in that game is to make a baby with Ed. How would you feel?

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Well, that's what I feel about the only way to make a baby in Tomodachi Life is to get married.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
It's the same thing to me.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Interesting perspective.

18:52.000 --> 18:58.000
Marriage and having children have nothing to do with each other. I'm just saying this.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
I've been married for almost nine years with my husband for almost 17 years.

19:03.000 --> 19:10.000
And yeah, maybe I wanted a baby for a little while, but it wasn't the sole basis of our marriage.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
You know, I see those assholes, oh my wife won't give me a baby, I'm leaving her.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Fuck you! You marry someone because you love them.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
And that's the whole point. If you have the game and you have the ability to get married,

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
it should be because you are playing a relationship in that game, not just to fucking breed.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
And sometimes difficulties come into play where mom or dad may not be able to have a child.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Exactly.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
And so, you know, that's why I always get, like, I don't mean to get on a political tangent,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm going to take this tangent train on a very quick trip, okay?

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
That's why I always get really, like, my feathers get really ruffled when I hear the arguments about,

19:48.000 --> 19:53.000
it takes a man and a woman to raise a baby and that's a proper family is to have a man and a woman.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.000
What about that family where mom passed away during childbirth?

19:58.000 --> 20:07.000
How offensive is a statement like that to that family where the dad is doing everything to raise that child appropriately?

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Yeah.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
Think before you open your fucking mouth. Why don't you just say, I think gay people are gross?

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Because that's what I hear. Again, perception, folks.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
They've got the cooties.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
When you make a comment like that, Loki, you and I lived together for what, two and a half years?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Did you catch gay living with me?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Did you catch it?

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
No. But then again, you throw like a girl, so.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So do you.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
Well, what about this too? I mean, I'll just talk about my, you know, my mom left my dad when I was a baby

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
because at the time my dad was not a very stable individual.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
You know, she left because of domestic abuse.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
Would we have all rather than that my mom had stayed with my dad and have him not get any better,

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
beat on her, beat on me and have that kind of a broken childhood as opposed to her,

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
you know, raising me with my grandmother and having me raised.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I was raised in a matriarchal house.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.000
You're not, you know, I'm just saying, you know, look at these people who have to make tough decisions like this.

21:14.000 --> 21:21.000
What about women or women who are raped and decide that, you know, because of moral reasons or whatever,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
they're going to have that kid.

21:22.000 --> 21:26.000
Do you want them to hunt down their rapist and say, help me raise this baby?

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, I got to, we're getting, I mean, these, these are all very tough social questions.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Obviously, you're asking some very uncomfortable questions.

21:34.000 --> 21:39.000
But I think what people have to realize is that, yeah, it might be just a video game,

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
but when it's supposed to be a life reflection, there's, life is a little more complicated than that.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
It's a lot more complicated. Yeah.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
So, and sometimes we play video games to escape life.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
But then when the game sets down all these rules that seem very arbitrary, it can be very difficult.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
That's actually why I really like the whole approach of The Sims to it.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
Because you can, you can, you know, bang somebody, get knocked up and kick them out of the house if you want to.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
You know, you can raise the baby by yourself if you want to.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I have had a character do it.

22:10.000 --> 22:19.000
You know, I, you can have, you know, same sex parents, opposite sex parents, and aliens and vampires.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
Basically, no one looks at you weird because no one gives a shit. It's not their business.

22:24.000 --> 22:30.000
I like that approach. Don't make it anything that's, oh, weird. Just make no one care.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
Because really, no one should care. It's no one else's business.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
All right. Well, we've got to move on because it is about half past six, and I've got to move into our interview tonight.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
You know, we've been talking a lot in this opening about how Civilization has changed.

22:47.000 --> 22:57.000
And, you know, there is another simulator out there, one of my favorites of all time, Civilization, that is, that has existed through, through five different games.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
And the third Civilization game, I'm going to be honest y'all, Civ III, not my favorite in the series.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
It's still a good game. It's like, it's like ice cream. Even a bad flavor is still ice cream. It's still pretty good.

23:07.000 --> 23:15.000
That's how I feel about Civ III. But then, you know, when I first played Civ IV for the first time, and I fired up that, you know, loading screen and saw that opening movie,

23:15.000 --> 23:24.000
it was very much like, yes, this is a new, this is the rebirth of Civilization. This is a new game. This is going to be awesome.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.000
And so Civ IV, you know, a lot of that is credited to the soundtrack of the game.

23:29.000 --> 23:35.000
And one of the most influential songs in the game that had such an impact was a song called Baba Yetu.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
And we are going to be welcoming the composer of Baba Yetu to the show tonight, Christopher Tin.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
Before we give him a call, let's take a listen to a clip because it is an audio download.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
I can't play the entire song for you because you got to, you got to go to Christophertin.com and get this album for yourself.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
But we're going to play a clip here to set the mood of Baba Yetu from Civilization IV here on Orange Lounge Radio before we welcome Christopher Tin.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
And we're going to play the song called Baba Yetu.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Baba Yetu

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Baba Yetu

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Baba Yetu

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Baba Yetu

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Baba Yetu

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Baba Yetu

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Baba Yetu

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
I still get chills listening to that. I don't know about you guys, but that's like such a great song there.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Again, that's a clip of Baba Yetu from Civilization IV.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
And we are going to get the composer of Baba Yetu on the line right now.

25:27.000 --> 25:34.000
We're going to do this live here. We're going to give Christopher a call and get him on the show to talk about Baba Yetu as well as his brand new album.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Hi there, is this Christopher?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Yes it is.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
Hey Christopher, how you doing? It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio. You're on the air. How's it going?

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Hi Rob.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
Hi.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Welcome.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Hi.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
Welcome to the show. Congratulations. You just released your brand new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea this week, right?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Yes I did. This Thursday in fact.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
Wow, that's awesome. Now if people want to pick up a copy of The Drop That Contained the Sea, where's the best place to go to pick that up?

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
Well the best place is my own website, ChristopherTin.com. You can also get it at iTunes and Amazon.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
But they take a big cut, so my website is definitely the best place to do it.

26:09.000 --> 26:17.000
So if you want to make sure that Christopher is actually the one getting your money, because he deserves it for this soundtrack, check out ChristopherTin.com.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
We see some folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw is asking, will you take questions from the chat room?

26:22.000 --> 26:28.000
Absolutely. If you have a question for Christopher Tin, head on over to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
I've also got some questions from social media we will get to in just a little bit.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
But Christopher, if you don't mind, I want to take a step back, because we are a show primarily about video games and gaming culture.

26:39.000 --> 26:51.000
So you have an awesome title by your name. You are the first person to win a Grammy for a song that was composed for a video game.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
How does that feel when you hear that?

26:53.000 --> 27:04.000
It's kind of cool. The history of video games is littered with all sorts of trivia, and it's kind of cool that I get to be a little footnote in that history.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
So it's cool. I really enjoy it.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
You might end up a Jeopardy question someday. That's pretty awesome.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.000
That would be hilarious if that happened. I would love that.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
Which would feel better? The Grammy or the Jeopardy question? No, don't answer that.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
I don't know. That's a tough one, you know? Yeah.

27:19.000 --> 27:27.000
Don't answer that. That was a dumb question. All right. Let's take a step back. Since we are a video game show, I want to talk about Civilization IV, obviously.

27:28.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm a huge fan of the Civ series, and I just talked about how Civ III, for me, was not the strongest Civ game.

27:36.000 --> 27:43.000
But Civ IV, that was such a rebirth for the series for me, and a huge part of that was the music.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
When you fire up that game for the first time and you hear Baba Yetu and you see the full motion video of Civilization is being created,

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
it really sets the mood for this epic rebirth for Civilization.

27:53.000 --> 28:02.000
I know you've probably been asked this question a million times, but for the sake of our audience, how did you end up being asked to do Baba Yetu for Civ IV?

28:02.000 --> 28:13.000
It's a pretty funny story, actually. The lead designer of Civilization IV is a guy named Soren Johnson, who happened to be my roommate back in college.

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
I went to my five-year college reunion and I ran into Soren and I said,

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Soren, what are you up to? He said, I'm a video game designer now. I was like, oh yeah, that's cool.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
He said, I'm working on a game. Actually, he said he just finished a game. It was Civilization III.

28:28.000 --> 28:33.000
I said, oh, fantastic. I love the Civ series. I grew up playing it. He said, that's great.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Well, I'm working on Civ IV. Have you ever considered writing music for video games?

28:37.000 --> 28:47.000
I hadn't at the time, but obviously it was a thrilling idea for me because, like I said, I grew up playing Civilization.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
Like many other people, I logged hundreds of hours playing that game.

28:52.000 --> 29:00.000
A few months later, I got a call from him saying, hey, Chris, we took some of the music that you produced in college and we stuck it on the game and we really like it.

29:00.000 --> 29:10.000
We were wondering if we could hire you to write a new piece of music that had an African influence as well as an orchestral influence with lots of big taiko drums.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
I said, yeah, I'd love to do it. That was kind of my version of the breaking into the business story.

29:17.000 --> 29:25.000
Just a pure chance encounter with my old college roommate, which led to pretty much the biggest break of my life.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
It seems so crazy that they talk about sometimes, and I was just having a conversation with a colleague before the show tonight,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
that a lot of the gaming industry sometimes is about who you know.

29:35.000 --> 29:41.000
It's so interesting that, yeah, it was this chance encounter or whatever, but it worked out so perfectly.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
You can't imagine Civ IV without that soundtrack now.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Yeah, it's kind of weird, isn't it? You think about it.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
This was like 10 years ago that I ran into him at our reunion, maybe 11 years, something like that.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
It's almost one of these things where it almost never happened for me.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
My life would be very different now if I hadn't run into Soren.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
It's a cool thing, I gotta say.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
Well, congratulations. Your music is incredible, and you're very deserving of the success, so congratulations to you.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Thanks, Rob. I appreciate that.

30:14.000 --> 30:17.000
No worries. Baba Yetu, it's had a lasting presence.

30:17.000 --> 30:26.000
Here we are still talking about, they're on Civ V and talking about Civ V and a half now with the After Earth and all this or whatever they're making this year.

30:26.000 --> 30:31.000
Yet, here we are talking about Baba Yetu. This song's had such a lasting presence.

30:31.000 --> 30:36.000
How did it feel to win a Grammy for a song that you'd written years ago?

30:37.000 --> 30:48.000
It was a great feeling. It was kind of surreal, and it actually didn't sink in for about a year until the following year when I went to the Grammys as a spectator.

30:48.000 --> 30:55.000
I knew some people at that time who were nominated for Grammys, and one by one I saw them all not win.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
At that point, I was just like, oh my god, I can't believe I managed to get through. I can't believe it happened for me.

31:01.000 --> 31:09.000
That's when it really sank in. It was kind of a surreal experience when I actually got it, though.

31:10.000 --> 31:20.000
Baba Yetu is really a staple of the Video Games Live Tour. I'm sure you're probably familiar with the Video Games Live Tour that Tommy Tallarico puts on, and he's still touring the world with this.

31:20.000 --> 31:28.000
I was actually just telling a story to Bobby on the show prior to us tonight that when I went and saw Video Games Live, I remember them playing Baba Yetu.

31:28.000 --> 31:40.000
That was one of the memorable pieces in the show for me. Have you seen or participated in Video Games Live, and how do you feel about your song being such a staple of the tour?

31:40.000 --> 31:49.000
I love it. I'm very heavily involved in the show. I conducted it from time to time. I conducted the Canada Tour last year.

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
We went coast to coast in Canada and did the show for a number of different audiences.

31:54.000 --> 32:04.000
I'm going to be conducting Baba Yetu again this June at the LA E3 Video Games Live Show.

32:05.000 --> 32:12.000
I love it. They were the ones who premiered the song live. They performed it at the Hollywood Bowl back in, I think, 2006.

32:12.000 --> 32:28.000
I got to give credit to Tommy and Jack Wall as well, who is conducting it. They really brought that song out of purely the video game world and into this new world that I'm connected to, which is the classical world.

32:28.000 --> 32:35.000
Because of Video Games Live, the sheet music got published by Alfred Publishing, which is a large sheet music publisher.

32:35.000 --> 32:48.000
Alfred issued it, and it became a hit amongst high school choirs. Suddenly, thousands of choirs around the world were singing this song, just for their spring concerts and whatever.

32:48.000 --> 33:00.000
It introduced my music to a brand new audience. I like to think that this was a big step in me. I think it's kind of difficult for video game composers to hop over to the mainstream.

33:00.000 --> 33:12.000
I think this was my particular way of doing so. It was purely through the fact that my music got performed so much, and the sheet music, that I found an audience outside of video games.

33:12.000 --> 33:31.000
Wow, that's amazing. Do you still plan to work with video games composed for future video games? Now you're on this different path where you're able to express the world music on your own through these albums. Do you see yourself working with video games again in the future?

33:31.000 --> 33:49.000
I actually have a new song coming out in a game that I can't tell you the game, but I can tell you that it'll be announced in a few days, actually. But if people like Baba Yetu, it's similar in terms of the style of it.

33:49.000 --> 34:02.000
The game itself that it's coming out in, let's just say it's in that same world. There'll be an announcement pretty soon, within the next week, I think.

34:02.000 --> 34:18.000
Well, I have a guess what that might be, but we'll see. That'd be awesome. I'm hoping it's true. I'm sure whatever it is will be awesome. Let's continue to talk about the future. I know that you have a new album that's out there, so I definitely want to let you talk about that new album.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
So what do your fans have to look forward to from your new release, The Drop That Contained the Sea?

34:23.000 --> 34:40.000
Well, it's a lot more epic, world-influenced, orchestral, choral music, I guess is the way to describe it. If people like Baba Yetu, then there's a lot of tracks on there that I think blow Baba Yetu away, but we'll see what other people think.

34:40.000 --> 34:55.000
But I'm really proud of it, actually. I think it's been my way of maturing over the last couple of years as a composer. I think the level of writing is a lot deeper. My level of expression is a lot more personal and a lot more grandiose, I think.

34:55.000 --> 35:15.000
I feel really good about it on a purely artistic level. So far, the response that I've gotten from people has been very positive as well. People have been saying that it's like the evolution of my writing. A lot of people have said it surpasses my previous album, so I feel really good about it, I gotta say.

35:16.000 --> 35:34.000
That's a great point, because when you talk about that this is where you're at now and things have evolved and so forth, I think everybody always asks me, how can I go listen to Orange Lawn's radio episode 1? I don't know if you know, we're on episode 552 now, so we've been doing this a very long time.

35:34.000 --> 35:40.000
And I'm kind of like, don't worry about episode 1, guys, it's not even as good as what we're doing now.

35:40.000 --> 35:58.000
Yeah, totally. You always want to push yourself as an artist and you always want to evolve, right? And what's a little difficult sometimes is some people, especially if you're an artist that releases an album once every five years or something, they're kind of locked into a time capsule in terms of who you were five years ago and what you were writing then.

35:58.000 --> 36:22.000
But you always do want to push yourself as a writer because you want to grow, right? And if people just want to listen to the stuff I was writing five years ago, there's already an album for that, but I do sort of want to bring people along for a ride and of course I hope to reward their participation on this journey by delivering a good product and I hope that I've done that.

36:23.000 --> 36:37.000
I think you have. I think when people listen to The Drop That Contained the Sea, they will not be disappointed. We're going to play a track from that in a little bit at the end of the interview so people can get a little taste of that. But if you want to hear more of it, check out The Drop That Contained the Sea at ChristopherTinn.com.

36:37.000 --> 36:47.000
Christopher, our chat room is lighting up with questions. In fact, I'm not even going to be able to get to all these. I feel awful. But I do want to ask you some of these questions that are coming from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

36:47.000 --> 36:56.000
I'm going to go with this one from Dark Tetsuya who asks, is there a particular genre of game you've always wanted to compose music for?

36:56.000 --> 37:19.000
Hmm, interesting. A particular genre. I think it's a role-playing game of some sort. I think that would be great. Or an MMO actually. You know what, I love the idea of working on an MMO. Something where people give me kind of a world to populate with my ideas, so to speak.

37:19.000 --> 37:38.000
Yeah, something like that. I'm not so drawn to things like first-person shooters. Whatever gives me the opportunity to write good music. But honestly, I just love working on games anyway. Whatever people ask me to do, I'm probably thrilled to do it.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
Well, I was going to say, if Blizzard is out there listening, Christopher is waiting for your call. So just know that.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
Yeah, I know all those Blizzard guys. And one of these days, maybe I'll come begging at their doorstep or something.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
I don't think they'd mind.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
No, I love them. They're a really talented bunch of guys. I have a lot of respect for them.

37:57.000 --> 38:11.000
Let me do a question from Dungeonbuster, who saw your AMA recently on Reddit. Dungeonbuster asks, can he share what about Katamari Damacy's sound makes it amazing to him? I love the soundtrack too, but I'm curious to know what excites him about it.

38:11.000 --> 38:17.000
Yeah, I gotta admit, Christopher, when I hear your music, I don't necessarily see Katamari Damacy influence. What's that about?

38:17.000 --> 38:25.000
But it's so good. I don't know, I can't explain it, but I just love the energy and the zaniness of it.

38:25.000 --> 38:33.000
We're not just talking about the main theme, which is fantastic, of course, but in my mind, the entire soundtrack to all the Katamari games is genius.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
I second that.

38:35.000 --> 38:47.000
There's a wide diversity of styles in there. I mean, some great vocal performances, some great tracks being produced by a number of different DJs and producers and so forth. I think it's just really, really cool.

38:47.000 --> 39:02.000
And I think it takes a special, really quirky game like Katamari to pull off a soundtrack like that. You're never going to hear that in any other game. And I don't know, I think it's just fantastic writing.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And I kind of miss that series myself.

39:04.000 --> 39:19.000
I have to say, though, it combines anything from old swing to jazz to the whole crooner style. My two favorite tracks are completely, stylistically different from each other. The Moon and the Prince and then Que Sera Sera.

39:19.000 --> 39:28.000
Totally, right? I mean, it's all over the place. And I think that's why it's so fun, too, because it's like this giant amalgamation. It's like a Katamari in musical form.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
It is. It really is.

39:30.000 --> 39:37.000
It's like a giant amalgamation of random songs thrown together. And I just think it's fantastic.

39:37.000 --> 39:47.000
Let's go to another question from our chat room from Gamer Girl, who asks, is there an influence outside of video games that you get your inspiration for the music you compose?

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
There's got to be plenty, right?

39:49.000 --> 39:58.000
Oh, there's a lot. I mean, I'll tell you what inspired me to write the latest album is I got really turned on to the band Florence and the Machine a couple of years ago.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Oh, yes.

40:00.000 --> 40:09.000
I totally dig her. And I, you know, this album was kind of inspired by that feeling that I got when I first listened to her debut album Lungs.

40:09.000 --> 40:19.000
I mean, I was just, I just loved the rocket-ness of it. And I loved the lyrics and I loved her vocal performance and sort of the gospel influence.

40:19.000 --> 40:28.000
She was, I mean, that album, you know, really, you know, there's absolutely no direct influence on any of the songs. I mean, they're so stylistically different.

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
But the energy that I got from her really made me want to create an album like my latest one.

40:33.000 --> 40:45.000
And then, you know, there's all the other sort of influences that I have from being a classically trained composer and playing jazz and, you know, doing all these other different things growing up and listening to world music and performing in world music groups.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.000
But honestly, the influence comes from all over the place.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
That's amazing to hear because Florence is one of my favorites. I got to say Shake It Out is probably one of my 10 favorite songs ever written.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Oh, I know, right? Oh, my God, yeah.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
She wrote it in like 15 minutes, apparently. She's like, like, she just literally-

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
I have one that I like better, though, and that's My Boy Builds Coffins.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
That one I can just sing.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
Yeah, so good.

41:10.000 --> 41:19.000
But she's very diverse in her styles, too, if you really think about it. And I know on your albums, you have all these songs in different languages and it's very diverse as well.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
I just, it's, I would have never made that connection to Florence. That's so funny.

41:22.000 --> 41:33.000
Yeah, I mean, it's purely on a fan level that I'm connected to her. I mean, there's no sort of like, it's not like our music is related in any sort of level, but I just, I'm just a huge fan.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I understand the feeling very well.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
If I may, actually, one tiny question for me.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
Of course.

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
I did happen to notice it sounded like you had a little bit of a minimalist influence as well, like Philip Glass.

41:45.000 --> 41:59.000
Hmm, actually, I was a big John Adams fan all through college, actually. That's well spotted. I'm not sure where you spotted that, but you know, that's woven into my DNA musically. So I mean, it's all this sort of stuff surfaces at one point or another, so good catch.

41:59.000 --> 42:09.000
I just sort of got the feeling across the board, you know, it's like, you know, how there's just that, it'll start with one thing and then build and build and build, but it's so subtle that you don't notice it until one point.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
Well, what were we talking about a minute ago? Art always provokes response, and it's always interesting how that response comes in all these different ways.

42:16.000 --> 42:27.000
I actually, when I'm a designer, as my hobby now, I do it only for volunteer work now, but when I listen to you, actually, when I draw, I listen to Philip Glass.

42:28.000 --> 42:42.000
And depending on the style of what I'm doing, depends the style of music I'm going to listen to. It's like, I will fully throw on, you know, Ella Fitzgerald if I'm doing, you know, 30s and 40s style, so.

42:42.000 --> 42:56.000
All right, well, I just, I don't want to take up too much of Christopher's time. I just have a couple more questions from our chatters and our listeners. One more question from chat here, Christopher, from Tiger Claw, who asks, have you ever thought of composing, speaking of diversity, have you ever thought of composing for feature films or TV?

42:57.000 --> 43:10.000
Yeah, you know, I've never really given TV much of a thought until recent years, and I think that's because, like, I think TV's gotten really good recently, and, you know, I've started to become more of a fan of TV.

43:10.000 --> 43:26.000
Films, my original intent was to write for movies, but along the way, I sort of got sidetracked by commercials, games, and, you know, this career that I have now. I would love to write for films. I think collaborative work is a lot of fun, and films are a great medium to work in.

43:26.000 --> 43:35.000
So, I mean, I have done a number of films, and I'd certainly like to do more. So, I mean, I'm just, you know, I'm keeping all my options open at this point.

43:36.000 --> 43:44.000
All right, I'm going to go to one more question. This one's actually from Facebook, and I know this guy is a huge fan of yours, so he'd be so devastated if I didn't ask his question, and I'm going to.

43:44.000 --> 43:53.000
So, Awesome Unicorn is on our Facebook and asked you this question earlier this week, who said, I'd like to hear about the process of selecting vocalists for the songs.

43:53.000 --> 44:01.000
Some of your work seems very tailored to a specific type of performance or singing style, and then others seem like a wider range of vocalists would be able to perform the songs.

44:01.000 --> 44:08.000
Do you tend to write songs with specific performers in mind to sing them, or do the songs come first and the quest for the vocalists later?

44:08.000 --> 44:19.000
Well, hello, Awesome Unicorn, first of all. Yes, I do actually write specifically with vocalists in mind.

44:19.000 --> 44:29.000
I mean, usually what will happen is I'll listen to a bunch of records, and I'll identify who I want to work with, and then I'll just track them down on the internet and write to them.

44:29.000 --> 44:43.000
If they're game, I will write with them in mind. With a lot of the singers I've reached out to, they've totally been game, and so the songs were pretty much tailored to them.

44:43.000 --> 44:55.000
I think there's a real advance to doing that. First of all, if you have a specific singer in mind, you can write to their strengths.

44:55.000 --> 45:03.000
When you write to their strengths, they'll perform the hell out of it. When they perform the hell out of it, you get an immensely dramatic and gratifying performance.

45:03.000 --> 45:10.000
You maybe won't always get that when you write something in the abstract and have someone else come in and sing it later.

45:10.000 --> 45:20.000
There are times when I've done that as well, and it works some of the times, but generally speaking, I prefer to have someone in mind when I'm writing for them.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
When I'm writing a song, I prefer to have a particular voice in mind. Let me put it that way.

45:25.000 --> 45:30.000
Good to know. I'm glad we could resolve Awesome Unicorn's inquiry there.

45:30.000 --> 45:36.000
Before we let Christopher go and get to the other song preview, Jamie, you mentioned you had one other quick question you wanted to sneak in.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
What is your favorite non-standard time signature?

45:40.000 --> 45:54.000
Probably, I don't know, maybe 7-8 or 5-8, something like that. I'm going to start exploring more and more complex ones as I get further and further into Bulgarian music and Bulgarian rhythms, which are very complicated.

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
7-8, 9-8, 11-8, 13-8, things like that. I'm just going to start exploring a little more.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
But I think there's plenty of great music that can be written in 4-4, I gotta say.

46:04.000 --> 46:15.000
I agree with that. I just keep thinking about the first time I ever, I was a band nerd, the first time I ever played Mars Bringer of War, and learning how to do 5-8, and I was like, I want more of this.

46:15.000 --> 46:22.000
Yeah, right? Totally. There's a little bit of a Mars Bringer of War influence on one of the songs on my new album, too, actually.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
Ooh, I'm excited, because that's like my favorite in the planets.

46:27.000 --> 46:38.000
Oh my god, yeah, it's fantastic. Actually, the ninth track of my album, it's called Has Gengor Fridum, which is a sort of setting of an Old Norse Viking text.

46:38.000 --> 46:52.000
I mean, that's one, there's a piece where, you know, there's a little bit of Mars Bringer of War, there's a little bit of Carmina Burana, there's a little bit of Nobuo Amatus, Liberi Fatali, you know, there's all these influences.

46:52.000 --> 47:08.000
And, you know, I'm speaking to a gamer crowd here, but, and this is why I feel comfortable saying this, like, there's a lot of game soundtracks out there which have this sort of bombastic, you know, Gustav Holst, Mars Bringer of War sound to them, you know, these gothic choirs and things like that.

47:08.000 --> 47:16.000
And I've never really had the opportunity to write for a game like that. And I sort of resisted writing a piece like that, sort of for my own projects.

47:16.000 --> 47:33.000
So after I conducted Video Games Live, and after I conducted Liberi Fatali a number of times, I was just like, I want to write a piece like this, I, you know, screw it, I just want to do this, you know, I don't care, you know, if it's been done 1000 times, I'm gonna write my own version of this type of gothic bombastic thing.

47:33.000 --> 47:44.000
And so, you know, I channel Stravinsky and Karl Orff and you know, all these other guys and, and, you know, crank up this big old Viking tune, which I was a lot of fun to do, you know,

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Well, I'm sitting here excited now.

47:45.000 --> 47:55.000
Well, only Dark Sakura would go there and take it to a whole nother music nerd level. But the chat room is eating it up. Just so you know, Christopher, chat room is Bobby Black Wolf saying 7-8 is my favorite too.

47:55.000 --> 48:01.000
And kind of causing to a music nerd high five and they're they're they're music nerding out there. So that's

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
High five guys, high five.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
My first major in college was a music major. So

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Fantastic.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
I was a band nerd and I was a clarinet player in high school myself.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Oh, fantastic. I was a trumpet player.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
I was sax and contra alto clarinet just to be different.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
All right.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Wow.

48:18.000 --> 48:26.000
Music nerds and band nerds and video game nerds everywhere have a reason to check out Christopher Tin.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
You can check check him out on his website, Christophertin.com.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
And you can check out the new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea, which I'm sure many of you haven't heard yet because it just came out this week.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
So no excuses. Go check that out at Christophertin.com.

48:38.000 --> 48:42.000
Christopher, as we say goodbye to you, we're going to check out one of these songs from the new album.

48:42.000 --> 48:48.000
This is track four. And I apologize if I horribly butchered the name, but it's Eza

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Nomso, I believe.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
It's Eza Nomso, which means come tomorrow.

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
And this is also performed by the Soweto Gospel Choir who performed Baba Yetu and a little bit of trivia about this song.

49:00.000 --> 49:06.000
I wrote this at the last minute. I was on a plane to Johannesburg.

49:06.000 --> 49:12.000
And it's a long story, but I was being flown around for this commercial project I was doing for Emirates Airlines and they're flying me all around the world business class.

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
So I had a very cushy seat and I was on my way to Johannesburg and I thought I need to write another song for these guys to sing.

49:18.000 --> 49:24.000
And so I wrote this song and it's about clouds, which is kind of a fitting thing to write about when you're flying.

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
So it's got a sort of a brisk sort of breezy feel like you're sort of flying through the clouds.

49:30.000 --> 49:41.000
And the lyrics are about, you know, the lyrics translate to things like, like a bird, I fly, I sing, like a bird, I'm holding on to the wind.

49:41.000 --> 49:45.000
Very sort of poetic stuff about, you know, clouds and flying through the air.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
Well, we're going to check this out right after I say goodbye.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
Christopher, thank you so much for taking the time out today with us.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
I know today is a big day for a lot of people with Mother's Day and everything.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
So thank you for spending time with us and best of luck with the new album.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
And I really encourage people everywhere to check it out on your website.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Thanks, guys. It was a lot of fun.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
And I look forward to the surprise announcement this week.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Yeah, yeah. Keep an eye out.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
All right. Take care, Christopher. It was a real honor.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.000
Likewise.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
All right. Bye bye.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Bye.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
This is a clip of track four from the album, Iza Nomso.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
I think I said that right. Come tomorrow is what it means.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.000
Nyomso.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
Nyomso. Here it is. Come tomorrow. I'll just say come tomorrow.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:12.000
oh,

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:18.000
oh,

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.000
oh,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:30.000
oh,

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:36.000
oh,

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.000
oh,

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:48.000
oh,

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:54.000
oh,

01:59:54.000 --> 02:00:00.000
oh,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:06.000
oh,

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:12.000
oh,

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:18.000
oh,

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000
oh,

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:31.000
oh,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000
oh,

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.000
oh,

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:50.000
oh,

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:56.000
oh,

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:02.000
oh,

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000
oh,

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:15.000
oh,

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:21.000
oh,

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.000
oh,

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:33.000
oh,

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:39.000
oh,

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:45.000
oh,

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:51.000
oh,

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:57.000
oh,

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.000
oh,

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.000
oh,

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
oh,

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:22.000
oh,

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:28.000
oh,

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:34.000
oh,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:40.000
oh,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:46.000
oh,

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.000
oh,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:59.000
oh,

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:05.000
oh,

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:11.000
oh,

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:17.000
oh,

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:23.000
oh,

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:29.000
oh,

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000
oh,

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:42.000
oh,

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:48.000
oh,

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:54.000
oh,

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.000
oh,

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:06.000
oh,

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.000
oh,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:18.000
oh,

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.000
oh,

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:31.000
oh,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.000
oh,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:43.000
oh,

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:49.000
oh,

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:56.000
oh,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.000
oh,

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:08.000
oh,

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:14.000
oh,

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:20.000
oh,

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:26.000
oh,

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:32.000
oh,

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:38.000
oh,

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:45.000
oh,

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:51.000
oh,

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:57.000
oh,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:03.000
oh,

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:09.000
oh,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:15.000
oh,

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:21.000
oh,

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:27.000
oh,

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:33.000
oh,

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:39.000
oh,

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:45.000
oh,

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:51.000
oh,

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:58.000
oh,

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
oh,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:10.000
oh,

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
oh,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.000
oh,

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:28.000
oh,

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:34.000
oh,

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:40.000
oh,

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:47.000
oh,

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:53.000
oh,

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
oh,

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:05.000
oh,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:12.000
oh,

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
oh,

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:24.000
oh,

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:30.000
oh,

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:37.000
oh,

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.000
oh,

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:49.000
oh,

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:55.000
oh,

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:01.000
oh,

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:07.000
oh,

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:13.000
oh,

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:19.000
oh,

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:26.000
oh,

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.000
oh,

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:38.000
oh,

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
oh,

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:51.000
oh,

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:57.000
oh,

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:03.000
oh,

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000
oh,

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:15.000
oh,

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:21.000
oh,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:27.000
oh,

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:33.000
oh,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:40.000
oh,

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.000
oh,

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:52.000
oh,

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.000
oh,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:05.000
oh,

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.000
oh,

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:17.000
oh,

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:23.000
oh,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:30.000
oh,

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:36.000
oh,

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.000
oh,

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.000
oh,

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:54.000
oh,

02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:00.000
oh,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:06.000
oh,

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.000
oh,

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000
oh,

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:23.000
oh,

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:29.000
oh,

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000
oh,

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:41.000
oh,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
This is a real game, people, only in Japan.

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Omega Quintet, coming to you September.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.000
It's Idol Master meets the beep.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Drop that beep.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
All right, lastly but not leastly,

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.000
this made me exclaim a lot of excited things

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:04.000
that had to get beeped, because I was excited to hear that Tetsuya Mizuguchi

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
is back in game development.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
That's right.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
We thought he was taking a break

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
or was going long-term or whatever to focus on the college stuff,

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
but in the new issue of Edge,

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
which is available in print form and so on,

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
he talks about how he left Q Entertainment.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
He took up a role as a lecturer,

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
but he is not giving up on video games.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
So he's right now, quote, helping with a few games,

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
but they are not like his previous work,

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
like Res or Space Channel 5.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
He says, I'm helping with some social games in Japan.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I'm just helping.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
I want to start a new project on my own,

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000
maybe this year or next year.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
Yes.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Very excited, because I'm a Mizuguchi fanboy.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
That you are.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I am, very much.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:49.000
All right, Dark Sakura.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Well, there is a new comerage for the Left 4 Dead franchise,

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:58.000
and it is an arcade game that's planned for Japan

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.000
that basically it's going to,

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I don't know if this is going to be something like

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
the Gun Survivor series,

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
if it's going to be one of those,

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
but it looks like Taito is working with Valve

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
to put this out,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
and it's been thought of,

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
announced before as Project Z,

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
but now it's Left 4 Dead.

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Next up, Shaq Fu, a Legend Reborn.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.000
It got funded.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Next.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
What an interesting world we live in,

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.000
where Amplitude probably won't get,

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
on its current path anyway,

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:32.000
won't get funded,

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:35.000
yet Shaq Fu got funded.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Just let that sink in for a minute.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000
But.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
And then have a drink.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
But.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
There is something good coming out of this.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Okay.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Five percent of all the profits will be donated

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Okay.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Better than five percent going to Kickstarter,

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
but that's a great thing to hear.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Last but not least, we have,

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:00.000
you know how there's just two new tracks for Outrun?

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Well, now there are going to be three

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Outrun soundtracks coming out.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.000
You can get them for $9.49 for each soundtrack

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000
on Amazon or $9.99 on the iTunes store,

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
or you can just get them individual

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
in case you're like me

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
and only care about Magical Sound Shower.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Fair enough.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000
And don't already have other Outrun soundtracks.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Alright, we're going to move on.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
There is no frugal question.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
I was going to say, for the record,

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
one of my horses in Derby Owners Club

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
was called Magical Sound.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I remember that.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
I think because there wasn't enough characters

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:34.000
to be Magical Sound Shower.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
But you did have Beat Politary.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Just Politary.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
No, Politary, so that you could whip Politary.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Yes.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:41.000
And that Politary would cry.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Although it's kind of tasteless in retrospect,

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:46.000
but I don't really wish harm upon this individual,

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.000
but it was just a running gag with Bamani music

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
because her songs were really bad.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000
I had one called Just a Horse

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000
that ended up being awesome.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Didn't you have one called Glue?

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Yeah, I did have one called Glue,

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
and Glue ended up being my best sire.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:02.000
I remember I think I had one called Briton Spears.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Yeah.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
And then...

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000
I missed Derby Owners Club.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
That was the day.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I know it's still around, but it's not the same.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
I found my folder.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Did you really?

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
It has my horses in it.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Anyway.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Alright, anyway.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.000
No frugal question of the week this week

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
because I knew we would be running along

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
because of the interview

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
and I wanted everybody to ask our guest questions,

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
but it'll return next week.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
So Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
or Google.com slash plus Orange Launch Radio.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
There is a game Sega should bring

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
to the Wii U.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.000
What?

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Derby Owners Club.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Hey, now you're talking.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Because then you can whip the horses

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:34.000
with the Wii remotes.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Yeah.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
And Sega's in bed with Nintendo now.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
And you'd use your little sub screen for training.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
This is a good idea.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Why isn't this happening?

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
I don't understand.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
I don't understand.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
Because licensing everything that goes into that game

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
is actually kind of fucking expensive.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
That's why the cabinets are premium.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.000
That's true.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Aren't those like six digits for those cabinets?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:55.000
I would not doubt it,

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
especially for that main screen that always shows the running race.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Crazy.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
That alone is easily high fives.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
All right, let's move on to some other

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Take the card with you.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
longer gaming news stories.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
We'll get into maybe a little bit more in depth.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Loki.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
All right.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
So once again we're talking about Nintendo here.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
They're planning to approach emerging markets,

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
you know, like China and stuff,

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
a little differently than they do the rest of the world,

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000
including that they are going to actually target those markets

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.000
with different hardware or new hardware, I guess.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
They're basically saying, you know,

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
we want to make new things,

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000
you know, thinking rather a cheaper version of what we currently have.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
The product and price balance must be made from scratch.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.000
So if you kind of take it like, you know,

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
how they made the Wii mini, you know,

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:50.000
doing something like that for maybe like the Wii U or something.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Or, you know, 2DS or something like that.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Where it's slightly cheaper than the stuff that's out there,

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.000
you know, to help drive sales, I guess.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I don't know.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I mean, I guess that's a good idea.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000
I just, I can't imagine what they would strip out feature wise for like a Wii U.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
You know, the 3DS obviously, the 2DS works.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000
NFC.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Yeah, I think with the handhelds it would be really easy to get.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
The gamepad might be tethered.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Yeah, it would be really easy to get a lower cost console for the handhelds.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000
The other consoles, I mean, what about just a Wii?

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Like, why the Wii U? Why not just a Wii?

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Well, they have the Wii mini, so they could do that.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.000
This is for other markets that don't have video games

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.000
as much as they do in Japan, USA, Europe as it is.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Well, as of recently, they haven't had any consoles because they were banned.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
It's an interesting change in strategy for Nintendo,

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000
especially considering a lot of the crap that we use getting here in the States and in Japan and so forth.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000
It's an interesting way to try to turn things around by taking a proven success and launching it in other places.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:58.000
I mean, it's not like China is a small country, you know.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Something like the Wii has the potential to do very well there, so it's a very interesting strategy.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Maybe a good way to cut the losses in the home department.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
I don't like that term.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:11.000
What?

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Proven success.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Well, what would you call the Wii in that regard?

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.000
It is. Come on, Wii Sports. Best video game ever, sales-wise.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:23.000
I've, you know, saved the argument that I've made at least three times on the show previously.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
I call it a lightning bolt.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.000
It came, it landed, it's done.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Other markets, I don't know.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.000
I truly don't know how could I know the state of gaming in China.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.000
I really don't want to make any claims to that, but it's one of those things like,

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
it was truly media fervor.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:50.000
It wasn't technically, low barrier to entry, gaming, games, games from real life that we all know,

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:54.000
and you can do, you can put to use with less investment.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.000
It was a lightning bolt.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:04.000
You are not guaranteed the success if you give it to somebody else with cultural differences.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Bowling isn't a worldwide thing.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Soccer, you probably know.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I don't know. I just, like that term has a place that we use, not it, in my opinion.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Alright, well, we will see what happens.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.000
I think we'll get more information of this at E3.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Maybe, maybe.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.000
In the meantime, as far as the Wii U is concerned, you know, I mentioned that one of the other markets,

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.000
besides just the US, is Japan, and Japan, some information for what they're going to be getting Wii U-wise.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Bayonetta 2 and Hyrule Warriors set for summer debuts in Japan.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:41.000
This surprised me. I figured Hyrule Warriors was probably a summer, like, early fall game,

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:47.000
but the fact that Bayonetta 2, it's fucking happening this year, OMG, and it might even be summer,

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
especially in Japan, that's pretty exciting to hear.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:54.000
So, yeah, finally we'll get to see what this, you know, hype with Bayonetta 2 is all about,

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
because the first game was pretty awesome.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Of course, Bayonetta 2 bringing a two-player mode into the game, analog and touch-based controls,

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
and, of course, new hair for Bayonetta, very important.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Yeah, that's really exciting.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:18.000
The only other Wii U games confirmed for this year for the West, those games, Mario Kart 8, Smash Brothers,

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000
X by Monolith Soft, which I'm actually very curious about that one, that looks like it could be a winner as well,

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.000
and whatever else they announce at E3.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:32.000
So I'm fully expecting at E3, we're going to get release dates for Bayonetta 2 and Hyrule Warriors here in the US.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:37.000
That's pretty exciting, so some things to get excited about on the Wii U.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Is it going to be enough to really push sales of that system?

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:45.000
I don't know, I think another price cut would go a long way in helping that, but we shall see.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Meanwhile, Dark Soccer are going to talk about a game that should be on the Wii U, but probably won't.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:58.000
That isn't. Alas, Minecraft, specifically the PS4 and Xbox One versions,

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:02.000
they are not going to have the infinite world size that the PC version does.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It will have borders. You will find the end of the world, and then you'll fall off of it.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Basically, they are constrained for size limits so that you can't...

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I mean, they have bigger worlds than the PS3 and 360 versions,

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:24.000
but they still are limited because there's only so much memory, only so much space.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Not infinite.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:33.000
People make a big deal about the PC worlds being infinite and so forth, but it's really infinite in theory.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.000
You get the equivalent of a kill screen, where the data starts...

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Yeah, at some point you're going to run out of server space.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:49.000
It's going to be forever. You would be challenged to ever be able to run from one end of the world to the end.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Well, people do actually make that look up. I think it's called the Endlands.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:58.000
It's a thing in Minecraft where people basically go until the game starts having corrupted data,

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:03.000
and the calculations won't apply anymore because they've already used up what they can.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Wow. Has anybody found that on the VoG server yet?

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Everybody stays in one little area on the VoG server.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Everybody stays in one area, and also...

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.000
I tried to go out a ways when I built my house, and to come to find out, it really wasn't that far.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
That's why you fly.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000
The other thing, too, is I occasionally...

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:24.000
Well, I don't anymore, because I haven't really messed with the server in a while,

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.000
but I'd occasionally cut all the area that's around...

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Because I did that so that new terrain would generate, because when we upgraded,

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:39.000
there's new biomes and stuff that weren't generating, so I did that.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.000
And so I clamped it all down to where we were just at.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:50.000
So if some idiot goes straight for a long ways away, I'm just going to probably...

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Unless there's some interesting stuff over there, I'm probably just going to erase that terrain and...

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Clip it out, yeah.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Yeah.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Okay, fair enough.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000
It's really boring, though. There's not a lot of terrain that's interesting over there.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
There's a lot of great stuff on the VoG server, though.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I know we haven't talked about it in a while, but there have been people working hard on there

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
to connect everything with trains everywhere.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Seattle said it best, the Farlands. That was it.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Well, yeah, the problem right now is when they upgraded Bucket,

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:19.000
it's because they've added all this new stuff now,

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.000
because they're giving you the ability where you're going to be able to change your username,

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.000
and so they're tied into IDs now, and so all the systems that are based off usernames are all broken,

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:31.000
and so it's just a big ol' mess. The whole infrastructure is kind of being rewritten,

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:34.000
so a lot of those plugins aren't available.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
And I've spent all my time programming, so I haven't really messed with...

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Because honestly, I looked at the server logs and there's nobody on there, so whatever.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:45.000
How do you guys feel about the limited space on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I kind of feel that even though it's limited, it's going to be very hard to push the boundaries of it.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.000
It's going to be a lot of space to work with. I don't think it's a big deal.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Well, they're saying it was because of save file limitations, so how big of a save file are we talking?

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Because save files aren't normally that big, at least on consoles.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I would imagine, even with a couple megs, which some games have 30-meg save files.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I mean, they're huge, some of them.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I'm surprised you couldn't just make an exception. I mean, come on, it's Minecraft.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:17.000
They're like, nope, nope, nope, sorry, we have this rule in place here that we can't do this.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
We're not flexible at all.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
It might have something to do with the RAM or something. I don't know.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000
But I'm pretty sure those save files are going to be able to be pretty big.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:29.000
You know, I was just thinking. Remember when 30 megs were hard drive limits?

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Yes, right?

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
When we moved out here, we had a 60-meg hard drive.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Yeah. My first PC had a 40-megabyte hard drive. Like, that couldn't even fit an episode of this show.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:46.000
The day the gigabyte was standard, I was like, ahhh.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Exactly.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:51.000
My first computer had a 0-megabyte hard drive.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:26:00.000
My first computer, mine, it actually was in my bedroom. It had no hard drive and two 5.25-inch flash drives.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Yeah, I remember when those 5.25-inch disks could hold, what, 720 kilobytes?

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
And when you measured your hard drive by height?

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Yeah.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I used to use a full-height hard drive as a paperweight.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
We're reminiscing again. Let's go do more news.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Because we're old.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
I know. Low-key.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:25.000
Alright. So, this is kind of, I don't know.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Everyone's been kind of wondering since they announced Unreal Engine 4.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Hey, so when do we get in the next Unreal Tournament game?

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Because it's been like, what, six years since Unreal Tournament came out?

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Maybe even more than that.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:46.000
So, now Epic is going to put out an Unreal Tournament game, but they're kind of going a different route with it.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
They're actually making it open source.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000
And so, they're going to be creating the game.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.000
It's going to be on, I want to say it was going to be on GitHub or something like that.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
Oh, that was fun.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Well, maybe not GitHub. I don't know.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Oh, it is on GitHub.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:10.000
But it's going to be available to the people that actually pay for the Unreal Engine.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I don't know if I trust those crazy people at GitHub anyway.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:28.000
And apparently, there's going to be discussion with people that work at Epic developing the game and fans of the game.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.000
And you're actually going to be kind of helping mold how the game is.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:37.000
And they're going to have Twitch streams showing stuff like that.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Also, like I said, all the code that's created during the development of the game will be available on GitHub if you're an Unreal Engine 4 developer.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:50.000
So, you need to pay that $19.99 a month or whatever it is.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.000
So, that's kind of neat.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.000
And when the game does come out, it will be free to play.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Interesting.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I'm sorry. Yeah. And not free to play as in you buy stuff. It's free.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Which is a shocking...

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I really don't want to do Unreal a disservice because they have been a mainstay for so many important things for as long as they have.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
And so, I really...

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Very specific, the point that I'm trying to make.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:28.000
I've always considered Unreal to be kind of second.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
More engine, less game.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Exactly as Loki just finished saying.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Unreal Tournament, not so prolific.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:38.000
But the games that have been built on Unreal Engine, far and wide.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Phenomenal. That's where their strength is and they make a good game on top of it.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:48.000
The fact that they're going in the same direction that Valve has with Steam.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Steamworks and mods for their game aren't new.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:59.000
But items and all of these other community-driven things that generate interest, revenue for everybody.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.000
It's the right choice for them. It's the way the gaming has gone.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:12.000
It enables them to do new things and open up Unreal to plenty more players that may not have been able to play it in the past.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Not condescendingly, welcome to this generation.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:22.000
It seems like they did it right. They're here. Everything that they've done has been interesting.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:28.000
The pool of available, capable games has only gotten bigger and it's exciting.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Some comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Dark Tetsuya says, not gonna lie, super stoked for the new, free Unreal Tournament.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Tiger Claw says, Unreal Tournament had a huge mod community behind it.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:44.000
It's where you can download lots of custom maps, skins, and all sorts of mods for it.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:49.000
SHG100Matt says, I still have Unreal Tournament 2004.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:52.000
Still my favorite Unreal Tournament game and I still play it occasionally.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:55.000
Live.vognetwork.com. Those comments.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Yeah, they recreated the whole end of Hypercube in Gary's mod.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Yeah, you mentioned that. Crazy. Mod communities are something else.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
But I mean that in the nicest way.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Anyhow, let's move on. One community that's on hold for a little bit.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Need for Speed. After 13 years of a new Need for Speed every year.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Really? I didn't realize that. My god.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Well, they took a year off this year.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:29.000
It will be back in 2015 and this news was broken during an EA conference call about earnings.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Ghost Games in Gothenburg is working on an innovative new chapter of the Storied franchise.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:40.000
We've planned an extended development window to ensure we're delivering a high quality experience for Need for Speed players next year.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000
That quote from CEO Andrew Wilson.

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.000
So, no other reasons outside of that, but you know what? That's alright.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Take the time to get it right, folks. There's nothing wrong with that.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000
And I look forward to playing this new Need for Speed game.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:59.000
So, alright. Let us take a moment to go to our email bag.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
You know, every week you guys email us.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Yeah, boy.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Oops. Not that one. Sorry about that.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:14.000
This is the song that we use for the emails every week when you guys email us.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Dark Soccer's gonna dive into the mailbag head first and find some emails worthy of reading on tonight's program.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
All one of them.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Just one?

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Yeah.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Hey OrangeLounge PokeMasters.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Let's create our own Pokemon on this week's show.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
With exclamation points.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
What would your custom Pokemon look like?

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:35.000
What are his or her powers?

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Example, fire, ice, electricity, etc.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Don't forget to name it.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Great show as always.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Keep gaming dudes and dudette.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
EA skeezy.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I would have a dark type that would be female and based kind of off of a fox.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Kind of.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Named Bob.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I don't even know where to go with this question.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I would want a kitty named Sanrio.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Like my kitty.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Well, Alan's kitty, but mine by association.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Do you have a Pokemon you would have, Jason?

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000
I don't have the imagination for this anymore.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:18.000
It's really strange to say, but like I said earlier, I've owned maybe three of them.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
And I really appreciate the universe.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
It's interesting, it's beautiful, and I love what they continue to do.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:26.000
But Jason would like a brain for his Pokemon.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
That's it.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Jason's Pokemon is going to be Mother Brain.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
I don't have the courage.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I need a heart.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I want to go home.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Jason's is going to be Mother Brain.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Well that makes that battle very interesting.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
That was a great Facebook meme I saw, by the way.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Happy Mother's Day with Mother Brain.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Did you see the Cubone one?

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I forgot what side it was, but someone said,

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Cubone's having the worst Mother's Day ever.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Because Cubone wears his mother's skull.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
Awful.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
I think it was Geekology or something.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Loki, do you have a Pokemon in mind?

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
I don't fucking know anything about Pokemon.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I don't care.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:08.000
We have to do our various shows as Pokemon.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Where we only say our names the entire show.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Rah rah!?

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Thank you for the email.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Team America. World police to me.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
No. We love the random questions.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
If you have some random questions for us.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Participate at Orangelawandtrady.com

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I would think with the new-

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
I'm a Digimon fan anyway.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I would think with the new stories we've had this week

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
You all have some things to say, so participate at Orangelawandtrady.com

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Why did you just make crossed fingers at Dark Soccer

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
when she said she liked Digimon

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
You don't even know Pokemon anymore

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I know Pokemon a hell of a lot more than I know Digimon

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Did you ever watch any of the Japanese Digimon?

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.000
No, definitely not

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Digimon Zero 2 is like the best anime in the universe

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I'm just going to say this

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
This guy I dated once

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:55.000
This is years before Alan obviously

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.000
This guy I dated once had me watch the Digimon movie

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I thought you said Disgaea

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Needless to say it didn't work out

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
No no no no

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
We have to have you

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
Whomp whomp whomp

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
You need to watch it in Japanese

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000
It's actually a true story

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
But anyway

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.000
I am disappointed Rob, my heart is break

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
I'm just giving you shit

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Although that is a true story

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
But that wasn't the reason

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
I won't go into the reasons here on this show

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Because I'm classy

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Let's get into the FUs of the week

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Speaking of classy

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
It's time for us to say fuck you

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
To things that are pissing us off

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Why do we do this on a video game talk show?

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
It's called tradition, deal with it

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Dark soccer

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
This one is private

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
I'm leaving it at that

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
I actually know I have another one

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Fuck you to my grandmother's doctor

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Who thinks that people give a shit that he used to play

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
For the University of Alabama football team

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
And isn't actually taking care of her needs

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
So fuck you

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
With a sandpapery giant three foot dildo

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Ouch

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Uh, Jason

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.000
You wanna follow that?

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:22.000
No

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I don't wanna come anywhere close to that

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Uh

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
FU to highway construction

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Oh god

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Oh yeah

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Oh you had to come through highway 50 to get here didn't you

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Yup

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Oh you poor bastard

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000
You didn't warn me

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
That's my drive home from work every day

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I forgot

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.000
It wasn't that bad

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
The good news is you don't have to go through it all the way back

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Eh, I got more traffic in Berkeley

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Shocking me on the way out here than that

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Whatever, minor driver

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
I'm enjoying my time in San Francisco

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Thank you France

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Low key

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
I'm not a big fan of cyclists

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:58.000
And I'm really not a big fan of cyclists racing

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
And the fact that you know

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
They're shutting down Folsom

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
At least most of Folsom

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
For a fucking bike race

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
Yes we could have done this on the weekend

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
But no fuck you guys we're gonna do it on a Monday

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
And we're gonna shut down most of you know

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
The part that people actually drive through

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
Oh and it's gonna be during business hours

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Wait they're shutting down Folsom on Monday?

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Yeah they're shutting down like a good section

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Of like Folsom Boulevard and stuff like that

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
So it's just like

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
I fucking hate you guys

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
So much

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
And now you know it's now they're doing it

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Thankfully I don't

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
I'm not going to work right now so it's not a big deal

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
I just don't drive through Folsom that day

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
But you know it's still fucking annoying

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
I have to see if that's gonna impact my work tomorrow

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
I was just about to give an FU to the fact

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I have to be up and in work early tomorrow

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
But now I'm worried about this

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Stupid thing that Low key's talking about

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Well it's just in like old Folsom

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
So I don't think it is

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
As long as it doesn't stretch out to

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Rancho Cordova

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
Alright

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Then in that case

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
My FU of the week would go to

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
I don't know I guess things have been

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Mostly well this week

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
I've actually had a pretty good week all things considered

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
So my FU of the week would go to

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Just the fact that

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
The year is going by so fast

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Where did it go?

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I know it's May 11th

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
It's crazy

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Alright

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
FU to the fact that frappy hour is over

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
It's actually probably a good thing

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Those things are a lot of calories

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Alright that's it for the FU of the week

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
And then we're going to open up the phones

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
At 1877 Game OLR

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Our username on skype

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
But a few more stories for you guys

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I saw this news and I kind of giggled

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Because I was like

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Damn

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
But yes Elder Scrolls Online has been delayed

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
On consoles

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Six months later

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
So uh

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
That's gotta suck

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Considering that I don't think that MMO's

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Done too well as far as like people being

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Impressed by it or anything

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
The fact that now the

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Console versions aren't coming out until

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
November or December

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
That's gotta hurt

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
Especially now that they're coming out instead of a dead period

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Of releases it's

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
In the middle of the fucking 4th quarter

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
When no one's going to give a shit about your fucking game

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
That can have positives and negatives

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Because it could come up on Christmas lists

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
And so forth

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
But Bethesda probably would have another game coming out

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
And it's either going to be maybe like

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Doom 4 or a new Fallout game

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
So who's going to give a fuck about an Elder Scrolls Online game

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Eh we'll see

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I don't know

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Unless it's Dishonored 2 maybe

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
I agree that the reception of uh

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Prey 2 finally

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I agree the reception of Elder Scrolls Online

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Hasn't been the greatest

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
I know we're really into it but

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
It does seem like the other MMO's out there

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Kind of eclipse it like nobody's really

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Going after Elder Scrolls the hardest

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
People are playing it because WoW's boring right now

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Or because WildStar's not out yet

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
You know I kind of fear for Elder Scrolls

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Once everything else kind of gets up and going

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
But we'll see

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
It's not like there's not going to be

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
New MMO's coming out

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Like there's going to be this game that's coming out from

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I don't know just some no name company

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Named Bungie that's

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
You know Destiny and

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Oh I'm sure that game will affect the

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Sales of that at all

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Delayed hopefully to fix all the broken

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Stuff that should have been fixed in the beta

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Welcome to the wide wonderful world of

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Online games where they never work

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
To be fair though

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
It is an Elder Scrolls title so

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
A vast majority of bugs

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Are to be expected usually with hilarious

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Results but you know it is an MMO

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
Correct yeah and an MMO though

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Things are different it's one thing to screw up your world

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
It's one thing to another to screw up everybody else's

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
Anyhow

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Some news on Disney

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Infinity which yes Disney

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Infinity there of course there's the new ones

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Coming out and it is a success

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
How much of a success?

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Well Disney Interactive's decision

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Had revenues increase 38%

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
During the second quarter

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
This means they have an operating income

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
Of 14 million this compared to a

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
54 million lost last

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Year this business grew quote

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Driven by the strength of Disney Infinity

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
And there's also growth in Japanese

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Mobile markets

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Unfortunately this isn't

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
All good news because they also

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Had to cut 26% of the staff

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
And a 50% reduction in game

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Development so they didn't just get

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Those numbers at the strength of the game

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Because they're not developing any other games other than

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Disney Infinity yeah that's kind of the

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Well I think that there's some mobile

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Stuff too but yeah it's not quite

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
What it used to be so yeah Disney

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Infinity sales over 3

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Million starter packs and an

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Estimated 500 million in global retail

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Sales to date Disney

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
Infinity 2.0 this

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
September of course with the Marvel characters

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Well yeah and then here's the other thing too

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
That Disney's doing why they

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Probably laid off people is that

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
They are now outsourcing

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Their games to be developed

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
You know for their movie titles

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
So like for example

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
They're not developing

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Disney planes the sequel game

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
That's coming out the Disney planes 2

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Or whatever Majesco's doing that now

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Or I

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Want to say like Tangled had like a

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Third party doing that one

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Harmonix is doing that Disney

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Fantasia eventually

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Someday yeah

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
I wish it was sooner than later but

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
Things happen

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
So well I mean

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
I'm glad to hear you know I'd like to

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Hear about profitability in the gaming industry

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Although I'm a little sad it

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Came at the loss of jobs but

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Hopefully it will lead to

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Job creation in a year or two

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
So that would be some good news

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Speaking of good news I

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Can't think of a better thing to end

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
The show on than talk about

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Free games right Dark Sakura? Yep

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Plants vs Zombies is free on Origin this month

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Go get it Well that's good

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
And bad news Bad

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
You have to get Origin good

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
Brains I don't know it wasn't so bad

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
I got it for the Titanfall thing

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
And you know it hasn't eaten my computer live

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
So whatever The good news about

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
All that despite all the shit we've given Origin

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Over the years it has gotten

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Better you know it's still

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Kind of I don't think you really need it but

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
It's not quite the pain in the

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Ass it used to be so

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
I'll pick up free games on it I'm not gonna

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Buy games on it but I'll pick up

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Free games Well actually I got

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Dead Space for free on there too

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
I got Dead Space a long ass time ago for free

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
They've been giving away

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
They've been trying to entice people to come to Origin

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
By giving away free games in their catalog

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
So hey I'm not gonna complain

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I got Populous for free too

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
I have quite the library there

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Free games that they put out every now and then

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
I haven't played any of them but hey

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
What else is new? Steam

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
See but then you get that client on your desktop

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
And then good old games

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Come out of nowhere and says hey we've got

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Covert action available for five bucks

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
You know that Sid Myers game that you're like the only

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Person on the planet that likes it Rob

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
So I had to buy it

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
I had to buy it it's covert action

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
You guys awesome

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
And I don't know

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Maybe I'll end up getting Titanfall

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Too cause I kinda want it

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
But I'm trying to hold out for a sale

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Trying really hard

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
We'll see Just wait

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
I'm trying Loki I'm trying

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
It's difficult

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
Alright that is it for our

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Stories tonight but we are

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Gonna go to the phones

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
The Skype line is open

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
1877 game OLR or a username on Skype

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you wanna give us a call to talk about

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Anything we've talked about tonight

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Or possibly something else

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Maybe there's a story we didn't hit that you wanna talk about

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Go ahead and give us a call right now

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
While we wait for some calls to come in

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
With a delay I'll ask Loki if there's any

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Last minute stories and I'm gonna bring up our

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Well real quickly we talked about a really

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Expensive HD NES

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Console that was supposed to be coming out

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Yes

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
So now they're finally selling it

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
It's $500

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
And it will up- $599

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
US dollars

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
$599 US dollars

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
And it will up scale games to 1080p

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Your old

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Nintendo classics in 1080p

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Of course you have to buy

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
Controllers if you don't have controllers

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
And it's

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
One solid piece of aluminum but

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Fuck that

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
I don't need it to up scale that

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
And I think if you even

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
If you bought an NES and bought an

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
Upscaler it would probably be way

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Cheaper than buying this thing so

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
I don't know

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Some people

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And just as reliable as it was back in the day

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
Do I have to blow in the cartridges to get them to work

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
For that authentic feel

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Yeah actually you would probably

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
It's those cartridges still

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Going to our Twitter

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Some interesting tweets coming in

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
SSG100Matt sends a tweet

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
This is sure to be polarizing

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
But I'm going to read it

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
SSG100Matt sends a tweet that says

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
According to a study and survey

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
This is from Reason.com

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
More gamers politically align themselves with libertarian

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
I'm not super

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Even though that's not where I personally necessarily go

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
I'm not super surprised to hear that

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Could that potentially be because

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
Whenever we talk about these politics

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
About violent video games

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
They're trying to ban them

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Does it drive people away from the two parties

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
That everybody talks about most of all

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Well the two party system is shit anyway

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
So maybe people are actually just getting smart

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
You think?

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Although I am actually turning my interest

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Toward the after party

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
That's real

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
That's basically what's evolved out of the Occupy movement

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Interesting

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
As long as it's not

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
A pee party

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Anyway

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Let's go to the phones

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
We do have a call coming in

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio who's this?

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
It's the one and only Ronma

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
How is everybody in the studio tonight?

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
It would just not be Orange Lawns Radio without Ronma calling in

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
What's up buddy? We're doing great

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
We had a great interview tonight

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
And Jason's here, it's a full house tonight

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
We have 25 devices on the internet

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
It's great

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Well there's 5 more devices I have wired up right now

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Not much, couple of quick things

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Number 1, I meant to mention last week

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Where you were talking about that

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Waffle place in New York City that we took you to

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Yes

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
It was called Waffle and Dingles I believe

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
I think that's the name of it but the place is so good

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
So good, still there?

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Yes, yes it is

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
So there's a possibility

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
I will be in New York very soon

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
We're going for Poutine

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Gee I wonder what announcement this is related to

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Because we may also go a weekend without a show

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Potentially yes

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
I will know next week

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Stay tuned

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Rob you don't have to worry about not doing a show

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
I have a small studio here

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
We will jury rig something

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
We'll do an

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
OLR Unauthorized or something

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
There you go

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Yeah there's a lot of interesting things that could be coming up

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
I don't want to say too much

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
But I will know for sure in 7 days

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
You can call it Marmalade Radio

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Because it's Orange Jam

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
Tune in for next week's show

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
I'll definitely tune in for next week

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
The second thing

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Not gaming related

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
Something I meant to ask you

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
I don't remember if I did

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
How do you feel knowing

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
That there's going to be Dunkin Donuts

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
In your neighborhood and if it's already there

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Have you been there yet?

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
I'm so fucking excited I'm shaking and crying and screaming and convulsing

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
I'm just like

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
You guys don't understand

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I know the rest of the US probably looks at me and goes

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
It's just Dunkin Donuts

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Fucking shut up

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Live in California and have no Dunkin Donuts

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
People even ask me

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Where do you get donuts if you don't have Dunkin Donuts?

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
And I go

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
That's a great question

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
I want to see Tim Hortons

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Yes

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
But for the record the grocery store and there's lots of mom and pop stores

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
There's no Winchells anymore

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
There's Winchells in LA

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
One Krispy Kreme

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
Actually I've found four Krispy Kremes in town

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
In the area

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
There's a couple in Roseville and one in Atomas

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Everybody finally got off Atkins

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
But anyway

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
As far as Dunkin Donuts goes

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
There is one in California now

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
And I haven't been there yet

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Because it's in Barstow

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Barstow is between Los Angeles and Las Vegas

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Known as Death Valley

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
Um

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Yeah

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
So I'm not going there to get a coffee

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
However it is coming to

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Our neck of the woods

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
I think they said 2015

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
So I think we're going to start seeing them next year

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Which I'm excited

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Their coffee is so flipping good

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
I have a reason I don't care

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
So terrible for you

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
I am not going to care because I can't

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
So you still need me to ship you

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
A few batches of coffee

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
I would love that

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Yeah however we can get the K cups

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
But I'm going to be honest the K cups are not

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
Even as good as the real thing

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
We also can get the bags of coffee

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Yeah I think there's better K cups out there

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
I thought it was really horrible when they had like apple

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Whatever flavored fucking coffee

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
I was like what the hell were they eating but the coconut was really good

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
It does not compare to

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
That drink that they give you

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
That's like a little bit of coffee and then

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
Creamer and sugar

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Amazing

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Anyway

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
I guess you could bring the discussion on our video game show

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
To food but you know what donuts

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Are a great

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
Great snack to game too

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Not healthy but

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Unless you're me you sit there and you

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Make a batch of popcorn and you sit there and you

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
Eat it while you're playing Kingdom Hearts 1.5

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Remix

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
Yeah something like that I'll usually play

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Final Fantasy 14

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
And sob quietly to myself

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Into my bowl of potato chips

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
But you know

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Alright anything else you want to talk about tonight

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Last thing I'm getting out of here

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
So yesterday I picked up my

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Glorious Playstation 3 from the shop

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
And the guy told me that

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
It's working

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
I had it burn in for about 4 hours

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
So you're good to go

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
But I recommend getting a new one cause this one's going to

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Die on you, may die on you soon

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
He pretty much told me don't use it for

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Streaming of anything

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Play a couple of games on it

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
Movies but don't use it

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
As a streaming device

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
He's like get an Apple TV and I'm like

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
What?

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Was there a reasoning behind that?

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Well

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
I took my PS3 in the first time because

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
When I was watching my Ronlef Blu-rays

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
It would lock up after about 10 minutes

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
And then

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
It would not read Blu-rays

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
Now it's working fine. The guy told me

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
I brought it in just in time before it started to

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
To yellow light out

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
He pretty much said he had to disassemble it

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Clean all the thermal paste off

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
Put fresh thermal paste on it, reassemble it

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
And get it up and running

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Wow

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
He said that the Playstation 3's were never designed for streaming

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
And I'm like

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
I've been streaming on this device for maybe about

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
2-3 years and I haven't had an issue with it

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Maybe you should just flip it upside down

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Like we used to do with the Playstation 2's

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I fixed everything

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
We used to put them on their side

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
With my PS1

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
That's what I did

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
When this first started acting up I flipped it

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
Horizontal, vertical

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
I'm like, okay, let's see if it works

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Still nothing

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
I always thought mine was going to be full of cat hair

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
Because it was like super hot

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
Heat coming out of that thing

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
And I took it apart and it was actually completely clean

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
If that Playstation 3 gets hot enough

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Perfect for grilling chicken

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
Mmm, if I ever had one

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
It knows

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
And I remember

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
When you get the PS2's

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
Don't use it for playing DVD's

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
The drive was not designed for normal DVD's

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Spinning, I'm like, well, let me go out and drop

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
50 bucks on a DVD player, you know

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
We used ours for years

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
Most of America used theirs for DVD players

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
That's why that thing sold so well

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
I don't understand how a DVD drive isn't used

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
For DVD's

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
You know how it is, somebody says something

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
And everybody follows along with it

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
But I think it was more of a heat issue

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Because when I moved it to this new place

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
My PS3 sits on a little platform

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
Under the table

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
It's getting intercooler

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
I mean, my friend had a friend who had an uncle

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Who told me that, you know, they buried

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
ET in the desert in the middle of New Mexico

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
So

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
And lo and behold

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go to get more calls

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
But thanks so much for the call, buddy

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
Uh oh

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
Internet connection problem

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
We're losing Rama anyway

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
So thanks for calling, Rama

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
If you hear this and your internet didn't cut out

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Boy, that was weird

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Oddly timed

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
Alright, we're still connected

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
It looks like

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
So I'm hoping we're not having those same issues that we were having earlier

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Rama's problem

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Northeast problems

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Oh look, and Rama just left IRC

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
So that's, well, there you go

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
He had to make an exit

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
He was just like, I'm out of here, bye

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
He was all, fuck it, pull the cord

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Yeah, he just said, fuck it, and pulled the plug

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
But we do have another call coming in

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Hey, one man's loss is another man's gain

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Let's get to it, hi, we're just launching

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
Who is it?

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Hey, you're lucky

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
That Rama just pulled the plug out of anger

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Or something

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
What's up, buddy?

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
Well, I could talk about

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
A lot of stuff that happened

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
During the week and especially on Twitter

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
But I want to talk about

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Team Fortress 2

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Don't know why

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Can we talk about Kirby Triple Deluxe

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
And you're gonna have to come up here and kick her butt

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
And by kick her butt, meaning give her a hug

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
And go out for Mexican food together

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
Dark Sakura hates Kirby Triple Deluxe?

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Not really

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
I haven't played it yet

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
It was a joke earlier in the show

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
Yeah, me neither

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
FedEx screwed up my order

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
It pretty much got lost

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
And I have to wait until Wednesday

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
To report it back to Amazon

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
And say it got lost

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
I'm kind of sad

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I would be playing

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
I would be talking right now about Kirby

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
I am surprised you are not over there right now

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Beating down the door

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
Showing your anger

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
It's very reserved of you

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Anyway, I'm sorry

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
That's not what you called in to talk about

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
What did you want to talk about?

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
You want to talk about Team Fortress 2?

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Yeah, basically

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
I got back into Team Fortress 2

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
After months of not playing

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
And still the game is pretty much the same

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
It hasn't changed that much

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
At least from what I've noticed

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Aside from new hats

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
And some new stuff for the weapons

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
But

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
I don't know

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
I found a new enjoyment on it again

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
And pretty much

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
Where I'm going

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Is if you have

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Played a game recently

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Or maybe not recently

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
But

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
That's a reason

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
That you haven't played

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
For many months or many years

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Before

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
I actually do have an answer to this

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
But you guys are going to roll your eyes so hard

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
You can see your fucking brain

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
But it's my honest to god answer

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
And that is because I had the new computer

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
And all the new graphics and everything

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
The one game I had to go back and see

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Was Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
And play that again

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
I totally did do that this week too

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
It was so sexy

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
The graphics were about the same

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
Because Mass Effect 3 was only set for a certain bench level of graphics

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
And I wasn't using HD textures or anything

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:54.000
So not to be all Jamie about my gaming week

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
But I definitely played some Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
And that was a sexy thing to revisit

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
I'm trying to think

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
Because I've had the new computer

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
There's been other things I've been revisiting too

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Getting to go back and play

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
Some of the games I've had

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
Diablo and stuff was pretty cool too

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
But what about you guys?

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Is there a game?

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
You've played for the first time in a very long time

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
You just kind of went back and revisited

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
It wasn't a long time

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
But I've had the conversation a couple times

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
About comparing Titanfall on the 360

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
Versus the Xbox One

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
And they're not terribly different

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
I think more of the differences that I see

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
Are the fact that I sit closer to the TV

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
At work than I do at home

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
And I think it may have those

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
120, 240 hertz features on

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
And not on game mode

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Flat 60, etc.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
I played

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
I don't know if this actually counts

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
But I did download Jetmoto 2

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Onto my PSP

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Not Vita

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Onto my PSP

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
The other day

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
I bought it a while back

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
Graphically I don't remember anything

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
But not having all of the shoulder buttons

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Completely fucks that game up

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Because the R1, L1, and R2, L2

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Do very distinct things

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
I really wish they'd bring that game series back

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
Jetmoto?

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
I saw what they did with 3 though

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
I played Fairy Solitaire

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
Fairy Solitaire?

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
Can't get it old school

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
I was bored

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
So I played Fairy Solitaire

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Especially when you have some of those free games

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
I played Portal 2 not that long ago

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
And that was the first time since probably the game came out

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
It was kind of fun to relive that one

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
I should just give you my Portal 2 shirt that I don't wear

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Cool, free clothes

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
I played

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
While I was restocking my 360

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
I downloaded and played Discs of Tron

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
That didn't look any different

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
My 360 hasn't been hooked up for like 6 months

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
I had so many downloadable games it was disgusting

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
So I should plug that in and play some of that old school stuff

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
I did have the Tron

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
They released that

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
The arcade Tron

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
4 minigames

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
The Overworld is a game

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Although it's not

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
I can travel in 4 directions

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Hey in the 80's that was modern stuff

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
Well there you go Act Deaf

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
There's some of our walks down memory lane

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
Yeah those are pretty cool games

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Especially like Portal

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:22.000
It's a game I usually try to play at least a few times a year

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Even I played Portal the first one a few weeks ago

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
I did a stream on it too

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Good times

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Good times

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
When these companies give away games for free

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Even though they might be a few years old

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
They're always worth picking up

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Let's say Plants vs Zombies being given away free

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Right now on Origin

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
As long as you're cool and have an Origin on your computer

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Most of you probably already have it

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
I would say go grab it while it's free

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Because maybe you haven't played Plants vs Zombies

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Since it was first out on the

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
IOS or Android devices

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Or when it was first out on Xbox 360

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
It might be a whole different experience on PC

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
Definitely worth picking up

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
Especially if you don't have it

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
Because it's a really great game

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
Absolutely

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
I already have it on Steam

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
Act Deaf I'm going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
Thank you very much for the call

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Good question trip down memory lane

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Hey thanks for having me

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
And I hope you get your copy of Kirby already

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
I can't have Kirby's number one fan here on OLR

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Being robbed of his Kirby

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
It's not cool

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
It's sad

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Oh FedEx we're coming after them too if they don't get it worked out

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
Alright

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
Take care

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
Alright

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
We can probably squeeze in one more call if someone can get in here pretty quick

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
DarkTetsuya sends us a note that Fistful of Potions

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
Was taping from a comic shop during free comic book day

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
That was last week

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
But yes I read that one last week

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
That was during the

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
Wait did you?

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
If they tweet during the show I usually get to it

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
Jason if you let me do my segment

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
I'm just kidding

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Well we are being invited to Concord Ontario

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Being a Catholic school board trustee

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
What the hell is that?

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
We get all these random ass tweets that are like

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
Oh I went to church and I saw the

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
OLR and I'm like what the fuck is this

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
I've been trying to figure out who they are

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
I don't know who OLR is

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
It's a church I just don't remember what it was

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
I remember seeing that one time

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Probably Ontario something

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
That's fine

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
But it just cracks me up

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Because I'll see these random tweets

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
It's like somebody tweeting god dammit

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
I heard you talking shit about me on air

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
That was an actual tweet from Gemet this week

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
Or hey read only memories

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Is on Steam Greenlight

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
Like Reddertainment tweeted us which is true

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
And then it'll be like oh the worship this Sunday

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Was so good

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
It's Our Lady of Rosary Church

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
In Union City

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
Thank you

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
It's like my story that I've told

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
My coworker who has the Twitter name Dice

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
And he retweets

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
Everybody who bitches at him

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
For Battlefield

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:04.000
There's one it's www.OLR.net

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
And then

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
OLRSD.org

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
For the San Diego one

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
I think it's just a church there

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Who owns OLR.com

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
Online residential New York source for real estate

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Listings

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
I looked into that some time ago

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
But you know whatever

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Anyway

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
Moving on to another tweet

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
Again this is the last chance to get called in

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Or to call in 1877 game OLR

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
username on Skype

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
Orange Lounge Radio

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
I see some people talking about civilization in chat

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
Which ties into the interview we had earlier

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
And it just kind of makes me laugh

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
Because Civ is that game you can go back and revisit once in a while

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
But it's going to be a very long while

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
All night long

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
And it's going to look exactly the same

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
And play exactly the same

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
As long as you have the time to spend on it

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
With Civ they have the expansions and everything

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
I kind of hope

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
I have a funny feeling

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
When Christopher Tin was on the show earlier

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
Talking about that song of his

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
It might be for that new Civ game

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
Is that the impression you got?

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
Because that's the impression I got

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
I didn't

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
I was leaning towards some new title

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
I was going to make a tongue in cheek

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Joke about Civ 6

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
Civ 5.5, Civ Next DLC

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Well there's the whole don't call it alpha centari

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
Civilization game that's on its way

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
Not my world

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
That was going to be my

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
Tongue in cheek joke

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
I would kind of expect it to be a new game personally

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
A different company at least

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
I was surprised

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
It was next week because I would have thought

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
E3, but now is the time of year

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
Where all the companies are getting a jump on E3

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
To say here's the games to get excited

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
About E3

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
As big as some other companies

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
Right, yeah I know about that one

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
Or even just need to shove some of the news out of the way

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
Before what they're going to announce there

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
All these companies that weren't cool enough to get in the door

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
Anyway, going to another tweet

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
From 13X forever

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
Or cross forever, 13 forever

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Who tweets us and says

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Did you know that Kiro Blaster

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
A new game from Pixel from Cave Story fame

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Is available right now

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
And tweets us a link to playism-games.com

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
I did not know that, but you have educated me

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
I've checked that out because

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
Pixel games, like all the

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
That stuff was great

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
With Cave Story and all that

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
So, excited

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
Hooray hooray

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
Unfortunately, Shane's not in the room right now

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
But I had to read this tweet from Andy Scout

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Who tweeted at us saying

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
I can't trust game recommendations from someone who doesn't like

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
Ni No Kuni

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
Me neither, Andy, me neither

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Alright, I guess that's it for tweets

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
How about any other last minute stories?

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
No

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Well, I guess that means we're out of here

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Because the phone is not ringing

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
So I'm going to go ahead and close that on up

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
And we're well past 9 o'clock anyway

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
I want to thank you guys for staying up late with us tonight

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
Really appreciate it

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
What a great show, thank you guys all for being a part of it

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
If you like what you heard here at Orange L'Antrado

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Please, all we ask, tell a friend or two

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
About the show, help spread the word

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Of the show, that's all we've got

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
Is word of mouth

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
We really appreciate a nice review

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
On a website where you found this show

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
Those reviews go a long, long way in helping us be visible

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
So please, help us out

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
Really appreciate it

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
Jason, I want to thank you for being here

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
Absolutely

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
I know we didn't get to talk as much tonight

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
Because I didn't get to budget you any stories

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
And we had another guest on tonight

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
Who, you know, with all due respect, Jason, you didn't win a Grammy

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
That's a tough act to follow

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
Maybe next year

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
I give him all of the accolations and lauds I possibly can

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
But it's a pleasure to have you here

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
And come back again sometime

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
You said you might be here next week?

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
Make a weekend of Scandia next week

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
And I can stick around here for the weekend

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
Then we can hear that schmexy voice of yours all over again next week

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
It'll be fun

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
I'll be here

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
We'll give you some stories

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
I can be here

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
It's like Jason the sequel

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
That'd make it sound like a Friday the 13th movie

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
Wasn't it?

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
The funny slash sad thing

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
That may turn out to be more accurate

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
Not the Jason movie part

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
You're going to be here for months and months again?

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
It's fucking possible

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Oh boy

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Keep that fourth chair nice and warm for Jason

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
Alright

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Moving on, DarkSakura

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
Thanks for being here

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
As you always are

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
You're welcome

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
I really want a burrito

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
A burrito?

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
I may go to Adelbertos

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
Do you want to get me a burrito?

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
I'm going in the opposite direction

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
I'm going that way, far away

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Well, poop

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
Well, if you eat a big enough burrito

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:47.000
Jason, I didn't properly give you a chance to give your final thought

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Did you have a final thought?

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
No, actually

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
I really don't

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:57.000
I have literally nothing left in my mind right now

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
Besides maybe telling your dryer to hurry up

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
Hey, it's got a timer on it

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
It'll tell you when it's done

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
Alright, my final thought

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
I love the fact too that you are literally on your last clean thing you own

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
It's a radio show

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
He can wear whatever he wants

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
But he's got pajama pants with little chilis on them right now

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
It's hilarious

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
This was a very explicit plan

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
I have more than a week's worth of pants

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
But I like having all of them just in case for some reason

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
I don't get a chance to do laundry

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
Because doubling up

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
Yeah, pajama life

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
Exactly, that's alright

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
It's radio, they don't look at us

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:37.000
The audience is lucky I'm wearing any pants at all

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
But you know

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
We're lucky you're wearing pants at all

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:45.000
I do that out of respect to you guys who come here in the studio

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
But trust me, the minute you guys leave

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
I did

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
Sorry, Jason

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
I did say as soon as I walked in here

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
That lounge has gotten more appropriate

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
Because we're not all crammed around a dining room table

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
And we're actually spread out

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
What do you think of Studio N7?

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
It's fucking open, there's space to move

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:07.000
And not have to shift and get out of people's way and contort

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:11.000
Most families would have a dining room

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
Well you do have a dining room, it's literally right there

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
You remember what we did with our dining room

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
Pinball

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
We called it Pinball Alley

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
I'm just saying, wouldn't a baby Pac-Man machine fit right here?

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
Just saying

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
Wouldn't it be great?

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
I'm gonna turn into Dark Sakura's house

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:31.000
Get a table, I have a freaking bar top cabinet that could go right there

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
Where's that in my video capture card?

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
You know, I thought about it before I came here

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
And I thought about it after I came here

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
And I was like, oh, forgot it

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
I'm messing with you

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
N7 is wonderful, that is my final thought

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
Alright, fantastic

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
My final thought tonight is

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
It is really stupid to drink a cup of coffee

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
At 8 o'clock in the evening

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
When you realize, oh yeah, I have to go to bed early tonight

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
Cause I gotta be up at 6.30 in the morning

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
That's not true, you have awesome dreams

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
When you're caffeinated

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
And they're weird

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
That's a good way of looking at it

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
Alright, last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
My final thought is I hate my fucking touchpad

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
For some reason it keeps clicking the right button

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
Even though I'm not touching the right button at all

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
It's really annoying

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
And it's just some stupid

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
Aces gesture garbage

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
Which I disabled, but it's still doing it

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
You have a rough life

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
Yeah, and I'm trying to figure out

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
How to fucking do texture atlases correctly

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
Cause I don't want to buy this one program to do it

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
And it's just a pain in the ass

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
Alright, well that's gonna do it for another week

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
At Orange Lounge Radio

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
Thanks to Christopher Tin for being here

Thank you very much, we'll be back to do it all again next week

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
Happy Mother's Day once again

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
To all you guys out there

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
Have a great week, we'll see you next time

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
