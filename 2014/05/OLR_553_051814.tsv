7000	14000	Visual Hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week Nintendo continues to stir the pot by confirming the new hardware is taking shape.
18000	24000	Microsoft's connected withdrawal continues with the announcement of a connectless Xbox to be released next month and the timing is suspicious.
24000	28000	The road to E3 continues tonight on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	43000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this May 18th of 2014, the 553rd episode of our show.
43000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
49000	55000	And it is a busy show tonight. With my co-hosts, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
55000	56000	Hi.
56000	57000	How are you, Jamie?
57000	58000	I'm fibrous.
58000	60000	Vibrous?
60000	61000	Fibrous.
61000	62000	I'm eating salad.
62000	66000	And that and your neighbors are jerks because they don't use their turn signals.
66000	67000	Oh, that's not very cool.
67000	72000	Also, when we hit 555, we need to call that our preval show.
72000	78000	Our preval? You know actually my car hit 66,666 miles yesterday. I thought of you.
78000	80000	Your car's the devil.
80000	83000	I think it might still be at that in the driveway actually.
84000	87000	Alright, also joining us as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
87000	88000	Hi.
88000	89000	Hey, Loki, how you doing?
89000	90000	I'm alright.
90000	96000	And I want to say thank you, Loki, for... Loki gave me a new HD capture card before the show tonight so I can do some fun things.
96000	97000	Loned.
97000	99000	Well, you know, gave me for a little while.
99000	101000	Well, if I like it, I'll buy my own, honestly.
101000	102000	Yeah, exactly.
102000	105000	But, yeah, no, I'm like really appreciative.
105000	110000	Well, what's sad is that I bought one a while ago, but it's delayed, it's not very good, I couldn't get it to work.
110000	116000	Don't feel sad, I have like six capture cards, I've just not been satisfied with any of them, but this one's actually pretty good.
116000	120000	So I can hopefully do more stuff online and all that, so it'll be good.
120000	122000	So thank you for remembering that, I appreciate it.
122000	125000	How's, what's the status of your game, real quick?
125000	137000	This week I've been working on an editor for making the ships in, like, well, because these ships actually eat parts of ships, so making all the parts out of my voxel stuff.
137000	144000	So that's what I've been working on, and I was working on a copy and paste function today, just for the fuck of it.
144000	157000	But it's pretty much done, I actually put up a new YouTube video last night, or Friday, so showing some of that, and I made the ugliest, I don't know, sort of spaceship, it wasn't really a spaceship video.
157000	159000	And what's your YouTube channel, if you want to check that out?
159000	161000	Just Loki O.L.R.
161000	170000	And Tigerclaw in our chatroom, because again, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, at the Voice of Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com.
170000	175000	And again, that's Sundays at 6 or 9, depending on what coast you're on, right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
175000	178000	Tigerclaw in our chat is asking what brand of capture card, it's an Elgato, right?
178000	181000	It's an Elgato Game Capture HD, I think.
181000	188000	And I don't remember the one I had, I want to say it was a diamond, and it does not shine bright like a diamond, let me say.
188000	192000	I shouldn't shade the company when I'm not 100% sure that was it, but yeah.
192000	197000	It has little pictures of video game, generic video game characters on it, and that should have been a sign right there.
197000	198000	Anyway.
198000	204000	Alright, also joining us in studio tonight, he pops in for a few months, and pops out for a few months, but luckily we're on an end cycle right now.
204000	207000	Say hello to VX JasonXVXYZ.
207000	214000	My trend of breaking speakers and overly loud audio segments continues tonight, as was evidenced by the intro.
214000	217000	That's alright, it's because you taped it here and not on your to-go.
217000	221000	Yeah, very strange just to be, like literally everything was different.
221000	227000	I used your microphone, I used Windows, I used Audition, and none of these things I have touched in, well your microphone, never.
227000	230000	It's amazing how differently balanced all these mics are.
231000	237000	Just a little behind the scenes thing, we actually use hand mics here at OLR, which is kind of frowned upon in the podcast scene,
237000	245000	but I'm just not set up, especially in this large space, to have these big honkin' stationary microphones, and we don't really do the sit around a table thing.
245000	246000	We just need to suspend them all from the roof.
246000	249000	Oh yeah sure, my rental home, suspend them all from the roof, sounds like a good idea.
249000	253000	The U2 music video from three or four months ago, I completely forgot what it was called,
253000	260000	but when I actually watched it, the swing microphone stand actually looked really amazingly cool.
260000	266000	Last week on the show, Shane was here in studio, we were talking about our trip to Scandia here locally,
266000	270000	which actually has just randomly a whole bunch of music-based video games.
270000	273000	It's actually a pretty rad arcade, I gotta say.
273000	275000	I'm gonna give props where props is due.
275000	278000	I felt like arcades were kinda done.
278000	282000	I go to Scandia and I'm like, this is rad, I feel like it's ten years ago all over again.
282000	286000	So props. But Jason, you went today, what'd you think?
286000	294000	It's really familiar, you go in and you see modern games laid out with a reasonable amount of space,
294000	297000	all things considered, on how big that building actually is.
297000	299000	It is a small arcade, yeah.
299000	304000	It's nothing to scoff at, but you have all of the cheap redemption on one side,
304000	307000	and a lot of good, modern, fun stuff off to the right.
307000	312000	You know what, Sunnyvale Golf Land was a huge arcade, and still is a huge arcade,
312000	316000	but they did a lot of fighting game tournaments and a lot of the Bomani stuff really took off there years ago.
316000	321000	And that was a really small ass arcade too, it's probably about the same size as Scandia.
321000	323000	I say yeah, as if I've ever been.
323000	327000	The only three golf lands I've been to are Mesa, Roseville, and now Scandia.
327000	330000	Over the span of 13 years, 12 years.
330000	335000	Alright, well I will talk a little more, we will talk a little more about those games
335000	338000	when we get into How Was Your Gaming Week a little later, but we've got to get to it.
338000	344000	There's too much news tonight, and believe it or not, tonight we start with breaking news,
344000	347000	which by the time a lot of you guys listen to this, it's probably not so breaking,
347000	351000	but it's Sunday night and this is what everybody's talking about right now.
351000	366000	Starting off tonight with a report from Variety, and I usually wouldn't talk about news this big
366000	373000	if it was coming from a site that has a bad reputation for rumors like Kotaku or Motley Fool
373000	377000	or one of those websites where when I read their articles my eyes roll to the back of my head so far
377000	383000	I can see my brain, but Variety, they don't really, I mean this is an industry-respected mag,
383000	388000	especially in the entertainment world, so the fact that they're running with this I think lends a lot of credit to this.
388000	395000	And the headline reads, YouTube to acquire video game streaming service Twitch for $1 billion.
395000	398000	That's billion with a B.
398000	401000	Billion with a Dr. Evil in the 2000s.
401000	404000	Yes. Need I say much more than that headline?
404000	409000	That is, according to sources, familiar, and then a lot of the rest of the report gives background information.
409000	415000	They do say that this is the most significant acquisition in the history of YouTube.
415000	420000	Google acquired YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion.
420000	426000	So Twitch, only worth a little over half of what YouTube was worth back in 2006,
426000	431000	and then no comment obviously coming from YouTube or Twitch at this time.
431000	433000	I imagine it would be wait till Monday.
433000	438000	YouTube, they say, is preparing for US regulators to challenge the deal, according to sources,
438000	442000	because YouTube is the number one platform for internet video,
442000	446000	and the Justice Department may take a hard look at antitrust,
446000	450000	because if buying Twitch could be those issues in the online video market,
450000	454000	and I know in the past I've said on this show, where is our Twitch competitor?
454000	457000	Why is nobody stepping up the way that Twitch has?
457000	459000	If you had, you might have been bought for a billion dollars.
459000	460000	There's livestream.
460000	464000	Well, it doesn't do, they ban gaming, don't they?
464000	467000	They do some gaming. I've gamed on livestream before.
467000	473000	But it's not really their big focus over there, and I want to say they have a lot of criteria too.
473000	477000	Twitch is really all about kind of the being open and everything with the livestreaming,
477000	481000	but the focus is on the game, and I guess you have Ustream,
481000	486000	but again, Ustream isn't taken very seriously by a lot of the big gamer circles,
486000	489000	and I think a lot of that just has to do with their model and so forth.
489000	493000	Ustream supports the Playroom boobies and butts channels just fine,
493000	495000	but that's pretty much all they do.
495000	499000	And I guess there's like Hitbox, there's some others,
499000	502000	but none of them have quite that share that Twitch does.
502000	505000	So it does raise an interesting question in that regard,
505000	508000	but I kind of think it's not going to matter at the end of the day.
508000	515000	I think if YouTube wants it, YouTube will get it, and this makes a very logical acquisition.
515000	520000	So what do you guys think in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com?
520000	523000	I'm curious to see your thoughts in our chat room.
523000	525000	Those in the studio, what are your thoughts hearing this news,
525000	528000	which we've been marinating on for only about 90 minutes?
528000	533000	LedUpG actually says, is AT&T buying DirecTV or Comcast Time Warner antitrust?
533000	538000	I was actually going to ask, has there ever actually been an antitrust lawsuit in gaming
538000	545000	since the third-party Atari Nintendo dispute back in the late 70s, early 80s?
545000	550000	I really couldn't say. I don't know that there has been.
550000	556000	It's been a long time coming, but it's not the sort of thing that we deal with that often that we hear about.
556000	561000	I want to say somebody went after Nintendo over the third-party cartridges.
561000	565000	I mean, when Atari sued Nintendo, but I don't remember if that fell under antitrust.
565000	569000	But that might have been part of their argument in that whole situation.
569000	571000	But still three decades ago?
571000	574000	Yeah, it was a long time ago, for sure.
574000	578000	Well, Jason, what are your thoughts?
578000	585000	All of my arguments stray on technical, so it's actually really weird to answer this.
585000	592000	I don't like YouTube's live streaming platform, and I think the technical marriage of what Twitch has done before
592000	595000	and getting YouTube live streaming in order is going to come a long way.
595000	599000	YouTube commenting during YouTube live streams is a freaking joke.
599000	604000	The whole of the interactivity on YouTube live streams I dislike a lot.
604000	608000	When you talk about YouTube streaming that you don't like, are you talking about Google Hangouts?
608000	610000	Because I actually think that stuff's kind of amazing.
610000	617000	I've seen, actually, because there's a Unity show that I watch that does YouTube live streams twice a week or so,
617000	623000	and they're talking about their chats and stuff, and sometimes their chats are several minutes behind.
623000	625000	It's ridiculous, the amount of lag.
625000	629000	So there's two sides of it. There's the broadcasting side of it, which is Hangouts,
629000	637000	and there is a Hangout host-specific chat, and obviously the hosts that are actually talking voice and video.
637000	642000	But if it is doing Hangouts on air is the moniker that actually streams to YouTube.
642000	649000	You go to the YouTube interface and just as a viewer take in the Hangout.
649000	657000	There's no chat to speak of. It's basically YouTube comments bolted onto a live stream that are slow and limited to 180.
657000	660000	I think it's more than Twitter, like 200 characters or something like that.
660000	662000	Live stream really does that a lot better.
662000	664000	Yeah, everything does it a lot better.
664000	667000	YouTube live streaming as it stands is terrible.
667000	672000	Having a technical marriage, even a little bit between the two services, there is a lot of good potential.
672000	674000	But I think it's important to say nothing will happen overnight.
674000	675000	Absolutely.
675000	678000	Nothing's going to happen tomorrow when they announce this.
678000	680000	Those changes would be gradual.
680000	685000	But you may see something happen around the holiday when more people are getting games that they want to stream online,
685000	690000	especially with the Twitch service built right into the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.
690000	692000	Loki, your thoughts?
692000	695000	I don't know. I mean, I guess it'll be alright.
695000	698000	I don't know yet. As long as they don't force Google Plus on everybody.
698000	700000	They've already kind of done that.
700000	707000	I don't know. I mean, I use YouTube more than I use Twitch, so I don't know.
707000	711000	I'm indifferent about it because it doesn't really affect what I do right now.
711000	716000	I've got to say, the news doesn't totally surprise me, honestly, because it makes a lot of sense.
716000	719000	Twitch TV was a privately held company.
719000	723000	There were investors that had invested millions of dollars into this company.
723000	727000	Investors want to make money, so when somebody comes in offering a billion with a B,
727000	729000	I mean, this is the kind of stuff that's going to happen.
729000	733000	And, you know, it's not Comcast.
733000	735000	I mean, there's that.
735000	740000	And it's not Facebook, I guess, because everybody got real mad when Facebook bought Oculus,
740000	744000	even though I don't think that's the end of the world either, but I digress.
744000	746000	None of it's the end of the world. It's all corporate bullshit.
746000	750000	Well, the one thing that does kind of pop into my head is, you know, obviously,
750000	755000	I have had some difficulty with YouTube, and it's probably some of the things that you all are thinking about,
755000	758000	is with the copyright claims and the things that they do.
758000	762000	And just to put this into perspective, last week on the show,
762000	767000	and, you know, Jason, if you didn't know, Jason puts all of the OLR episodes onto YouTube.
767000	771000	Well, not all of them, but ever since episode, what, like 5.03?
771000	772000	5.28?
772000	773000	Oh, really?
773000	774000	I haven't been to that one.
774000	775000	Okay, but, you know, the past-
775000	776000	It's been a good couple of months.
776000	780000	The past at least 25 episodes or so, you've been working on, you always put them on YouTube.
780000	783000	It helps to kind of like get it out there and expand the audience.
783000	786000	And it's a really convenient way, because like everything has YouTube, right?
786000	788000	So it's a really convenient way to find OLR.
788000	791000	You want to get OLR on your 3DS? You can do it.
791000	793000	Just go on the YouTube app, do Orange Ons Radio, you can get it.
793000	795000	So, I mean, we love it for that reason.
795000	798000	That's why Jason does it and takes the time to do that.
798000	802000	But to put it in perspective, last week's show, we had Christopher Tin on the show, right?
802000	803000	So he's promoting his new album.
803000	811000	And as part of the promotion, we agreed with his people that we would play two 90-second clips from his, you know, Baba Yetu,
811000	815000	because I knew you all would know this, and then a 90-second clip from the upcoming album.
815000	818000	So we played those two clips on the show last night.
818000	820000	I think you guys all know, or last week, excuse me.
820000	826000	And you'll never guess the message that I sent to Rob last night at about 9 p.m. when everything was going up.
826000	833000	So Jason puts the show on YouTube, and before the thing is even finished processing, copyright claim.
833000	839000	Copyright claim hits our YouTube that it contains a recording from, and it doesn't even say, it doesn't even say it's Christopher Tin,
839000	844000	it doesn't even say that it's 2K, it's like P...
844000	845000	It was a really vague name.
845000	847000	It was something vague that was a...
847000	848000	P-E-D-L.
848000	853000	Yeah, something like that that was a strike against the Civilization soundtrack.
853000	862000	Now, I could sit here and fight over the nickel of revenue that the OLR, you know, episode's going to make in ads or whatever,
862000	869000	but, like, I'm kind of over it at this point, but this whole fact that YouTube lets these troll companies,
869000	873000	and I had another, I had another one of my Let's Play videos get hit.
873000	878000	It was my Super Hexagon video that I have on my personal channel where the creator of Super Hexagon has said,
878000	885000	you may place my videos up and monetize them, and then the guy who did the soundtrack, you may place my videos up and monetize them.
885000	889000	It gets hit for the soundtrack because it's some third-party copyright troll.
889000	895000	YouTube needs to fix this, or I need to be able to go after these guys in response when they're doing it falsely,
895000	901000	because, really, they always err on the side of the companies.
901000	903000	What fucking business does that?
903000	905000	I thought the number one rule of customers...
905000	906000	All of them?
906000	909000	What is the number one rule of customer service? The customer is always right.
909000	910000	Actually, no, it isn't.
910000	915000	Whether you believe it or not. I taught customer service for seven years. That is the rule. The customer is always right.
915000	922000	That's the foundation that we go on, whether we believe it's right or wrong or whatever, and I know there's situations and so forth,
922000	928000	but YouTube does not believe that their customers are right, and that's very frustrating. That's why we're all mad.
928000	930000	Are you paying for it?
930000	935000	I am giving them stuff that they are making money off of.
935000	937000	But are you paying them out of your pocket?
937000	939000	No, I'm not paying them out of my pocket.
939000	941000	So I can go somewhere else, yes?
941000	942000	You can go somewhere else.
942000	943000	I can.
943000	949000	To her point, affiliates are more like... Google's customers are advertisers.
949000	954000	Above and beyond anything else, they are advertisers, and by extension, YouTube specifically,
954000	959000	when the copyright crackdown happened, the start of this year, whenever it was,
960000	967000	affiliates, those are the ones that have their own ad networks and agreements, and those are the ones where money is actually changing hands.
967000	971000	Unfortunately, I agree with Jamie on this one. Not unfortunately, but I agree with Jamie on this one.
971000	978000	And on top of that, you are also looking at potentially legitimate companies that do have the legal manpower to soothe the pants off of them
978000	983000	and get money out of them for allowing a copyright violation to go through.
984000	990000	Whether they're right or not, their first goal is to cover their own asses.
990000	995000	Well, and this is why there's that hesitation big time amongst...
995000	998000	You know, when you look at Twitter right now, and RIP Twitch is trending.
998000	1003000	This is why people are upset about the buyout, because they know YouTube does not err on the side of the consumer.
1003000	1010000	And so Twitch, if they go down that same path, everybody's just like, fuck it, then what am I doing on Twitch?
1010000	1011000	Why don't I go somewhere else?
1011000	1016000	Oh shit, there isn't anywhere else that's really usable right now.
1016000	1021000	So you gotta make your own video streaming thing or something, which I don't even know the first thing about doing that,
1021000	1025000	but maybe that'll be out there more and more as we look at the future.
1025000	1029000	It's gonna take something privately owned that isn't gonna go...
1029000	1030000	Again.
1030000	1034000	But that'll just get, again, exactly, that'll just get sold in seven more years.
1034000	1037000	Unless you have somebody with the integrity not to sell.
1038000	1044000	I don't know. I don't know how much integrity I'd have if someone's flashing a billion dollars in my face, but okay, sure.
1044000	1047000	You know, I honestly don't think that I would.
1047000	1054000	If I believed firmly enough in what I was doing, too many people are willing to be bought and sold, have their morals bought and sold.
1054000	1056000	I don't think I could do that.
1056000	1058000	Easy to say, difficult to do.
1058000	1060000	I've passed it up before.
1060000	1065000	With all due respect, if somebody were to come in and offer a million bucks for VoG, probably do it.
1065000	1066000	That's a lot of money.
1066000	1068000	This isn't morals, it's just a choice.
1068000	1072000	There are plenty of people that will not sell, there's plenty of people that will.
1072000	1076000	There's plenty of people that will never take VC money, there's plenty of people that will.
1076000	1081000	But if you're taking a stance against this kind of business practice, then you have to be able to stand by it.
1081000	1084000	The more that they think that money's gonna work, the more they're gonna do it.
1084000	1087000	The people that started these companies probably didn't come in with...
1087000	1090000	Twitch did not come in because YouTube was bad.
1090000	1092000	That was years and years and years ago.
1093000	1101000	If somebody is gonna say, hey, we're offering you an alternative to the corporate owned crap or whatever, we're offering you this.
1101000	1102000	Which might happen.
1102000	1110000	They'd have to also be willing to get their funding from, I'm gonna just use quoting fingers on this, a legitimate source.
1110000	1113000	As opposed to taking buyout money.
1113000	1116000	They'd have to be willing not to sell out.
1116000	1121000	Well, I mean, if we look at Twitch's history, I mean, Twitch started, of course, as Justin TV.
1121000	1125000	And I remember when OLR was broadcast on Justin TV because they were just starting to get their gaming content.
1125000	1128000	We had that studio at the old house and all this stuff.
1128000	1136000	But Justin TV, if you even go further back, I mean, literally that website started so that the dude, Justin, who owned the thing, could life cast.
1136000	1139000	He had a camera strapped to his head and life cast 24-7.
1139000	1144000	And then it was him and then it opened up to more people and there was, what, Justine?
1144000	1147000	I know it became like a big, like, no, literally her name was Justine.
1147000	1149000	It was just funny that they were Justin and Justine.
1149000	1150000	But, you know.
1150000	1151000	Hi, Justine.
1151000	1153000	And then everybody could pick up on this.
1153000	1156000	I remember Scott Rubin at all games when we were a part of that network.
1156000	1158000	He was really big on this whole thing.
1158000	1161000	And he went to E3 one year with a camera on his head and this whole thing.
1161000	1162000	I mean, that was, you know, the big thing.
1162000	1168000	And then that all spun off into Twitch, you know, because the gaming content was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
1168000	1169000	More demand, more demand.
1169000	1175000	So literally a guy with the idea to broadcast a camera next to his head just sold that for a billion dollars.
1175000	1176000	In a way.
1176000	1180000	I mean, obviously I'm jumping A to Z a little bit, but it's crazy how that works, right?
1181000	1182000	So.
1182000	1183000	Everything.
1183000	1188000	The flow of business is not one way, but this is the way it works.
1188000	1189000	You start with an idea.
1189000	1192000	You implement it to the extent that you're able to.
1192000	1198000	And then you start either if you, if your idea is great and you make money and you can hire people immediately for that reason.
1198000	1199000	Great.
1199000	1204000	If not, you get what resources you can, both physical and people manpower.
1204000	1205000	And then you start building up.
1205000	1206000	Something's interesting.
1206000	1211000	People want to go in and fund it because they are investing.
1211000	1212000	They want to make their return too.
1212000	1215000	Yeah, this, this is not a bad thing.
1215000	1216000	It is.
1216000	1233000	People have a bad taste in their mouth ever since the year 1999 and 2000, but investments are a good way to get liquid capital and infrastructure in much less time than being able to actually save up that money or even like standard credit lines or something like that.
1233000	1236000	MM2K in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1236000	1237000	I don't want to ignore our chat room.
1237000	1242000	MM2K says advertisers are the clients, quote, yet users of the service are the consumers.
1243000	1250000	Um, SHU 100 Matt says at some point a company will end up becoming so big that they need to partner up with another company to improve its product.
1250000	1253000	Otherwise someone else could swoop in with an improved version.
1253000	1266000	You know, well, Twitch did take a little bit of heat about three months ago when they had to, it's in order to accommodate the PlayStation four and the Xbox one, they had to kind of change their streaming, you know, from a tech side, they had to change things.
1266000	1275000	And what the user saw is that now there was like a 30, 45 second delay between when they would stream things and when the chat would come in, which, Oh my God, like there was so much uproar about that.
1275000	1281000	And people were really mad, which, you know, people had built their concepts around the instant ness.
1281000	1285000	I mean, something like Twitch plays Pokemon would have worked even better had it been instant.
1285000	1286000	Right.
1286000	1287000	But obviously they were able to make it work anyway.
1287000	1292000	Um, but I kind of look at it and laugh because we've been doing this show on a 45 second delay for about 12.
1292000	1293000	I mean, that's just how it is.
1293000	1295000	And I've always just thought, okay, that's just built into the show.
1295000	1297000	There's always going to be a little bit of a delay.
1297000	1298000	It's no big deal.
1298000	1299000	You know, you work with it.
1299000	1308000	Even right over the air radio has at least a seven second delay because heaven forbid somebody say, fuck, shit, cock, piss, cunt on the air.
1308000	1310000	You know, they have to be able to bleep that.
1310000	1313000	So I like see all his comment.
1313000	1321000	We can make our own streaming site with hookers and blackjack actually well said, but how so.
1321000	1323000	So, all right.
1323000	1330000	Uh, anyhow, uh, let's see other comments in the chat room over at a live dot vog network.com.
1330000	1338000	Dungeon buster says a lot of companies can choose to remain private and make money that way, but going public is something that many do in order to raise capital for further expansion.
1338000	1342000	It also exposes them to many, many more investors that will want a return on the money.
1343000	1346000	Uh, I'm probably going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.
1346000	1351000	Oleg Jank spirit says there is always the option for a public company to go private.
1351000	1352000	It's an expensive process, but it can be done.
1352000	1353000	That's true.
1353000	1356000	I have heard of, um, some companies doing that in the past.
1356000	1357000	Yeah.
1357000	1366000	So Dell bought back with, uh, with an investment from Microsoft to Dell bought out all their shareholders to go private, uh, mid last year.
1366000	1367000	Yeah, that's it.
1367000	1368000	That's that.
1368000	1369000	I knew I'd read somebody about that news.
1369000	1371000	It's not frequent.
1371000	1372000	It is a thing that can be done.
1372000	1376000	People get their money back at fair market value and status changes.
1376000	1385000	I have more respect for the companies that stay private or have their shareholders be their employees because they're actually giving back to the people who work for them.
1385000	1387000	It's a far more ethical practice.
1387000	1398000	And on top of that, they're guaranteeing that as far as I can say, they have a more satisfied worker base because the workers are actually getting a direct return from how well the company is faring.
1399000	1405000	Um, well, that's not happening with Twitch or Google in this case.
1405000	1413000	I mean, that's just, that's the, this is the reality of now where we're at and there is no gaming company that I can think of in this industry that does run this way.
1413000	1414000	So now what?
1414000	1416000	The clock continues.
1416000	1421000	Next company will be in the news in two, three years.
1421000	1422000	I kind of don't think they're on this.
1422000	1431000	I mean, despite the fact that I just voiced the concern with YouTube and you know, Twitch, Twitch also has, you know, people play music in the background when they're streaming.
1431000	1432000	That's very common.
1432000	1434000	And I think it's a lot harder to police the live streams and so forth.
1434000	1438000	And I'm not saying people should go out there and it should just be like copyright bonanza.
1438000	1440000	We're just going to stream movies on Twitch.
1440000	1441000	No, no, no, no.
1441000	1449000	But like, you know, if somebody is going to play music and it's in the background and it's incidental, then it's like going to somebody's house and they have their boombox playing in the background.
1449000	1450000	It's not that big a deal.
1450000	1451000	Right.
1451000	1457000	So I just hope we don't start to like over police this shit or that's where they're going to lose consumer confidence.
1457000	1464000	And any of this pushback they're seeing right now is consumer, a lack of consumer confidence in, you know, YouTube or whatever.
1464000	1468000	Yeah, but they don't need consumer confidence because there's nowhere else to go.
1468000	1471000	That's, that's a very valid point.
1471000	1473000	Kind of like Comcast.
1473000	1480000	Well, and even, and I just want to make clear, despite the concern I just brought up with YouTube, you know, I'm not again,
1480000	1482000	nothing's going to change overnight.
1482000	1493000	I just hope YouTube takes a cautious approach knowing that if they are a network populated with user content and a competitor could arise,
1493000	1497000	and I guess there is Ustream and some other, you know, this hitbox and some of this other stuff out there,
1497000	1500000	YouTube will want to be very careful in what it does.
1500000	1508000	It's not unheard of for users to abandon a website and cause that website to lose oodles and oodles and oodles of money.
1508000	1512000	MySpace. Friendster.
1512000	1513000	Orkut.
1513000	1514000	Yahoo.
1514000	1516000	I've never heard of Orkut.
1516000	1520000	It's Orkut. It's big in Brazil now, I think. Google. Google owns that too.
1520000	1521000	Yeah.
1521000	1522000	Oh, okay.
1522000	1524000	Blogspot. That's still around.
1524000	1525000	Yeah.
1525000	1526000	LiveJournal.
1526000	1528000	LiveJournal is a good example too.
1528000	1531000	So, you know, yeah, so that it's...
1531000	1535000	Ass, cheese, Zynga.
1535000	1536000	Oh, what was the...
1536000	1537000	Zonga.
1537000	1538000	No, X...
1538000	1539000	Zynga.
1539000	1540000	X-A-N-G-A.
1540000	1542000	Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, Zynga.
1542000	1545000	So, anyhow.
1545000	1546000	Alright.
1546000	1551000	Let's see how one in chat says, boom box, how old are you? Shut up. Get off my lawn.
1551000	1554000	They're not boom boxes anymore. They're jam boxes.
1554000	1557000	Excuse me. Excuse me.
1557000	1558000	Alright.
1558000	1559000	That's not fair at all.
1559000	1563000	Considering that most songs nowadays have a drop in there somewhere,
1563000	1571000	so I would think that describing the, you know, the thump of a bass, you know, would be, you know, more like a boom.
1571000	1575000	Hell, there was a song talking about, you know, here comes boom bass.
1575000	1576000	There was boom.
1576000	1579000	There was a song called Drop the Bass as well.
1579000	1581000	They came out when I was in high school.
1581000	1587000	Or as I just saw, like, you know, pretty much everyone's, you know, on Facebook and Reddit and all that stuff.
1587000	1591000	Was it Lonely Island skit last night where...
1591000	1592000	SNL skit.
1592000	1593000	Yeah.
1593000	1594000	Da Vinci.
1594000	1595000	Da Vinci.
1595000	1596000	Yeah.
1596000	1598000	Was it...
1598000	1601000	When's the bass drop or something like that or...
1601000	1602000	It was pretty funny.
1602000	1603000	I'll have to check that out.
1603000	1605000	Don't look up that clip. It was pretty funny.
1605000	1606000	I'll check that out.
1606000	1607000	Alright.
1607000	1610000	Final thought here from SSJ100Matt in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1610000	1613000	We could get really deep or meta about this, but I still think it's too early.
1613000	1614000	That's right.
1614000	1621000	More news about this possibly to come out on Monday because, you know, and by the time people are listening to this show, we might even have more information.
1621000	1623000	So I'm not going to run this topic into the ground.
1623000	1627000	It's just going to be very interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks and months.
1627000	1632000	Especially with, you know, Twitch is now the, you know, there's no more G4 or anything like that.
1632000	1635000	So, well, I guess, isn't technically G4 actually still there, but it just...
1635000	1636000	Esquire.
1636000	1637000	Whatever. They might as well be gone.
1637000	1638000	G4 as it stands.
1638000	1641000	No, they're not Esquire anymore because Esquire became...
1641000	1643000	It was a different station that became Esquire.
1643000	1644000	Yeah, the style thing.
1644000	1645000	Yeah.
1645000	1646000	Yeah.
1646000	1647000	Alright.
1647000	1648000	Yeah, G4's still around.
1648000	1649000	Who cares? Nobody's watching any of it anyway.
1649000	1651000	More people are watching Twitch than any of that stuff anyway.
1651000	1654000	So, but Twitch is the official streaming partner of E3.
1654000	1659000	So it's going to be interesting to see how this news could, you know, play into that a little bit.
1659000	1660000	We'll see.
1660000	1661000	Maybe this was something that was supposed to come out at E3.
1661000	1662000	Who knows?
1662000	1663000	So.
1663000	1664000	Alright.
1664000	1665000	We are going to move on.
1665000	1666000	We had...
1666000	1667000	This was our breaking news topic.
1667000	1670000	We had another kickoff topic we were going to start the show off with.
1670000	1675000	And I'm going to turn it over to Loki who's got a few news reports to go through here about this.
1675000	1676000	Alright.
1677000	1678000	So let's see.
1680000	1686000	Microsoft making some really interesting decisions earlier this week.
1686000	1695000	The big bombshell was that, hey, yeah, we're going to bring out an Xbox One at $399 without Kinect.
1695000	1698000	And it will be coming out June 9th.
1698000	1703000	So, you know, everybody's been kind of saying, you know, hey, I don't give a shit about Kinect.
1703000	1706000	Why am I paying an extra $100 for Kinect?
1706000	1708000	Well, now they've done that.
1708000	1719000	But at the same time it's kind of like, damn, now, you know, those people, since they were trying to justify the extra $100 with Kinect, now it's not a requirement.
1719000	1720000	So there's probably not...
1720000	1724000	There's going to be as much support as there was on the Xbox 360 for Kinect.
1724000	1728000	So it is kind of a waste now for those people that bought the system early.
1728000	1730000	Early adopter syndrome, I guess.
1731000	1743000	And then, you know, to kind of go along with that, you know, one of the other gripes about Xbox Live has been that most of the entertainment apps are behind the Xbox Live Gold Paywall.
1743000	1749000	You have to have a gold subscription in order to be able to, you know, watch Netflix or do any of that stuff.
1749000	1757000	So now, starting, I guess, in June as well, they're going to be removing some of those.
1758000	1768000	So now you're going to be able to actually, you know, watch those apps and stuff for, you know, without having a gold subscription.
1768000	1772000	And this is kind of interesting. I'm kind of surprised that they did this in the first place.
1772000	1782000	But they are actually going to be offering refunds for people that may have had an Xbox Live subscription just to watch those apps.
1782000	1787000	So, why you would want a subscription just to watch those apps is beyond me.
1787000	1792000	The other thing, though, free to play games are still going to require Xbox Live Gold.
1792000	1802000	So, whereas you can play an MMO for free on the PlayStation Network, you're still going to have to have Xbox Live Gold in order to, like, play, like, Elder Scrolls Online, for example.
1802000	1809000	And then, on top of that, Games with Gold is going to be getting a little bit of a tweak.
1809000	1820000	They are doing pretty much like the PlayStation Plus program, where now any of those free games that you download aren't going to be yours to keep, like they have been in the past.
1820000	1829000	But now, starting June, you're going to get games for, I guess, discounts for games. They're going to have stuff for Xbox One as well.
1830000	1839000	And then, any games that are part of that program, you're just going to be able to have access to, but they're not going to be yours forever.
1839000	1847000	If you stop paying for gold, you don't get to play them anymore, much like the PlayStation Network.
1847000	1856000	I got to say, though, what the hell? They just go, hey, let's copy everything Sony's doing, because it seems like they're copying everything Sony's doing.
1856000	1863000	You know, they're making the tweaks exactly the same as, you know, the PlayStation Network, and that kind of seems...
1863000	1865000	Well, because Sony's outsold them by at least two million.
1865000	1869000	Well, I understand that, but that kind of smells of desperation, if you ask me.
1869000	1875000	Next thing you know, their controllers are going to operate in 3D space with the camera...oh.
1876000	1887000	The quote-unquote funny thing to me is that, didn't they come out...like, didn't Don Mattrick or one of those guys after E3 come out and say, oh, the Xbox One won't work without Kinect.
1887000	1890000	It will not work. It does not function without Kinect.
1890000	1892000	Well, and then they've also found out...
1892000	1901000	Sorry, I have to say, all that...everybody saw through that corporate bullshit when those words came out of their mouth.
1901000	1903000	That is Microsoft's problem.
1903000	1910000	They were steadfast to that stuff, too. They were steadfast to saying, oh, listen, you know, this is a fact that this cannot work with it.
1910000	1919000	The Sims will not run without an online connection, or SimCity, I'm sorry. The SimCity will not run without an online connection.
1919000	1925000	It is impossible for this to happen. Unless we want to, you know, do that.
1925000	1931000	I think there's a huge alert memo, if we happen to have any gaming companies who happen to listen to the show, memo alert.
1931000	1942000	People see through that shit. You need to believe that your tech geek people, who are mostly pretty smart across the board, sees through a lot of that speak.
1942000	1949000	Like, if this doesn't put an exclamation point on the end of that, I'm not sure what does.
1949000	1954000	Now, to be fair, because I don't want to make it sound like we're taking a poop on Microsoft while they're down.
1954000	1960000	I do feel like things have come a lot way for the better ever since they got that new guy in there that replaced Don Mattrick.
1960000	1962000	Is that Aaron Greenberg that's in that position?
1962000	1963000	Yeah.
1963000	1971000	Yeah. So, you know, I feel like things have changed for the better since then, you know, and I do feel like there is more transparency happening.
1971000	1976000	I feel like, you know, the direction seems to be better. So, hooray.
1977000	1987000	But on the flip side, I get at the same time why they're the hardcore Xbox fans out there that are a little bit disappointed that maybe Microsoft didn't stick to their original vision in some ways.
1987000	1995000	But if you don't come, I mean, and this is true of Nintendo now, if you don't come out the gate swinging, you're going to be in trouble.
1995000	1999000	Quick, named three Kinect games that are must-own on Xbox One.
2001000	2002000	That was funny.
2002000	2003000	Exactly.
2003000	2005000	I'm going to do it because I sell that stuff.
2005000	2008000	Quick, do it. What are the three must-own Kinect games on Xbox One?
2008000	2010000	The brand new Kinect Sports game that they have.
2010000	2011000	Not out yet.
2011000	2012000	It is out.
2012000	2013000	Oh, is it now?
2013000	2014000	Yeah, it was out in April.
2014000	2015000	Okay, well it hasn't been out for a while, but okay.
2015000	2018000	Okay. So, and then you've got Just Dance 2014.
2018000	2021000	Okay, fair. Although that is on other platforms, yes.
2021000	2025000	It is. And, sadly enough, I think.
2025000	2026000	Ha! Ha! Ha!
2026000	2028000	That's because there's only three Kinect games out there.
2028000	2032000	See? That's my point, is that they didn't come out the door swinging.
2032000	2035000	I mean, there's the Fighters on Cage, but that's absolute shit, so.
2035000	2040000	This was the Nintendo issue as well, is that Nintendo did not come out swinging with the Wii U.
2040000	2049000	Yes, their lineup was impressive, but over half of it was recycled stuff from years ago with the Wii U injected into it.
2049000	2052000	And the other half was delayed, or in some cases outright cancelled.
2052000	2054000	Exactly. And that's the same problem they had.
2054000	2061000	So, you know, it's a bummer that Harmonic's Fantasia thing got pushed back as far as it did, because maybe that could have been a bit...
2061000	2063000	It's probably not going to sell as well anymore, either.
2063000	2067000	Harmonic's not having a good week this week. They are not having a good week. I feel bad, I do.
2067000	2070000	I hope Chroma makes you billions, Harmonic.
2070000	2080000	Here's the thing. Okay, so, the stuff that they're talking about, at least on the games with gold stuff, it's not new, though.
2080000	2084000	They're saying that they're going to have free games and monthly deals and other benefits.
2084000	2088000	That's the same shit they have right now. It's exactly the same.
2088000	2094000	In fact, the only difference right now between what it was and what they're announcing is that,
2094000	2096000	oh, by the way, you're not going to be able to keep those games.
2096000	2098000	That's really it. That is the only thing.
2098000	2101000	There's not a... It doesn't say that they're going to be building this online library.
2101000	2106000	Like, for example, these new games that are out in June or whatever, those aren't going to be there in July.
2106000	2111000	You know, it's not like this virtual library that the PlayStation Plus has.
2111000	2114000	It's just, now, I can't keep those games.
2114000	2115000	That's really the only announcement.
2115000	2118000	You know, the fucking deals that they have and shit, it's not new.
2118000	2121000	They already have that. It's already out there.
2121000	2125000	In fact, I'm not even sure if you have to have gold to participate in those deals in the first place.
2125000	2128000	But that just seems really stupid.
2128000	2131000	They're not differentiating themselves.
2131000	2135000	They're doing exactly the same as the PlayStation 4.
2135000	2137000	To be honest, Loki, a lot of that is secondary.
2137000	2140000	I'm going to just keep it real. A lot of that stuff is secondary.
2140000	2142000	And what it really comes down to is the games.
2142000	2149000	And if Microsoft wants to differentiate itself from Sony, which I think they absolutely can do, and I think are doing in a way,
2149000	2156000	they did come out days later and confirm Halo 5 coming to Xbox One, which I mean, duh.
2156000	2165000	But it is one of those things where, okay, if you buy an Xbox One, this is something you're not going to get on PlayStation 4.
2165000	2168000	And I think you're going to see a heck of a lot of this at E3.
2169000	2174000	I mean, isn't it always? The focus is going to be greatly on exclusives, exclusives, exclusives.
2174000	2176000	That's really what it's going to be.
2176000	2179000	Because now they're the same price point, which, honestly, they came down.
2179000	2185000	Isn't that funny that that price point drop is timed for the day before their press conference.
2185000	2187000	When everybody's going to be talking Microsoft.
2187000	2190000	Originally, I don't think they were supposed to be coming out and announcing any of this stuff.
2190000	2197000	I think that they had to kind of announce it early in order to kind of...
2197000	2199000	Prepare the retailers a little bit, probably.
2199000	2202000	Well, not even that. They could do that anyways.
2202000	2208000	But I think they wanted to come out and do that so that they have a little bit more...
2210000	2214000	I don't know, get people excited about it and get pre-orders and sales up and stuff.
2214000	2217000	Because they haven't been really working that well.
2217000	2224000	But I think, if anything though, now that they've come down $100, you're not going to see a price drop on that system.
2224000	2227000	But I don't really think you're going to see a price drop on the PlayStation 4 since it's doing so well.
2227000	2232000	But they could, if they wanted to wiggle the cost down a little bit, they could.
2232000	2238000	That's the thing. Sony could really kick Microsoft in the balls right now if they come out at E3 and drop the price of the PlayStation 4.
2238000	2240000	I'm with you. I don't think they'll do that.
2240000	2243000	But there are other ways they could beef up the PlayStation 4.
2243000	2250000	For example, a really killer bundle game, which I guess Infamous Second Son would be the prime candidate.
2250000	2253000	Destiny in a couple of months once we get there.
2253000	2262000	Yeah, that's a good one too. But I could think that they could come out at E3 and say PlayStation 4 now has Infamous Second Son bundled in for free and a terabyte hard drive.
2262000	2266000	And it's a shiny white or a red or a blue.
2266000	2267000	And the camera!
2267000	2269000	Or, yeah, they bundle the camera in.
2269000	2275000	There are other ways that Sony could sweeten the pot without necessarily just flat out dropping the price.
2275000	2277000	The same way that we use drop the price.
2277000	2280000	And that could be a kick in the balls to Microsoft.
2280000	2284000	But, you know, I'm still looking at this going,
2284000	2292000	Hey, I kind of want to get an Xbox One because I know by next year I'm going to want to play Halo 5.
2292000	2295000	I'm going to want to play Quantum Break. I want to play Sunset Overdrive.
2295000	2300000	There's enough games coming for Xbox One that are exclusive that I want to check out.
2300000	2302000	So I know I'll get an Xbox One eventually.
2302000	2305000	And this news about the Kinect, I'm like, great, I was over that Kinect shit.
2305000	2307000	So I'm excited for that.
2307000	2309000	Yes, how many times did they trick me into buying a camera?
2309000	2310000	Hmm?
2310000	2312000	How many times did they trick me into buying a camera?
2312000	2318000	Right. Which, you know, to be fair, I did search high and low to get a camera for the PlayStation 4.
2318000	2320000	But it was, you know, something new.
2320000	2322000	That whole live streaming with the camera.
2322000	2324000	That whole experience that I hadn't been able to do before.
2324000	2326000	That was my main motivator. Not any of the games.
2326000	2328000	The games was just icing on the cake.
2328000	2329000	So.
2329000	2334000	But, you know, now that I have that camera on the PlayStation 4, that's even more like...
2334000	2337000	Here's the thing, though. Like, their main thing with, you know, the Xbox One,
2337000	2343000	this is kind of one of the reasons why I'm not that into the Xbox One as I was with the Xbox 360,
2343000	2346000	is that, hey, look, it's like Windows 8 stuff.
2346000	2348000	You can run all these Windows 8 apps in there.
2348000	2351000	Okay, I got to tell you, I have Windows 8 on my laptop.
2351000	2354000	I don't run any of the Windows 8 apps. Ever. None of them.
2354000	2357000	I do not even touch that stupid Metro interface.
2357000	2361000	Maybe I run Skype, and that is pretty much the only Windows 8 app.
2361000	2366000	In fact, anything that they have that's defaulted in there to auto-open with the Windows 8 thing,
2366000	2369000	I find the older version that's on, you know, the laptop.
2369000	2372000	You know, the stuff that's been around for ages now.
2372000	2375000	Like, you know, any of the picture viewers and stuff.
2375000	2376000	And I defaulted to that.
2376000	2381000	It's just, I don't think people are going to be using the Xbox One to Skype with each other.
2381000	2385000	Can you just, I'm sorry, now I just can't get the image out of my head,
2385000	2390000	and I just, can you imagine Jack Tretton coming out, which I know he isn't the Sony guy anymore,
2390000	2394000	but just bear with me here, because this is the image I have in my mind, because I go back to last year's E3.
2394000	2397000	Can you imagine Jack Tretton coming out at E3, smug motherfucker,
2397000	2403000	coming out on stage and being like, PlayStation 4, we thought we'd bundle the camera with it,
2403000	2407000	give it the same price, like right after Microsoft test out.
2407000	2408000	Can you imagine that?
2408000	2411000	We believe that the camera is an integral part of, you know, the PlayStation experience.
2411000	2416000	They should bring Jack Tretton back just to be a smug motherfucker, to get up on stage and be like,
2416000	2418000	we're going to give a camera away with every PlayStation 4.
2418000	2421000	And hell, we can even get the actor playing Kevin Butler to come up.
2421000	2423000	He can give him a high five or something.
2423000	2426000	You know, flip off Microsoft, you know, and just...
2428000	2431000	Two years of Sony digs in a row at Microsoft would be pretty unreal.
2431000	2432000	We'll see.
2432000	2435000	I have to say, like, right now, like, if I had to choose, if someone said,
2435000	2439000	okay, here's, you know, $400, pick a system to buy, I'm going to buy a PlayStation 4.
2439000	2443000	Just because, you know, spec-wise, between even the same games we're running on both platforms,
2443000	2446000	it runs better on PlayStation 4, and...
2447000	2448000	I don't know, I'm not a huge Halo fan.
2449000	2451000	Although, another Crackdown game.
2451000	2453000	That could be interesting.
2453000	2456000	And I just want to be extra clear, because the chat room's like, I just want to be crystal clear.
2456000	2459000	I do not expect Sony to actually do that with a bundle in the camera.
2459000	2460000	That would be a huge cost.
2460000	2461000	No one would care.
2461000	2464000	Yeah, I just, in my head, it's funny.
2464000	2465000	It's funny in my head.
2465000	2469000	Because you know they've got to do something smug this year, like they did last year.
2469000	2471000	So, I just, in my head, it's funny.
2471000	2472000	All right.
2474000	2477000	Anyhow, going over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
2477000	2481000	sg100matt says, I'm sure they have several different plans that will be enacted depending on how the other responds.
2481000	2482000	Oh, you bet.
2482000	2488000	You know, there are rumors that Sony had three slides with three different prices for the PlayStation 4 ready to go.
2488000	2490000	And they were waiting to see what Microsoft was going to do.
2491000	2496000	So, I mean, rumors, but I wouldn't doubt at all that that's how the game works, folks.
2496000	2498000	I wouldn't doubt at all.
2498000	2505000	So, sg100matt also said earlier, to be devil's advocate, what if this new bundle is just an entry point for people who are on the fence?
2505000	2510000	Maybe they want to get people playing the system to show them that a Kinect could improve their entertainment experience.
2510000	2512000	Perhaps this might be a long-term strategy.
2512000	2516000	I think, yeah, it's like the 4GIG system, basically.
2516000	2520000	Kinect was a huge selling peripheral the past few years.
2520000	2524000	So, I mean, there is credit to that line of thought, and I wouldn't discount it.
2524000	2526000	They always have a multi-skew strategy.
2526000	2529000	And here's the other thing, too, to keep in mind.
2529000	2533000	The version that does have Kinect has a game bundled with it.
2533000	2535000	It has fours of five, or it's got Titanfall.
2535000	2538000	This new one, I don't think has anything bundled with it.
2538000	2540000	So, you're kind of losing out on top of that.
2540000	2542000	You're losing out on a free game.
2542000	2543000	Interesting.
2543000	2547000	Interesting point, because I heard that one of our local retailers, Fry's,
2547000	2554000	I saw Flaco Jones say something during Bobby's show that Fry's was selling the current Xbox Ones for $430 with Kinect.
2554000	2558000	But I wonder if that's the skew before Titanfall was bundled in with it.
2558000	2559000	I wonder if that was the old skew.
2559000	2560000	Yeah, it probably was.
2560000	2562000	So, very interesting.
2562000	2564000	All right, we'll see.
2564000	2568000	All right, well, I got a Dark Sakura.
2568000	2571000	You've been quiet during that segment, but I know you're not the hugest,
2571000	2573000	just like, I've got to get an Xbox One right now.
2573000	2578000	But any thoughts on the price drop and the value of Kinect to the Xbox One or any of that?
2578000	2581000	It's just more business.
2581000	2584000	I mean, it's meant to fool people who are on the fence.
2584000	2586000	That's exactly what it is.
2586000	2590000	In the end, if people want the system, they're going to buy the system.
2590000	2591000	It doesn't matter what the price point is.
2591000	2593000	It depends on how much they want it.
2593000	2596000	I think that on-the-fence statement is very important because it goes to show why,
2596000	2598000	two days later, they come out and say,
2599000	2601000	Sorry, I know I'm jacking one of your news stories later, Loki,
2601000	2603000	but we all know Halo 5 was announced, too.
2603000	2607000	Yeah, we're well aware that it was announced last year that it was coming out.
2607000	2610000	It's total shocking news that it was at E3 last year.
2610000	2613000	But why reiterate it now?
2613000	2615000	Because, like Jamie says, it's to win the people that are on the fence.
2615000	2617000	Because now we know it's called Halo 5.
2617000	2621000	Oh, my God, I couldn't figure out that the next Halo after 4 was going to be 5.
2621000	2622000	Wait, wait, wait.
2622000	2624000	Guardians?
2624000	2625000	I love the Guardian legend.
2625000	2627000	Oh, my God.
2627000	2629000	Don't worry, it's not the last Guardian.
2629000	2631000	It's actually coming out.
2631000	2634000	The third Xbox is the Xbox One, so surely this is Halo 1 again.
2634000	2636000	No, but here's the thing.
2636000	2638000	It's like...
2638000	2640000	Oh, crap, I lost my train of thought.
2640000	2642000	Whatever, who gives a shit?
2642000	2645000	If you have more thoughts on this, of course, we'll be taking calls later in the show
2645000	2648000	at 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,
2648000	2650000	and of course our email bag, always open to you.
2650000	2653000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2653000	2656000	Meanwhile, we are going to move on to the show, because believe it or not,
2656000	2659000	outside these two huge topics, there's still plenty of other stuff going on in gaming
2659000	2660000	we had to get to.
2660000	2661000	Outside this hour that we've already killed.
2661000	2662000	I know, right?
2662000	2664000	I knew it was going to be one of those nights.
2664000	2665000	Well, let's try to go around quickly.
2665000	2668000	We always like to, at the top of the show, kind of establish the frame of reference
2668000	2671000	we're all in this week by sharing with you our gaming weeks
2671000	2673000	and the type of video games we've been playing this week.
2673000	2675000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
2675000	2676000	What have you been up to?
2676000	2678000	It was actually...
2678000	2683000	I've had another busy week, so I did play some...
2683000	2684000	I actually haven't touched Animal Crossing.
2684000	2685000	Can you believe it?
2685000	2688000	Because I've been playing Bravely Default a little bit.
2688000	2689000	There's going to be weeds.
2689000	2690000	Well, you know what, that's a good excuse.
2690000	2693000	I'm not going to have weeds because I have the perfect village
2693000	2696000	and I have the pretty village ordinance.
2696000	2700000	Which I guess I should check on my villagers and see if that diva bitch left yet.
2700000	2707000	I played some Mass Effect just to find out that my mods weren't working again.
2707000	2712000	Tried to play some Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm in the really shitty boring part
2712000	2718000	where I have to gain another level and a quarter before I can do more story quests.
2718000	2722000	Something to try, because there is that big lull between 40 and 50,
2722000	2725000	something to try. See if you can trigger any of the dailies
2725000	2727000	because I want to say the Kobold dailies start at 41
2727000	2729000	and that's at least three more quests you can do.
2729000	2732000	Oh yeah, I've got the soulless ones.
2732000	2733000	Oh, there you go.
2733000	2735000	The little soulless ones. I keep forgetting about them.
2735000	2737000	I just hate that whole area.
2737000	2742000	Yeah, they refresh every day so it'll help push you over the limit a little bit.
2742000	2747000	Yeah, but mostly I've just been running around looking at fates and...
2747000	2748000	Fates are good.
2748000	2750000	Looking at fates and...
2750000	2754000	I still find pretty areas in that game I haven't seen before.
2754000	2758000	I was trying to finish my hunting log because I only have the last two, the 48 and 49.
2758000	2759000	Nice.
2759000	2761000	Oh, the 49 and 50 I guess. Whatever the last two are.
2761000	2766000	But they're in like, two of the critters are in this back corner
2766000	2770000	that you have to go through all of these things to kill before you can remotely get there
2770000	2773000	and I think I just need to have someone covering my ass so I can get there and kill it.
2773000	2776000	If you need a bodyguard, Jamie, just remember...
2776000	2779000	I...
2779000	2780000	No.
2780000	2783000	Will always cure you.
2783000	2784000	You know what?
2784000	2785000	Please don't do that.
2785000	2788000	Nobody does that song like Dolly Parton.
2788000	2790000	So stop it.
2790000	2793000	They need a little more country twang next time.
2793000	2795000	Nobody can touch Dolly.
2795000	2797000	Not even dead Whitney.
2797000	2799000	Aww.
2799000	2802000	Unless Dolly was crack, in which case...
2802000	2804000	Y'all are disrespectful.
2804000	2805000	Alright.
2805000	2806000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2806000	2810000	Oh come on, who was the people who had RIP Whitney as a death knight?
2810000	2813000	That was not me, I have RIP Betty White.
2813000	2814000	That was me actually.
2814000	2817000	RIP Betty White I have on hold just because we all know it's going to happen.
2817000	2820000	I think I actually had RIP Whitney now that I think about it.
2821000	2823000	Oops.
2823000	2824000	Alright.
2824000	2828000	By the way, we had all these death knights on World of Warcraft and we were all playing that.
2828000	2835000	And like one day somebody thought, oh would it be funny to roll all these RIP characters for people that aren't dead yet but will probably be dead soon.
2835000	2837000	And of course, Jamie, anyway.
2837000	2839000	I think somebody had RIP Lindsay, but I don't know.
2839000	2840000	Anyway.
2840000	2841000	Jamie won the lottery on that one.
2841000	2842000	Jamie won the lottery.
2842000	2843000	Alright.
2843000	2844000	Loki.
2844000	2852000	I've only played a little bit of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, in which case I kicked everybody's ass in multiple games several times over, score capping everything.
2852000	2857000	I have to say from chat, live.vognetware.com, Dark Tetsuya is like, wow, that took a dark turn.
2857000	2858000	Did a little bit.
2858000	2859000	It was a little bit of a dark place.
2859000	2860000	Dark Sakura, hello.
2862000	2863000	Alright, sorry, Loki.
2863000	2865000	But yeah, mostly it was just programming.
2865000	2874000	Like I said earlier that I was working on my object editor, which I just finished building a copy and paste function.
2874000	2877000	So that's cool, I guess.
2877000	2892000	The only thing I have to do left on that, I guess, is actually have to replace all the prefabs I have with ones that are split up by triangles so that I can run a script in there to detect which pieces of geometry are actually hidden inside the object so that it removes all the end nodes.
2892000	2895000	So that it removes all the unnecessary faces off there.
2895000	2897000	That's about it, I think.
2899000	2900000	Yeah.
2900000	2902000	Isn't programming fun and exciting?
2902000	2903000	Yeah, I enjoy it.
2903000	2905000	I'm actually learning quite a bit.
2905000	2909000	And a lot of it I'm kind of like, oh, okay, well, how do I do this?
2909000	2911000	And then I look it up and I figure that out.
2911000	2918000	And then a lot of times now, even with some of these things, I'm just kind of figuring it out on my own now.
2918000	2920000	I'm able to solve my own problems in here.
2920000	2923000	And it's like, I don't actually know how to do this now.
2923000	2927000	But then again, I kind of have to wonder, you know, how limited C Sharp is in...
2927000	2935000	I mean, it's not limited in Unity, but a lot of it's just kind of just, okay, pointing variable to variable and stuff like that.
2935000	2936000	I don't know.
2936000	2940000	I'm sure it's way different, you know, outside of Unity.
2942000	2944000	All right, I'll do my gaming week and then we'll wrap up with Jason.
2944000	2949000	My gaming week, not really a lot of new games, but I've been playing a lot of old standbys.
2949000	2951000	Diablo 3, I've been playing a lot of this week.
2951000	2957000	We'll talk about this a little more in detail later in the show, but they're having like a weekend where you can get increased legendary drops.
2957000	2961000	So of course, you know, I had to check that out and a lot of my friends are playing that right now too.
2961000	2964000	In the Blizzard camp, I've also been playing the Heroes of the Storm alpha.
2964000	2966000	I've unlocked the daily quests.
2966000	2974000	So I actually like, I have that thing where I can get gold by playing as a Starcraft character today or playing as a support character today.
2974000	2976000	Kind of encourages you to try new things.
2976000	2981000	But look, I know Heroes of the Storm is an alpha, so I don't want to be too critical of it because there's a lot in testing.
2981000	2983000	But I really need a way to report players.
2983000	2986000	Most of the players in the game have been really good so far.
2986000	2995000	But once in a while, and last night I had a real jerk off that was playing the game, that just flat out called me out, was like, you suck, you're awful at this.
2995000	2998000	And I said, wow, you're really motivating me to do better.
2998000	3000000	And I just followed him the entire rest of the match.
3000000	3004000	And I still participated. I did, you know, stuff. I just followed him the entire rest of the match.
3004000	3007000	I just, you know, call me a troll or whatever. That's fine.
3007000	3011000	But it's kind of one of those things where it's like, you know, when you're negative to people, you're going to lose.
3011000	3018000	And I tell you what, every instance I've had in that game so far, if somebody is negative, we lose.
3018000	3023000	If everybody's like positive, like, hey, I mean, I'm not talking about like you have to be like, I love you so much.
3023000	3026000	OMG, you guys are the bestest ever. It doesn't even have to be like that.
3026000	3030000	Just like, hey, how's it going? You know, going top. We need more on mid.
3030000	3035000	You know, if people like play that way, win every time. Every time.
3035000	3039000	So, but right now, because it's an alpha, we don't have a way to report people.
3039000	3045000	And it kind of, it really like grinds my gears because, you know, it's really hard to get in the hero's alpha.
3045000	3046000	You basically have to win the lottery right now.
3047000	3051000	So why there's these toxic people that are being let in when there's other people I know that really want to play,
3051000	3053000	and really want to test, and really want to get the most out of the game.
3053000	3055000	They can't get in. It's very frustrating.
3055000	3062000	So, hopefully Blizzard's going to pull back the curtain a little bit and show us what they plan to do to quell the, you know,
3062000	3067000	MOBA trend that unfortunately has taken hold of a lot of those games.
3067000	3069000	And that is that most of them are pretty toxic.
3069000	3072000	So, don't be a dick, you guys.
3072000	3078000	Alright, and let's see. Otherwise, more Final Fantasy XIV.
3078000	3081000	Although, I really hit a wall with Endgame this week.
3081000	3083000	It was like, I really don't want to pull this boss anymore.
3083000	3084000	I am so, I'm so over it.
3084000	3085000	Overit.com.
3085000	3089000	So, I kind of need a new patch to get here soon, but it's coming.
3089000	3091000	So, I don't know how the Warcraft people are doing it.
3091000	3093000	They're on the same raid and they're going on like nine months now.
3093000	3094000	Although, I will say.
3094000	3095000	We've done it.
3095000	3096000	I will, well, yeah.
3096000	3097000	And I will say, funny enough.
3097000	3099000	Okay, here's what's really weird and I'm totally going to get judged for this.
3099000	3103000	But, like, I've kind of been flirting with the idea of going back to WoW just for a little bit.
3103000	3106000	Just because I haven't played for a few months.
3106000	3107000	So, all that stuff is kind of new to me.
3107000	3111000	And it's like, well, when I've kind of hit the end of my creative juices with this MMO.
3111000	3115000	Kind of makes me want to go back and see my old MMO and check in with all the people I still know that are over there.
3115000	3116000	I don't know.
3116000	3118000	Such is the life of an MMO player, I guess.
3118000	3121000	Then I wonder why I don't get any other games played.
3121000	3123000	So, alright.
3123000	3125000	You can help me finish my levels.
3125000	3126000	That would be fun.
3126000	3129000	I offered to be your bodyguard, but then everybody was like, shut up, Rob.
3129000	3132000	No, they were telling you to stop singing.
3132000	3135000	I will only bodyguard if I can sing.
3135000	3137000	You can sing, but I don't have to have the mic on.
3137000	3138000	I am a bard, you guys.
3138000	3139000	That's what we do.
3139000	3140000	Alright.
3140000	3142000	Jason, how was your gaming week?
3142000	3146000	I feel strange because I actually had quite a prolific gaming week.
3146000	3149000	Which is against the grain of everything you guys have said before.
3149000	3152000	And also against the grain for me while I'm out here.
3152000	3155000	But, I actually played quite a couple of interesting things.
3155000	3156000	A little bit more Titanfall.
3156000	3158000	I streamed a little bit on Saturday.
3158000	3162000	I don't think I have announcements set up, so you just kind of have to know to look.
3162000	3164000	And that's obviously not the easiest thing.
3164000	3168000	Unless somebody's actually subscribed to me, which would surprise me a lot.
3168000	3170000	I made a couple of clips.
3170000	3175000	I recorded a couple of local clips and then I clipped one of the streams from Twitch onto
3175000	3179000	onto Twitch's recorded videos that isn't the entire stream.
3179000	3180000	Whatever.
3180000	3181000	Anyways, Titanfall is fun.
3181000	3182000	That's the story here.
3182000	3188000	I started into Crypt of the NecroDancer that I've been meaning to for a little while.
3188000	3192000	And after getting acquainted with the way that that game worked, I proceeded to go to
3192000	3193000	the forums.
3193000	3196000	I was thinking about reporting a bug, but it's something that's going to be fixed in
3196000	3199000	a future release anyways because the game is still being active developed.
3199000	3200000	Whatever.
3200000	3204000	I am fucking terrible at Crypt of the NecroDancer.
3204000	3211000	I pay so much attention to the rhythm of the game that I know I understand the patterns
3211000	3215000	of the enemies, but they still just completely destroy me.
3215000	3218000	Jamie in her classic game of the week last week was talking about Rogue.
3218000	3220000	Crypt of the NecroDancer is a rhythm roguelike.
3220000	3221000	I didn't know that game was out.
3221000	3222000	Is that on Steam?
3222000	3223000	Pre-order.
3223000	3224000	Pre-order Alpha.
3224000	3225000	Oh, okay.
3225000	3227000	And you actually can't buy it right now?
3227000	3229000	Pre-orders were open for a certain amount of time.
3229000	3231000	All of those players have Alpha.
3231000	3234000	You should have pre-ordered it when I talked about it on the game three months ago.
3234000	3236000	I just forgot.
3236000	3237000	So shoot me.
3237000	3239000	It'll be out.
3239000	3243000	And I'm starting to look at how custom songs are going to work to make things really fucking
3243000	3244000	crazy.
3244000	3247000	So I go on the forums to report a bug and I'm just kind of poking around looking at
3247000	3251000	other threads and there are people that are already just completely destroying the game.
3251000	3257000	There was a forum post titled Hardcore Shmardcore, something silly like that, that somebody has
3257000	3262000	already thoroughly decimated Hardcore with no, you know, without dying all of the powerups,
3262000	3265000	all of the items and all that kind of stuff.
3265000	3268000	I can't even get past the fucking second dungeon of that game.
3268000	3274000	It's the exact same thing as Binding of Isaac and it's the weirdest thing.
3274000	3276000	But yes, Script of the Necrodancer is quite fun.
3276000	3280000	I have high hopes for it and I'm going to keep continuing to play it because it's worthwhile.
3280000	3286000	A little bit more Hearthstone but nothing particularly interesting to say about that.
3286000	3292000	And then there was something else on something that I played but nothing new and I don't
3292000	3297000	think, obviously there wasn't anything interesting to say about it if I can't even think of it.
3297000	3300000	Probably FTL, which I am also still completely terrible at.
3300000	3302000	You might be proud of me a little bit.
3302000	3305000	I didn't talk about it during my game of week because I literally played like five minutes
3305000	3309000	of it but I did buy Titanfall this week on PC.
3309000	3313000	Yeah, because Origin have that Please Play Origin sale where like a lot of their games
3313000	3314000	are 40% off so I picked up...
3314000	3315000	We still exist!
3315000	3316000	Please Play Origin.
3316000	3318000	So I picked it up for like 35 bucks.
3318000	3319000	I was like, all right, I want to...
3319000	3322000	I need something that will really push my new computer to its limits.
3322000	3326000	So I only played through the tutorial and then I tried to do a match but I was having
3326000	3327000	connection problems.
3327000	3329000	It was like Origin can't connect.
3329000	3333000	Which, you know, as much as I want to come on here and go, LOL Origin, our internet was
3333000	3336000	acting a little wonky so I'm going to give it a pass this time.
3336000	3337000	But I'll try to get in there later.
3337000	3340000	It is weird though how you can only play campaign multiplayer.
3340000	3342000	It's a little weird but all right, I'll try it.
3342000	3346000	And if you win or lose it doesn't actually change the flow of the campaign.
3346000	3347000	That's good.
3347000	3349000	Yeah, you just...
3349000	3352000	The mech battle stuff is interesting.
3352000	3354000	It's interesting.
3354000	3356000	They're kind of a lot of fun to control.
3356000	3357000	The tutorial was neat.
3357000	3361000	The agility in that game, like all of the agility and all of the stunts really, really
3361000	3362000	do it for me.
3362000	3365000	Because Mirror's Edge was fun but it was a little bit heavy.
3365000	3368000	And you get all of the benefit of all of this fancy...
3368000	3371000	You know, it's faster than Halo.
3371000	3378000	And there's more maneuverability on building sides and double jumping and grappling up
3378000	3380000	the corners, all that kind of stuff.
3380000	3384000	And I don't call titans down very often in that game.
3384000	3388000	I just kind of stick to my guns, literally and figuratively.
3388000	3391000	I stay on foot and I do what I can.
3391000	3394000	Rodeoing a titan is fucking fantastic.
3394000	3398000	I don't know what it is but that really, really makes the game for me.
3398000	3404000	If I don't doom a titan when I'm rodeoing it, if that's even proper conjugation.
3404000	3408000	When I rodeo a titan, if I don't doom it, I'm not pissed off because the whole process
3408000	3409000	is just fun.
3409000	3414000	The ability to just kind of be on a rooftop, see that an enemy titan's coming that way.
3414000	3415000	Banzai!
3415000	3417000	Right on top of it and into it just...
3417000	3418000	I don't know.
3418000	3423000	I fell out of first person shooters more or less a while ago.
3423000	3427000	I enjoy Titanfall thoroughly.
3427000	3429000	That's quite the endorsement.
3429000	3433000	I still think a PS4 is the better investment in the first place.
3433000	3438000	And I have Titanfall on the 360 but all of my friends that do as well have it on the one.
3438000	3440000	Well, besides you.
3440000	3442000	But I don't have a PC.
3442000	3452000	I think it's just because I have access to an Xbox One and I have literally, still, never played a PS4.
3452000	3454000	But I'm getting very, very...
3454000	3456000	There's one in the other room.
3456000	3460000	I made time for Scandia today and the show and not the PS4, unfortunately.
3460000	3463000	Yeah, I still to this day have not touched a PS4.
3463000	3467000	And the Xbox Ones that we have at work, I played with a friend in person.
3467000	3472000	We have two of them at work now and so we both had our dedicated TV and Xbox One.
3472000	3477000	I didn't really chime into the Kinect argument because I was just going to say the same thing.
3477000	3479000	I don't mind the Kinect being around.
3479000	3483000	I'm signed in instantly as soon as the console is warmed up.
3483000	3487000	There's still some weird flow-y things with the way that the console operates.
3487000	3493000	But the Kinect, the Xbox One, live streaming Titanfall, having a pretty fucking good time.
3493000	3495000	Kind of really like it.
3495000	3500000	But that's the only thing I'm doing besides Peggle to cool down anything else until...
3500000	3502000	I don't even know.
3502000	3508000	Sunset Overdrive is probably the only other game on the Xbox One that I'm specifically fixated on.
3508000	3513000	Just to be fair, PlayStation 4 also has the instant sign-in if you have a camera.
3513000	3515000	Because it'll see you.
3515000	3517000	It'll see you and you hold the controller up.
3517000	3521000	Like when I go sit on the couch and I turn it on, it draws a box around my face and it goes,
3521000	3525000	Rob Roberts! And then I hold up the controller and it flashes and it knows what controller I'm holding.
3525000	3532000	Why can't they just have a default to one user profile like the Xbox and the PlayStation 3 did?
3532000	3533000	You would think.
3533000	3535000	It's so difficult, this technology.
3535000	3539000	If you don't have the camera, it will come up and you can pick.
3539000	3541000	And I like having my own profile.
3541000	3547000	I've always been annoyed that Nintendo, the Wii so specifically, only has one profile.
3547000	3549000	And you have to choose a different character.
3549000	3551000	Even multiplayer games fixate around one profile.
3551000	3555000	Anyways, I definitely want to make an investment in something soon.
3555000	3558000	Obviously I can get by with Titanfall on the 360.
3558000	3561000	But I don't know.
3561000	3564000	We'll see once the money is actually there to be able to do it.
3564000	3566000	Which is not going to be anytime soon.
3566000	3569000	Yeah, speaking of which, I want to get into housekeeping here real quick.
3569000	3571000	Before we get into the rest of the news tonight.
3571000	3575000	For housekeeping tonight, we will be here for the next few weeks.
3575000	3577000	I mentioned that we might be off.
3577000	3579000	That is not going to happen after all.
3579000	3582000	So we're going to be working pretty hard over the next few weeks.
3582000	3587000	Part of that reason is that VoG will be represented at E3 this year.
3587000	3590000	We're going to have 2.5 times the manpower this year that we had last year.
3590000	3592000	So that's going to be great.
3592000	3593000	So check that out.
3593000	3595000	You can see what we did last year.
3595000	3596000	E3.vognetwork.com.
3596000	3598000	And we plan to do something very similar this year.
3598000	3601000	We'll have more details probably next week or the week after.
3601000	3603000	Either on Bobby's show or here on OLR.
3603000	3605000	But I'm going to be there.
3605000	3606000	Bobby's going to be there.
3606000	3607000	Jason's going to be there.
3607000	3611000	So unfortunately Dark Sakura and Loki cannot be there.
3611000	3614000	But they'll be watching from home.
3614000	3617000	And we'll give their commentary that Sunday on the program.
3617000	3619000	And we will be back.
3619000	3621000	I will be back from E3 in time that Sunday.
3621000	3623000	We will have a proper wrap up show.
3624000	3629000	We don't want to commit to doing anything from E3 as far as broadcast goes.
3629000	3631000	Because we're trying to keep ourselves pretty busy.
3631000	3635000	What we're trying to do is we're trying to line up people for the shows for the coming months.
3635000	3639000	So although you may feel like I wanted to get my E3 shows during the time.
3639000	3642000	Well you will have all the information on the website where you can ask questions.
3642000	3646000	And we're hoping to really bring content to the shows over the coming months.
3646000	3648000	So it's kind of an investment sort of thing.
3648000	3650000	But we're really looking forward to that.
3650000	3651000	So I'm excited.
3652000	3654000	Also I know some of the other VoG people.
3654000	3655000	I keep focusing on us.
3655000	3658000	But I do know Electric Sisterhood is going to be there too.
3658000	3660000	I don't know who else from the network.
3660000	3662000	I think that's it from our network that's going to be there.
3662000	3663000	But I don't want to leave out ESH.
3663000	3664000	They are going to be there.
3664000	3667000	But they do because they do a lot of written content for their own site.
3667000	3668000	They kind of focus on that.
3668000	3671000	So we don't rope them into the VoG coverage.
3671000	3673000	But you'll hear stuff on their show for sure.
3673000	3678000	So shout out to the lovely ladies at Electric Sisterhood Tuesdays on VoG.
3679000	3681000	I think that's it. I think that's all I have.
3681000	3684000	So let's get into some gaming news, shall we?
3684000	3685000	Loki.
3685000	3687000	So there's a rumor.
3687000	3693000	I mean, you know, originally it was going to be that I thought they were talking about Halo 2,
3693000	3696000	the anniversary edition of that coming out on Xbox One or something.
3696000	3707000	Well now they're going to have apparently this rumored Halo Master Chief collection that's going to be coming out Xbox One.
3707000	3718000	I don't know if you can call it HD remaster, but HD remastered versions of Halo Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo 4.
3718000	3721000	HD-er.
3721000	3726000	And apparently it's not going to include Halo Region and Halo 3 ODST.
3727000	3737000	And I guess that's supposed to be coming out maybe on Xbox One at some point in time for Halo 5 Guardian,
3737000	3741000	which they announced the title and have a little picture.
3741000	3746000	It's supposed to be coming out in the fall of 2015, though.
3746000	3751000	So if you were thinking that's going to be the big fall title for Xbox One, nope.
3751000	3753000	No, sounds like this Halo 1 through 4 compilation.
3753000	3763000	If it's true, which, you know, again, you kind of have to weigh what's the source it's coming from and how much do I kind of put credit in it.
3763000	3766000	It definitely sounds plausible. It doesn't sound illogical.
3766000	3772000	We've already heard rumors before about a Halo 2 HD, so it being expanded to include 3 and 4.
3772000	3783000	Technically, it's possible that they will still do the Halo 2 HD for the Xbox 360, and then the Xbox One, which would make sense.
3783000	3795000	Xbox One would contain the Xbox 360 Halo anniversary, Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3 and Halo 4, since it would be harder to redo all the visuals for 2.
3795000	3804000	I would have thought it would have just been an engine like Halo 4, since it's the newest, maybe up-res for Xbox One, and then it just has all the old maps.
3804000	3814000	I kind of thought that's where it would end up going, but I guess if they really do put all four complete games in there for $60, that's a pretty darn good deal, especially to catch people up.
3814000	3821000	And on the Xbox One, Halo 2 on Xbox Live now would be a great asset.
3821000	3829000	It's too bad, though, that the multiplayer in that game wouldn't beat all of the Halo maps in the Halo 4 engine or something like that. That would be pretty awesome.
3829000	3835000	Kaijuto in chat at live.fognetwork.com says, isn't Halo 3, Reach, and 4 already all HD?
3835000	3837000	Now remember, Loki said HD-er.
3837000	3839000	HD-er.
3839000	3841000	HD-er.
3841000	3843000	I don't know. See, that's the thing. I don't understand.
3843000	3846000	1080p, 60fps, OMG.
3847000	3853000	Well, no, no, hold on, hold on. This is the Xbox One we're talking about here, so that's not a guarantee at all.
3853000	3859000	I mean, there's no guarantee that's going to be 60fps or 1080p, native 1080p.
3859000	3866000	So, I don't know, but, yeah, Halo. So expect some Halo in your future.
3866000	3873000	But really, is a compilation of games that they've already put out really going to sell you on Xbox One? I don't think so.
3874000	3879000	It wouldn't, go back to Jamie's On the Fence comment from earlier.
3879000	3882000	It definitely sways somebody who's on the fence like me.
3882000	3887000	Like, it's another one of those things where I'm like, well, if I get it, I'm not going to get an Xbox One just for this.
3887000	3894000	But, if I get an Xbox One and I want to play Killer Instinct and I want to play Quantum Break, shit, now I can get Halo 1 through 4 as well?
3894000	3896000	Ooh, that's a pretty good argument.
3896000	3899000	You know, that's kind of what it does.
3899000	3907000	I think they'll sell a lot. The Halo 2 part of that, I mean, like Kaijuto said, Halo 3 and 4 are already HD. What's the big deal there?
3907000	3911000	For me, it's the Halo 2 end of it is really the centerpiece of that whole collection.
3911000	3915000	What if you get extra pink armor?
3915000	3917000	More pinker?
3917000	3919000	More pinkier.
3919000	3924000	What if it's like in multiple hues of pink and purple?
3924000	3927000	I would so be there.
3927000	3929000	What if you can add sparkles?
3929000	3931000	Collect hearts and bunnies and all the little symbols.
3931000	3933000	What if you can have bling armor?
3933000	3937000	Oh, now sparkles, you had the symbols in Halo, but you never had the sparkles.
3937000	3946000	I thought they had something, it was burning. They had fire, which was a special bungee Halo 3 helmet that you could get.
3946000	3952000	Somebody did a mod for Mass Effect 3 where all the armor is sparkly and blinged out, like it's made out of jewels.
3952000	3960000	They should do that for Halo, and then I would buy it.
3960000	3965000	Ikuma JP in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Hello Kitty Halo.
3965000	3967000	Alright, you guys are...
3967000	3973000	I'm interested in it, but it's one of those things where it's like, well, if I get an Xbox One, I'll just pick this up too.
3973000	3977000	I like your bear pants.
3978000	3981000	I was wondering if anybody was going to bring up the PJs again this time.
3981000	3987000	Okay, so Jason's here because he is visiting California. He's doing laundry outside during the show.
3987000	3989000	I'm going to take a picture of your bear pants, your bear leg.
3989000	3997000	Last week, Jason had these like chili pajama bottoms that he was like, like little, like the restaurant chilis, like pepper chilis.
3997000	3999000	Whole chilis, not cut chilis.
3999000	4003000	Yeah, that was where they had, and this week he has the bears or whatever.
4003000	4013000	It's just really funny to me because he had pants on when the show started, so he changed pants in the garage into these bear PJs and then came back in the studio.
4013000	4015000	Right on the other side of the wall from your head.
4015000	4017000	Gross, but...
4017000	4021000	Hey, who was the one that was talking about the short situation?
4021000	4023000	The fact that I'm sewing...
4023000	4025000	As soon as the show's over, woo!
4025000	4028000	You know with Horde House, I don't have to wear pants.
4028000	4039000	Hey, do you know how many times I've done remote ends for OLR, like when I've been on the show on my house, where I've had no bra?
4039000	4042000	Seriously, who wants any of that crap on when you're at home?
4042000	4044000	Dark Sakura's not wearing pants right now.
4044000	4048000	Actually, I'm wearing shorts under my skirt. I'm wearing an amazing floofy skirt.
4048000	4049000	She's wearing a floofy...
4049000	4050000	The very Renaissance festival.
4050000	4054000	That's actually what it's from. This skirt is now four sizes too big for me.
4054000	4057000	I feel like you should do some twirl dancing in that skirt or something.
4057000	4059000	I might catch fire and turn into a Mockingjay.
4059000	4064000	Alright, let's move on to some more news. So, we'll see what happens with the Halo.
4064000	4073000	Hey, I mentioned earlier in the show, Diablo 3 was having a very special weekend this weekend, and it is the legendary event to celebrate the second birthday of Diablo 3.
4073000	4084000	Or for many of us, the rebirth of a game that was mediocre the first time, that after some patching and removal of the auction house and so forth, now kicks a lot of ass after its latest expansion.
4084000	4090000	So, 100% increase to legendary drops. That's going on right now, and it runs through Thursday.
4090000	4093000	So, if you haven't checked out Diablo 3 in a while, now's a good time to get back on there.
4093000	4100000	You do not have to have the expansion for that, although you do have to have the expansion for Adventure mode, which is really all I ever play now.
4100000	4103000	That means now I have to install that on my computer.
4103000	4108000	Actually, there's plenty of people at Locat who are playing it on their computers at work during lunch.
4108000	4115000	You know, it's funny because you brought up roguelikes last week in Rogue in your Classic Game of the Week, and this is like one of the kings of roguelikes, really.
4115000	4122000	And it really is just such an easy game, especially with Adventure mode, to just kind of go in and do a rift, mindless, get some upgrades, and then I'm done.
4122000	4126000	It's a great little time killer. So, yeah, that's part of it.
4126000	4136000	But the other part of this is that maybe if you don't want this on PC or whatever, you're more of a console gamer, maybe you've been wondering when is this coming out on PlayStation 4 because they talked about this a long time ago.
4136000	4147000	Well, guess what? They finally announced Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls The Ultimate Evil Edition is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as 360 and PS3, which already had Diablo 3.
4147000	4157000	The release date? August 19th. This will include the Reaper of Souls expansion, and this will be Diablo 3's first foray on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4157000	4163000	Now, you might be thinking, well, do I have to own Diablo 3 on 360 or PS3 to have this?
4163000	4169000	And the answer is no, you don't. And then the second thought is, well, great, I'm screwed because now I already bought Diablo 3, I gotta buy it again.
4169000	4175000	Yes, but the good news is that it will be cheaper. It will be only $40 on the 360 and the PlayStation 3.
4175000	4181000	Or as it will be the full 60 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but it will be game plus expansion.
4181000	4184000	Yeah, but you know what? $40 buys lunch for two weeks.
4184000	4188000	And it buys the PC version too, so something to think about.
4188000	4194000	Inferno Pauldrons will be granted to your account if you pre-order now, so there you go.
4194000	4204000	And Diablo 3 currently running on patch 2.0.6, although it should be noted that the PC and the console versions run independently sometimes,
4204000	4209000	because the console version runs loot very differently because you don't really have the inventory the same way.
4209000	4213000	The legendary event I just spoke of actually doesn't apply to the console version.
4213000	4217000	Console versions are running on version ERR37.
4217000	4221000	Don't be a jerk. Alright.
4221000	4228000	Bochikawa in chat playing a lot of Diablo apparently. Bochikawa says, got like 20 legendary todays, only using three of them.
4228000	4234000	You know, I've been getting legendary patterns out the wazoo.
4234000	4240000	Lots and lots and lots and lots of patterns, so that's exciting for the crafty side of me.
4240000	4242000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
4242000	4248000	I'm sorry, I'm just a little horrified about IkumaJP suggesting that all the guys here wear fundoshi.
4248000	4250000	Is that like what the sumo...
4250000	4254000	Yeah, kinda. The ancient Japanese banana hammock.
4254000	4256000	Ancient jockstrap, basically.
4256000	4258000	Yeah, pretty much.
4258000	4260000	I was just mildly horrified.
4260000	4262000	Maybe I'm wearing one of those under my pants.
4262000	4265000	Does that explain your no panty lines?
4266000	4269000	No, that's just my big butt.
4269000	4273000	Anyway, Path of Exile. That other game.
4273000	4281000	Well, it actually has been running a charity for Child's Play and raised $20,000 for Child's Play.
4281000	4289000	The event started on May 10th and went on until yesterday. Not me yesterday, next Saturday, May 24th.
4289000	4297000	Basically, it has an in-game item on sale, the angelic mask that has sold 3600 units.
4297000	4307000	There's also prizes in there for different drawings. There's a level 15 one that's 100 stash tab bundles.
4307000	4311000	It goes up to 35 gets an Nvidia performance card.
4311000	4319000	The 85 one is an hour private Q&A on Skype with the game makers, so pretty cool deal.
4319000	4321000	Not too late to check it out.
4321000	4324000	Not too late to buy stuff for kids.
4324000	4331000	That's really neat that they're turning that into a charity. Those are the types of things that sound like Kickstarter rewards, but it's all going more to a charity benefit.
4331000	4341000	If you don't like the $40, you just joked earlier, $40 could buy a heck of a lot. Path of Exile is free to check out.
4341000	4344000	If you like it, you can give $40 to charity.
4344000	4347000	Buy your $5 item and help out some kids.
4347000	4352000	There you go. I think that's great. That's a great use for Path of Exile. Kudos to you guys over there.
4352000	4354000	Do you remember kudos, Rob?
4354000	4356000	Like the candy bar?
4356000	4358000	They were granola bars, right?
4358000	4359000	Those are good.
4359000	4361000	Chocolate covered granola bars.
4361000	4365000	Every time I hear kudos, I think of those now. Ever since the 80s and I want one.
4365000	4367000	That's funny.
4367000	4369000	They don't make them anymore.
4369000	4371000	Every time I hear Oreo, I think about cookies too.
4371000	4373000	You know what? You can bite my big toe.
4373000	4377000	Because I stepped in grass today and got a nice big hive on it so you could bite it.
4377000	4379000	Oh, you must have been in our backyard.
4379000	4382000	No, I was actually in my front yard because I left my phone at Charlie's.
4382000	4383000	Nope.
4383000	4385000	At the restaurant around the corner from my house.
4385000	4386000	Nope.
4386000	4388000	Thank goodness they found it because I was like, lost mode.
4388000	4390000	Have you told all the listeners where you live?
4390000	4392000	Don't fucking care.
4392000	4394000	Come over and party with Dark Sakura, guys.
4394000	4396000	I didn't say what Charlie's exactly was.
4396000	4398000	I didn't say exactly where it was.
4398000	4400000	I just said it was Charlie's.
4400000	4402000	Don't fucking care.
4402000	4405000	If any of you people show up at my house, I'll throw my cat at you.
4405000	4408000	Somebody came on here the other day and said,
4408000	4410000	Oh, we went to the gym boys down the street.
4410000	4412000	I'm like, give away where I live.
4412000	4414000	Luckily, there's like 40 gym boys.
4414000	4416000	There's a million gym boys in Sacramento.
4416000	4419000	Anyhow, which by the way, that was a good taco.
4419000	4421000	And they're not paying me to say that.
4421000	4422000	All right, Loki.
4422000	4423000	Yuck.
4423000	4424000	All right.
4424000	4426000	Well, back on the subject of Halo.
4426000	4432000	Halo Collector's Edition, I guess, or Combat Evolved on PC.
4432000	4436000	Remember it ran on GameSpy.
4436000	4441000	Well, it's actually being taken over now by a third-party company, Game Ranger,
4441000	4444000	who is going to be doing support for that
4444000	4446000	and allowing that to continue on multiplayer-wise
4446000	4449000	because I know a lot of people are fans of Halo.
4449000	4454000	Also, I guess, Lost Planet 3 is also moving to a new service
4454000	4457000	to retain its multiplayer.
4457000	4461000	Also, Street Fighter 3, third Strike Online Edition,
4461000	4468000	and Marvel vs. Capcom Origins are all migrating away.
4468000	4473000	But Age of Booty and Flock, not so much.
4473000	4481000	And then, let's see, Mortal Kombat also is going to be moving off of GameSpy servers.
4481000	4484000	Of course, that's the last Mortal Kombat game to come out,
4484000	4487000	Mortal Kombat 9, I guess, if you would.
4487000	4492000	And although after, I guess, May 31st, the Vita version, though,
4492000	4494000	is only going to support ad hoc multiplayer,
4494000	4496000	that is not getting its multiplayer fix.
4496000	4501000	But for all the other versions, though, they are migrating away from GameSpy.
4501000	4506000	It's interesting to hear about all these games that are frantically trying to fix themselves
4506000	4510000	to get around GameSpy, which ones have the big enough bases to do it,
4510000	4514000	and which ones are just like, eh, fuck it, it ain't worth the trouble.
4514000	4519000	If you like your games, play them online regularly, or it might happen to you.
4519000	4523000	Reminds me, I need to go play more Mass Effect 3 multiplayer.
4523000	4525000	The whole rumor about the trilogy holds true.
4525000	4529000	I want there to be a multiplayer renaissance. I hope so.
4529000	4531000	Moving on, Jason.
4531000	4532000	Quick little fun one.
4532000	4538000	I think we've referenced a couple of times about flashing back to the 80s already in this episode.
4538000	4539000	But do it again.
4539000	4544000	Go get out your cassette tapes and bring up your VHS players and put on Cyndi Lauper.
4544000	4546000	The Goonies is back.
4546000	4547000	Well, sort of.
4547000	4553000	The game, quite possibly the first game to accompany a film's release in the same year,
4553000	4557000	The Goonies, was updated by Team Sloth recently.
4557000	4561000	I'm sorry, Sloth Team, the original Goonies game made by Datasoft,
4561000	4566000	has been updated for Windows and Linux with new graphics and sound, and even a couple...
4569000	4571000	It sounds like lowercase from what I remember.
4573000	4577000	I should have played the Goonies theme when I played Pop, and it's gonna be a day, if it's even on there.
4577000	4578000	It might not be on there.
4578000	4580000	I did get it. Anyways.
4581000	4584000	Any excuse to play this song. It's one of my very favorite 80s songs.
4584000	4586000	Yeah, it's worth it.
4586000	4589000	And the game has like an 8-bit version of this, which is amazing.
4589000	4591000	Well, the old one did.
4591000	4593000	I wonder if I have that one. I'm gonna dig for that while you...
4593000	4599000	Modern graphics, well, newer graphics, newer sounds, and as I said, a couple of additional levels.
4599000	4604000	All of 20 megabyte download can be yours.
4604000	4607000	So is this a remake of the NES version, or is this like the...
4607000	4609000	Oh, they had an arcade version, I thought.
4609000	4611000	Was this like a PC only thing?
4611000	4615000	This was specifically a PC version that was brought into actual modern compatibility.
4615000	4617000	Oh god, Bobby Blackwolf in chat said,
4617000	4619000	TwitchTube just emailed their copyright strike.
4619000	4621000	Yeah, what do you wanna bet? What do you wanna bet?
4621000	4623000	That little interlude I just played is gonna strike the episode.
4623000	4625000	I'll talk to you in six days then, I guess.
4625000	4626000	God.
4626000	4629000	Well, here, let's go for strike two with the 8-bit version.
4631000	4632000	Yes.
4632000	4634000	Yes!
4634000	4639000	This game, this song actually had a third channel.
4639000	4641000	You know, you hear kind of the backbeat.
4641000	4642000	Yeah.
4642000	4643000	And the main, but right here...
4645000	4647000	Splits into the two harmonies.
4647000	4648000	Very fun.
4648000	4649000	Love it.
4649000	4651000	Love Me Some Goonies.
4651000	4652000	We actually watched that.
4652000	4655000	We've been starting to do a thing at work called Third Thursday,
4655000	4661000	where we all just, all the remote people get together and watch a movie via one of our live streaming sources.
4661000	4665000	And I take it back, Goonies wasn't related to that,
4665000	4669000	but The Office watched Goonies in the last two or three months or something like that.
4669000	4670000	It was really fun.
4670000	4672000	I missed Goonies as a kid.
4672000	4677000	I've only seen it since I was at least a teenager, or possibly even a young adult.
4677000	4682000	But I've seen it a couple of times in the last decade, and good movie.
4682000	4684000	Always good to catch back up with that.
4684000	4689000	I like this story because it always reminds me that there's a scene for these remakes,
4689000	4692000	and there's a lot of very talented people that remake a lot.
4692000	4696000	I was looking at the comments, and apparently somebody else had done a Goonies remake not that long ago, too,
4696000	4699000	and had all these MSX game remakes.
4699000	4706000	I'm always blown away by the talent of people that take these old video games and remake them just as hobbyist projects.
4706000	4709000	I truly don't even understand how it works.
4709000	4715000	I get mods, I get game development, not to say I could do it,
4715000	4718000	but I truly do know the pieces that go in together,
4718000	4722000	but to take something like that and completely modernize it,
4722000	4727000	I suppose I'm comparing it to how modding worked in the PlayStation world,
4727000	4736000	where DRM and tricky things to weight off hackers and copiers or anything like that actually became a thing,
4736000	4739000	but back then they were probably really, really raw assets
4739000	4743000	that they could literally just take the time to make look better, slap it into place.
4743000	4751000	The game's fucking 20 megs. This isn't bolting it onto the Unreal Engine and starting over.
4751000	4756000	Good on them. I will have to check that out at some point, because I do like the old games.
4756000	4760000	Even the reference to Truffle Shuffle. How could I go without a reference to this article to the Truffle Shuffle?
4760000	4765000	Luckily, it's a radio show, so we don't have to see it.
4765000	4768000	What are you insinuating?
4768000	4770000	Dark Sakura.
4770000	4773000	Well, we do have some good news for our friends in the UK.
4773000	4776000	Some good news.
4776000	4781000	Well, there is, actually it's already sold out now, but UK...
4781000	4782000	Bad news.
4782000	4789000	Yeah. Well, there's UK retailer John Lewis selling the Wii U for 112 pounds.
4789000	4801000	Marked down from two... going from the 234.95 ones went to 159.95, and the 149.95 ones went to 112.
4801000	4806000	If anyone's curious, 112 pounds is just shy of $200.
4806000	4818000	So, yeah. That was... it was 8 gigabytes Wii U with New Super Mario Brothers U, and also an 8 gigabyte SD card.
4818000	4820000	That is dirt cheap for all that.
4820000	4821000	That is dirt cheap.
4821000	4824000	For the complete bundle and everything else for sub $200, that is fantastic.
4824000	4825000	And now they're gone.
4825000	4828000	We haven't seen it that low in the US, have we? Craziness.
4828000	4829000	Now they're gone.
4829000	4831000	Good on you to get to it in time.
4831000	4841000	Wow. All right. Well, let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out this week as we look at release dates, and hopefully things that you'll be able to get your hands on before they sell out.
4841000	4855000	Yes. Well, this week there's actually not a whole ton coming out, but some good games, starting off with Wolfenstein The New Order, which will be out on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PC.
4856000	4868000	Drakengard 3 on PlayStation 3, and Mugen Souls Z on the Vita. That's it.
4868000	4869000	That's it?
4869000	4871000	Yeah. Not a whole ton.
4871000	4874000	I guess waiting for summer to officially start before you...
4874000	4877000	But the week after next, Watch Dogs.
4877000	4878000	Oh, yeah.
4878000	4879000	That'll be pretty big.
4879000	4880000	The Mario Kart 8 right behind you, right?
4880000	4882000	Yep. Mario Kart 8 that same week as well, so, yeah.
4882000	4883000	All right.
4883000	4894000	Well, let's check out what's coming out in Japan. On the PlayStation 4 this week, Infamous Second Son gets its Japanese release on May 22nd, so you can check that out if you're a PS4 owner in Japan. It's a pretty good game.
4894000	4899000	I've only played little bits and pieces of it, but I got into it more than I did the other Infamous games, so there you go.
4900000	4918000	On the PlayStation 3, it's a soccer full week as World Soccer Winning 11 2014 that comes out this week from Konami, as well as a specialized soccer controller from Hori who does a bunch of those peripheral things, so if you need the ultimate in controlling your soccer games, you have that on the PlayStation 3 this week.
4918000	4922000	Nothing on the Xbox 360, but what else is new as far as Japan is concerned?
4922000	4931000	On the Vita, you have a few things to look forward to, like Amnesia World and To Love Rue Darkness, Battle Ecstasy.
4931000	4932000	To Love Rue Darkness.
4932000	4941000	To Love Rue Darkness. Well, I keep wanting to say To Love Rue Paul, but that's actually not the case whatsoever, although I don't know, they could be Drag Queens.
4941000	4942000	No.
4942000	4944000	No, it's not. I think it's based on anime, right?
4944000	4945000	Yes.
4945000	4946000	Yeah, very much so.
4946000	4947000	Yes.
4948000	4953000	Well, in this one, it's like, you can almost see right up this girl's skirt, it's a little scandalous.
4953000	4957000	You are filled with the unsurprising statements of the day in these last two minutes.
4957000	4958000	Right?
4958000	4959000	I seem to remember that...
4959000	4960000	Have you played this game at all?
4960000	4967000	I want to say I might have seen an episode or two of the anime. I probably didn't. I'm sure I just saw a reference to it in general.
4967000	4973000	Well, the back of the box emphasizes communication, battle, and adventure. So, there you go.
4973000	4977000	In other words, anime girls in hilarious situations?
4977000	4980000	In another anime adventure game. I think you kind of know what you're in for on that.
4980000	4987000	Alright, and then on the Wii U this week, well, nothing, but you do have Mario Kart 8 to look forward to worldwide.
4987000	4990000	So, when we get it, you guys are getting it in Japan as well.
4990000	4994000	And last, I was just going to check out the 3DS, because they get some regular releases.
4994000	4997000	World Soccer winning 11 also on the 3DS this week.
4997000	4999000	That's it for Japanese releases.
4999000	5001000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
5001000	5012000	In the UK, there is on the 20th of May, there is a transistor for PS4, PC, Wolfenstein The New Order for everything.
5012000	5016000	On the 21st, Always Sometimes Monsters on PC.
5016000	5018000	The 23rd, Killer is Dead.
5018000	5020000	And Tropico 5.
5022000	5030000	And since this will come out after the 25th has already hit, the 25th has already hit, in the UK, I'll go ahead and say The Inner World will be out on Android.
5032000	5033000	Alright.
5034000	5040000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio on Bognetwork.com, use the passphrase, D.A.L.L.
5040000	5045000	Just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
5045000	5055000	Alright, well this is kind of exciting, but Far Cry 4 has been converted, and ironically enough, it was pretty much what was leaked out months ago.
5056000	5059000	Regarding, you know, it's going to take place in the Himalayas.
5061000	5066000	Sorry about that, I tried to bring up an article and it played a video. I hate that shit. Sorry about that.
5066000	5073000	It will be coming out November 18th on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC.
5073000	5080000	And I guess they're saying that, well they haven't really talked too much about who the main character is and stuff.
5080000	5086000	But it looks like this very flamboyant dictator of some sort, so...
5087000	5088000	Kafka.
5088000	5089000	Could be cool.
5092000	5095000	Yeah, so I guess they're going to have some pre-order bonuses and that fun stuff.
5095000	5096000	Of course.
5097000	5099000	To be continued at E3, I'm sure.
5100000	5106000	Alright, one other story here, and that is rumors about the PlayStation 4 camera price going up. Isn't this ironic?
5106000	5110000	Through all the joking we were making earlier in the show about, oh, wouldn't that be funny if they gave it away now?
5110000	5113000	There's actually rumors out there that the price is going up.
5113000	5120000	Well, what this is coming from is, I guess there was a contest giveaway, and unfortunately I can't bring up that site, because they're one of those horrible sites that has the autoplay videos.
5120000	5128000	But they had some sort of contest reference, that there was a contest that showed that the approximate retail value of the camera that they were giving away in the contest,
5128000	5135000	this was some type of official Sony contest, was $69.99, whereas the retail price of those cameras right now, $59.99.
5135000	5143000	But as we know, a while ago, GameStop, for whatever reason, because those cameras were hard to find for a short time, GameStop jacked up the price $10.
5143000	5145000	Was the contest in America?
5145000	5152000	I believe so, because I don't think the values would have reflected it otherwise. It would have reflected the local currency.
5153000	5159000	But anyway, as we all know, GameStop had jacked up the price $10 for a time. I don't know if they're still doing that.
5159000	5161000	I'm really not surprised.
5161000	5168000	But I will tell you this, I think it could be the case that somebody was just lazy and Googled the price when they were writing those contest instructions.
5168000	5179000	I don't think they have insider information or something. And I will say this much, I just went to Amazon and looked up a PlayStation 4 camera, and you can even give it for $59.96!
5179000	5181000	Three cents off, bitches!
5181000	5186000	But yeah, at Amazon.com right now, they're still selling that, and I'm sure lots of other retailers.
5186000	5195000	So nothing that we've heard of yet regarding the price officially going up. I would just chalk this up to some bad Google foo at Sony.
5195000	5202000	And in case you're wondering, yes, it is still $69.99 at GameStop. Or pre-owned for $54.99.
5202000	5203000	Well...
5203000	5204000	Such a deal.
5204000	5211000	Fuck that. It's right there, PlayStation 4 in stock. Is Amazon themselves selling it, or is it one of their retailers?
5211000	5214000	It's ships and sold by Amazon.com.
5214000	5224000	And I'm picking on Amazon here, but I imagine Best Buy has them, and maybe Target, and a lot of those other retailers probably have them too.
5224000	5231000	They're not hard to find anymore. It was the Japanese launch that made them hard to find for a while, and now that's not a problem.
5231000	5238000	So go get them, if that's what you want. But if you don't, well, you still have a pretty good gaming console.
5238000	5247000	Alright, let's take a trip down memory lane, you guys. We're gonna take a trip back to when you didn't need fancy cameras to play video games.
5247000	5255000	You didn't need to broadcast yourself online playing a video game, because you know what? Nobody needed to see you swearing like that.
5255000	5258000	Or any other part of you on camera.
5259000	5266000	It's the classic game of the week, and every week Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5266000	5271000	Hey, you kids should be playing this game right now, and if you're not, I'm gonna kill you.
5271000	5274000	No. I'm gonna shoot your food.
5274000	5276000	Or the lack of eating food will kill you.
5276000	5279000	Okay, first I have to tell you what inspired this.
5279000	5280000	Okay.
5280000	5282000	So I did pick Gauntlet.
5282000	5289000	I was playing D&D last night. Yes, I played D&D. Second edition in the house. At my friend's house, technically.
5289000	5294000	So anyway, we had zombies coming, and somebody just kept asking,
5294000	5296000	Okay, where's the monster generator?
5296000	5299000	And I was like, it's fine as long as no one shoots the food.
5299000	5303000	And then I started playing this on my phone, and I got 50 experience points. It was awesome.
5303000	5305000	Nice.
5305000	5310000	So anyway, yeah, the game is Gauntlet, which I was actually surprised I have not done before.
5310000	5319000	And also since the arcade one, as I recall, did not have music, I picked the NES Gauntlet one for having background music.
5319000	5327000	So you can play as Thor the warrior, Merlin the wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Quester the elf.
5327000	5331000	They have their own powers, their own strengths.
5331000	5338000	And so you have the warrior, who is the strongest hand-to-hand. The wizard has the best magic, of course.
5338000	5341000	The elf is the fastest, and the Valkyrie has the best armor.
5341000	5346000	So basically, you have to go through giant mazes and kill a bunch of creatures.
5346000	5351000	And you have to destroy the generators in them, so that they just don't keep throwing shit at you.
5351000	5356000	There are no bosses, but you do have an enemy that is just called death.
5356000	5363000	That will drain your health, but is... you can kill it. You can kill death. You can kill death in the face.
5364000	5372000	So basically, when your health reaches zero, you die. You can put in another coin and get another life.
5372000	5383000	So basically, it's just a really... I'm not the biggest Gauntlet fan, I will admit this, but it is a pretty fun game if you've got other people playing it with you.
5383000	5396000	It also had a narrator that used the TMS-5220C speech chip that would say things like,
5396000	5399000	Shots do not hurt other players, yet.
5399000	5403000	Remember, don't shoot food. Elf, shot the food.
5403000	5406000	Remember, don't shoot food.
5406000	5408000	Yes. Warrior needs food.
5408000	5411000	Valkyrie needs food badly.
5411000	5413000	Yes. Things like that.
5413000	5417000	I've not seen such bravery.
5417000	5421000	It sounds almost like the Speak and Spell 2.
5421000	5423000	Or when you're playing with Dark Sakura.
5423000	5426000	Someone shot the food.
5426000	5432000	Bitch, I will cut you. I will shoot your food.
5432000	5439000	Okay, that's it. We need the new OLR dream game. It's called OLR Gauntlet.
5439000	5443000	Someone make OLR Gauntlet. I will figure out a way to rom-hat Gauntlet.
5443000	5449000	So it's OLR Gauntlet, and it would be what? Me, you, Loki, and I guess Jason would be the fourth, or Bobby.
5449000	5452000	You guys have to pick if it's going to be Jason or Bobby as the fourth.
5452000	5455000	I say they're all ferrets scurrying around the dungeon.
5455000	5457000	And the clips vary between the voices.
5457000	5459000	No, it would be us. It would be us.
5459000	5464000	Or it could be Shane, who attacks with the power of apathy.
5464000	5471000	No, I think Jason has put in enough hours on air that Jason will have earned his...
5471000	5473000	His stripes as the fourth, yeah.
5473000	5476000	His semi-official fourth host.
5476000	5483000	Or we have a giant chat room just following along that looks like an IRC window.
5483000	5489000	Well, that's what we're doing. We're going through this giant chat room, and it's all trolls that are in the chat room trying to kill us.
5489000	5491000	And rabid ferrets.
5491000	5495000	And the game says things like, bitch, I will cut you.
5495000	5498000	And you have the secret goal of finding Sanrio under our bed.
5498000	5501000	Retreat to Pinkberry.
5501000	5503000	Yeah, all of our food icons are Pinkberry.
5503000	5505000	Don't shoot, Pinkberry.
5505000	5512000	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, can we get Loki as Tingle to be the elf?
5512000	5514000	Sure.
5514000	5515000	No.
5515000	5516000	Loki is definitely the elf.
5516000	5519000	I was actually thinking that Rob would make a good elf, because you're fast.
5519000	5520000	I want to be the wizard.
5520000	5521000	I'd have to be the Valkyrie.
5521000	5522000	You have to be the Valkyrie.
5522000	5523000	You have to be the Valkyrie.
5523000	5524000	And Jason could be the warrior.
5524000	5525000	And I could be the, there you go.
5525000	5526000	Loki's the, come on.
5526000	5527000	Loki's the elf.
5527000	5528000	Come on.
5528000	5531000	Are you the fastest Loki?
5531000	5532000	I don't know.
5532000	5534000	Sadly out of this group, probably.
5534000	5535000	I don't know.
5535000	5537000	Dark Soccer might be a little faster, but she has to be the Valkyrie.
5537000	5539000	So.
5539000	5541000	But you got to say Shane.
5541000	5546000	No, I don't want to get the food.
5546000	5548000	See, I'm talking about OLR gauntlet.
5548000	5550000	If we did VoG gauntlet, then it would be a little bit different.
5550000	5554000	You'd actually be able to, you'd have multiple choices of characters or like skins for your
5554000	5555000	characters.
5555000	5556000	There you go.
5556000	5559000	We'd have the special Tingle skin for Loki.
5559000	5560000	Unlocked when you choose green.
5560000	5561000	Any other color can be something else.
5561000	5564000	There is a game out there where you can play Loki as Tingle.
5564000	5566000	It's just a lot of you'd never found it.
5566000	5569000	So I'm just saying maybe you want to go revisit a game we were selling the shit out of on
5569000	5573000	this show about two months ago and go see if you've missed something.
5573000	5574000	Anyway.
5574000	5579000	So basically, the game could be very, very, very difficult.
5579000	5584000	And as you got further into the game, you actually did have, you could actually hurt
5584000	5587000	your other players with friendly fire.
5587000	5589000	It used a joystick and it had two buttons.
5589000	5591000	One for fire, one for magic.
5591000	5594000	Magic also starts the game because the magic.
5594000	5595000	Ooh.
5595000	5600000	There were some people who were very, very good at the game until they did a ROM update
5600000	5604000	that reduced the extra shot and extra shot power and extra shot speed for Warrior and
5604000	5610000	Wizard and added a point-based difficulty system so that it made it really hard to get
5610000	5614000	from one to seven without dying.
5614000	5619000	And level four was actually designed so that the food drops would block monsters from
5619000	5620000	swarming on the player.
5620000	5627000	So that got removed out of that because then you could just sort of bend the game over.
5628000	5634000	Gauntlet II came out and Valkyrie and Elf did not receive extra food removal penalties.
5634000	5637000	Only Warrior and Wizard would do that.
5637000	5644000	Valkyrie and Elf would receive all of the default food that their difficulty allowed them to.
5644000	5652000	There was also a big dispute going on about this where for the port that came out that
5652000	5658000	basically Ed Log, who was a co-creator of Asteroids and Centipede, was credited for the
5658000	5662000	game design for the arcade version and the NES version.
5662000	5671000	And John Palovich, who was I believe another, was actually against that, saying that the
5671000	5677000	original concept came from a game called Dandy that was for the Atari 800 computer and the
5677000	5679000	game that he designed.
5680000	5683000	So yeah, big bunch of crap out of that.
5683000	5685000	There were tons and tons of ports.
5685000	5693000	We had a DOS, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, MSX, NES Atari Lynx, Apple IIGS, Master System,
5693000	5700000	Mega Drive, Genesis, as Gauntlet IV, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum.
5700000	5708000	There also was at least on the arcade, Midway Treasures for GameCube, PS2 and Xbox and Windows.
5709000	5713000	Gauntlet II sometimes was the only one converted for some of those as well.
5713000	5716000	There was a Game Boy version of Gauntlet II.
5716000	5724000	The NES version was the big one that it was pretty much the big departure from the way
5724000	5726000	the arcade version worked.
5726000	5734000	It kept the formula and the cast of characters, but it did new levels and had a different quest.
5734000	5739000	You had to actually retrieve the sacred orb from the 100th level.
5739000	5745000	You could get portions of a password in certain clue rooms throughout the first 99 levels.
5747000	5752000	It was also one of the few licensed Tengen cartridges.
5752000	5760000	The only other ones that were officially licensed Tengen releases besides Gauntlet was Pac-Man
5760000	5762000	and RBI Baseball.
5763000	5768000	It actually was re-released as an unlicensed game after the split from Nintendo.
5768000	5773000	The Mega Drive version was Gauntlet in Japan and in the US it was released as Gauntlet IV
5773000	5776000	with a new soundtrack and original game modes.
5776000	5779000	It had quest mode, battle mode and record mode.
5779000	5783000	There was a DS version that was developed by Backbone.
5783000	5784000	I forgot about that.
5784000	5787000	There was the DOS version like I said, the Spectrum.
5787000	5789000	There were a bunch of other versions.
5789000	5795000	There's even a cell phone version that's for Java, ME and Brew that was done by TKO Software.
5797000	5802000	There's also Gauntlet The Deeper Dungeons that was an expansion pack for the original Gauntlet
5802000	5808000	with 512 new levels and required the original game.
5808000	5810000	There might be a such thing as too many levels.
5810000	5812000	You know what, yeah.
5812000	5816000	But people are basically agreed that it is not as great.
5817000	5819000	And then of course we've had sequels.
5819000	5822000	There was the Gauntlet Dark Legacy and all that.
5823000	5825000	But nothing I think touches the original.
5825000	5826000	But still.
5826000	5829000	Oh, Gauntlet Legends is a hell of a lot of fun.
5829000	5830000	That was one of my favorites.
5830000	5833000	Dark Legacy specifically wasn't as much.
5833000	5835000	I don't even remember what they tried to change.
5835000	5836000	I remember I didn't like it.
5836000	5838000	But Legends I did enjoy very, very much.
5838000	5842000	This reboot where they've kind of Diablo-fied it a little bit I'm really looking forward to.
5842000	5843000	It should be interesting.
5844000	5847000	I mean, would we have had a Diablo if not for Gauntlet?
5847000	5849000	Would we have had a Gauntlet if not for Rogue?
5849000	5850000	Who knows?
5851000	5852000	Hard to say.
5852000	5853000	Is that it?
5853000	5859000	Um, actually it also, just something that's funny that I think is great.
5859000	5863000	You remember when Dragon Magazine used to review fantasy video games?
5863000	5864000	I do.
5864000	5866000	Well, I mean, I wasn't around at the time.
5866000	5867000	The Mac version.
5867000	5869000	You were around in 1989, Rob.
5869000	5871000	Oh god, I thought it was earlier than that.
5873000	5875000	But the Mac version was reviewed in Dragon 150.
5875000	5876000	Huh.
5876000	5879000	And it got a 4 out of 5 stars around the time.
5879000	5884000	Computer and Video Games did the Amstrad version and said it had great graphics, great sound, and perfect playability.
5884000	5886000	So, yeah.
5886000	5890000	The multiple ports of this game have gotten very high reviews.
5890000	5892000	So, there you go.
5892000	5893000	Alright.
5893000	5894000	Gauntlet.
5894000	5895000	There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
5895000	5896000	Your classic game of the week.
5900000	5901000	Gauntlet.
5901000	5902000	Alright.
5902000	5903000	Didn't time as well as I hoped.
5903000	5904000	It was a little bit delayed, but whatever.
5904000	5905000	Soundboard's a little slower.
5905000	5906000	It worked.
5906000	5907000	Alright, final word.
5907000	5909000	Alright, we got plenty more show to come.
5909000	5910000	See, you know what?
5910000	5911000	What?
5911000	5919000	If it was, if we were gonna do our own voiceovers, you know, for our version, it'd be like,
5919000	5921000	Look at that warrior.
5921000	5923000	Bitch, don't shout the food.
5924000	5926000	You shout the food?
5926000	5927000	Bitch?
5927000	5928000	I know, right?
5928000	5929000	Alright, anyhow.
5929000	5930000	We're gonna take a break, guys.
5930000	5932000	When we come back, there is plenty more OLR to come.
5932000	5933000	Lots and lots and lots of news.
5933000	5935000	The FUGO Question of the Week comes back this week.
5935000	5941000	And the emails, FUs of the Week, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on
5941000	5944000	Skype, ORANGE LOUNGE RADIO, at us now so you can get through a little later in the show
5944000	5947000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
5954000	5958000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening.
5958000	5963000	May the 18th, 2014, episode number 553 of our show.
5963000	5964000	And thanks for joining us.
5964000	5968000	You know, whether you're here live or whether you're here via the podcast feed or Stitcher
5968000	5972000	or whatever service it is you use to listen to internet radio shows, we really appreciate
5972000	5973000	your support.
5973000	5974000	And, you know, I do just want to say thank you.
5974000	5977000	You know, earlier in the show, I talked about how we are gonna be covering E3 this year,
5977000	5981000	and it looked a little grim at one point that we might not be able to do that because, you
5981000	5986000	know, the folks at E3, they use some really weird methods to gauge, like, how big sites
5986000	5987000	are.
5987000	5990000	They use Alexa, which I kind of thought, like, didn't Alexa toolbar kind of go out of style
5990000	5991000	with GeoCities?
5991000	5993000	So I always thought that was, like, really weird.
5993000	5997000	But, you know, we were able to kind of show them some other things, like, you know, our
5997000	6001000	ranking on Stitcher and some of the other, you know, ways that, you know, we do kind
6001000	6002000	of have...
6002000	6004000	You do realize we've been doing this for, like, 12 years.
6004000	6005000	They don't care.
6005000	6006000	They don't care, right?
6006000	6007000	It's all about how many people, right?
6007000	6010000	So I just want to say, you know, your guys' support has really helped us be able to do
6010000	6011000	that.
6011000	6012000	So I just want to thank you guys.
6012000	6015000	You know, those of you that have left reviews on Stitcher and iTunes, you know, that really
6016000	6017000	does help.
6017000	6018000	So thank you very much.
6018000	6021000	So, yeah, I hope we make you proud.
6021000	6025000	I don't want to just go to E3 and play everything and then come back the next week and be like,
6025000	6026000	hey, guess what, guys?
6026000	6027000	I just...
6027000	6029000	I played all this stuff at E3 and, oh, this is good and this is good.
6029000	6034000	I kind of hear a lot of that and what I really want is to try and, you know, not everybody
6034000	6037000	does this at E3 because there's just a lot of, like, very publicist types of people.
6037000	6041000	But if there are designers that we are able to connect with, especially...
6041000	6042000	Think of it this way.
6042000	6046000	We probably won't get the AAA people, but we'll probably get the B people, you know,
6046000	6049000	that are kind of in that line between indie and big game.
6049000	6050000	We can probably get those people pretty easy.
6050000	6054000	So if you have questions about the games, we want to take your thoughts directly to
6054000	6055000	those people.
6055000	6056000	It is the Voice of Geeks Network.
6056000	6059000	So we look forward to, you know, presenting your voices at E3.
6059000	6061000	And Oculus does have a booth.
6061000	6062000	They sure do.
6062000	6063000	And you know Bobby's all over that.
6063000	6064000	So...
6064000	6068000	And we will try to be the voice for you guys at E3.
6068000	6070000	So, you know, just appreciate all the support.
6070000	6071000	That's why it's 2.5 people.
6071000	6074000	I'll be playing enough games for all three of us.
6074000	6077000	If you don't have to wait in all these lines and whatever.
6077000	6080000	You can be the designated wait in Nintendo line person.
6080000	6081000	Yeah, right?
6081000	6082000	So I hope you enjoy standing for eight hours.
6082000	6083000	Come on, come on, come on.
6083000	6084000	Get back to this hall.
6084000	6085000	Let's go.
6085000	6086000	Although I can't...
6086000	6088000	I don't imagine what they would be showing that would have such a giant line unless it's
6088000	6089000	like a Zelda...
6089000	6090000	Zelda...
6090000	6093000	A playable Zelda is the only thing I can think of.
6093000	6094000	Smash Brothers.
6094000	6095000	Eh...
6095000	6096000	I don't know.
6096000	6100000	Well, they're having a Smash Brothers tournament, so obviously Smash Brothers is going to be
6100000	6101000	finished.
6101000	6103000	I don't think I'd wait in a huge line to play it.
6103000	6106000	I could watch it and get a pretty good grasp of what's coming.
6106000	6107000	You know what I mean?
6107000	6108000	Probably Zelda.
6108000	6110000	But I'm not going to come on the show and be like, I played it, if I didn't play it.
6110000	6114000	One can dream of a new excite truck that doesn't involve, you know, mini games in the middle
6114000	6115000	of the race.
6115000	6117000	But I think that's just a pipe dream.
6117000	6118000	Hey, but...
6118000	6120000	But if I learn enough programming...
6120000	6121000	Someday.
6121000	6122000	Someday.
6122000	6127000	SSJ100Matt says, fully expect Jason to get my NHL questions answered.
6127000	6129000	So, you better get on that.
6129000	6131000	Yes, there will be an NHL 15.
6131000	6133000	Yes, it will be hockey.
6133000	6135000	Yes, they will update the roster.
6135000	6137000	Yes, there will be fights.
6137000	6139000	Yes, you will be able to customize it.
6139000	6141000	I mean, I don't be the poo-poo.
6141000	6145000	Every year they have refined something to be a lot better.
6145000	6146000	It's just...
6146000	6151000	I don't know, I guess I'm not into the game enough to know what to ask for the next year's game.
6151000	6153000	Yes, there will be a zombie mode.
6153000	6155000	Yes, there will be a puck.
6155000	6156000	A zombie mode.
6157000	6159000	Bochi Kawa in chat at live.fognetwork.com says,
6159000	6161000	the B people tend to be enthusiastic, right?
6161000	6164000	That means good answers instead of form question answers.
6164000	6165000	Absolutely right.
6165000	6167000	So, you know, I don't want to disappoint you guys.
6167000	6170000	If you have questions about the big stuff, we'll try.
6170000	6173000	But I'm just saying, you're going to be more likely to get it from the...
6173000	6176000	Remember that one time we sat down with the Madballs guys?
6176000	6177000	Yeah, they were very cool.
6177000	6179000	We could ask them anything and they would have answered it.
6179000	6182000	So, you know, it's those guys that are going to really want to talk about their games.
6182000	6184000	They need help with the coverage.
6184000	6186000	There's some games that aren't going to need help with the coverage.
6186000	6192000	So they just bring out a press release and everybody copy paste it on their site as exclusive, exclusive, you know, and all this stuff.
6192000	6195000	So, you know, anyway, I don't want to spend too much time on this topic.
6195000	6199000	We'll kind of get into it more as E3 quickly approaches, but I'm looking forward to.
6199000	6201000	And I just want to, again, thank you guys.
6201000	6203000	It wouldn't be possible without your guys' support.
6203000	6207000	So, you know, as we always say at the end of the show, tell a friend or two about the show.
6207000	6208000	That's all we want.
6208000	6210000	And hopefully they have Alexa toolbar installed.
6210000	6213000	I don't see how we can be surprised about what's going to be at E3.
6213000	6216000	I mean, after all, the official E3 roster list came out.
6216000	6218000	So what is up with all that crap?
6218000	6222000	They do this every year and every year some dumb ass falls for it.
6222000	6224000	Oh my God, it leaked out.
6224000	6226000	No, it didn't. It never fucking leaked.
6226000	6231000	No one has on a piece of paper of what is coming out for like everything.
6231000	6233000	That's just stupid. Nobody has that.
6233000	6235000	Yeah, no, nobody has that.
6235000	6237000	Too much. Keep in mind, guys.
6238000	6246000	Nintendo, a few years ago, they wouldn't even tell the people that made the signs what the new Wii was called.
6246000	6250000	It just said, new Nintendo console experience on the signs.
6250000	6252000	Nowhere was the Wii U branding to be found.
6252000	6255000	That's how few people really knew what was going on.
6255000	6259000	So you think they're just going to have some word doc out there that has everything listed?
6259000	6261000	Come on.
6261000	6263000	But it has the header.
6263000	6265000	Oh, it has the logo. It's official.
6265000	6269000	It's an Ariel Black. I mean, you know, how common is that font?
6269000	6271000	Please.
6271000	6275000	Dark Sakura just had a moment where she rolled her eyes to the back of her head.
6275000	6276000	That was awesome.
6276000	6278000	That was Ariel Black.
6280000	6283000	I should have just said Comic Sans and then had to clean up vomit.
6283000	6285000	Papyrus.
6287000	6292000	All right, let's clean up our act a little bit with some rapid fire gaming news.
6292000	6294000	It better all be set in Helvetica.
6295000	6298000	All right, well, Loki, start us off and use a pretty font.
6298000	6304000	A game I actually backed on Kickstarter, Among the Sleep, is actually going to be coming out on PlayStation 4,
6304000	6307000	and it's going to have support for Morpheus.
6307000	6310000	Remember, that's Sony's VR thing.
6310000	6321000	In fact, actually, it makes sense because they have support for Oculus, so why not support for Morpheus,
6321000	6323000	whenever the hell that's coming out.
6323000	6325000	That's pretty interesting. If you're not familiar with Among the Sleep,
6325000	6334000	Among the Sleep is a survival horror game set from the perspective of a toddler.
6334000	6337000	So you're crawling around on the ground and stuff like that,
6337000	6340000	and all this creepy shit happens in your house, and your parents are gone,
6340000	6343000	and you're trying to figure out what's going on.
6343000	6349000	I wonder if it'd have uncontrollable sobbing in it because that's what toddlers do, too.
6349000	6351000	I kind of want to play it.
6351000	6358000	You can walk around, but you're not as fast as you are if you crawl, so that's kind of interesting.
6358000	6361000	I don't know. It looked cool. It looked kind of creepy.
6361000	6368000	The game does sound like a legitimately creepy premise, and you're literally defenseless, probably defenseless.
6368000	6374000	I guess Amnesia was the most popular recent memory game to follow that trend,
6374000	6378000	but to have anything else like that, this game sounds really fun. I'm looking forward to it.
6378000	6382000	Yeah, in fact, they sent me an update the other day about the game, and I never actually checked it.
6382000	6386000	But yeah, it looks cool, so I can't wait to check that out.
6386000	6397000	Also, this weekend, there was the Mario Kart 8 test drive, I guess, at certain, well, 2700 retail GameStop locations.
6397000	6402000	I went to a GameStop just out of complete randomness, and you guys know I don't usually shop there,
6402000	6404000	but I was that bored, okay?
6404000	6406000	We were going to Target, and there was one right next door, and I was like,
6406000	6412000	maybe they've got another buy-two-get-one-free-used game sale, and maybe I could be suckered into it this time.
6412000	6415000	Let's go look. So I go over to GameStop, and then I see the Wii U thing set up,
6415000	6418000	and I'm like, oh yeah, the Mario Kart thing was supposed to be this weekend.
6418000	6421000	I'm like, why is nobody here? And then I look at the thing, and there's nothing.
6421000	6425000	It says pre-order it now, coming out May 30th, but nothing on the thing.
6425000	6429000	Nope, just a normal kiosk that has screenshots and videos.
6429000	6434000	Yeah, I was a little disappointed about that. Way to go, GameStop.
6434000	6437000	Best Buy had no problem having stuff available to play.
6437000	6440000	Actually, are they doing that at Best Buy again?
6440000	6444000	I believe so. Oh, actually, I don't know. I don't know if they did come out and say that yet.
6444000	6447000	I thought they did, because I thought that was, it was Smash Brothers, maybe.
6447000	6450000	Oh, yeah. Yeah, I think they did say that some of that was going to be playable.
6450000	6452000	I think they did come out and say that already.
6452000	6458000	And then also it was confirmed, I guess, that Mario Kart 8 voice chat in lobbies
6458000	6464000	is only going to be in lobbies and only available if you're playing in, well, I'm sorry,
6464000	6468000	it's available in friend-only lobbies.
6468000	6473000	So, I don't know if that means that it's actually in the lobby itself,
6473000	6478000	or only in matches that you have that are private matches with your friends.
6478000	6480000	That's, yeah, I would assume it's just the private matches.
6480000	6483000	And that's, you know what, that's okay, because I don't need to hear the strangers
6483000	6486000	and some of the 12-year-olds that are probably going to be playing the game
6486000	6489000	that'll get on there and go, I'm going to whoop your ass, bitch.
6489000	6492000	Some of that stuff, I don't need to hear it.
6492000	6496000	But it'll be fun when I want to hop online with some of my podcast frenzies
6496000	6501000	over at Koopa Club and Bobby and some of the other people I get to play online games with
6501000	6505000	and hear them all in the lobby. It'll be a lot of fun.
6505000	6508000	Of course, then I'll have to hear Bobby, I'm going to kick your ass, bitch.
6508000	6511000	No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
6511000	6515000	Booby Black Wolf.
6515000	6519000	Yes, that's what I'll do in retaliation. I'll just keep messing up his name. It'll be fun.
6519000	6526000	But also, I guess, they announced that in Smash Bros. they're going to be having
6526000	6530000	female Animal Crossing villager characters that'll be playable.
6530000	6534000	In fact, there's going to be four villager characters available.
6534000	6537000	Two female, two male. So, yay.
6537000	6540000	And I'm sure they control all the same.
6540000	6543000	And why this needed to be an announcement, I don't fucking know,
6543000	6545000	because it's just padding the fucking roster.
6545000	6549000	Well, it's kind of cool, though, that they're using the different skins
6549000	6552000	to make things a little more diverse. I think that's cool.
6552000	6554000	Okay, where's my female Mario, then?
6554000	6558000	Well, see, here's the thing. Mario is a character as a singular.
6558000	6562000	But you do get the Wii Fit trainer as a male. Like, they have that.
6562000	6565000	You know, and they've mixed it up a little bit.
6565000	6568000	I know, it's just, it's dumb. Whatever.
6568000	6572000	I think it's dumb. It's like, okay, cool, let's put out a press.
6572000	6575000	It's not like the OMG News of the Century.
6575000	6578000	There will be different skin colors for the characters.
6578000	6580000	Let's put out a press release for that one.
6580000	6583000	But as far as your weekly Smash Brothers update, it's fine.
6583000	6587000	It's fine. It's not a huge deal, but it's cool.
6587000	6591000	I like how the other male character looks even crazier than the first villager,
6591000	6595000	so maybe there'll be more memes created from it.
6595000	6597000	I wish you'd be able to import your own villager.
6597000	6599000	Now, that would be awesome.
6599000	6603000	Have they announced, can you use your Mii in Smash Brothers?
6603000	6606000	Yeah, no, they haven't announced that.
6607000	6611000	You know, I think amongst all the character wank we've talked about on this show,
6611000	6616000	the whole Pac-Man and everything, the most obvious thing that's sitting right in front of us is your Mii will be in the character.
6616000	6621000	Nope. A Mii doesn't have an obvious moveset where everybody else has a game, a cannon.
6621000	6623000	Unless your Mii is a...
6623000	6625000	Not even gonna go there.
6625000	6627000	Create your own character.
6627000	6631000	Not gonna go there? Well, it's character, but...
6631000	6634000	Because with Miis you can draw a penis on their face if you really want to.
6634000	6637000	But you can play your Mii in Mario Kart, so wanna race my penis kart?
6639000	6641000	I understand that, but I'm just...
6641000	6645000	Things I will only say to Loki one time in my life for $200.
6647000	6648000	It's the Daily Double.
6648000	6651000	Whatever. Cool that they have a female kart.
6651000	6653000	Cool that they're representing all genders.
6653000	6655000	All two genders.
6655000	6657000	There are multiple genders.
6657000	6659000	Oh god, Loki.
6659000	6662000	No, no, I understand that. That's why I said all two genders.
6662000	6665000	Because they're only representing two genders in the game.
6665000	6667000	I didn't say all...
6667000	6669000	It was a highbrow joke.
6669000	6671000	Apparently that went over your head.
6671000	6673000	Maybe because you're sitting down.
6677000	6679000	On the heels of Tomodachi Life.
6679000	6685000	Yes, I'm so ignorant out there that I don't realize that people identify with other genders other than male and female.
6685000	6687000	Gee, really?
6687000	6689000	What year is this? I mean, seriously.
6689000	6691000	Come on.
6691000	6693000	Get with the times, Nintendo.
6693000	6695000	I'm just saying.
6695000	6697000	Yes, okay.
6697000	6701000	And if you want, I mean, they kinda look like dolls anyway, so they're not really...
6701000	6703000	It's a skin, okay?
6703000	6705000	It's a skeleton of a character with a skin.
6706000	6708000	Loki, next time, just come out and say,
6708000	6710000	you can play a female Animal Crossing villager.
6710000	6712000	Woohoo. And then done. You're done.
6712000	6715000	No! Here's what they need to do.
6715000	6717000	I'm sorry, here's what they need to do.
6717000	6719000	Instead of just playing as the villagers.
6719000	6722000	They need to fucking have all the characters from Animal Crossing in it.
6722000	6724000	Like, all the different villagers.
6724000	6727000	Because you want Jamie to be able to kick the living shit out of Ed, for real.
6727000	6728000	Yeah, exactly.
6728000	6730000	And punch that diva bitch in the face.
6730000	6732000	Because that would be awesome.
6732000	6734000	Alright, anyhow.
6734000	6736000	You know how they have the Pokeballs and stuff?
6736000	6740000	They should have a hole you can dig in the ground and dig somebody up or something.
6740000	6741000	Jason, please help.
6741000	6742000	You have to dig up Resetti.
6742000	6744000	Jason, save us.
6744000	6746000	Dig up Resetti? Well, I guess I get it.
6746000	6749000	And then he yells at the other person until they fall off the screen.
6749000	6750000	He's an assist character.
6750000	6753000	Continuing on with the Nintendo news,
6753000	6756000	brings word that Nintendo of America has updated its rewards
6756000	6758000	for you to spend your hard-earned coins.
6758000	6761000	You know, I've been maxed out since I started walking after getting back home.
6761000	6764000	I have been maxed out at 300 coins for a very, very long time.
6764000	6768000	And I'm never going to use this on the StreetPass minigames.
6768000	6770000	Why the hell don't I pick myself up a game?
6770000	6772000	That would just be genius.
6772000	6777000	And on that note, what I can pick up this month with said hard-earned coins
6777000	6782000	is the Super Metroid on the Wii U specifically for 200 coins.
6782000	6785000	Kirby's Adventure for the 3DS on 200 coins.
6785000	6788000	These are all, of course, virtual console games.
6788000	6791000	You can pick them up on the platform that I'm listing.
6791000	6794000	So on the Wii U, you can pick up Super Metroid for 200 coins.
6794000	6799000	On the Wii or the Wii U, you can pick up Mario Kart 64 for 250.
6799000	6802000	And on the Nintendo 3DS, Kirby's Adventure for 200 coins
6802000	6805000	and Brain Age Express for 200 coins.
6805000	6807000	Wasn't that bundled on...
6807000	6808000	Kirby time.
6808000	6810000	That was DSI. That wasn't 3DS. Never mind.
6810000	6811000	Dart Tetsuya is saying,
6811000	6813000	wait, you can use the pedometer coins on Nintendo rewards?
6813000	6814000	Is that not the same thing?
6814000	6815000	Oh, no, it's not.
6815000	6817000	Sorry. Oh, sorry.
6817000	6821000	I just get a 3DS and stick it in a paint shaker forever.
6821000	6823000	You only get 10 coins a day, isn't it?
6823000	6825000	No, no, you're mixing up the coins with what you get at Club Nintendo.
6825000	6828000	With the rewards where you register the code in the box.
6828000	6830000	My bad. I am so sorry.
6830000	6832000	This is why he's 0.5.
6832000	6834000	I'm just kidding.
6834000	6836000	I'm kidding.
6836000	6838000	I'm being a bitch. I'm kidding.
6838000	6840000	Yes. Yes, you are.
6840000	6842000	He's a stupid bitch.
6843000	6844000	You know, it's funny.
6844000	6848000	I had that misconception like a year and a half ago,
6848000	6852000	and because I never actually went to buy anything, it just stuck.
6852000	6857000	Well, maybe Nintendo needs to explore other forms of currency
6857000	6859000	than that same 8-bit coin they've had.
6859000	6861000	They're not going to let you have games.
6861000	6864000	What about rupees? Can't one be coins and one be rupees? Come on.
6864000	6867000	Rupees representing dollars and coins representing coins.
6867000	6869000	Alright, next story.
6869000	6870000	Fine.
6870000	6873000	Fine. Continuing on the Nintendo news, as I said,
6873000	6876000	and taking it to E3, as we speculated.
6876000	6879000	Nintendo is going to hold two developer discussions.
6879000	6882000	The first one, perhaps unsurprisingly, for the new Smash Brothers,
6882000	6886000	and a second, as of yet, unannounced 3D title
6886000	6890000	will be discussed specifically on June 11th.
6890000	6892000	And then, of course, June 10th is going to be a developer discussion
6892000	6894000	involving Super Smash Brothers.
6894000	6896000	What could it be?
6896000	6898000	Who knows? We'll find out in like two and a half weeks.
6899000	6902000	Well, I have this document here, and it's printed in papyrus,
6902000	6905000	so you know it's legit with a Nintendo logo on it.
6905000	6908000	And it says it's going to be Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2.
6910000	6913000	You know that's a legit thing on one of those rumored documents.
6913000	6915000	Yeah, back in 99.
6915000	6918000	You know what? If that was going to be the case,
6918000	6922000	because if you think about it, the first one was Dracula X.
6922000	6926000	In Japan, not turning the moonlight was called XX.
6926000	6929000	So if we were going to continue the X series,
6929000	6934000	we would have a Kumato Dracula XXX,
6934000	6936000	which would have extra succubus action.
6936000	6938000	Of course, we're going to all feel like fucking assholes
6938000	6940000	if this turns out to be true.
6940000	6943000	I'm not going to feel like an asshole because I didn't condone or deny it.
6943000	6947000	You give very good evidence as to why they would not call it
6947000	6950000	Symphony of the Night 2. You're right. Symphony of the Night was too.
6950000	6953000	It would have another name of something.
6953000	6955000	It would be, okay, we had Rondo of Blood,
6955000	6958000	we had Nocturne in the Moonlight, or Symphony of the Night.
6958000	6960000	So it would have...
6960000	6962000	Let's call it We Love Bram Stoker and get it over with.
6962000	6964000	Dance in the Dark with Lady Gaga.
6964000	6967000	Yeah, Dance in the Dark with Lady Gaga would be replacing Shaft.
6969000	6976000	It would be a brand new game in the lines of, what was it, Winx?
6976000	6979000	Where they're going to be sparkle vampires, so yeah.
6980000	6982000	Moving right along.
6982000	6984000	Wait, comment from the chatroom.
6984000	6986000	Come on, we love the chatters.
6986000	6988000	Live.vognetwork.com.
6988000	6990000	Dark Tetsuya says, Symphony of the Night 2.
6990000	6992000	Yeah, not without Koji Igarashi, they're not.
6992000	6996000	Look, again, I don't want to give credit to this rumor,
6996000	6999000	but that's the time when they do that shit,
6999000	7002000	is when it's like, oh, so-and-so's not here to stop me.
7002000	7004000	Bitch, it's on.
7004000	7006000	So I just, like, yeah.
7006000	7008000	Oh, Ikuma JP.
7008000	7010000	Alright, moving on.
7010000	7012000	regulate x Triple X.
7012000	7015000	BMX Triple X, that's what Dracula Triple X was.
7015000	7020000	See, it would be Maria running around naked with an even worse accent.
7020000	7022000	Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
7023000	7025000	That's what it would be.
7026000	7028000	That's just because she swallowed.
7028000	7030000	Ah, let's go to the next story.
7030000	7032000	Please.
7032000	7034000	A recent and ongoing chick.
7034000	7036000	Rob. Rob!
7036000	7038000	Get a hold of yourself over there.
7038000	7045000	A recent and ongoing charity event for deployed Marines and other enlisted servicemen,
7045000	7052000	Operation Supply Drop, which gives games to servicemen and women deployed overseas.
7052000	7061000	And in an unfortunate, unsurprising article, in all of 26 minutes, the website was brought down by attackers.
7061000	7067000	Because, so that the direct route going to operationsupplydrop.com is obviously,
7067000	7073000	could be impacted at times, but they do have a Facebook account you can go to,
7073000	7080000	and their address that you can donate, that you can make PayPal donations to is donations at operationsupplydrop.com,
7080000	7082000	if you feel so inclined.
7082000	7087000	You can go to PayPal, which presumably will not be down, and send money directly to that address,
7087000	7096000	and help out, because of all of the things to attack, attacking people whose primary connection,
7096000	7105000	not to their loved ones, is actually the new releases going on back home, is certainly a worthwhile event to contribute to.
7105000	7108000	And this is taking games that they're sending to military folks?
7108000	7109000	Yeah.
7109000	7113000	So, these guys are out there fighting for your freedom, your freedom to troll, basically,
7113000	7117000	and your freedom to be an asshole, and those are the guys you're going to go after.
7117000	7120000	Like, what a bunch of fucking cowards.
7120000	7127000	So the interesting thing about this one is that the article is particularly small, and I don't think anybody's claimed responsibility.
7127000	7134000	This is very, very quickly, likely, overseas hacktivism.
7134000	7139000	Like, these aren't United States trolls, but they're people that, whether in our country or not,
7139000	7142000	are probably causing this to happen, as are you.
7142000	7145000	A very logical answer, unfortunately.
7145000	7147000	Or people that are in the West that are mad.
7147000	7149000	A very shitty, but logical answer.
7149000	7150000	Yeah.
7150000	7151000	So.
7151000	7152000	Help them out.
7152000	7154000	Everybody deserves to play the game.
7154000	7160000	Everybody should be able to play the games they want to, and if you're willing to help out, absolutely do so.
7160000	7163000	Alright, there's Sakura.
7163000	7168000	Well, we have a few things, if they would ever load.
7169000	7171000	So, um.
7173000	7175000	God, I hate this.
7175000	7176000	Sorry about that.
7176000	7179000	I'm going to go to the ones that actually do load.
7179000	7184000	There is a confirmed game called Pokemon Art Academy.
7184000	7189000	And it's basically, from what I can see, it's drawing Pokemans.
7189000	7192000	Learn to draw Pokemans.
7192000	7196000	How hard can it be to draw a Jigglypuff? Christ.
7196000	7198000	Even I could probably draw a Jigglypuff.
7198000	7200000	That swirl is difficult to get straight.
7200000	7204000	The swirl is a poly-whirl, Jason. God damn it, learn your Pokemon.
7204000	7207000	Jigglypuff has the little hair swirl.
7207000	7209000	Jigglypuff.
7209000	7212000	Anyway, also, um.
7212000	7214000	I'll never admit I'm wrong.
7214000	7223000	Kim Jong-un, who is the current asshole in charge of North Korea, is in a side-scrolling shooter game called Glorious Leader.
7223000	7225000	Tell us how you really feel.
7225000	7228000	Well, his dad was probably a bigger asshole.
7228000	7233000	And it's supposed to be released on PC and mobile devices.
7233000	7237000	But it actually has him and Dennis Rodman.
7237000	7242000	Who are the main characters.
7242000	7247000	The Glorious Leader there is on a unicorn and shoots down paratroopers.
7247000	7249000	And...
7249000	7251000	Why do they have to make him awesome?
7251000	7253000	Like, he rides on a unicorn.
7253000	7255000	Like, that's awesome. Why do you have to make him awesome?
7255000	7257000	I think it's a big parody.
7257000	7259000	Do you know who should be in that game? Me.
7259000	7262000	I'll be Glorious Leader.
7262000	7264000	I'm not as big of an asshole.
7264000	7271000	Also, Gung-ho is bringing out six more Japanese PS1 classics to the PlayStation Network.
7271000	7275000	And I hate the way these sites load on my iPad.
7275000	7279000	But there will be Sarara's Little Shop.
7280000	7284000	That's basically what Wrecked Here was before there was Wrecked Here.
7284000	7287000	Tokyo 23-ku Safe-ku War.
7287000	7292000	It's in a world where school uniforms have been banned.
7292000	7298000	There's Dragon Beat Legend of Pinball, Heroin Dream 1, 2, and Neo Planet.
7298000	7300000	So there you go.
7300000	7302000	All right.
7302000	7304000	Destructoid Fix Your Webpage.
7304000	7306000	Make it mobile-friendly.
7307000	7312000	There's a lot of sites out there that need a little help in the mobile department, isn't there?
7312000	7316000	There's so many people that view things on tablets these days, too, you know?
7316000	7318000	All right.
7318000	7323000	We are going to go over to our Facebook and our Google Plus fan communities.
7323000	7325000	And go to our question of the week.
7325000	7329000	When you take Facebook and Google Plus and slam them together, you get foogle.
7329000	7333000	Or, starting next week, the fwitch question of the week.
7333000	7346000	On this week's fwitch question of the week, we asked about rumors.
7346000	7351000	Rumors and scuttlebutt and things overheard in a hair salon.
7351000	7354000	It is about E3.
7354000	7359000	So, E3 is just around the corner, which kicks off a flood of E3 rumors en masse.
7359000	7366000	One such rumor, which we gave our listeners, was the story about the Halo 1 through 4 compilation that Loki talked about earlier in the show.
7366000	7371000	There's also another rumor involving a Nintendo lineup and, you know, big games for all the companies.
7371000	7373000	So, which rumors do you believe?
7373000	7377000	Are there any E3 rumors that you are positive are true at this moment?
7377000	7379000	Why?
7379000	7381000	So let's see what the listeners have to say about E3 rumors.
7381000	7386000	So going to the Facebook, or as we call it now, Foculus.
7387000	7394000	Going to Foculus, we have Andy R, who quite simply says, and even got some likes for this, Andy R just puts it bluntly,
7394000	7400000	I believe none, none shall pass.
7400000	7404000	I take every E3 rumor with a bag of salt.
7404000	7410000	Awesome Unicorn says, I treat E3 rumors like fan fiction.
7410000	7411000	Totally fun.
7411000	7416000	Awesome Unicorn being written by Kim Jong Un.
7416000	7417000	Dennis Rodman.
7417000	7419000	That's an awkward visual. Let's not go there.
7419000	7427000	Alright, totally fun to think about, but reality starts to seem too boring if you spend too much time on them.
7427000	7429000	That's one of my favorite answers ever.
7429000	7432000	Blood Drunk says, E3 2014.
7432000	7434000	Gavin rolls on stage.
7434000	7436000	Giant Orange 3 appears in the background.
7436000	7438000	Crowd tenses up.
7438000	7444000	People burst into tears of joy as Gabe announces Half Life 3, part of the Orange Box 2,
7444000	7450000	which includes Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, Hat Fortress 3, and Ricochet 2.
7450000	7452000	Gavin drops the mic and walks away.
7452000	7453000	Gaben.
7453000	7454000	I always say Gaben.
7454000	7458000	I know it's Gabe Newell, but I just say Gaben, because I think of Yo Gabba Gabba.
7458000	7459000	I don't know, it's just weird.
7459000	7462000	I thought you were thinking of What's His Face from...
7462000	7464000	I'm not going to think of the band.
7464000	7466000	Blood Drunk says, I want to believe.
7466000	7472000	You know, wasn't that the winner of our, and we'll do this in two weeks,
7472000	7476000	we'll do our annual list list of E3 Rumor I want to come true.
7476000	7483000	And last year we had, Gaben or whatever comes out on stage and says, Half Life 3 available on Steam now.
7483000	7484000	Drops the mic.
7484000	7486000	Alright, here you go.
7486000	7493000	To kind of go back to what we were talking about earlier, about that ridiculous dream scenario, it's Sony.
7493000	7500000	So you have Jack Trenton on there, you have the actor playing Kevin Butler,
7500000	7507000	and then Gabe Newell walks out on stage, says, not only will Half Life 3 be on Steam,
7507000	7509000	but it will also be exclusive to the PlayStation 4.
7509000	7513000	They all jump in the air, do a high five, slow motion, done.
7513000	7515000	And then they make out awkwardly.
7515000	7517000	Okay, you had to take it there.
7517000	7526000	Alright, Red the Haze, it's like a congratulatory thing, like the European soccer players do.
7526000	7529000	It's like the MTV Music Awards.
7529000	7534000	And then Christina Aguilera comes out and talks about how we're all going to get dirty.
7534000	7540000	Alright, Red the Haze over on Focculus says, not really a rumor,
7541000	7547000	but I am all conspiracy theorist mode with a lot of signs point Sony announcing support for the Vita and Vita TV at E3.
7547000	7551000	By signs, I mean references to Vita TV support for games like Killzone Merc,
7551000	7555000	timing of PS4 remote play on Vita TV recently coming out,
7555000	7559000	cheap $30 pricing for a first-party title like Freedom Wars on Amazon,
7559000	7563000	and even that recent enabling of all PS1 and PSP titles on Vita.
7563000	7566000	Of course, I'm taking it with a grain of salt, but I'm optimistic.
7566000	7570000	I'm optimistic too, Red the Haze. That seems very logical that would happen.
7570000	7572000	I'd rather be Optimus Prime than optimistic.
7574000	7580000	Nemesis 47 says, I'm seeing all the rumors from Sony. Among them I'm hoping isn't true is God of War 4.
7580000	7585000	A fourth game isn't needed since part three ended on a good and sensible note that made sense,
7585000	7587000	and a part four to the game isn't needed.
7587000	7591000	Halo is knocking down your door saying, what up?
7591000	7595000	Because you could say the same thing about the Halo franchise, but they did it anyway.
7595000	7600000	Not to discount your opinion though, because I understand when you kind of want a developer to just,
7600000	7605000	it's time to stop and move on to something else, but I'm sure there'll be an Uncharted 4 as well.
7605000	7610000	I'm still holding hope for Beyond Good and Evil 2 since that game needs a part two.
7610000	7613000	I'm also hoping for a new Hitman, news on Kingdom Hearts 3.
7613000	7615000	Ooh, that's one we're not talking about enough.
7615000	7618000	I'd like to see some Kingdom Hearts 3, a little more of that.
7618000	7619000	That's because Final Fantasy 15.
7619000	7621000	That's because we're still waiting for the HD remake of the second one.
7621000	7624000	Ooh, do you think Final Fantasy 15 will be playable on the show floor?
7624000	7628000	Oh, my body is ready.
7628000	7630000	Speaking of making out awkwardly.
7630000	7634000	And news on WWE 2K15.
7634000	7637000	Those are our answers from Facebook.
7637000	7642000	So let's go over to Twitch Plus and some of the answers over there.
7642000	7644000	To ActDeft Plus?
7644000	7648000	Well, we do have our first answer from ActDeft, GoogleDeft, who says,
7648000	7652000	I try not to believe any rumors out there unless they're truly from a trusted source that I know of,
7652000	7654000	but I can't help to get excited for some of them,
7654000	7661000	like the supposed list of titles shown for Nintendo Digital Event thing that features GameCube Virtual Console titles.
7661000	7663000	Granted, the list was too awesome to be true,
7663000	7667000	but it did get me excited for a slim chance to see something like that on Nintendo's side.
7667000	7669000	To play Devil's Advocate for a minute, though,
7669000	7672000	like, why the fuck not would GameCube games not show up on Virtual Console?
7672000	7674000	It's a logical conclusion.
7674000	7676000	Can't Wii U games play Wii games?
7676000	7677000	Yes.
7677000	7679000	Couldn't the Wii play GameCube games?
7679000	7681000	Because they've been using the same hardware for like ten years now.
7681000	7684000	But, I mean, couldn't it happen easily?
7684000	7687000	The excuse might be that it's emulating an emulator.
7687000	7690000	Um, you know, I don't know...
7690000	7691000	But I'm telling you...
7691000	7693000	I think it should be feasible, they're pretty close.
7693000	7698000	People forget, F-Zero was like, it wasn't true HD, but it was progressive scan,
7698000	7700000	and it looked really fucking good.
7700000	7705000	Or just re-release the GameCube games like they did with the new Wii control things,
7705000	7713000	but just do like some new HD thing where they upscale older titles like F-Zero, GX.
7713000	7716000	Maybe not Mario Kart Double Dash, because one, it's Mario Kart Double Dash,
7716000	7723000	and two, Mario Kart 8's coming out, but, you know, release them, re-release them.
7723000	7727000	At least they would pad their release schedule, that would help them a little bit.
7727000	7730000	If I remember correctly, GameCube support is...
7730000	7731000	Excuse me.
7731000	7737000	GameCube support is not possible natively, but it's because it's just a part of the Wii.
7737000	7743000	Homebrew unlocked it within months of the Wii U's release, if not much, much quicker than that.
7757000	7758000	I got the truth.
7761000	7764000	I heard Jennifer about Sally and Brad getting together at the Winter Formal.
7764000	7766000	Aren't they just totes adorbs?
7766000	7771000	Also, I heard Jennifer Aniston's pregnant and getting married, or is not pregnant, or just broke up with Brad.
7771000	7773000	Isn't that sad, funny, tragic, awesome?
7773000	7775000	Yeah, I don't put much stock in rumors.
7775000	7780000	The only rumors I listened to was by Fleetwood Mac in 1976.
7780000	7783000	Best answer to Andon, thank you very much.
7783000	7785000	Great answers there.
7785000	7790000	From our Focculus and Twitch Plus communities.
7790000	7797000	If you want to pay attention for future questions, check us out over on Facebook.com or Google Plus, of course.
7797000	7799000	Alright, let's move on.
7799000	7801000	What about our answers?
7801000	7802000	Oh, do you have some answers? Yes?
7802000	7803000	No.
7803000	7805000	My answer is green.
7805000	7808000	I think the Fleetwood Mac rumors answer is good enough.
7808000	7810000	That's a good enough note to end on.
7810000	7812000	It is a great enough note to end on.
7812000	7814000	Now Rhiannon is stuck in my head.
7815000	7820000	I need to get rock-banned out. We're going to play a Don't Stop after the show.
7820000	7823000	Alright, Loki, let's get back into some news.
7823000	7828000	Alright, so it's another week, so another lawsuit.
7828000	7832000	And this time, of course, Nintendo is being targeted again.
7832000	7843000	It is due to, I guess, a complaint by Philips, patent 379, Virtual Body Control Device.
7843000	7851000	And I guess they're saying the Wii, the Wii Remote Plus controller, Wii Remote controller, Wii Nunchuck,
7851000	7862000	MotionPlus, Balance Board, Wii U, Wii U Gamepad, and Wii Mini, all infringing on that.
7862000	7874000	And I guess they sent a notice back in December of 2011 and provided Nintendo with, I guess, Nintendo's null,
7874000	7877000	or with the evidence that they were infringing on that.
7877000	7882000	And now, I guess, there's a second instance of that.
7882000	7888000	Was it user... I hate these really, like, generic patents.
7888000	7891000	User interface system based on pointing devices.
7893000	7894000	Okay.
7895000	7899000	And their infringement has been deliberate and willful, apparently.
7899000	7901000	And so now they're seeking trial by jury.
7902000	7903000	That's dumb.
7903000	7904000	That's dumb.
7904000	7908000	They're just mad because those Philips CDI games didn't turn out very well.
7910000	7911000	That's what I think.
7913000	7916000	This little lawsuit is awfully late.
7916000	7920000	Like, isn't there, like, limitations on how... I mean, I guess there's not.
7920000	7922000	But usually more than a decade.
7922000	7923000	Like, come on!
7923000	7925000	This seems very desperate.
7925000	7928000	And it is kind of amusing that it's Philips, considering the history.
7928000	7932000	But even outside of that, it's like, how many people have tried to sue Nintendo over the Wii, and did any of them win?
7932000	7934000	Actually, I take that back. I think one of them did.
7934000	7936000	There was the one that was suing everybody over their controllers.
7936000	7939000	I just... well, the whole power system's all messed up anyways.
7939000	7943000	The fact that you can, you know, patent things like, you know, whatever this...
7943000	7945000	User interface system based on pointing devices.
7945000	7950000	Like a computer with a mouse that's existed in a concept since the fucking 70s.
7952000	7957000	There's even a buddy of mine, a co-worker of mine, has a TV that you actually...
7958000	7965000	I don't know where the camera is, but you take the remote, and if you pull the trigger, you actually get a pointing device.
7965000	7967000	Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure it's a Philips.
7967000	7972000	It could be a Sharp or something like that, but shockingly, you have a remote, you point it to the screen,
7972000	7979000	and a little finger shows up that allows you to choose the smart TV elements, and change your features, and toggle settings.
7979000	7984000	Yeah. So, I don't know. I don't know if they're gonna... I doubt they're gonna win.
7984000	7988000	And it's not gonna, like, stop the sales of, you know, the Wii or anything.
7988000	7995000	If anything that stops the sales of Wii U, it's gonna be the lack of games on the console, or the fact that it's underpowered, or that, you know, other stuff.
7996000	8003000	Alright. Well, moving on to a game that was actually our Classic Game of the Week a few weeks ago when Shane was with us.
8003000	8008000	Dark Soccer wasn't. And then Loki loves this game and wishes it would go free.
8008000	8012000	Well, I do have some news about Final Fantasy XI for its 12th anniversary.
8012000	8017000	The game is going to be... getting a new update. Not going free, sorry.
8017000	8025000	However, on May 15th, a new patch is coming out to Final Fantasy XI that will be adding new weapons, missions, a new campaign, and more.
8025000	8030000	There's a whole teaser video out there, which apparently just shows some of the stuff in the game.
8030000	8034000	I know Shane was getting really excited about this, so it's pretty cool.
8034000	8040000	Some of the add-ons, I guess, are now free, like the Visions of Abyssia and the Heroes of Abyssia.
8040000	8047000	You can access all this content if you have the expansions with Rise of the Zilert and Wings of the Goddess, so that's pretty cool.
8047000	8055000	So there's a lot to still experience in the game for a pretty low cost, but it does still have a monthly fee, which does continue to be the barrier for some people to do it.
8055000	8061000	Yeah, like I think the base game now, like with all the expansions, is like $10. It's like super cheap.
8061000	8064000	Super cheap. A lot of MMOs are pretty cheap to get into.
8064000	8075000	Unless you get 30 days free, so it's almost cheaper to buy the game over and over and over again, except they don't let you do that, unfortunately.
8075000	8077000	What's the subscription on it now?
8077000	8080000	On XI? Oh, same as it always was.
8080000	8085000	Well, it didn't go up, but no MMOs have that I can think of.
8085000	8092000	They just think of other ways to get money, like Warcraft will start selling you cosmetic armor or something, you know?
8093000	8098000	Alright. Well, there you go if you want to check that out in Final Fantasy XI.
8098000	8100000	Dark Soccer.
8100000	8111000	Well, this is a good thing. I don't know how many people have heard of Women in Games International, but basically it's an advocacy group, and they've just announced the new members on their advisory board.
8112000	8117000	There's a statement that's said by their president and CEO, Belinda VanSickle.
8117000	8122000	Everyone involved with WIGI is passionate about making the video games industry more inclusive.
8122000	8127000	We have all amazing ideas about outreach programs we can create to make that happen.
8127000	8132000	So, basically, just some of the different people on here.
8132000	8138000	There are people that have been in the industry for a while, but the big thing to take from this, too,
8138000	8146000	is that it's a group that I think definitely more gamers need to support, need to participate in their outreach programs,
8146000	8151000	need to bring more out so that we can see more inclusiveness and equality in games.
8156000	8159000	And the men in the room are quiet.
8159000	8164000	Well, to be fair, I was multitasking a little bit, as I sometimes do during the show, so I apologize.
8164000	8167000	I was also kind of reading our chat room to see if they were saying anything on it,
8167000	8173000	but I think they're still hung up on some of the 3DS versus 2DS and some of the emulation stuff that's going on there.
8173000	8175000	Oh, I'm sorry a woman was talking. I guess no one was listening.
8175000	8177000	It's delayed. 45 seconds. Stop it.
8177000	8179000	I'm jumping, Rob.
8179000	8180000	All right.
8180000	8183000	But there is actually a good quote from one of the new board members.
8183000	8187000	This is Wesley. I'm trying to see if I can find her name through the list.
8187000	8192000	But she says, I want to continue the support of inclusion within the global gaming community,
8192000	8196000	and I admire WIGI as an organization that does just that.
8196000	8201000	And if you want to find out about them more, it's GetWIGI.com.
8201000	8203000	You can learn more about the group.
8203000	8209000	Well, and I see that part of their mission is to promote diversity and so forth,
8209000	8211000	and obviously that's a good thing.
8211000	8216000	We need more diversity in all different aspects of the gaming industry, absolutely.
8216000	8219000	Oh, God. What?
8219000	8223000	So they have this advisory board. Will it be the WIGI board?
8223000	8227000	Actually, probably. That's clever.
8227000	8229000	Except it doesn't steal your soul.
8229000	8233000	Like, I want to punch you in the face, but that was actually really smart, so I can't.
8233000	8237000	It doesn't. They don't steal souls. They add souls to the gaming industry.
8237000	8238000	Good call.
8238000	8240000	What do you think, though? I mean, in all seriousness,
8240000	8244000	I'm going to ask a tough question that you might not like Dark Sakura, but I've got to ask this.
8244000	8247000	What can an advisory board really do?
8247000	8249000	Okay, so they get together and they form up and they say, we're going to promote this.
8249000	8251000	What can they really do?
8251000	8256000	Well, if developers actually give a shit about women, they'll speak with the advocacy groups.
8256000	8260000	Say, hey, here's our idea. This is what we're going to put in this.
8260000	8264000	Do you have any input? What can we do to improve?
8264000	8271000	And on top of that, they're doing things besides just acting as an advisory board.
8271000	8274000	They're doing sponsorships.
8274000	8277000	They're actually having a party at E3 this year.
8277000	8285000	They have a female game artist for Google Hangouts as an industry discussion.
8285000	8290000	So they're not just doing things, you know, they're putting the word out there.
8290000	8294000	They're making sure that the idea stays public, and they're educating people out there.
8294000	8300000	There's even actually a Girl Scout patch that they've created for girl gamers.
8300000	8302000	It looks like a Zelda heart.
8302000	8304000	Now, that's kind of cool.
8304000	8310000	Like, at a younger age, kind of get people thinking like, you know, this is a career option for you.
8310000	8313000	You can do this. That's pretty cool, I got to say.
8313000	8317000	They have another group that's called DLC Events, Drinks, Lectures, and Community
8317000	8324000	that they do quarterly to create, you know, just discussion about what's going on in the industry
8324000	8330000	in, you know, a really, I guess, laid-back arena.
8330000	8336000	There's also another group called Women and Men where, and I'm trying to see exactly where this is located.
8336000	8342000	Okay, this is on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles and another one in San Francisco at Julian's Billiard Club.
8342000	8347000	They do this the first Monday of every month from 7 to 9 with Happy Hour
8347000	8351000	where you basically meet and talk about, you know, business.
8351000	8356000	It's just a casual place to talk about the industry.
8356000	8359000	You said Julien's or Julien's?
8359000	8361000	Julien's Billiard Club.
8361000	8363000	Okay, then I don't know where that is, but there's a place.
8363000	8365000	4th Street, San Francisco.
8365000	8366000	Then they got the name wrong.
8366000	8368000	Yeah, they got the name wrong. It's Julien's.
8368000	8369000	That's the Metreon.
8369000	8371000	Yeah, right next to the Metreon has like eight tables.
8371000	8374000	I'm just reading up the thing because the only place I go to over there is the Metreon.
8374000	8384000	For the folks in LA, the place is Bubsy's West, 3110 Santa Monica Boulevard.
8384000	8388000	Again, that's the first Monday of every month from 7 to 9
8388000	8393000	for people in the industry to get together and talk about what's going on in games.
8393000	8396000	Raven's Dolphin in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
8396000	8403000	I like the Girl Scout patch. My sister is a pack mother, but my nieces suck at games, so they're out.
8403000	8406000	Well, you know what? All the scouts can't do everything.
8406000	8409000	You guys know this. I was actually a Cub Scout.
8409000	8416000	I was a Cub Scout, and I got patches too, but I didn't get patches for football or any of the sports-related ones.
8416000	8420000	My patches were like, I don't know. Do they get patches for...
8420000	8421000	Riptieing.
8421000	8428000	Actually, you know what I did? They used to have these little events where you would build the little cars,
8428000	8431000	and they would race them. They'd have the Derby, and then there's the boats.
8431000	8432000	Like the pine...
8432000	8433000	Pine wood Derby.
8433000	8436000	Pine wood Derby, those things. That was the stuff I would get into, actually.
8436000	8438000	So I probably had badges for that.
8438000	8440000	There's an old man in our chat room now.
8440000	8441000	Is there really?
8441000	8442000	There is.
8442000	8447000	By the way, I saw Grandpa join the chat room, and I did want to just give a quick happy birthday shout-out to Grandpa.
8447000	8452000	He turned 68 over the past... No, he's 34. But he turned 34...
8452000	8457000	I can't wait till he's 37, because then I can give him the year of jokes that I had in a row.
8457000	8461000	But he celebrated today, even though his birthday was a couple days ago.
8461000	8464000	Actually, if I can make another congratulations.
8464000	8470000	And I know a few of them may be listening, so to the adult B'nai Mitzvah class of Temple Orishon Mazel Tov.
8470000	8472000	Mazel Tov!
8472000	8475000	To hit major milestones at a later age.
8475000	8476000	Alright.
8476000	8477000	Yeah.
8477000	8481000	To which I got a nice hearty fuck you ginger in return.
8481000	8485000	Well, you know what? Undo those birthday wishes. I hope your birthday sucked, Grandpa.
8485000	8489000	I hope it absolutely was awful. I hope that food thing you went to today, I hope you get diarrhea.
8489000	8491000	Bobby had his wriggling day.
8492000	8497000	That's right, Bobby Blackwell had a birthday last Monday.
8497000	8500000	And apparently Ron Charles is coming up.
8500000	8504000	But see, here's the thing with Bobby. He chose to stop having birthdays at the age of 29.
8504000	8506000	So no more birthday for you.
8506000	8509000	That's why I'm calling them wriggling days. Because of Homestuck.
8509000	8511000	Oh my god, everybody's having birthdays.
8511000	8513000	It's his sixth 29th birthday.
8513000	8517000	Rama is turning 36 on Saturday. Everybody's having a stinking birthday.
8517000	8520000	Yeah, well my birthday was last month and that was the most important.
8521000	8523000	Alright. Loki.
8523000	8528000	Actually, one thing to see y'all. My husband also gets white hairs in his beard. He makes me pluck them.
8528000	8530000	I've exposed this now on the internet.
8530000	8532000	You pluck mine too?
8532000	8534000	No, I'm not marrying you.
8534000	8535000	And now you know.
8535000	8537000	No more you know.
8537000	8538000	Alright.
8538000	8540000	Grand Theft Auto 5.
8540000	8545000	So back when we last checked on Grand Theft Auto 5, it was selling a ton of copies.
8545000	8548000	And it's still selling tons of copies.
8548000	8552000	In fact, it has sold 33 million units.
8552000	8554000	So that's a lot of copies.
8554000	8560000	And Rockstar is promising a next-gen release this fiscal year.
8560000	8565000	So they will have a next-gen game sometime between now and March 2015.
8565000	8575000	If I were to be a betting man, which I am, I'm going to say that it's probably going to be Grand Theft Auto 5 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8575000	8577000	And on PC.
8578000	8582000	Just saying. I think that's possibly what it's going to be.
8582000	8584000	I think that's definitely what it's going to be.
8584000	8586000	Yeah. Just guess.
8586000	8590000	But then again, I'm just some random dude on Twitter.
8590000	8592000	You're just some dude. You don't know what the hell you're talking about.
8592000	8593000	I don't know anything.
8593000	8595000	That's right.
8595000	8600000	And then of course, Take-Two had a pretty good fiscal year.
8600000	8604000	And one billion dollars in revenue.
8604000	8611000	In fact, it was a net revenue of 2.35 billion for fiscal 2014.
8611000	8620000	And with a 94% growth in revenue over its last year, which was 1.21 billion dollars.
8620000	8622000	So, not bad.
8622000	8626000	And it would be interesting to see what else they have come out of this year.
8626000	8629000	God damn it! And put out the god damn Grand Theft Auto 5 single-player patch.
8629000	8631000	I'm ready for that.
8631000	8633000	We need some more content there.
8633000	8637000	Not necessarily online. Because I've kind of given up online for now.
8637000	8639000	TigerClaw in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com asks,
8639000	8642000	What if Rockstar announces a new Red Dead Redemption?
8642000	8644000	I'd still be fine with that. That's a win-win too.
8644000	8646000	No complaints?
8646000	8649000	I just think that Grand Theft Auto 5 is incredibly popular.
8649000	8652000	And that it's kind of...
8652000	8657000	They have the higher quality assets because they've kind of showed those off in screenshots and everything.
8657000	8661000	So, it's kind of a given that they're going to probably do that.
8661000	8668000	But yes, I could see them later on coming out with a Red Dead Redemption 2 with an improved version of the engine that they're running right now.
8668000	8670000	But I think it's going to be Grand Theft Auto 5.
8670000	8672000	And I would probably buy it again.
8672000	8674000	Of course you will.
8674000	8676000	I'll probably buy it for the first time.
8676000	8677000	Yay!
8677000	8681000	Because I knew they'd release it on PlayStation 4 eventually. They just have to, right?
8681000	8684000	I think we'll see that at E3. That announcement will happen.
8684000	8686000	We'll see.
8686000	8688000	Jason!
8689000	8692000	I'm fairly certain I remember hearing this.
8692000	8697000	If not, it certainly was news last year, July specifically.
8697000	8704000	But, yet again, Square Enix is considering the expansion of Dragon Quest X to overseas markets.
8704000	8706000	Says David Gibson,
8706000	8712000	Square Enix is considering expansion of Dragon Quest X to overseas market.
8712000	8716000	Says its profit guidance range is reasonable.
8716000	8725000	Square thinks that if they bring it here, enough of their loyal fans could buy it to presumably at least break even and hopefully actually make a profit.
8725000	8728000	Great for those fans that haven't already imported it.
8728000	8732000	That, you know, I guess consoles are still rather heavily region locked.
8732000	8734000	But it would be a nice thing to continue to see the series stateside.
8734000	8736000	These guys keep fucking teasing me.
8736000	8738000	Like, I really want to play Dragon Quest X.
8738000	8741000	Although, just what an MMO fan needs.
8741000	8744000	And I'm whiffly waffling between XIV and Warcraft.
8744000	8747000	Now, let's tempt me with Dragon Quest X.
8747000	8750000	So, maybe it's not the best idea.
8750000	8752000	This game came out early last year, right?
8752000	8754000	It's been a while.
8754000	8756000	Oh no, it was out on the Wii originally.
8756000	8759000	Which makes it even before 2012.
8759000	8764000	No, it was like right before the Wii U came out when it came out in Japan originally.
8764000	8766000	So, that's how long we haven't had it.
8766000	8768000	I mean, you never know.
8768000	8770000	That could be one of Nintendo's little surprises.
8770000	8771000	Something to bolster.
8771000	8773000	Because they did have a version specific for the Wii U.
8773000	8776000	So, they could always bring that over to the US.
8776000	8780000	And I would bet Nintendo's probably lobbying them hard for it, you know?
8780000	8785000	It would be their answer to like Elder Scrolls Online or Final Fantasy XIV.
8785000	8788000	You know, it would be something that would be exclusive to Nintendo Wii U.
8788000	8791000	But, I don't know. I don't know.
8791000	8793000	Show your support. Let them know you care.
8793000	8794000	That's right.
8794000	8797000	Alright, you can let us know you care by sending us an email every week.
8797000	8801000	You guys send us emails to participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
8801000	8804000	And DarkSakura, she dives into the mailbag head first.
8804000	8809000	And, you know, catches some letters in her floofy dress that she has.
8809000	8811000	Bitch, I might.
8811000	8812000	And she picks...
8812000	8814000	It's big enough to just kind of let him off.
8814000	8816000	Just kind of scoops him up and picks him up.
8816000	8820000	This skirt really could be made into maybe about three total skirts.
8820000	8821000	But I love it.
8821000	8822000	And have room.
8822000	8823000	I love it. It's cute.
8823000	8824000	I'll vouch for that.
8824000	8828000	So, DarkSakura, why don't you pull out some emails and read them for us here on air.
8829000	8832000	This one has been labeled skeezy silly question of the week.
8833000	8835000	What's up, everybody? Except Loki.
8836000	8838000	So much Pokemon on last...
8838000	8840000	Rude. I'm totally rude.
8840000	8841000	So hilarious.
8841000	8845000	So much Pokemon on last week showed that my question was pretty damn relevant.
8845000	8846000	Nice.
8846000	8849000	Oh, because Loki refused to answer. Remember?
8849000	8851000	He asked a question about Pokemon and Loki was like...
8852000	8853000	Anyway.
8854000	8855000	What about Pokemon?
8855000	8856000	Exactly.
8856000	8858000	I don't know. It was like, if you could make a Pokemon, what would you make?
8858000	8859000	And you were like...
8859000	8860000	Bitch, I'm trying to read.
8860000	8861000	That's a dumb question.
8861000	8862000	Hearts.
8862000	8863000	Yes. Sorry.
8863000	8866000	Take yourselves back to the old days when everybody thought the world was flat.
8866000	8867000	Yes, Rob.
8867000	8869000	Time to bust out the knickers and bifocals.
8869000	8870000	Lol.
8870000	8873000	Would you have traveled the great journey to find out for yourselves?
8873000	8876000	How close to the imaginary edge would you get?
8876000	8881000	Who the hell would captain the OLR ship and why the heck do we make him or her captain?
8883000	8884000	Would you go discover the world?
8884000	8886000	Would you go discover the world? I'd probably...
8886000	8890000	Actually, if I were going to go backwards in my ancestry, I'd probably be a court lady in France.
8891000	8892000	Just saying.
8894000	8898000	And I don't want it to be in France when some people are getting their heads chopped off because that time sucked.
8900000	8906000	This might be a little too pop culture heavy for some people, but if I were to travel the world to see if it's flat or not,
8906000	8913000	if I really believed that it was flat, I would want my co-pilot or my co-captain or whoever to be Sherry Shepherd because she believes it's flat too.
8913000	8916000	So, there you go. Maybe we'll find it together.
8916000	8917000	I don't get it.
8917000	8920000	People actually didn't think the world was flat by the way back then.
8921000	8925000	Because the horizon line was curved. They just didn't know what was out there.
8925000	8932000	Yeah. The unknown. The great unknown. It's just like us beyond certain ends of our universe. How big is the universe? Big.
8932000	8933000	That's all we know.
8933000	8937000	Somebody tell Loki that he needs to use his frickin' imagination and create himself a Pokemon.
8937000	8939000	Love you guys. EA skeezy.
8940000	8943000	So, wait. What did the ultimate question end up being in there?
8943000	8944000	What would we do?
8944000	8949000	What would we do if we were given the option to explore the world?
8949000	8950000	To explore the world.
8950000	8952000	To discover what the world is like.
8952000	8955000	Can I just go back to Hawaii for a little while? That would be kind of awesome.
8955000	8959000	I would like to discover my bed where my naps are.
8959000	8964000	Actually, you know what? Who wouldn't want to travel? And I would like to do more traveling around the world. I really would.
8964000	8967000	I'd like to get paid to travel. If someone wants to pay me to travel, I'll do it.
8968000	8970000	A travel series podcast or something?
8970000	8971000	Heck yeah.
8971000	8972000	That'd be fun.
8972000	8974000	Gaming around the world.
8974000	8977000	No, it'll be called, Jamie judges shit around the world.
8977000	8979000	Gaming around the world? Hey, you know what?
8979000	8981000	Jamie judges the world.
8981000	8996000	There's a lot of people that don't realize, especially when we talked about how the Wii is, or sorry, not the Wii, but Nintendo is putting something out that's probably like the Wii into countries that aren't as heavily saturated with gaming consoles like we have here in other countries.
8996000	9000000	I think it actually would be pretty interesting to see how gaming really is perceived in other countries.
9000000	9002000	See how they're still playing the master system in Brazil?
9002000	9008000	Well, yeah, and we have Act Deft that calls in sometimes to tell us how things are different in Mexico, you know, and there's some things that we take for granted.
9008000	9009000	Where are Swedes?
9009000	9012000	Yeah, we had Aki Ripper from Sweden. He hasn't listened in a while, I don't think.
9012000	9014000	Swedes call next week.
9014000	9017000	And then we have our guy from Belgium that emails us once in a while. We love the international books.
9017000	9018000	We have Sil.
9018000	9019000	And Sil.
9019000	9020000	We love Sil.
9020000	9023000	Sil is absolutely gorgeous. Did you see her picture? She's so gorgeous.
9023000	9024000	I do.
9024000	9025000	I have a girl crush on Sil.
9025000	9026000	I do.
9026000	9027000	I have a girl crush on Sil, too.
9027000	9030000	All right. Anyhow.
9030000	9033000	Yeah, we had another email.
9033000	9037000	Thank you, EA Skizie. You have a great name, but not as great as Awesome Unicorn.
9037000	9041000	Or Serious Turtle.
9041000	9047000	Or, um, oh, God, now I forget the name. Oh, well, never mind. Sorry, Derailed.
9047000	9049000	Sorry, whoever's name he can't remember.
9049000	9050000	Sorry, whoever's name I can't remember.
9050000	9051000	Dark Sakura.
9051000	9053000	Nasty Canasta. That was it.
9053000	9054000	Nasty Canasta.
9054000	9055000	Nasty Canasta.
9055000	9059000	So this one's subject is Takata in Rogue Number 3.
9059000	9062000	I see what you did there. Musical jokes.
9062000	9069000	I realize time was limited for last week's Classic Game of the Week, but I would have liked to hear more about the games directly inspired by Rogue,
9069000	9076000	including Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon series or Fatal Labyrinth on the Genesis, although not necessarily action roguelikes.
9076000	9086000	Also, per your discussion of Holst with Christopher Ten, do you agree that Airship's theme from Super Mario 3 and perhaps the March of the Meanies from Yellow Submarine has strong influence from Mars Bringer of War?
9086000	9089000	Oh, that is a good point.
9089000	9092000	I could actually, with the Mario 3 warship theme? Oh, absolutely.
9092000	9093000	Yeah, I could totally hear it.
9093000	9095000	Absolutely.
9095000	9098000	Yeah, cue that up sometime.
9098000	9113000	Because I'm actually running through, I think that it really does have the whole, at least the beat to it and the sort of crescendo that the background music makes.
9113000	9119000	I'm wondering if any of the people in the chat room have ever heard Mars Bringer of War and if you haven't, why not?
9119000	9124000	Yeah.
9124000	9132000	Can you imagine, this would have been a great question for Christopher Ten, we'll have to get him back, but what kind of music would Christopher Ten have made on the NES?
9132000	9140000	You know, where you're so limited. It's really amazing what these game programmers back then were able to do.
9140000	9144000	Have we had the NES sound chip discussion?
9144000	9147000	Between the Famicom disk and the...
9147000	9155000	No, just literally the limitations of the Famicom, of the NES sound chip.
9155000	9159000	By the way, for comparison, Rob, you should pull up Mars Bringer of War.
9159000	9167000	Well, he does that. I'm extrapolating a little bit from the bit of chiptune composition software that I've seen, but an NES has four channels.
9167000	9175000	Two wave, one pulse, one noise. Noise is usually sound effects, basic crashes.
9175000	9187000	The wave channels actually have a fair amount of extensibility in them and then the pulse channel I've actually kind of forgotten.
9187000	9204000	But four channels to be able to play any music that the game has and any and all sound effects, that's why classic games more often than not, some sound effects just fail to fire because there wasn't, you know, whatever the sound effects being stacked couldn't play at the same time.
9204000	9209000	Here's Mars Bringer of War, or at least a YouTube labeled as such, so I'm going to hope it's right.
9209000	9220000	Yeah.
9220000	9229000	You can't really hear the drum in the back. It's very faint, kind of, but you can definitely hear the big swelling.
9229000	9236000	Keep in mind, this is like 30 seconds out of a seven minute piece. And as Bobby says in the chat, content ID strike number three, probably.
9236000	9238000	No, that's five.
9238000	9239000	We're doomed.
9239000	9243000	We're doomed. Oh, now we'll never make that nickel off the 12 views we get of the show on YouTube.
9243000	9244000	We're spreading culture.
9244000	9246000	We brought doom upon ourselves.
9246000	9250000	I do want to say, isn't it by now the works of Holst in the public domain?
9250000	9251000	You'd think, you'd think.
9251000	9254000	It doesn't matter. Somebody is claiming the rights of their own.
9254000	9260000	Yeah. If some troll claims the rights, it's not going to matter at the end of the day because that YouTube sites on their site.
9260000	9262000	Fuck them with something hard and sandpapery.
9262000	9263000	Exactly.
9263000	9267000	P.S., what would you say to be the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament?
9267000	9271000	What would I say to be the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament?
9271000	9273000	Like a game?
9273000	9276000	I would say, can I go to bed? Because I don't play either.
9276000	9293000	So they're saying the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament, they're saying from Half-Life and its type of standard kills deathmatching, what Unreal Tournament game mod would be cartoonish, exaggerated.
9294000	9310000	Honestly, I'm going to say that the to-be-released Unreal Tournament is going to be the Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament because somebody is going to bring that style of game to it with the announcements of the modability that we covered last week or two weeks ago.
9310000	9318000	I'm going to be honest. I agree with Akhdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com. The Team Fortress of Unreal Tournament is Team Fortress. I'm kind of on that page, I think.
9318000	9319000	Yeah.
9319000	9322000	Unreal will get something very good.
9322000	9328000	I realize Team Fortress was born of Quake originally, but, I mean, anyway.
9328000	9330000	Alright, that's it for emails?
9330000	9331000	That's it.
9331000	9333000	Well, there are only two emails.
9333000	9334000	Yep.
9334000	9343000	You can do better than that, people. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com. You know, it is a show where every gamer has a voice, but only if you use it. So, send us more emails.
9344000	9350000	Alright, this is a good time for us to get a little bit ranty in a segment we call the FUs of the Week.
9350000	9366000	This is fucked up.
9366000	9374000	Um, FU to the people in your neighborhood who don't use their turn signals because they're buttholes. Like stinky crusty buttholes.
9374000	9375000	Ew.
9375000	9377000	With a couple of hemorrhoids.
9377000	9379000	That's so weird.
9379000	9381000	Yeah, but that's how I feel about them.
9381000	9391000	Um, and uh, um, FU to being warm. Yeah, I'm done.
9391000	9393000	I turned on the AC.
9393000	9396000	That's okay. I think I'm still just kind of out of it.
9396000	9399000	Okay. Uh, Loki.
9399000	9409000	Um, I don't know. FU to my feet hurting. I don't know why.
9409000	9420000	Um, my FU of the Week goes to the fact that Loki gave me his french fries. Actually, I'm very thankful that Loki gave me his french fries. Don't get me wrong, but my FU goes to the fact that I ate them all. I ate them all.
9420000	9422000	FU to the fries and not the Loki.
9422000	9424000	They were delicious. Yeah, exactly.
9425000	9430000	FU to myself for not showing restraint is what it really is because I need to be showing a little more restraint.
9430000	9435000	I totally showed restraint with my 4x4 with soda and fries and a milkshake.
9435000	9438000	E3's coming up. I've got to lose 25 in a week.
9438000	9445000	Do you realize they will not do more than a 4x4 anymore? Because I wanted more than a 4x4 and it would only do a 4x4.
9445000	9451000	I thought they would if they weren't too busy or they do it at certain times. I thought 7x7 was as high as you could go.
9451000	9454000	Oh, maybe. Well, they said they won't do more than a 4x4.
9454000	9455000	What did you ask for?
9455000	9461000	It was actually a 5x5. I wanted to do a 6x6, but I thought that would be too much.
9461000	9465000	Might be a little much. Oh my god. That's too much. Oh my god.
9465000	9470000	Their patties are really small. Their double is just like, it's nothing.
9470000	9476000	I have a single hamburger when I go to In-N-Out and that is plenty. There's so much butter on that fucking thing.
9476000	9478000	It's like, oh my god. Anyway.
9479000	9481000	FU to so much butter. In-N-Out burgers.
9481000	9483000	I think you could get him to cook it without the butter.
9483000	9484000	Jason, did you give an FU?
9484000	9487000	I did not. Thank you for considering me.
9487000	9489000	Once in a while I do.
9489000	9494000	I guess since this is probably the only part of the show where it's relevant. FU to the Ford Focus.
9494000	9503000	I don't remember what year it is, but whenever I don't have my own car accessible I use Zipcar to get up here to Sacramento from San Francisco.
9503000	9510000	And I try out new cars. I try out different cars because I'm curious. I'll be in the market again for one eventually.
9510000	9515000	And my car is 2006 so why not see what's changed in the last couple years shy of a decade.
9515000	9523000	There's no switch for locking and unlocking the car doors in the car that I can tell.
9523000	9529000	I'm assuming, unlike my Civic that has the button on the key and doesn't work if the engine in,
9529000	9533000	you can only use the buttons on the key. Presumably it works when the car is started.
9533000	9541000	As Rob, when we were on our way to Scandia, Rob was living the reclined life the whole way because we couldn't find the handle.
9541000	9542000	What the hell was that?
9542000	9548000	It's not on the floor, on the bottom seat. It's on the back, on the side of the back seat.
9548000	9556000	The Ford Focus because I had a Ford Focus. I believe that the lock mechanism is just if you lock the driver's side door.
9556000	9562000	But there's not even a manual tab either. I can find nothing involving the locks in that car.
9562000	9564000	Besides on the key.
9564000	9565000	Really?
9565000	9566000	It's weird.
9566000	9573000	I had a 2001 or a 2000. This is 2013 or something like that. It's also a hatchback.
9573000	9575000	It's also a Ford Focus.
9576000	9583000	And most of all, I've never had a problem, a meaningful problem with sync before nowadays.
9583000	9587000	Microsoft, actually it was just sync. Microsoft kind of distanced themselves.
9587000	9589000	F you to sync. Fucking frustrating.
9589000	9591000	You'll notice the music stopped five minutes ago, Jason.
9591000	9593000	Excuse me.
9593000	9596000	You have a laundry list you've built up over the past few weeks.
9596000	9599000	Well, I also have laundry, so my brain's just in that mode right now.
9599000	9600000	Fair enough, fair enough.
9600000	9601000	All right.
9601000	9603000	We just have a couple more stories for you guys.
9603000	9608000	Then we're going to open up the phones and take calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9608000	9611000	And if you want to be on the show, you better call quick.
9611000	9615000	Because we are already, we just hit 9 o'clock Pacific and midnight on the East Coast.
9615000	9617000	So we're not going to go all night.
9617000	9619000	I'm sorry my F. You ran so long.
9619000	9620000	I know, right?
9620000	9622000	All right. Let's get through a couple more stories here quick. Loki.
9622000	9626000	All right. So this is kind of neat.
9626000	9628000	You know, there's a lot of entrepreneurs out there.
9628000	9634000	And this IndieGoGo campaign is for an interactive toothbrush.
9634000	9636000	It's a video game toothbrush.
9636000	9638000	Is it a decision, Mark?
9638000	9640000	It's called Grush.
9640000	9643000	I don't know what the fuck that's, I guess, game brush.
9643000	9644000	I got my joke.
9644000	9645000	Gruel.
9645000	9646000	You got my joke?
9646000	9647000	No.
9647000	9648000	The Citadel DLC?
9648000	9651000	Oh, yeah. Okay. I get it now.
9651000	9654000	They're seeking, like I said, they're seeking funding on IndieGoGo.
9654000	9659000	It's, I guess, the idea of some guy that used to be an exec at EA.
9659000	9665000	And what it is, is it has a 3D accelerometer built into the toothbrush and a gyroscope.
9665000	9670000	And apparently with it, it sends a signal to a mobile phone.
9670000	9673000	So it's kind of a peripheral for, like, an iPod or something like that.
9673000	9678000	And it includes, you know, a case that you can hang on your mirror that's waterproof.
9678000	9682000	And they kind of show some concepts of it.
9682000	9686000	It's totally built in Unity, the little thing that they designed.
9686000	9688000	And kind of derpy looking.
9688000	9690000	But I think it's cool.
9690000	9694000	Whatever gets you to, you know, incentivize kids to brush their teeth, I guess, would be good.
9694000	9701000	But I haven't even seen what exactly they're looking, how much funding they need for this thing.
9701000	9703000	Let's find out.
9703000	9705000	Well, they were-
9705000	9707000	Four hundred thousand dollars.
9707000	9712000	They were seeking fifty thousand dollars, and they just made it.
9712000	9714000	They just made it.
9714000	9716000	With three hours left.
9716000	9718000	They're just over that, so.
9718000	9720000	Congrats.
9720000	9722000	Yeah, so that's kind of neat, I guess.
9722000	9725000	And you can still get in on the action if you're listening live.
9725000	9729000	But, honestly, it looks kind of derpy.
9729000	9734000	I remember games, like, in the 80s that would teach you, like, hygiene things, like brushing teeth.
9734000	9738000	Like, there was a game called Plaque Attack, where you had to, like, floss on Commodore 64.
9738000	9740000	I fucking loved Plaque Attack.
9740000	9743000	You had to shoot down the candy canes and chocolate things.
9743000	9746000	Wait, I think we're mixing two games, because there was one on Atari.
9746000	9750000	I think that was Plaque Attack, but there was one on Commodore 64 as well that was, like, another one.
9750000	9756000	And you can also- they also have a parental dashboard where you can see which kid, you know, brushed their teeth and which kid didn't.
9756000	9760000	So you can stalk them and go, like, fucking David has him brush his teeth.
9760000	9762000	Charles, that was awesome.
9762000	9764000	David, though, he's gonna get grounded.
9764000	9766000	He's an unhygienic motherfucker.
9766000	9767000	That's right.
9767000	9772000	Unhygienic motherfucker, that should be the exact phrase on there.
9772000	9777000	You get that gold star in the comic sans font that says unhygienic motherfucker.
9777000	9781000	Alright, anyhow, I know a few people at anime cons I'd put that on.
9781000	9784000	And I love- wait, and this is not Rama.
9784000	9786000	Not Rama, not Rama, I love Rama.
9787000	9792000	And this is the best- they have, like, you know, that goes down the list with all the different, like, press quotes and stuff like that.
9792000	9798000	You know, they have, like, stuff like, this is a brilliant way to show one where to brush your teeth while providing fun.
9798000	9801000	And then Kotaku's, here's the next gen gaming toothbrush!
9801000	9805000	That's, like, the fucking most useless phrase I've ever seen.
9805000	9809000	It's like, okay, yeah, I'm sorry, what was the previous gen gaming toothbrush?
9809000	9811000	There wasn't one.
9811000	9818000	Alright, well, speaking of just crazy new devices, there's something called CleverPet.
9818000	9824000	And we end tonight talking about CleverPet, which is producing a game device for dogs.
9824000	9828000	Yes, the CleverPet is a dog game console.
9828000	9837000	It is supposed to engage and educate dogs by challenging dogs with puzzles and rewarding treats if successful.
9837000	9839000	Oh, this is a- this could be cruel.
9839000	9846000	It's three touch-sensitive light-up pads that sit at the front of the console, and the dog can use the paws or the nose to interact with them.
9846000	9850000	CleverPet has algorithms so you can change the difficulty of the puzzles.
9850000	9852000	Owners can track your dog's progress.
9852000	9858000	One of the games is like a DDR game that has the dog touch pads as they light up in a particular order.
9858000	9867000	The device can hold as much dog food as the standard dog bowl, and it all runs on a system known as SparkCore, and you can build custom software for it.
9867000	9875000	It was a 34-day Kickstarter campaign. The funding has already reached its $100,000 goal. The CleverPet will be $279.
9875000	9881000	Meanwhile, Amplitude's probably not going to make its goal, but the CleverPet made its goal.
9881000	9885000	For the record, people are saying they should do ones for cats. They've already made video games for cats.
9885000	9886000	Yeah, on the iPad, right?
9886000	9887000	On iOS.
9887000	9891000	Frisky has some games that they put on there.
9891000	9895000	I haven't even tried to see if Minda will play them yet. I'm afraid because she's the claw queen.
9896000	9903000	I mean, it's a neat idea. I just hope no one actually uses it as their primary feeding device for their animals because they will die.
9906000	9907000	I shouldn't laugh at that.
9907000	9909000	They will not live. They will be dead.
9909000	9911000	Bochi Kawa in our chat room at live.voguenetwork.com says,
9911000	9916000	Video game dog sitter? It sounds like it. I can entertain the dog while I'm away.
9916000	9919000	Well, people do that with their children. Why not?
9920000	9925000	And doggy, I'm going away for a week, and if you can figure out this video game, you'll get to eat. If not, good luck.
9925000	9933000	And I'm going to tell you this much, you know, just having had pets before, they're going to lose interest in this immediately.
9935000	9940000	All right, let's go to the phones. It's that time. 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype.
9940000	9945000	Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call. And look at that, the Skype line already lighting up with calls.
9945000	9947000	So let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9948000	9950000	It is the one and only Raven's Dolphin.
9950000	9954000	Raven's Dolphin! Long time no speak, buddy. Always good to hear from you. What's up?
9954000	9955000	Do you see me?
9955000	9960000	Yeah, I see you, and it's so, like, don't take this the wrong way, but it's so interesting to me to see you get older.
9960000	9966000	Because I remember when, no, no, no, no, you, okay, look, I'm an old motherfucker, Raven's Dolphin. Let's get that out of the way.
9966000	9972000	But you listened to this show, like, back in, like, 2006 and stuff, and I remember you calling into the show then.
9972000	9977000	And you were a lot younger, so it's just, I'm watching you become a man before my eyes, Raven's Dolphin.
9977000	9981000	You want to know something sad? I just turned 27.
9981000	9986000	Christ. And how old were you when you first heard OLR?
9986000	9988000	I swear I was 19.
9988000	9991000	Oh my God. Oh my God.
9991000	9997000	And I was listening to you on, like, PSP Drive, downloading it on my PSP, now I listen to you on your iPhone live.
9997000	9999000	I was like, holy crap, this is the future.
9999000	10001000	He couldn't even drink.
10002000	10004000	And now he's 27.
10004000	10006000	I couldn't drink the first time I was on the show.
10006000	10009000	Oh God. I'm so sad too.
10009000	10013000	Oh, I wanted to show you my Yoshi 3DS and then get to the topic at hand.
10013000	10015000	That is a cute little 3DS, I love it.
10015000	10019000	If I had the webcam, I'd show you my Zelda one, which is better.
10019000	10021000	Oh, I have that one as well.
10021000	10024000	What? What? Wait a minute.
10024000	10026000	He's as cool as Shane rocking the dual 3DS.
10026000	10028000	What do you need multiple 3DSs for?
10028000	10032000	At least Shane can say he worked for Nintendo at one point. What's your excuse?
10032000	10034000	It was cute and I needed it.
10034000	10040000	Okay, valid response. I stand corrected. Sorry.
10040000	10047000	Let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the weight of the Twitch as we know it.
10047000	10049000	Oh yes. Oh yes.
10049000	10055000	Now, I don't know if you know this, but I got into the Let's Play begrudgingly.
10055000	10058000	Begrudgingly got into it. I'm not a big fan of it.
10058000	10062000	I think a lot of people just scream a lot and just say horrible things.
10062000	10066000	But here I am and I've been streaming on other sites and all that stuff.
10066000	10071000	I think it's a very good idea for Twitch to go with YouTube.
10071000	10075000	The big site that people generate money in ads, Machinima's there.
10075000	10080000	All these big sites are there so they're going to meld these two together.
10080000	10085000	Twitch is all about the games and YouTube is all about the personalities.
10085000	10088000	So now you're going to have the games and the personalities.
10088000	10094000	What about the whole copyright thing that a lot of us are hung up on, including myself, a little bit?
10094000	10095000	I totally agree.
10095000	10099000	I'm not sitting here going, the sky is falling. I'm deleting my Twitch account.
10099000	10101000	I'll probably do streaming later tonight.
10101000	10104000	But it's kind of one of those things where I'm like, God damn it, don't fuck this up.
10104000	10106000	Do not fuck this up, Google.
10106000	10111000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. For them, it's like they just started their live thing.
10111000	10113000	And Twitch owns 40% of the market.
10113000	10116000	So for them, it's like we need to do something.
10116000	10119000	We need to address the gaming market that they have.
10119000	10125000	I just think buying Twitch will give them the absolute advantage over anything.
10125000	10129000	You stream, be damned, everyone else can go die.
10132000	10135000	Do you worry that it could start this whole antitrust thing?
10135000	10137000	I don't know. I don't know if that carries a lot of weight.
10137000	10141000	Well, there's so many companies being bought right now.
10142000	10147000	I mean, AT&T with DishNet, with DirecTV, it's like everyone's getting bought.
10147000	10151000	But there wouldn't be antitrust in that situation because there is still a huge satellite competitor.
10151000	10152000	Although, well, I don't know.
10152000	10156000	Well, it's tricky because Comcast just bought a huge, I don't know.
10156000	10157000	Time Warner.
10157000	10159000	I mean, it's tricky.
10159000	10161000	You know what's interesting, though?
10161000	10165000	What's interesting, though, is that we talk about these big companies get bigger and they get bigger and they get bigger.
10165000	10167000	You know, what's ever going to happen?
10167000	10172000	But it does seem like then this new company, you know, Comcast didn't exist 20 years ago.
10172000	10174000	You know what I mean?
10175000	10179000	There will always be innovation, as we learned with Oculus Rift.
10179000	10181000	There always will be someone out there.
10181000	10186000	It just seemed like it's either they're going to be bought up or nurtured enough to be bought.
10187000	10188000	That's what it looks like.
10188000	10190000	That's a very good point.
10190000	10193000	And Rama reminds us the Comcast Time Warner thing isn't final.
10193000	10195000	Well, we'll see. We'll see.
10195000	10200000	Well, right now the Twitch thing is not final, but it will probably come out.
10200000	10205000	I mean, YouTube probably needs it for their infrastructure, for their video stuff.
10205000	10207000	They're probably betting hard on it.
10207000	10208000	True.
10208000	10213000	I'm curious to see technologically what might come of this.
10213000	10220000	It could be a very neat thing, but, you know, again, I really hope the principles that guide it don't screw it up.
10220000	10222000	We're all a little nervous about that.
10222000	10223000	No, I agree.
10223000	10226000	Not a prominent Let's Player, but someone that watches the space.
10226000	10227000	Yeah.
10227000	10229000	Because now I watch the space.
10229000	10235000	Before I used to do the podcast thing, and I still do, but the Let's Plays scare me because the people on there scare me.
10237000	10239000	Wait a minute. I'm on there sometimes.
10239000	10241000	Well, you do good work.
10241000	10246000	And I seen you on there go like, hi, I'm Rob Roberts. I'm playing Donkey Kong 3. I watched a few things.
10246000	10247000	Thank you.
10247000	10248000	I know.
10248000	10252000	And like you say, you believe in the games, but some of these people are looking for a paycheck.
10252000	10259000	They're like, oh, man, fuck you, Nintendo. Fuck you, Nintendo. You know it belongs in the trash.
10259000	10262000	Yeah, I don't like to get super-duper negative.
10262000	10266000	I mean, sometimes I get a little... I think there's a difference between negative and sassy.
10266000	10270000	I'll get a little sassy, but I don't like to get just full-on negative.
10270000	10273000	There's a difference between insulting and criticism.
10273000	10284000	Well, as my mother RuPaul says, and this is something that we should all live by, throwing shade takes creativity. Being a bitch takes none.
10284000	10287000	There's a lot of bitches out there.
10287000	10289000	Ain't that the truth.
10289000	10291000	You ain't one of them.
10291000	10292000	What's that?
10292000	10293000	You ain't one of them.
10293000	10294000	No, I try not to.
10294000	10295000	You throw shade.
10295000	10296000	I try not to.
10297000	10304000	I think some people basically turn into virtual panhandlers with that stuff.
10304000	10307000	It's always like, pay me, pay me, pay me, pay me.
10307000	10310000	I don't know. I don't like to play that game.
10310000	10313000	One last thing. I know this is running a little long.
10313000	10318000	For me, I want to respect the game because I know that you guys do your work.
10318000	10322000	We wouldn't be here without the game or the games.
10322000	10323000	That is very true.
10323000	10326000	That's where I come from. I have to respect where it came from.
10326000	10328000	That is very true. It is about the games.
10328000	10330000	Go play the games and don't be a dick.
10330000	10333000	Not that I'm saying you're a dick, Ravenstaufen.
10333000	10337000	You're a fine young man who's grown up before my eyes.
10337000	10338000	Exactly.
10338000	10342000	Alright, Ravenstaufen. Take care, buddy. Thanks so much for calling the show.
10342000	10344000	Oh, you're welcome. I just want to shed some light.
10344000	10345000	Alright, sounds good. Take care.
10345000	10346000	Bye.
10346000	10347000	Bye.
10347000	10348000	Always good to hear from that kid.
10348000	10351000	For the record, Comcast was founded in 1963.
10351000	10352000	Was it really?
10352000	10353000	Yeah.
10353000	10355000	I had no idea they were that old.
10355000	10357000	Well, look at Facebook.
10357000	10358000	Okay? Facebook.
10358000	10359000	2004.
10359000	10362000	Oh my god, the guy who invented it is only 30, so it isn't that old.
10362000	10363000	Oh, anyway.
10363000	10365000	Let's go to the phone so we have another call coming in.
10365000	10367000	Hi, you're on Originals Radio. Who's this?
10367000	10369000	Hey, this is Zach Def.
10369000	10370000	Hey, Zach Def. What's up, buddy?
10370000	10377000	Well, remember last week that I talked that I didn't have a trivia trip to the Lux because it got lost in the mail?
10377000	10379000	You sound a little down. What happened?
10379000	10385000	No, I'm actually happy because, well, first let me tell you a story.
10385000	10394000	I contacted Amazon on Thursday to talk about my last game and Amazon was pretty quick.
10394000	10405000	The customer representative that spoke to me pretty much helped me in less than five minutes, so it all got fixed.
10405000	10410000	And by Friday afternoon, my copy of Triple Deluxe got delivered.
10410000	10412000	Jesus. That is a turnaround.
10412000	10422000	Yeah, it got here in a day, though I had to pick it up until Saturday because my friend, who helps me with shipping and all that, goes to pick it up the next day.
10422000	10429000	But basically, yeah, I got Triple Deluxe now and I have played it and I love it.
10429000	10435000	Hooray. Does it do justice to your favorite video game mascot?
10435000	10448000	Yes, it's pretty much your typical Kirby. You suck enemies and you either suck them out or copy their abilities.
10449000	10460000	It's pretty much the main gist of it, but it does have the Hypernova ability now that makes you pretty much suck everything and it's pretty much literal.
10460000	10469000	That's awesome. I'm glad to hear it. How's the music in the game? Because I'll tell you what, the thing I always remember about Kirby is the freaking infectious soundtrack to those games. Oh my gosh.
10470000	10476000	Superstar, Kirby Superstar, still has an absolutely amazing soundtrack that I adore to this day.
10476000	10478000	So how's the music?
10478000	10492000	The music is fantastic. Even though it doesn't have that many new tracks, though some are new, it has a really great soundtrack that is a staple from all the Kirby series.
10492000	10503000	It's something I have to thank for if I'm into video game music because Kirby is pretty much the game that brought me into it.
10503000	10515000	So what do you look forward to now? Now that Kirby is in your possession and you're playing through it, what do you have to look forward to now at this point? At E3 this year? What do you hope Nintendo is going to do?
10516000	10524000	Well, first of all, Mario Kart 8, I also have it pre-ordered so hopefully we can look forward to that.
10524000	10544000	Yes, and to all the people asking if there will be something with VoG playing, of course there's going to be. I don't know if they're going to have the leagues like they had on Mario Kart 7, but we'll try to take advantage of whatever systems they offer and absolutely we'll do a VoG night or something. Absolutely that will be a thing.
10544000	10566000	Definitely, that should be a thing. It's going to be awesome. Though for E3, at least for Nintendo, I hope that there's some of the old franchises back like Star Fox and F-Zero, that's the main two I can think of.
10567000	10585000	Other than your typical games that we're going to get like Zelda and New Mario and all that. But yeah, those are the two that come to mind. Even though I do have some old classics like Uniracers that nobody remembers but me.
10585000	10586000	No, I love that game.
10616000	10625000	Maybe on the 3DS or something like that. But yeah, it was the Tony Hawk before the Tony Hawk games. Basically, it was fun.
10625000	10638000	Very true. Yeah, I love that game. It's great. Yeah, I'd love to see Nintendo try to go to the vault and get another great franchise. Like when they did Sin and Punishment 2 on the Wii, that was a pleasant surprise. Unfortunately, the game I don't think sold as well as they'd hoped.
10638000	10656000	But it was still a pleasant surprise and maybe they'll try it again with something different. But we do know there's a lot coming out from Nintendo this year. As much as the Wii U is having its issues, those of us that did plunk down the money for one, we got Bayonetta 2, we've got the Monolith Soft game, the X or whatever it ends up being.
10656000	10665000	Obviously, there will be a Zelda in the cards at some point. We have Mario Kart 8. There's still a lot of stuff to get excited about on Wii U. So, it's not all bad news.
10665000	10685000	Yeah, there's tons of games that are coming out from Nintendo and especially for the Wii U. So, hopefully it will get better. As for Xbox One and probably PlayStation 4, though PlayStation 4 right now probably I don't have anything to look forward to or at least that I can think of.
10685000	10691000	But for Xbox One, Forza Horizon 2, that's basically it.
10691000	10702000	Yeah, that's probably something that's going to make me get an Xbox One as well as I've been talking about the whole on the fence thing and it really seems like as we start to get to the end of the year, Microsoft's just going to have the lineup I can't say no to.
10702000	10709000	Alright, anyway, ActDeaf, I've got to let you go to try and get at least one more call before we finish up tonight. But thank you so much for the call, buddy. And I'm glad to hear you got your game.
10709000	10710000	Hey, thanks for having me.
10710000	10713000	Alright, no problem. Anytime. Bye.
10713000	10722000	Alright, glad to hear he got us good. That's great that he got the great customer service and that's, you know, what we should expect that they get that game out to him. Silly that it got all held up.
10722000	10729000	We'll try to fit in one more call if anybody else wants to call us. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10730000	10740000	Uni Racers was sued by, should I say DMA Design, was sued by Pixar, not Disney, which was a separate company obviously at the time in the early 90s and I was right 300,000.
10740000	10752000	It's, you mentioned Zuckerberg right before his call and it's kind of funny. I was talking to the friend of mine a week or two ago and he mentions, you know, old quotes, 640K of memory ought to be good enough for anyone.
10753000	10760000	I countered with the fact that in 2002 or something like that, Bill Gates said spam was going to be solved in three years. Yeah, tell me about it.
10760000	10761000	Whoops.
10761000	10779000	Email spam specifically was the context but he mentioned that Zuckerberg had this quote to never, if you want to be an upstart, interesting, if you want to make a good product, do not take advice from anyone over 30.
10779000	10804000	Zuckerberg's 30 years old and is funny, in context, rather in hindsight, is funny because of poke, you know, poke versus, it was in Snapchat. Wasn't there some other third party like really, really absurdly simplistic thing that you just kind of poked someone about and I don't know.
10804000	10812000	Facebook has made very, very good, very, very interesting purchases in the realm of Instagram and Oculus and I'm sure there's another one that I'm forgetting.
10812000	10824000	But that quote to be used against him now that he's reached that magical age is kind of hilarious to think about and we'll see what happens with Facebook in the next, I don't know, however long it's still around and relevant.
10824000	10841000	Well, thank God I didn't make a statement like that when I first started doing OLR, right? All right, I'm still waiting to see if we get any calls on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio and dark to see and chat telling us that the 877 number doesn't seem to work all of a sudden, so I don't know what's up with that.
10841000	10853000	So we may not be able to take phone calls tonight. So sorry about that, guys. But we can still get your calls on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio, all one word. Meanwhile, Loki, is there any last minute stories?
10853000	10868000	There's one, it's apparently Target doing a triple trade-in deal thing where they give you triple value for whatever you trade in, which leads to some wonderful ways if one were to exploit said thing.
10868000	10878000	For example, you could trade in your copy of Titanfall, get $54 and then rebuy it for $40. Repeat forever.
10879000	10886000	And it's only going on through this week, from the 18th through, I forget what the date was.
10887000	10904000	Yeah, so if you're looking to trade in some games and not necessarily just selling or planning on exploiting everything, it might be a good idea just to check out Target and see what they'll give you for them.
10907000	10908000	That's it.
10908000	10909000	All right.
10909000	10912000	It's through the 24th, so the 18th through the 24th.
10912000	10915000	I didn't see any particular tweets, unfortunately, either.
10917000	10922000	You know what it is? I think that should actually fix things a little bit there.
10922000	10930000	You know what it is? I had to disable the phone number during the week, and I forgot to enable it before the show tonight, because we get all these frickin' spam calls on the line.
10930000	10934000	So, but it should be open now. Oh, did it just get through for you?
10934000	10937000	That was the direct line. I'm actually gonna test the total for you.
10937000	10939000	Yeah, that was my bad. Sorry about that.
10939000	10940000	She's wrong.
10940000	10941000	Oh my god, you were-
10941000	10942000	Yeah, fact spam and all that other shit.
10942000	10950000	Oh my god, we get so much of that stupid fact spam and stuff, so I just shut it off, because if they get enough busy singles, maybe they'll, you know, stop wasting the money on calling us.
10950000	10952000	You bitch, they're robots. You think they would really-
10952000	10953000	Yeah, that's true, that's true.
10953000	10960000	All right, well, since we are out, I'm gonna go ahead and shut it down, because we aren't really getting any, um, we aren't getting any other calls.
10960000	10964000	Oh no, is this you? No? This is, this is probably Dark Tetsuya.
10964000	10966000	Hi, you're on Orange Home Radio, who's this?
10967000	10968000	Oh hey, it's DT.
10968000	10973000	Hey, was I right or was I right? There, I fixed the phone, just for you, buddy. What's up, buddy?
10974000	10978000	So apparently, Dungeon Fighter Online reopened in the US.
10978000	10984000	Yes, I saw this, and we didn't fit it in the show world, but I'm glad you called in to talk about it.
10984000	10988000	What's- I know you were excited about this. What's going on with Dungeon Fighter?
10990000	10993000	Yeah, I guess, uh, who was that, uh, Neopole?
10994000	10995000	Mhm.
10995000	11001000	I guess they decided to reopen the game in the US. They're, they're doing an alpha test right about now.
11001000	11003000	Are you, uh, checking it out, or?
11004000	11005000	Oh yeah.
11005000	11006000	What do you think?
11006000	11011000	It's a little rough, it's not going at first, but, I think they got all the bugs worked out, for the most part.
11011000	11017000	Well, alphas usually are a little bit challenging, but, uh, I'm glad to hear they've, they're, they're working on it.
11017000	11021000	So, so you were a fan of the original, and then they just, they did just disappear, didn't it?
11021000	11022000	Yeah.
11022000	11029000	So, are they talking about any ways to improve it, or make it different, or are they just focused on bringing the game back as it was right now?
11030000	11037000	I think they're just leaving it as it is for the moment, but, I'm sure there'll probably be a beta, maybe some new features down the line.
11037000	11040000	Awesome. That'll be awesome. Well, what else have you been playing lately?
11042000	11045000	Oh, what is that, uh, on Epic, on Wii U.
11045000	11047000	Oh yeah, what do you think of that?
11048000	11055000	Oh, it's pretty cool, it's kind of like, uh, Metroidvania, with a little bit of World of Warcraft, or Diablo type elements.
11055000	11060000	I think that's on my Steam wishlist, I think I've seen that one, and I've heard about that, and that's definitely a game I want to get.
11060000	11062000	I did not realize it's on Wii U, but that's awesome.
11063000	11064000	Oh yeah.
11064000	11069000	Very cool. I might have to check that out. You know how much that is? Probably about $11.99 or something?
11069000	11070000	Uh, $10,500.
11070000	11073000	Oh, wow, that's a pretty darn good deal. I'll have to check that out.
11073000	11074000	Alright.
11074000	11075000	Very cool.
11075000	11077000	Alright, DT, you want anything else on your mind tonight?
11078000	11079000	Uh, nah, that's it.
11079000	11083000	Alright, well, check out the revival guide at Dungeon Fighter Online, because, you know,
11083000	11089000	DT, you know, when he loves a game, he really loves a game, like La Mulana or something, so he really believes in it, so.
11089000	11094000	Alright, so check it out, guys. Well, thanks for calling, DT, I'm glad we could fix the phone for you.
11094000	11095000	Yep.
11095000	11096000	Alright, take care, buddy.
11096000	11097000	Yep.
11097000	11098000	Alright, bye.
11099000	11102000	Alright, that is going to do it for another episode of OLRC.
11102000	11109000	Now, now I can go in, and now I'm going to disable the calls, because I don't want the frickin' fact spam this week.
11109000	11113000	Because every time they leave a voicemail, I get an email. I think it's really annoying.
11113000	11120000	And you hit play, and if your headphones are up very loud, you scream, much like the sound that's coming over the, yeah.
11120000	11122000	Exactly. Not having that. Alright.
11122000	11125000	Well, thank you guys very much for listening to another episode of Orange Lawn Radio.
11125000	11131000	We are going to go around and wrap it up, but as I always say, if you like what you hear here at Orange Lawn Radio, tell a friend or two about the show.
11131000	11137000	Help spread the word about Orange Lawn Radio, because, you know, we don't have a huge site corporate backing us.
11137000	11143000	We literally have built this from the ground up over the past 12 years, so, you know, your support means the world to us.
11143000	11146000	So, yeah, that's that. Jason, thanks for being here tonight.
11146000	11147000	As always.
11147000	11151000	It's a pleasure to have you here. I don't know if you're, are you back next week, or not for two weeks?
11151000	11154000	Nope, next week, not neither, actually. This wraps it up.
11155000	11156000	Possibly, actually.
11156000	11157000	Tell you three, right?
11157000	11166000	Because we were, yeah, we were talking about whether I'm going to go home for a week and come back until two weekends, which sounds like a terrible idea, but I'm crazy enough with it.
11166000	11167000	You are.
11167000	11168000	I'm crazy enough to do it.
11168000	11169000	In a good way.
11169000	11178000	Yeah, next week, next week is Fanime. My DJ set is technically Sunday at midnight, the actual Saturday night events in the Ed J.
11178000	11180000	Right, it's Memorial Day next weekend.
11180000	11181000	Yup.
11181000	11182000	Forgot. That's awesome.
11182000	11185000	It'll be a good time. It was last year, and I'm looking forward to it again this year.
11185000	11186000	Great.
11186000	11197000	Scandia had, I just realized I didn't mention this. When Rob played Poppin', I played Poppin', we looked over and there was somebody playing 2DX with headphones on.
11197000	11213000	I remember friends asking me, a decade ago, if the 2DX machine, if I've ever seen a 2DX machine with a headphone port, and because the old school sick style videos of, not Yasu, that was a DDR guy.
11213000	11221000	Oh man, I forgot his name. All of the old 2DX, like, Perfect Player, Lisu?
11221000	11223000	None of our listeners are going to know these people.
11223000	11224000	I think so.
11225000	11231000	At any rate, the people that made these Amazeballs 2DX videos.
11231000	11232000	The Tatsugin videos.
11232000	11253000	Yes, thank you. Tatsugin videos. You could see a headphone cable some of the time. I'm assuming that that was a custom job to make it easier on them, but we saw someone playing 2DX with a headphone port on, or with headphones on, and I kind of looked under the machine and saw that there was a little tiny, tiny mixer adapter under there.
11253000	11260000	I tried it for myself and my headphone cable was much too short, so I didn't get to try it out first hand. But it was nice. It looked nice.
11260000	11264000	It's hopefully something that a lot of other machines I play on from now on have.
11264000	11267000	Any quick final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11269000	11270000	No.
11270000	11272000	Alright, fair enough.
11272000	11278000	I think that was my final thought. Scandi is amazing. I didn't even play Technica, but the machines worked out well.
11278000	11280000	Yeah, they were in very good condition.
11280000	11287000	My final thought tonight is, I think I am going to check out that Unepic game after the show. Another listener recommendation success story. Here you go.
11290000	11291000	Dark Sakura.
11291000	11293000	No, I'm not saying anything.
11294000	11299000	Except, if someone wants to sell me a fairly recent Mac Mini for 100 bucks, I'll buy it.
11299000	11302000	Girl, I gave you a Mac laptop.
11302000	11303000	Yeah, that's 10 years old.
11303000	11304000	Well...
11304000	11305000	It won't run crap.
11305000	11306000	Well...
11306000	11307000	It runs Tiger, Rob.
11307000	11309000	You could get Linux on it. Alright.
11309000	11310000	Not really.
11310000	11312000	Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.
11313000	11315000	Trying to figure out how to save these triangles.
11316000	11318000	Triangle man, triangle man.
11318000	11319000	By the way, thank you.
11319000	11320000	What?
11320000	11323000	Because I actually still use it. I'm learning terminal.
11323000	11324000	You're welcome.
11324000	11326000	I'm actually using it to practice terminal commands.
11326000	11331000	That's fine. My other laptop, I might get rid of that one too, so we'll see.
11331000	11334000	I didn't hear Shane come home. Shane's here.
11334000	11335000	He's been here for a while.
11335000	11337000	Shane's been here for a while. I didn't even hear him come in.
11337000	11338000	I heard him when I was in the bathroom.
11338000	11339000	Creepy.
11340000	11342000	I was coming out of the bathroom.
11342000	11344000	Wait, did you... Shane, come here. We're still live.
11344000	11346000	Shane, did you have a lot to drink today?
11346000	11350000	Shane went to Grandpa's birthday party, just so you know, which I was unable to go to.
11350000	11352000	So he's making the drive that I'm about to drive.
11353000	11355000	At like 7 sangrias.
11356000	11358000	I hope you were safe to drive, young man.
11358000	11359000	You look like you need a nap.
11360000	11361000	He needs a nap. Alright.
11361000	11362000	Go nap.
11362000	11365000	That's it. We all need a nap. Go nap. You earned it, everybody. Have a good night.
