0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	Repeat after me, I will not believe everything I read on the internet
17000	21000	Nintendo hardware, Smash Brothers rosters, the time to fake is high before E3
21000	25000	But could a relationship between EA and Comcast per video games on your cable box be true?
25000	27000	Find out this week on the show where every gamer has a voice
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	36000	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	38000	It is Orange Lounge Radio
38000	41000	Live on this May the 4th of 2014
41000	45000	With the 551st episode of our show
45000	48000	And yes, let me get it out of the way right now
48000	51000	May the 4th be with you, blah-di-blah-di-blah
51000	55000	But, for me, as a fan of Arrested Development
55000	57000	Maybe not as hardcore as some other people I know
57000	60000	I would say it's actually Happy Cinco de Cuatro
60000	63000	And yes, I know it's totally wrong Spanish
63000	65000	If you see Arrested Development, you kn-
65000	66000	Ah, forget it
66000	68000	Alright, anyway, my name is Rob Roberts
68000	72000	And I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
72000	75000	With my co-host, sadly not here tonight, DarkSakura
75000	77000	She has the night off tonight
77000	80000	But we do have here in studio, Loki
80000	81000	Hi
81000	82000	Hey, Loki, how you doing?
82000	83000	Doing okay
83000	84000	Hi
84000	85000	Good, good to hear
85000	87000	What's new with you?
87000	90000	Not much, just looking at pictures of Legos
90000	95000	Pictures of Legos? Why, are you planning on investing a bunch of money on Legos or something?
95000	98000	No, just ideas
98000	99000	I see
99000	103000	Have you ever fiddled around with that program that allows you to build your own things offline
103000	107000	And then order the exact right Legos to make the thing?
107000	110000	No, I'd be afraid of how expensive it is
110000	113000	I mean, I just, yeah, it's gonna be expensive
113000	116000	We actually have a local Legos shop over here
116000	119000	That they sell cut, you know, pieces and whatever
119000	123000	So I haven't really gone in there because once again I'm afraid of how expensive it is
123000	125000	It's an expensive hobby from what I understand, so
125000	127000	There you go, good luck
127000	130000	And I noticed to the show tonight you brought your very own pizza
130000	132000	But you got your pizza well done
132000	133000	Yeah, I always do
133000	134000	Why is that?
134000	136000	I don't know, I like it well done
136000	138000	Fair enough
138000	140000	Alright, well since we don't have Dark Soccer here tonight
140000	146000	We do have another friend of the show here in studio to fill in and help host tonight
146000	150000	It's always good to see him and we might be seeing him a lot more often in the coming weeks
150000	152000	Say hello everybody to Shane
152000	153000	Hello
153000	155000	Shane Olinko here with us tonight, how you doing?
155000	156000	I'm good
156000	157000	Yeah?
157000	158000	Yes
158000	159000	So you live here now?
159000	160000	I do
160000	161000	You do, you're back in Northern California, welcome back
161000	162000	Thank you
162000	164000	And so we might be seeing more of you on OLR in the coming weeks?
164000	166000	Depends on if I'm awake or not
167000	170000	How's your rock and roll lifestyle going?
170000	174000	Do you sleep all day and party all night or what?
174000	179000	Yeah, partying is trying to catch Pokemon all night till like 5 in the morning, yeah
181000	184000	Well how was the experience in Northern California?
184000	187000	You came here from Kansas, for the listeners that didn't know
187000	190000	And you've been on the show on and off literally over
190000	191000	Like a decade
191000	193000	All the whole years, yeah
193000	197000	I think I first met you, my god, when you were like 19 years old I think
197000	202000	And it was when I was living with Loki, when we had that first, like, episode numbers less than 100
202000	203000	Was it 19?
203000	204000	No
204000	205000	I think so
205000	208000	No it was because we did episode 69 from the apartment
208000	210000	Yeah, no, Shane was only like 19
210000	212000	Oh I was 19, I thought you said you were 19
212000	216000	Oh god no, no I was 24 when the show started, actually technically 23
216000	218000	Cause the show started like 3 days longer
218000	219000	Yeah it was probably like 19
219000	221000	Yeah, so crazy stuff
222000	228000	So you're back from Kansas, and how does Northern California compare to Kansas?
228000	230000	It's better
230000	232000	In what ways?
232000	234000	Name one and I'll agree
234000	235000	The weather
235000	243000	Yes, it was 100 today, where I'm from back there, and they had humidity which makes it like 743
243000	248000	And let's see, how about the arcade scene, the games
248000	250000	Well there's not really one here either
251000	253000	We can go to Golfland and have some sadness
253000	255000	Oh my friend has his own DDR machines
255000	261000	I hear it's not so bad anymore because it's like one of the local Bimani enthusiasts actually runs a lot of that
261000	262000	See, when
262000	264000	Scandia had Pump It Up, so I was happy about that
264000	266000	They also have the new Beat Media 2DX
266000	270000	Okay I don't get that because when we went there, Shane and I went there when he was visiting like a couple months ago
270000	271000	None of that
271000	273000	Yeah it wasn't there a couple months ago
273000	275000	Shane we gotta take a trip
275000	277000	We can go play Spada
277000	279000	That's what it is
279000	284000	Alright, I want to say hi to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
284000	290000	We are at The Voice of Geeks Network, and we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
290000	292000	Right after the Bobby Blackwell show at The Voice of Geeks Network
292000	296000	www.vognetwork.com
296000	300000	Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, Shane likes California better because Del Taco
300000	302000	Yeah, it's actually pretty good
302000	304000	Okay, true story you guys, true story
304000	306000	First off, the first part of the true story
306000	310000	Shane, as long as I've known him, has been like addicted to Taco Bell
310000	312000	Like he's eaten a lot of Taco Bell
312000	313000	A lot
313000	315000	Why do you like Taco Bell of all places?
315000	316000	I don't know
316000	317000	I really don't
317000	318000	I've had Jim Boys
318000	319000	I've not had Jim Boys
319000	321000	What a convincing answer
321000	323000	But their breakfast is really good at Taco Bell now
323000	325000	So I have to vouch for that
325000	328000	Again, I've known you since you were 19, and to put things into perspective you're 30 now
328000	330000	So I've known you a long time
330000	333000	And in that entire time, I've always said when you come to visit California, I'm like we should go to Del Taco
334000	336000	You like Taco Bell, you're gonna like Del Taco
336000	338000	It's a very California thing, it's even better
338000	340000	And you're like, no, Del Taco sucks, Del Taco's stupid
340000	342000	I'm like, oh, he must have had it once and he never liked it
342000	344000	Well come to find out, I just found out this past week
344000	346000	You never had Del Taco, so you wouldn't have had it
346000	347000	Nope
347000	349000	And you were like, oh, this is so good
349000	351000	Yes, except for their french fries
351000	354000	Which, one, you're a Mexican restaurant, you shouldn't have french fries
354000	356000	You're stupid
356000	358000	Two, refer back to one
358000	360000	And three, they were way too salty
361000	364000	There might have been some french fries under that salt somewhere, but I couldn't find them
364000	366000	People are gonna think we're on their payroll
366000	368000	Their french fries are terrible
368000	372000	I think they're good, but people are gonna think we're on their payroll, we're not
372000	374000	And they have a hamburger, what the crap
374000	376000	I'm not gonna eat your hamburger
376000	378000	No more free advertising
378000	380000	Now the bacon double del is pretty good though
380000	382000	No more free advertising, they want more advertising, they don't have to pay for it
382000	384000	Alright
384000	386000	I haven't been there in like
386000	388000	There's one right by
388000	390000	There's one, not to give away where I live
390000	392000	But I mean, there's a few Del Tacos in Sac
392000	394000	I'm just gonna say, there's one like right near us
394000	396000	So it's like, probably less than a mile
396000	398000	So it's painfully addicting
398000	400000	I haven't been there since the first studio
400000	402000	Oh wow, that was a long time ago
402000	404000	Yeah, so like, you know
404000	406000	Alright
406000	408000	Also, I wanted to say, cause some people are asking
408000	410000	Like, where was Jason in the intro? Is Jason gone?
410000	412000	No, Jason's not gone, gone
412000	414000	He's just gone for the week
414000	416000	Jason's traveling right now, so he had to drive a lot today
416000	418000	And we actually do all the shows production on Sunday
418000	420000	Like I do the show roll on Sunday
420000	422000	Because we want to make sure we get as much news as possible
422000	424000	And sometimes still there's breaking news during the show
424000	428000	So he wasn't able to do the production schedule today
428000	430000	So that was my voice in the intro
430000	432000	And doing the passphrase this week
432000	434000	But Jason will be back
434000	436000	I think next week, but he's on a road trip
436000	438000	So I just didn't want everybody to go like
438000	440000	Oh my god, is Jason gone? No, he's still around
440000	442000	He's still helping with the YouTube
442000	444000	Which by the way, if you haven't checked out our YouTube channel
444000	446000	Jason does archive all of our episodes on YouTube
446000	448000	And you might be like, well, why would I want to watch something on YouTube?
448000	450000	Because it's really convenient
450000	452000	Like, you can do YouTube on your 3DS
452000	454000	You can do YouTube on all of the consoles
454000	456000	Sometimes it's a little more convenient than the MP3 files
456000	458000	And we want people to be able to listen to the show
458000	460000	As easily as possible
460000	462000	So if you want to listen to Orange Dance Radio on your 3DS
462000	464000	You can do that via YouTube
464000	466000	The only catch is that it is delayed by one week
466000	468000	The reason why we do that
468000	470000	We want to draw people to our site
470000	472000	To get the viewers and the numbers and all that
472000	474000	Yes, I'm fully opening and admitting it is kind of a trick
474000	476000	To actually retain our listenership
476000	478000	Because we don't want to lose everything to YouTube
478000	480000	But YouTube is an option
480000	482000	For especially the archive stuff
482000	484000	And Jason works very hard on that
484000	486000	So we thank him for all that
486000	488000	And yeah, DarkTitsUya says he just saw that
488000	490000	Episode 550 went up on YouTube
490000	492000	It sure did, it sure did
492000	494000	So that was Jason that did that
494000	496000	He also likes to sync
496000	498000	When we're talking about the Classic Game of the Week
498000	500000	He'll actually put the video of the Classic Game of the Week
500000	502000	He does little things like that too
502000	504000	For those that are actually watching
504000	506000	So as I mentioned, remember on Twitter
506000	508000	I saw this thing about that they're going to be
508000	510000	Marathoning all the episodes of The Simpsons
510000	512000	And 552 episodes of The Simpsons
512000	514000	So we have
514000	516000	Recorded, including the E3 specials
516000	518000	Because they don't really number those
518000	520000	More episodes than there are of The Simpsons
520000	522000	That's scary
522000	524000	Well that's because most TV shows only do
524000	526000	Hey, hey, hey, don't belittle what we're doing here
526000	528000	No, no, no, no
528000	530000	We've been doing this way too freaking long
530000	532000	But I mean, most
532000	534000	TV shows only do
534000	536000	What, 22 to 26
536000	538000	Episodes in a year? If that
538000	540000	I mean a lot of them are only like 12
540000	542000	But you think of a show like 24 is a great example
542000	544000	24 is coming back
544000	546000	They're having a shorter run this year with 12 episodes
546000	548000	But usually 24 was 24 episodes
548000	550000	Right? One for each hour
550000	552000	So most shows do that, but we
552000	554000	Produce something like
554000	556000	46
556000	558000	At least in a year
558000	560000	It varies depending on how many weeks
560000	562000	We have off in the year, because obviously if you do one every week
562000	564000	You get 52, but real life happens
564000	566000	We don't always have one every week, so we do about 46
566000	568000	Or so a year, so it's pretty
568000	570000	Pretty crazy, a lot of hardworking
570000	572000	Podcasters out there crank that out
572000	574000	There's probably, I know
574000	576000	Some that were on a daily basis
576000	578000	Got even more than that
578000	580000	That is dedication, folks
580000	582000	That do the daily shows, that is a lot
582000	584000	So, alright
584000	586000	Anyhow
586000	588000	I want to get to the gaming news
588000	590000	And our kickoff topic and our gaming weeks and everything
590000	592000	But I do want to kind of address
592000	594000	This in our kickoff topic tonight, because E3
594000	596000	Is right around the corner
596000	598000	We're getting to be about one
598000	600000	Month from E3, a little over a month
600000	602000	From E3, no word as of
602000	604000	Yet if VOG Network will be represented
604000	606000	At E3 yet, we
606000	608000	Put in our request about two and a half weeks
608000	610000	And still haven't heard back, so Bobby
610000	612000	And I are getting a little nervous, because we don't know
612000	614000	Where to do a hotel or any of that if we do get in
614000	616000	But we're hopeful
616000	618000	But regardless of that
618000	620000	Situation, E3 is happening
620000	622000	In about five weeks
622000	624000	And all the big gaming news
624000	626000	A lot of it's being sat on until then
626000	628000	You're going to see some of it trickle out
628000	630000	As people want to get the jump on E3
630000	632000	And people want to build the E3 hype
632000	634000	You saw Nintendo do some of that this week
634000	636000	We're going to get into that in the news
636000	638000	But speaking of Nintendo, a lot of lies
638000	640000	Start to come out around this time
641000	643000	About what companies are going to show
643000	645000	And one of the big ones that's been gaining a lot
645000	647000	Of steam out there is
647000	649000	Nintendo is going to release new hardware
649000	651000	At E3
651000	653000	Well, in a statement to website
653000	655000	Computerandvideogames.com
655000	657000	Nintendo came out, and this was posted on Friday
657000	659000	Nintendo came out and said, not happening
659000	661000	Okay, they basically said
661000	663000	Reps told this
663000	665000	CVG site on Friday
665000	667000	This reveal is not under consideration
667000	669000	So that's on record
669000	671000	They are not revealing new hardware at E3
671000	673000	Now, I don't know if that necessarily means
673000	675000	It's not a new console
675000	677000	Or anything like that
677000	679000	Because I still kind of go
679000	681000	It would not be outside of the realm of all possibility
681000	683000	For them to do another DS
683000	685000	Type of remake
685000	687000	I'm not necessarily saying
687000	689000	Like a new, like a 4DS
689000	691000	Or, I mean, right
691000	693000	Or a DS that has new powers
693000	695000	But I would think maybe like
695000	697000	What about like a reconfigured 2DS
697000	699000	That would not be outside the realm of all possibility
699000	701000	To me
701000	703000	But it's like them putting out something
703000	705000	To trump Wii U or whatever
705000	707000	Not happening
707000	709000	That's reverse
709000	711000	Fanboy wank
711000	713000	Yeah, I don't even see them redesigning the Wii U
713000	715000	Because you don't really need to make that
715000	717000	Console smaller, I mean, it's pretty small as it is
717000	719000	And maybe tweaking
719000	721000	The gamepad or something
721000	723000	But I just don't see them doing really
723000	725000	And why would you want to do that anyways
725000	727000	With everything out there
727000	729000	I think it would be, I mean, for Nintendo
729000	731000	To put out a new Wii U this soon
731000	733000	I mean, they can tweak the Wii U
733000	735000	The Game Boy Micro Micro
735000	737000	They can tweak the Wii U they have
737000	739000	I mean, I wouldn't think it's outside the realm
739000	741000	Of possibility that they somehow figure a way
741000	743000	To make the technology cheaper
743000	745000	Maybe they reduce the size of the gamepad
745000	747000	I don't know, I mean, again
747000	749000	Or increase the storage space or something
749000	751000	They reconfigure the Wii U that's out there
751000	753000	For like a Wii U
753000	755000	I don't even know what they'd call it
755000	757000	Super Wii U or Wii U 2
757000	759000	I don't even know what you would call this thing
759000	761000	Wii U Lite, Wii U
761000	763000	I don't know, yeah, just Wii U New
763000	765000	Or something, whatever they call it
765000	767000	I mean, they could slightly reconfigure it
767000	769000	But they're not going to throw everything out
769000	771000	Where none of the games are going to be playable anymore
771000	773000	We know Mario Kart 8, they're hedging a lot on that
773000	775000	And the new Smash Brothers
775000	777000	You know, I just
777000	779000	I don't know why people believe
779000	781000	That this is really going to be true
781000	783000	I don't know if the rumor is that they're saying
783000	785000	They're launching a system that's called the Fusion
785000	787000	That's going to play all these 3DS games
787000	789000	And stuff like that
789000	791000	Well, I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility
791000	793000	That Nintendo is going to look to marry
793000	795000	Their handheld console
795000	797000	And their home console
797000	799000	I don't think that's
799000	801000	Like, outside the realm of what is possible
801000	803000	And you see them moving closer and closer
803000	805000	To that with, what, the GBA games
805000	807000	You can play now on your
807000	809000	Wii U, right?
810000	812000	And you even said a long time ago
812000	814000	They're going to do DS or 3DS games on Wii U
814000	816000	And then they did, they're going to do DS games on Wii U
816000	818000	Yeah, it's going to happen
818000	820000	And I even think they're going to do it with the 3DS
820000	822000	Because they don't really care about 3D too much in those games
822000	824000	And they have the right aspect ratios
824000	826000	With your TV and your gamepad
826000	828000	To where you could do it
828000	830000	I mean, they say they can't emulate it
830000	832000	But, come on
832000	834000	They have emulators on PC that can run 3DS stuff
834000	836000	So, I don't buy that
836000	838000	Here's my other question
838000	840000	Why do people feel the need to lie about this shit
840000	842000	Going into E3?
842000	844000	Because they want hits
844000	846000	Because they want, you know, people
846000	848000	Some people get off on tricking people
848000	850000	And some people just want, you know
850000	852000	Page hits or something
852000	854000	Well, I mean, as far as page hits goes
854000	856000	I've seen some real cheap ass stunts for pages
856000	858000	Like, just even this week, on Twitter
858000	860000	There was a site that, and I'm not going to name the site
860000	862000	Because I'm not going to contribute to their
862000	864000	Cheap grab for hits
864000	866000	I didn't look to see if they ever apologized for it
866000	868000	But there was a website that a lot of World of Warcraft
868000	870000	Players kind of visited a lot
870000	872000	Because I think their roots were kind of in that
872000	874000	Or whatever, I see a lot of people in that community
874000	876000	That I follow because of Horde House
876000	878000	This site ran an article that was like
878000	880000	The top 15
880000	882000	Sexy girls wearing
882000	884000	Sexy girls holding controllers
884000	886000	Was the article
886000	888000	And it was literally like one of those
888000	890000	You click one for each picture
890000	892000	And it's just, it's sexy girls holding controllers
892000	894000	And sometimes provocatively
894000	896000	Sometimes wearing not so much clothing
896000	898000	Or whatever
898000	900000	It was just, it was a really gross way to try to like
900000	902000	Get hits, because a lot of these pictures
902000	904000	That were put up were from like charity
904000	906000	Events and so forth
906000	908000	And you know, it wasn't
908000	910000	It wasn't a super diverse
910000	912000	Group of women either
912000	914000	It's just, you know
914000	916000	It kind of reinforces certain
916000	918000	Stereotypes that I don't think are good
918000	920000	For gaming, so obviously
920000	922000	This is a really stupid thing that they did
922000	924000	That's the types of stuff that you see people do
924000	926000	For cheap hits
926000	928000	I mean, Buzzfeed has made an industry out of this
928000	930000	Right?
930000	932000	And sharing stuff on Facebook
932000	934000	Like, we could do more of that
934000	936000	On VOG if we wanted to, but there's just
936000	938000	There's certain lines I'm not gonna cross
938000	940000	You know what I mean?
940000	942000	So, that's that
942000	944000	Fifth dream in chat
944000	946000	Over at live.vognetwork.com says
946000	948000	Those sites seem to finally be dying
948000	950000	I don't know about that
950000	952000	Unfortunately, you know
952000	954000	It got a lot of people talking about it
954000	956000	And people checked out the article out of curiosity
956000	958000	I wouldn't be surprised at all if they didn't
958000	960000	But it just, I don't know, it really kind of
960000	962000	It irks me to know that
962000	964000	You know, E3 is looking for
964000	966000	Websites of a certain volume
966000	968000	And that's all they're looking for is a traffic volume
968000	970000	And they use these really archaic methods
970000	972000	Of measuring that traffic
972000	974000	That's what they're looking at to see who is media
974000	976000	And who's not for their site
976000	978000	And knowing that somebody is going to reach
978000	980000	These folks by putting pictures
980000	982000	That they don't even own in the first place
982000	984000	I mean, other debate aside
984000	986000	Of whether the pictures are appropriate or not
986000	988000	They don't even own these pictures in the first place
988000	990000	Of 15 sexy women with controllers
990000	992000	Like, knowing that that's how you do it
992000	994000	I don't know, this is kind of gross to me
994000	996000	Like, and it's like
996000	998000	I'm not willing to go there
998000	1000000	Just to feel
1000000	1002000	Special
1002000	1004000	In going to the show or whatever
1004000	1006000	Like, I am proud of the work that we do here at
1006000	1008000	And the
1008000	1010000	The commitment
1010000	1012000	That all of us, myself, Loki, DarkSakra
1012000	1014000	Have to it and having done it
1014000	1016000	For weeks and weeks and weeks and so forth
1016000	1018000	Like, I'm not going to stoop to those kind of levels
1018000	1020000	To meet these archaic
1020000	1022000	Qualification things
1022000	1024000	If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, fine
1024000	1026000	I won't get to tell you stories from E3
1026000	1028000	We won't get to do the interactive stuff
1028000	1030000	You can be spoon fed the same press release crap
1030000	1032000	That every other site is going to be running, whatever
1032000	1034000	But, you know, anyway
1034000	1036000	Sorry about that
1036000	1038000	Anyhow
1038000	1040000	Shane, you've been awfully quiet
1040000	1042000	Why do you think people
1042000	1044000	Want to lie about E3 stories?
1044000	1046000	Why do people lie about this stuff?
1046000	1048000	Because they want
1048000	1050000	Hits for their crappy sites
1050000	1052000	They just hide behind that
1052000	1054000	It's not always crappy websites
1054000	1056000	Yeah, it is
1056000	1058000	And a lot of times
1058000	1060000	They may be just trying to
1060000	1062000	Not even say educate guesses
1062000	1064000	But just try to take guesses about things
1064000	1066000	And that way if they're right, they can say
1066000	1068000	Hey look, we said that first
1068000	1070000	And that's supposed to give you some sort of credit
1070000	1072000	Oh yeah, the next call of duty
1072000	1074000	Is going to be on the Golden Gate Bridge, you guys
1074000	1076000	Now I'll just pull that out of my ass
1076000	1078000	And take a gamble
1078000	1080000	See what happens, right?
1080000	1082000	Yeah
1082000	1084000	Is that?
1084000	1086000	Anyway
1086000	1088000	I had to, I'm sorry
1088000	1090000	I know that's a sensitive subject, but I had to
1090000	1092000	Alright, anyhow
1092000	1094000	It's water under the bridge now
1098000	1100000	You know, you thought the usual suspects
1100000	1102000	Would be reporting on this news, but it is what it is
1102000	1104000	Alright, anyway
1104000	1106000	Let's get into our gaming weeks
1106000	1108000	The types of video games that we have been playing this week
1108000	1110000	And then we'll get into some more gaming news
1110000	1112000	I'll start with Shane
1112000	1114000	Dark Soccer's not here tonight, she usually goes first
1114000	1116000	But Shane, you're our guest
1116000	1118000	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1118000	1120000	I've been playing, and I'm currently playing
1120000	1122000	A lot of Pokemon
1122000	1124000	I am trying to complete my
1124000	1126000	Pokedex
1126000	1128000	That I've been technically working on for years now
1128000	1130000	I am 12
1130000	1132000	Pokemon short of the 718
1132000	1134000	needed
1134000	1136000	And I
1136000	1138000	Have been playing it way too much
1138000	1140000	Way, way, way, way, way, way, way
1140000	1142000	Too much
1142000	1144000	Now, why do you have to collect all
1144000	1146000	718 Pokemon?
1146000	1148000	Because the theme song said so
1148000	1150000	Way back in the day
1150000	1152000	And you gotta
1152000	1154000	You can't go against that
1154000	1156000	And B, you get this item
1156000	1158000	That makes it so you can find
1158000	1160000	Shinies easier
1160000	1162000	And that is what I want to do
1162000	1164000	And what does shiny Pokemon do?
1164000	1166000	They look shiny
1166000	1168000	They look different
1168000	1170000	What does shiny Pikachu look like?
1170000	1172000	Dark or yellow
1172000	1174000	That's it?
1174000	1176000	I get blue
1176000	1178000	And that is enough for me to want that
1178000	1180000	You make a big
1180000	1182000	It's not just you, but the Pokemon fandom in general
1182000	1184000	Makes this big stinking deal out of these shinies
1184000	1186000	And that's it. They look slightly different
1186000	1188000	That's it. Yep.
1188000	1190000	They used to have better stats back in the day
1190000	1192000	When they were first introduced
1192000	1194000	And now, no, it's just
1194000	1196000	That one might be slightly differently colored
1196000	1198000	Or sometimes they look really different because of their color
1198000	1200000	I was doing a livestream the other night
1200000	1202000	On Twitch of Final Fantasy 14
1202000	1204000	And this person was in the living room with me
1204000	1206000	And he was playing Pokemon
1206000	1208000	And he caught a shiny while I was on the stream
1208000	1210000	I was so happy
1210000	1212000	And he took over the stream with Pokemon talk
1212000	1214000	He's literally walking up to the camera
1214000	1216000	You told me to do it!
1216000	1218000	Because I wanted to know what the big freaking deal was
1218000	1220000	Because you're sitting over there going
1220000	1222000	I got a shiny!
1222000	1224000	And it was uglier
1224000	1226000	It's like some Pokemon look a lot better as shinies
1226000	1228000	But this one did not
1228000	1230000	It looked like somebody threw it in an oven
1230000	1232000	And took it out
1232000	1234000	Oh my god. What shiny did you get?
1234000	1236000	Swirlix
1236000	1238000	I don't even know what that is
1238000	1240000	It's the cotton candy Pokemon
1240000	1242000	Sounds like laundry detergent
1242000	1244000	So you are a Pokemon nerd
1244000	1246000	Of the highest caliber
1246000	1248000	Yes, I really am
1248000	1250000	You're 30 and playing Pokemon
1250000	1252000	Which is fine
1252000	1254000	I know a lot of folks that play Pokemon
1254000	1256000	But why after all these years are you still addicted to it?
1256000	1258000	It's still a fun game
1258000	1260000	It's a little bit like gameplay structure
1260000	1262000	That works every generation
1262000	1264000	Now it looks better on the 3DS
1264000	1266000	So I'm not going to give it up
1266000	1268000	It's fun to collect them all
1268000	1270000	Or frustrating
1270000	1272000	It's both of those F words
1272000	1274000	Alright
1274000	1276000	Anything else?
1276000	1278000	I played Final Fantasy 14
1278000	1280000	Skylanders
1280000	1282000	I'm a little bit infamous
1282000	1284000	And that's it
1284000	1286000	What have you been doing in Final Fantasy 14?
1286000	1288000	Playing Leviathan
1288000	1290000	Over and over
1290000	1292000	And that's the new fight
1292000	1294000	They patched in about 3 weeks ago
1294000	1296000	No, we're almost to 3 months
1296000	1298000	Is this the Leviathan patch really?
1298000	1300000	Holy crap
1300000	1302000	2.2 was Leviathan
1302000	1304000	2.3 is coming out in June
1304000	1306000	2.2 came out in April
1306000	1308000	End of March
1308000	1310000	Oh my gosh
1310000	1312000	Wow
1312000	1314000	Time flies
1314000	1316000	So I've been doing that
1316000	1318000	And getting my items from there
1318000	1320000	I want my water donkey
1320000	1322000	And some things to upgrade my items
1322000	1324000	That's it
1324000	1326000	Alright
1326000	1328000	We'll come back to Skylanders in a little bit
1328000	1330000	But we'll go over to Loki first
1330000	1332000	How was your gaming week?
1332000	1334000	I played nothing
1334000	1336000	Nothing?
1336000	1338000	What's up?
1338000	1340000	I've been coding
1340000	1342000	Oh that's right
1342000	1344000	Oh I've been putting stuff up on YouTube
1344000	1346000	Every now and then
1346000	1348000	Because I get bored of just looking at code
1348000	1350000	And I wanted to see some actual progress
1350000	1352000	So I'll take breaks from stuff
1352000	1354000	I was working on
1354000	1356000	I'm using this program
1356000	1358000	Called Cubicle
1358000	1360000	Which does voxels
1360000	1362000	To do the graphics
1362000	1364000	So I made some test stuff
1364000	1366000	It's hard looking at a box
1366000	1368000	And a box firing more boxes
1368000	1370000	Than another box
1370000	1372000	I wanted it to look like something
1372000	1374000	So I was just messing around
1374000	1376000	Learning the program a little bit
1376000	1378000	I made a ship
1378000	1380000	Just a really stupid looking missile
1380000	1382000	But I have video of it
1382000	1384000	Firing the missiles
1384000	1386000	Into big ol' volley
1386000	1388000	So you haven't been disconnected
1388000	1390000	From video gaming all together
1390000	1392000	It's just that you are right now obsessed
1392000	1394000	With this making your own game
1394000	1396000	I'm absolutely obsessed with it
1396000	1398000	That's what I've been spending all my time on
1398000	1400000	I was trying to play some Call of Duty this week
1400000	1402000	But unfortunately I missed
1402000	1404000	The people I play with
1404000	1406000	By a few minutes
1406000	1408000	Baby took longer to
1408000	1410000	Rock the sleep than
1410000	1412000	They normally did
1412000	1414000	So they didn't see me on
1414000	1416000	So they just said oh we're gonna call it
1416000	1418000	And I was like ahhhh I missed you
1418000	1420000	I checked a few minutes late
1420000	1422000	Unfortunately it didn't sync up there
1422000	1424000	So that's what I've been working on
1424000	1426000	And I actually got in touch with
1426000	1428000	Because my music that I've been
1428000	1430000	Picking and stuff I have no budget
1430000	1432000	So I have to pick free music
1432000	1434000	And that involves
1434000	1436000	A lot of Creative Commons songs
1436000	1438000	And so I've been spending
1438000	1440000	A lot of hours searching for Creative Commons
1440000	1442000	Work and I actually found
1442000	1444000	One that's gonna work perfectly for
1446000	1448000	The theme song
1448000	1450000	For the whole game
1450000	1452000	But the problem was it had some anime
1452000	1454000	Samples in there so I got in touch with the artist
1454000	1456000	Who actually is a huge fan of Shmups
1456000	1458000	And like that type of thing and he actually
1458000	1460000	Wants to score Shmups and stuff
1460000	1462000	So I'm like hey
1462000	1464000	Is there any way that you can make me a version of that
1464000	1466000	Song without the stuff in there? He's like
1466000	1468000	Yeah hell yeah! So I'm like
1468000	1470000	Sweet so that was the big
1470000	1472000	Exciting news today. I was gonna say you should put a call
1472000	1474000	You never know we might have listeners out there who are
1474000	1476000	Kinda musically like they might be
1476000	1478000	Amateur music just like your amateur
1478000	1480000	It's hard because I actually had someone
1480000	1482000	Hit me up on Twitter and I don't even think that they
1482000	1484000	Like knew anything they just was doing
1484000	1486000	Like a general search for like people
1486000	1488000	Making games or something
1488000	1490000	Just like some of that music just didn't work
1490000	1492000	It was like a lot of hip hop stuff
1492000	1494000	And it's hard to say like what
1494000	1496000	Exactly I'm looking for because it's basically
1496000	1498000	I have to listen to the song and if I can imagine
1498000	1500000	Like okay this is gonna
1500000	1502000	It just has the right feel to it
1502000	1504000	Didn't you try to say like pendulum meets
1504000	1506000	Daft Punk meets or anything? No that's not even
1506000	1508000	That and actually you know it's funny because I was looking
1508000	1510000	For you know that kind of
1510000	1512000	Pendulum drum
1512000	1514000	Drum and bass stuff and I actually found a lot of it
1514000	1516000	Just recently
1516000	1518000	It's actually I think it's another genre
1518000	1520000	Of drum step so it's a cross between
1520000	1522000	Drum and bass and dubstep they have a lot of that
1522000	1524000	So I did find a lot of that stuff
1524000	1526000	It's just a lot of it
1526000	1528000	This creative common stuff
1528000	1530000	Especially the electronic music and
1530000	1532000	Even there's a ton of dubstep for
1532000	1534000	One and two like
1534000	1536000	All the dance songs sound
1536000	1538000	Very similar like they use
1538000	1540000	Almost the same it's not like the same
1540000	1542000	Instrument but the way that they
1542000	1544000	Are structured is just like
1544000	1546000	Oh my god I'm just like listening to the same
1546000	1548000	Fucking song for 50 times
1548000	1550000	It's just ridiculous but that
1550000	1552000	Yeah it's what I've been working on is just that I've been
1552000	1554000	I'm trying to get to
1554000	1556000	Well I'm at a point now where I need to start making some
1556000	1558000	Of the assets because
1558000	1560000	You know try not to explain too much
1560000	1562000	About the game because I wanted to you know
1562000	1564000	I'm still working out stuff but
1564000	1566000	Basically it's like if you
1566000	1568000	Crossed a shmup with
1568000	1570000	Borderlands so you've got you know
1570000	1572000	It's a 2D shmup but your
1572000	1574000	Ships are customizable in every
1574000	1576000	Way so you can customize what weapons
1576000	1578000	Are on it the way it looks and all that stuff
1578000	1580000	And each thing has different features and
1580000	1582000	Stuff so you can literally play this game like
1582000	1584000	You can't almost any other shmup
1584000	1586000	You can play it like
1586000	1588000	In Igaruga or you can play it like Gradius
1588000	1590000	Or you can play it like whatever and so it's kind of catering
1590000	1592000	It towards you know however you want
1592000	1594000	Now I know that sounds absolutely complicated Bobby's always
1594000	1596000	Saying you know don't do something complicated
1596000	1598000	But you know what fucking simple games
1598000	1600000	Are fucking boring to me so
1600000	1602000	I'm going to do something complicated and you know what
1602000	1604000	It's actually worked out fine I've had no problems figuring out
1604000	1606000	How to code anything it's just it takes
1606000	1608000	A lot of time and just like right now
1608000	1610000	It's interesting to me too to hear about
1610000	1612000	All this little shit that goes into games that
1612000	1614000	Sometimes people forget like like the soundtrack
1614000	1616000	You might want to make a game and you
1616000	1618000	Might want to but you might not know the first thing
1618000	1620000	You have no budget that's hard because
1620000	1622000	You got it you know otherwise you're going to
1622000	1624000	Find free music that people want to have in
1624000	1626000	You know they use their music and then
1626000	1628000	On top of that like if you want to have a big soundtrack
1628000	1630000	You got to pay someone to make that music
1630000	1632000	Or you have to pay artists to do that kind of stuff
1632000	1634000	Alright you know Bobby is talking
1634000	1636000	About this in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
1636000	1638000	Live on this Sunday night Bobby
1638000	1640000	Says Loki is being Peter Molyneux
1640000	1642000	Right now you will be able to plant a tree on the
1642000	1644000	Ship and it will grow and Dungeon
1644000	1646000	Buster says will the ship have a dog
1646000	1648000	The ship is
1648000	1650000	Not going to have a dog and no
1650000	1652000	I hate to be compared to Peter Molyneux
1652000	1654000	But no seriously
1654000	1656000	That's what I'm you know I have set up
1656000	1658000	That's what I've been building is just this customization
1658000	1660000	Through where you can
1660000	1662000	Well I'm trying to do all the framework and then when I'm done
1662000	1664000	I can basically okay create a model
1664000	1666000	And put stats on it and that's it that's all I have to do
1666000	1668000	Is create models and stats
1668000	1670000	And be done with it
1670000	1672000	So that's why I'm trying to do all the coding
1672000	1674000	First but I'm getting to the point now where I need
1674000	1676000	I have where it creates
1676000	1678000	The ship from the parts and I don't have
1678000	1680000	Parts yet I just have this like stand in
1680000	1682000	Ship model and a bunch of blank stuff
1682000	1684000	And so I'm running into
1684000	1686000	Errors because it can't find these
1686000	1688000	Generic parts so I need to create a set of generic
1688000	1690000	Parts first so I can do more testing on that
1690000	1692000	And then finish what I'm coding
1692000	1694000	So I'm taking breaks now to
1694000	1696000	You know well last night like I was like
1696000	1698000	I'm too tired to actually code on stuff I'm just gonna listen
1698000	1700000	To some music so I listen to
1700000	1702000	About 200 Creative Commons tracks
1702000	1704000	And so I've been picking out
1704000	1706000	Stuff and just
1706000	1708000	You know like okay this works because
1708000	1710000	Creative Commons you know what was it
1710000	1712000	CC by is basically
1712000	1714000	All you have to do is attribute
1714000	1716000	The artist and you can use it in a
1716000	1718000	Commercial product you don't have to pay
1718000	1720000	Them you don't have to do anything they just that's it
1720000	1722000	There's not a lot of that out there and you have to
1722000	1724000	Also know where to look and it's hard like
1724000	1726000	I
1726000	1728000	It's a lot of searching and a lot of it's
1728000	1730000	Just like ugh
1730000	1732000	Maybe there's some artists out there who might
1732000	1734000	Want to help so hit Loki up on Twitter
1734000	1736000	Sure I mean in the mean time like I said
1736000	1738000	I'm gonna post stuff on my YouTube page
1738000	1740000	And I'm posting stuff on
1740000	1742000	You know Twitter
1742000	1744000	And like I'm not going into really any details
1744000	1746000	Like I know what the title of the game is but I'm not
1746000	1748000	Gonna say and I'm not gonna go into really
1748000	1750000	More details about anything else cause
1750000	1752000	I just
1752000	1754000	I don't want it like I just feel like I'll
1754000	1756000	Jinx it if I do that yeah so
1756000	1758000	I like hearing how you're
1758000	1760000	It helps too because you
1760000	1762000	Sometimes are a big critic of video games
1762000	1764000	So having to feel the pain of making one a little bit
1764000	1766000	I think it's gonna be very good for you well there's a lot of stuff like you know
1766000	1768000	It's like I made a save file
1768000	1770000	I'm like holy crap I made a save file
1770000	1772000	It's amazing you know it's like
1772000	1774000	It's like stupid
1774000	1776000	It doesn't even do anything right now
1776000	1778000	Other than yeah okay what's it saving
1778000	1780000	I don't know well it's saving nothing right now
1780000	1782000	It's a bunch of blank you know data but
1782000	1784000	You know it's made a save file
1784000	1786000	It's a save file it's so amazing
1786000	1788000	Going to the chat room
1788000	1790000	Bob Blackwolf is saying to be fair Loki
1790000	1792000	Who did give up multiple times already
1792000	1794000	But he says in parenthesis I'm actually
1794000	1796000	Really proud of Loki I just don't want to admit it because
1796000	1798000	Then I'd be a softy
1798000	1800000	I was working on a complete different game
1800000	1802000	And I'll even tell you what it was cause
1802000	1804000	Unfortunately it was you know it got
1804000	1806000	Lost when my computer crashed last time
1806000	1808000	I was working on another like F-Zero
1808000	1810000	Racer type game I was like what should my first
1810000	1812000	Game be I don't know I'll make a game that someone else
1812000	1814000	Wants to play okay Rob likes F-Zero okay I'm gonna
1814000	1816000	Get an F-Zero game so
1816000	1818000	I was gonna make an F-Zero game
1818000	1820000	That wasn't quite F-Zero but you know whatever
1820000	1822000	And funny enough actually I was looking at some stuff
1822000	1824000	The other day G1
1824000	1826000	No someone actually first off someone made a game that has
1826000	1828000	The title that I was originally gonna call it
1828000	1830000	And then there was another person that made another game that
1830000	1832000	Looks exactly like the game I was gonna
1832000	1834000	Make I was like ah well whatever you know
1834000	1836000	I started over and this was the concept that I'm
1836000	1838000	Doing now was actually one I had
1838000	1840000	Like about four or five different things I was throwing around
1840000	1842000	And at first it was like okay
1842000	1844000	This is gonna be way too hard I'm not gonna be able to do this
1844000	1846000	So I gave up on it went to the F-Zero thing
1846000	1848000	And then when I lost it all I'm like well crap
1848000	1850000	I don't even remember how I got on to doing a 2D
1850000	1852000	Shmoop again but um
1852000	1854000	Somehow I got on to doing that and then
1854000	1856000	That's where I stuck with it and so
1856000	1858000	It's been fun it's just
1858000	1860000	It's a lot of work and a lot of like
1860000	1862000	I have to be in the right mindset to be able to
1862000	1864000	Code stuff cause like you know I'll stay
1864000	1866000	Up late I'll be really tired you know
1866000	1868000	A lot of Red Bull so uh
1868000	1870000	It's just getting in the right mindset
1870000	1872000	And I wish I had more to show
1872000	1874000	It's just you know right now it looks very plain
1875000	1877000	Alright well good luck to you
1877000	1879000	We'll be looking for updates in the coming weeks
1879000	1881000	And now we'll understand why you're not playing as many
1881000	1883000	Of other people's games so good luck
1883000	1885000	Um alright let me uh
1885000	1887000	Talk about my gaming week cause I've played a variety
1887000	1889000	A variety of new games this week actually
1889000	1891000	Um I played and Shane
1891000	1893000	Brought this up earlier so I'll get right into this
1893000	1895000	I played Skylanders for the first time
1895000	1897000	I had never played these games before
1897000	1899000	And it was kinda like Shane with Del Taco
1899000	1901000	As we were talking about earlier in the show
1901000	1903000	I was kinda like I don't like Skylanders
1903000	1905000	And I haven't played it I just know I don't like it
1905000	1907000	Because uh you know they want to sell you all these figures
1907000	1909000	It's a cash grab and da da da da da
1909000	1911000	So Shane set it up for me and he's like
1911000	1913000	I don't own too many Skylanders
1913000	1914000	I don't
1914000	1916000	And he dumps 16 of them out on the table
1916000	1918000	That's 16 across 3 games
1918000	1920000	Were any of them Spyro?
1920000	1922000	No
1922000	1924000	Care about Spyro
1924000	1926000	Neither does Skylanders
1926000	1928000	So yeah so I played Skylanders which specifically
1928000	1930000	I played the new one that's on Playstation 4
1930000	1932000	So Skylanders Swap Force right which is the third game
1932000	1934000	On the Playstation 4 so you and I played that
1934000	1936000	And there's actually we caught
1936000	1938000	The whole thing on a livestream and I even put it up on my
1938000	1940000	Youtube channel at Rob Roberts Plays
1940000	1942000	If you want to see like us playing it for the first time
1942000	1944000	I gotta admit it was a pretty good
1944000	1946000	Looking game like you know it's on
1946000	1948000	Playstation 4 so the graphics were good and there's like
1948000	1949000	These scenes
1949000	1951000	Which is why I specifically got it on PS4
1951000	1953000	There's these scenes where you're like racing down
1953000	1955000	A tree branch and around that looks like
1955000	1957000	Something out of like a Sonic game or something
1957000	1959000	It actually looks really good
1959000	1961000	And the quality of that's pretty good
1961000	1963000	It's geared towards kids so you get a lot of loud colors
1963000	1965000	Cartoony vibe, big text, short
1965000	1967000	Sentences, things like that, the game is really
1967000	1969000	Geared towards kids
1969000	1971000	The gameplay itself is very platformy
1971000	1973000	Like you know
1973000	1975000	Somebody had called it Diablo
1975000	1977000	Asked to me but that's
1977000	1979000	I think the earlier games are more like that
1979000	1981000	Probably
1981000	1983000	It wasn't so platformy back then
1983000	1985000	It reminded me like a lot of like
1985000	1987000	A kiddie version of
1987000	1989000	Gauntlet which is fine cause that
1990000	1992000	Like you smash pots
1992000	1994000	To find gold and you use the gold
1994000	1996000	To upgrade your characters you know
1996000	1998000	It's pretty basic platforming stuff
1998000	2000000	And you know as a basic platformer
2000000	2002000	It works pretty well you know Shane and I
2002000	2004000	There were some neat little co-op games in it like to unlock doors
2004000	2006000	You go through these little puzzles
2006000	2008000	Where you try to join the green box
2008000	2010000	And the blue box but you want to collect
2010000	2012000	Little bolts on the way like it's a little puzzle thing
2012000	2014000	And they're fun to play co-op so
2014000	2016000	Yeah it's a fun little platformer
2016000	2018000	I will admit overall I liked
2018000	2020000	Skylanders more than I thought I would
2020000	2022000	That being said
2022000	2024000	It is completely obvious
2024000	2026000	There's a huge cash grab
2026000	2028000	Going on here
2028000	2030000	Especially with the in-game advertisements
2030000	2032000	Yeah tell us about this Shane
2032000	2034000	Tell us about the in-game advertisements
2034000	2036000	So to get like the final power for each character
2036000	2038000	There's these soul gems and they're littered throughout the levels
2038000	2040000	You go and collect one and
2040000	2042000	It'll be one for some random character
2042000	2044000	And like the one we saw was for Popthorn
2044000	2046000	Well I don't have Popthorn
2046000	2048000	Thankfully they let you preview
2048000	2050000	A video of Popthorn so you can see what
2050000	2052000	You're missing out on
2052000	2054000	Mommy mommy mommy
2054000	2056000	So that's kind of dumb but
2056000	2058000	Yeah and
2058000	2060000	There's these little gates in the levels
2060000	2062000	And some of them will be like fire doors
2062000	2064000	So you have to have a fire guy to get through the door
2064000	2066000	Or you'll have an ice leaf door
2066000	2068000	Where you have to have one ice guy
2068000	2070000	And one leaf guy or cause it's swap force
2070000	2072000	You have an ice top and a leaf bottom
2072000	2074000	Or whatever you have to be both elements
2074000	2076000	To get through that door
2076000	2078000	Here's the thing though and this is very important
2078000	2080000	It's not like those rooms
2080000	2082000	Lead to full fledged levels
2082000	2084000	They really don't
2084000	2086000	It's like one room
2086000	2088000	But the thing is that room's gonna have
2088000	2090000	What? More coins
2090000	2092000	Maybe a hat which is their version of armor
2092000	2094000	Basically that changes your stats
2094000	2096000	If you want to really collect them all
2096000	2098000	So to speak you're gonna have to have one
2098000	2100000	Skylander of each element
2100000	2102000	Now thanks to swap force
2102000	2104000	Not only are there elements
2104000	2106000	But there's powers
2106000	2108000	Oh and don't forget the giant boxes too
2108000	2110000	Oh yeah and the giants
2110000	2112000	You only need one giant
2112000	2114000	So now you have to have a
2114000	2116000	Fire railroad or whatever
2116000	2118000	You have to get a railroad guy
2118000	2120000	What the hell else was there?
2120000	2122000	There's stealth, there's the tornado ones
2122000	2124000	And you were giving me such crap
2124000	2126000	For not being able to go to so many places
2126000	2128000	I was cause I was like why can't we go through that door
2128000	2130000	You're like I don't have the figure
2130000	2132000	You don't have the right figure
2132000	2134000	No you were missing a lot of them
2134000	2136000	Yeah because I do not buy all of them
2136000	2138000	I buy the ones I like
2138000	2140000	And that's not always a whole bunch
2140000	2142000	So if you're the type that's OCD
2142000	2144000	And has to complete everything
2144000	2146000	Do yourself a favor
2146000	2148000	Stay the fuck away from Skylanders
2148000	2150000	Stay the fuck away because
2150000	2152000	It's gonna drive your OCD bonkers
2152000	2154000	Yeah cause they already announced what was in the new game
2154000	2156000	It has 60 new characters to collect
2156000	2158000	Collect
2158000	2160000	Like it's in Pokemon
2160000	2162000	Yeah 60 new characters
2162000	2164000	Each character is about 10 bucks
2164000	2166000	So that's $600 worth of characters
2166000	2168000	Right there
2168000	2170000	And I bet the trap team
2170000	2172000	The bigger ones are gonna be more expensive
2172000	2174000	And then 40 new enemies
2174000	2176000	To capture which means
2176000	2178000	I'm sure that each one of those gems
2178000	2180000	Maybe you're gonna only be able to store
2180000	2182000	One enemy per gem or something
2182000	2184000	And maybe they'll be cheap and be like $5 each
2184000	2186000	That's how they get you
2186000	2188000	That all being said
2188000	2190000	As far as like a platforming experience
2190000	2192000	I actually had a decent time
2192000	2194000	I would go so far as to say
2194000	2196000	I might buy the game for myself
2196000	2198000	If I can find a deal on it
2198000	2200000	That's what I do like
2200000	2202000	I didn't buy Swap Force when it first came out
2202000	2204000	I waited until it was like
2204000	2206000	On sale for 35 bucks
2206000	2208000	Which is 40 off the original price
2208000	2210000	But I'm gonna repeat to myself over and over and over
2210000	2212000	I don't have to open every door
2212000	2214000	Only buy the ones you think that are cool
2214000	2216000	And then you can always go back
2216000	2218000	Cause the figures work up through the series
2218000	2220000	So if you have an old figure
2220000	2222000	You can always bring it into the new game
2222000	2224000	Find an old figure
2224000	2226000	Remember we were at that place you hate yesterday
2226000	2228000	And they had like the triple packs
2228000	2230000	They had ones that were on sale for like
2230000	2232000	10 bucks so that was 3 characters
2232000	2234000	From an older game that you could use in the new one
2234000	2236000	For 10 bucks
2236000	2238000	But they don't level up power wise up to the same as the newer characters
2238000	2240000	That's true but who
2240000	2242000	Like I think that falls along the same lines
2242000	2244000	With the people that collect all of them
2244000	2246000	I like that little air bird I was playing as
2246000	2248000	I know that was one of the newer characters
2248000	2250000	I just need him
2250000	2252000	Yeah free ranger
2252000	2254000	It just depends
2254000	2256000	Having played Disney Infinity is just as bad
2256000	2258000	They do advertise the same thing
2258000	2260000	And a lot of times you have to have a full set of characters
2260000	2262000	In order to be able to unlock
2262000	2264000	Like stupid things
2264000	2266000	Oh yeah and the blind packs are fucking terrible
2266000	2268000	I bought a lot of those
2268000	2270000	But yeah it was
2270000	2272000	It was not worth it
2272000	2274000	But the blind pack thing is not so bad
2274000	2276000	Those are really only for the toy box stuff
2276000	2278000	And you don't really need them
2278000	2280000	Now let me say this
2280000	2282000	The one thing I didn't say about Skylanders
2282000	2284000	Is the figures themselves
2284000	2286000	I have to admit
2286000	2288000	I'm going to call something out when it's bad
2288000	2290000	But I'm going to call something out when it's good
2290000	2292000	And I've got to admit
2292000	2294000	Those figures like the 12 year old boy and me
2294000	2296000	Really love the figures that light up
2296000	2298000	When you put them on the portal
2298000	2300000	They're more expensive
2300000	2302000	Well whatever they're cool
2302000	2304000	When you put them on the thing
2304000	2306000	Like the one guy with his little jewel
2306000	2308000	The prism
2308000	2310000	Is that it?
2310000	2312000	His little arms light up and I was like
2312000	2314000	That's fucking cool
2314000	2316000	That's fucking magic man
2316000	2318000	I was like that's cool
2318000	2320000	And do they change the portal
2320000	2322000	The only time you're going to see it light up
2322000	2324000	Is when you're playing the game
2324000	2326000	The prism dude
2326000	2328000	The only time you see him
2328000	2330000	Is when he's on the portal right
2330000	2332000	When it lights up
2332000	2334000	Or is there other ways to get him to light up
2334000	2336000	Not when you're playing the game
2336000	2338000	No no that's the only way
2338000	2340000	But it's also like those light core ones
2340000	2342000	In the game they light up more than the regular ones
2342000	2344000	Like you could get a regular one
2344000	2346000	And a light core one
2346000	2348000	And the light core one will play slightly differently
2348000	2350000	Because it's a light core one
2350000	2352000	Which is neat
2352000	2354000	So the bottom line on Skylanders for me
2354000	2356000	Is it's not awful
2356000	2358000	It's not even bad
2358000	2360000	It's a decent platformer
2360000	2362000	It's a fine platformer
2362000	2364000	But know what you're getting into with this crap
2364000	2366000	And don't feel OCD about it
2366000	2368000	And realize that there really isn't that much
2368000	2370000	Behind all those doors
2370000	2372000	And there's a great resale market too
2372000	2374000	Yeah I mean can you tell the story about that one figure
2374000	2376000	Yeah I have one that I
2376000	2378000	Picked up while I was working one time
2378000	2380000	And I knew that it was rare
2380000	2382000	It's just an ugly variant of a figure
2382000	2384000	It's not painted right
2384000	2386000	It's stoned
2386000	2388000	It looks like granite
2388000	2390000	And that's a legit
2390000	2392000	Variant that they put out in packs sometimes
2392000	2394000	And that thing
2394000	2396000	Can sell up to according to what I saw
2396000	2398000	$750 unopened
2398000	2400000	Which is how I have it
2400000	2402000	Yeah that's because of those OCD people
2402000	2404000	Like oh I've got to get every single variant
2404000	2406000	Like your ex right?
2406000	2408000	Yeah exactly
2408000	2410000	And he didn't get that one
2410000	2412000	There's like one that they did
2412000	2414000	For the holidays for Activision
2414000	2416000	Blizzard employees too
2416000	2418000	I mean I thought it looked pretty cool
2418000	2420000	And I know that one sells for a lot also
2420000	2422000	And that was the only way you could get it was if you were an employee at that party
2422000	2424000	And Bobby says he got one at E3
2424000	2426000	That apparently is an early good seller too
2426000	2428000	So yeah
2428000	2430000	Alright so anyway there you go
2430000	2432000	That's Skylanders
2432000	2434000	Not as horrible as some people think
2434000	2436000	But yes it's a cheap cash grab
2436000	2438000	Be very careful
2438000	2440000	Just wait for your kids
2440000	2442000	I'm really surprised they have it
2442000	2444000	Well there was the
2444000	2446000	Rumble blast
2446000	2448000	That wasn't done
2448000	2450000	They didn't execute that well at all
2450000	2452000	No
2452000	2454000	The figures were like
2454000	2456000	An inch tall
2456000	2458000	They were really crappy figures
2458000	2460000	I don't know what the hell they were thinking
2460000	2462000	They didn't do it right
2462000	2464000	If they were to do it right
2464000	2466000	I'm trying to get 718
2466000	2468000	In a stupid game right now
2468000	2470000	It's so futile they release a new game every year
2470000	2472000	And then it's just you know you have more
2472000	2474000	Pokemon you gotta you know
2474000	2476000	Yeah but at least now they have that bank feature
2476000	2478000	In this game where I can put all these guys into
2478000	2480000	The Pokemon bank and when the new game comes out
2480000	2482000	I can bring them back in so I never have to
2482000	2484000	Find them again
2484000	2486000	Hope that save doesn't corrupt
2486000	2488000	Oh don't say that
2488000	2490000	They all go to the cloud
2490000	2492000	All my Pokemon are in the cloud
2492000	2494000	As long as the cloud doesn't burst
2494000	2496000	Or you get hacked
2496000	2498000	Chinese or Russian hackers take all your Pokemon
2498000	2500000	They took my Pokemon
2500000	2502000	I would declare war on that over country
2502000	2504000	Alright
2504000	2506000	Other games I played this week
2506000	2508000	I played a demo for a game called Child of Light
2508000	2510000	That's brand new
2510000	2512000	I did that one too I forgot about that one
2512000	2514000	You played it? I did the demo
2514000	2516000	You turned it off after like 5 minutes
2516000	2518000	I liked it I actually liked it quite a bit
2518000	2520000	The thing I liked about it a lot
2520000	2522000	Is that it did a lot of
2522000	2524000	Different stuff I don't see in RPGs
2524000	2526000	Very often like you know a lot of RPGs
2526000	2528000	Kind of the same
2528000	2530000	Same thing over and over
2530000	2532000	But Child of Light did some really neat stuff where
2532000	2534000	The right stick controls this
2534000	2536000	Extra little monster that can float around
2536000	2538000	The battle, well I say monster but it's really an ally
2538000	2540000	But this extra little fairy or whatever
2540000	2542000	They can float around the battlefield and like
2542000	2544000	Freeze monsters or
2544000	2546000	Heal your people
2546000	2548000	I thought that was like a really neat mechanic
2548000	2550000	It was a really stupidly simple thing but
2550000	2552000	I can't think of another RPG I've seen that in
2552000	2554000	Which I really liked that
2554000	2556000	Yeah that was neat but
2556000	2558000	The gameplay like the actual
2558000	2560000	Combat system I thought was crap
2560000	2562000	Well it's very basic RPG
2562000	2564000	You know either you like it or you don't
2564000	2566000	They really should have just made it a platforming game
2566000	2568000	Everything else about the game was great I can't deny that
2568000	2570000	It's a really gorgeous game Music is great
2570000	2572000	Music is great and
2572000	2574000	Everything rhymes which is interesting
2574000	2576000	Just a little way to do it but
2576000	2578000	Yeah and that's cool but
2578000	2580000	It's a decent combat system if you're gonna do that
2580000	2582000	See now here's what I disagree with
2582000	2584000	Actdeft in chat says
2584000	2586000	Child of Light reminds me of Bravely Default but better
2586000	2588000	And by better I mean could
2588000	2590000	Wow
2590000	2592000	I do not think Child of Light was better than Bravely Default at all
2592000	2594000	Bravely Default is amazing and Child of Light
2594000	2596000	Is a piece of crap
2596000	2600000	A really pretty sounding and pretty looking piece of crap
2600000	2602000	I did not think that rhymes
2602000	2604000	I didn't think it was a piece of crap at all but Bravely Default
2604000	2606000	Bravely Default on one hand was a very familiar game
2606000	2608000	Bravely Default had a very familiar sense about it
2608000	2610000	And it did do some new things within that
2610000	2612000	With the whole street passing and some of that stuff that Bravely Default does
2612000	2614000	Bravely Default
2614000	2616000	Bravely Default was like
2616000	2618000	Bravely Default was like
2618000	2620000	Bravely Default was like going to see
2620000	2622000	Bravely Default was like going to see
2622000	2624000	Bravely Default was like going to see
2624000	2626000	A new Harry Potter movie
2626000	2628000	That comes out in the series
2628000	2630000	Like you know what you're gonna get
2630000	2632000	You've read the book already
2632000	2634000	It's kind of the standard stuff
2634000	2636000	Whereas Child of Light was different
2636000	2638000	It was more of an art house indie film
2638000	2640000	It's doing some new things
2640000	2642000	You don't necessarily know what to suspect
2642000	2644000	People respond differently to it
2644000	2646000	Shane hated it
2646000	2648000	Are we saying that Bravely Default would be like Labyrinth
2648000	2650000	Whereas Child of Light is like Pan's Labyrinth
2650000	2652000	But did you hate Pan's Labyrinth?
2652000	2654000	I didn't really care for it
2654000	2656000	It was very visually pretty
2656000	2658000	Ok then yes
2658000	2660000	That is actually a really good example
2660000	2662000	Labyrinth is my favorite movie of all time
2662000	2664000	Pan's Labyrinth
2664000	2666000	They're the people that like
2666000	2668000	Stupid Child of Light
2668000	2670000	And probably Ni No Kuni
2670000	2672000	So they're awful people
2672000	2674000	Whatever
2674000	2676000	So yeah Child of Light I played that
2676000	2678000	I did not actually get the full game yet
2678000	2680000	But I probably will to be honest
2680000	2682000	Other than that I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I talked about last week
2682000	2684000	Shane really enjoys watching me play NES Remix 2
2684000	2686000	It's over now though so I'm very sad
2686000	2688000	He says it's over because I beat all the
2688000	2690000	Well I didn't beat all the stages
2690000	2692000	I will not fucking play Wario's Woods
2692000	2694000	I will not
2694000	2696000	I tried with Wario's Woods
2696000	2698000	What the fuck is that game seriously?
2698000	2700000	And I like puzzlers
2700000	2702000	But Wario's Woods has got to be one of the worst
2702000	2704000	ones I've ever played
2704000	2706000	I would put that up there with Tetris on the Playstation
2706000	2708000	If you've ever played the Playstation port
2708000	2710000	PS1 port of Tetris
2710000	2712000	It's god awful
2712000	2714000	And I would put Wario's Woods up there with that
2714000	2716000	It's that bad
2716000	2718000	So I refuse to play those stages
2719000	2721000	Shane watched me get really frustrated
2721000	2723000	It was so funny
2723000	2725000	The Kirby stages
2725000	2727000	Were the worst to me
2727000	2729000	Where he had to float up and not get hit
2729000	2731000	By the spikey things
2731000	2733000	And it was like 20 minutes of him getting hit by the spikey things
2733000	2735000	And I was laughing so hard
2735000	2737000	It's a bummer you can't
2737000	2739000	Live stream that gameplay
2739000	2741000	And the whole internet could have had a lull at that
2741000	2743000	But it's so frustrating
2743000	2745000	Just remind me seriously
2745000	2747000	To bring my
2747000	2749000	Capture thing
2749000	2751000	I have a capture thing too
2751000	2753000	But it's delayed
2753000	2755000	Oh my god bring it over
2755000	2757000	And he can play that stage
2757000	2759000	Over and over again
2759000	2761000	What was another one that you sucked at?
2761000	2763000	There were a lot of them
2763000	2765000	ActDeft is screaming at me in chat
2765000	2767000	Wario's Woods is awesome
2767000	2769000	It's different but it's good
2769000	2771000	Now I'm talking about Kirby
2771000	2773000	I don't dislike Kirby though
2773000	2775000	I like Kirby
2776000	2778000	I dislike what they did in NES Remix 2
2778000	2780000	But no it was fun
2780000	2782000	I gotta say
2782000	2784000	Spoiler alert for NES Remix 2
2784000	2786000	I don't think this is a big deal
2786000	2788000	But the very last stage
2788000	2790000	In the second set of remixes
2790000	2792000	The very last stage is
2792000	2794000	You save the princess as the princess
2794000	2796000	Meaning you beat Bowser
2796000	2798000	In Mario Brothers 3
2798000	2800000	With Super Mario Brothers 2 princess
2800000	2802000	They showed them the trailer
2802000	2804000	Well then it's not that big of a spoiler
2804000	2806000	But you know where she does the floaty
2806000	2808000	And you can't get hit because if you get hit she dies
2808000	2810000	She's a one hit kill or whatever
2810000	2812000	She's a woman
2812000	2814000	Stop it, not cool
2814000	2816000	But the frog Mario thing
2816000	2818000	Was the same way
2818000	2820000	You get hit one hit and they die
2820000	2822000	But anyway with the princess you get hit once
2822000	2824000	And she dies
2824000	2826000	But what's really funny is that when you beat it
2826000	2828000	She goes through the door
2828000	2830000	And gets to the castle
2830000	2832000	And it's the princess meets the princess
2832000	2834000	Sorry but you are in another castle
2834000	2836000	Or something like that
2836000	2838000	It changes the words
2838000	2840000	So that it's an old play on that joke
2840000	2842000	I'm sorry but our princess is in another castle
2842000	2844000	But then it's like sorry but you are in another castle
2844000	2846000	Ha ha ha just kidding
2846000	2848000	And then that's the end of the stage
2848000	2850000	You know what would have been a good remix
2850000	2852000	Is something to do with the part in Punch-Out
2852000	2854000	Where you're on the bike and your trainer is running after you
2854000	2856000	That could have been a fun stage
2856000	2858000	They didn't do enough with Punch-Out in that game
2858000	2860000	They didn't do enough with Punch-Out
2860000	2862000	I don't think there was a single remix stage that you just punched out
2862000	2864000	No I think it was like
2864000	2866000	You know one of the last remixes
2866000	2868000	Where it was like eight different stages
2868000	2870000	The lights went out
2870000	2872000	Silly
2872000	2874000	That would be funny to have Punch-Out where he's just
2874000	2876000	Punching other things in the air
2876000	2878000	Punch the
2878000	2880000	Well they did like Mario 2 is in there
2880000	2882000	So why couldn't they have put
2882000	2884000	Wart in there instead of King Hippo
2884000	2886000	So you'd have to punch Wart or something
2886000	2888000	That would have been cool
2889000	2891000	Punching the eggs from Birdo or something
2891000	2893000	Yeah
2893000	2895000	Or punching ducks from Duck Hunt
2895000	2897000	That would be hilarious
2897000	2899000	Go to our chat room
2899000	2901000	As soon as Shane cracked that joke
2901000	2903000	Rama's like no Jamie tonight
2903000	2905000	Where's Dark Soccer to smack him into place
2905000	2907000	No Jamie is off for the night
2907000	2909000	She wouldn't smack me
2909000	2911000	She would give me a look
2911000	2913000	And I would say I'm sorry
2913000	2915000	Made a huff yes
2915000	2917000	And then I've been like let's go play Final Fantasy 14
2918000	2920000	Alright
2920000	2922000	She might be listening be careful
2922000	2924000	No I just said my apologies
2924000	2925000	I know I know
2925000	2927000	He's not serious guys
2927000	2929000	Anyhow
2929000	2931000	I think that's really all I have for my gaming week
2931000	2933000	I mean otherwise Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3
2933000	2935000	All the same stuff I always play
2935000	2936000	So yeah
2936000	2938000	I will give a cheap plug for my Twitch channel though
2938000	2940000	Because ever since I got my new computer
2940000	2942000	I've been doing a lot more with it
2942000	2944000	And your PS4 you've been doing a lot more with
2944000	2946000	And my PS4 yeah I've been streaming on both
2946000	2947000	Rob Roberts
2947000	2949000	Oh that's something that you should have said
2949000	2951000	When we were doing Skylanders you could not see chat
2951000	2953000	And I wonder if that's something to do with the game
2953000	2955000	I don't know
2955000	2957000	Yeah they updated because the Playstation update
2957000	2959000	Changed some things like the Share Factory is really cool
2959000	2961000	I gotta say
2961000	2963000	If you haven't checked out Share Factory
2963000	2965000	Check it out because it makes movie making really easy
2965000	2967000	That was a great move on Sony's part
2967000	2969000	To really get people to share more of their
2969000	2971000	Gameplay footage that's being saved
2971000	2973000	It's really a powerful little program
2973000	2975000	But they also upgraded the Twitch functionality
2975000	2977000	Now I don't like the new layout
2977000	2979000	Because they put chat on the side
2979000	2981000	So you could I guess see more of it
2981000	2983000	Instead of more than two lines
2983000	2985000	You could see a little more
2985000	2987000	But it word wraps
2987000	2989000	It doesn't word wrap at all really
2989000	2991000	And then in the bottom it's just elapsed time
2991000	2993000	I liked it better with the scrolling messages at the bottom
2993000	2995000	And the elapsed time
2995000	2997000	But you can get rid of those borders completely
2997000	2999000	And just have the camera
2999000	3001000	You couldn't do that before
3001000	3003000	So that's pretty cool
3004000	3006000	That's the one feature I would like to see
3006000	3008000	Because in Final Fantasy XIV I could put the camera
3008000	3010000	Over the chat box so that
3010000	3012000	The people in my free company
3012000	3014000	When I'm live streaming
3014000	3016000	They don't feel like they have to censor themselves
3016000	3018000	Because what's being said is broadcast on the internet
3018000	3020000	Or whatever so
3020000	3022000	Bobby Blackwolf in the chat says
3022000	3024000	I'm on Raw TV
3024000	3026000	On a new line
3026000	3028000	That's what it looks like when you're chatting on the
3028000	3030000	Twitch TV now
3030000	3032000	Quick housekeeping
3032000	3034000	I don't have a whole lot to add
3034000	3036000	I will say follow us on Twitter
3036000	3038000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R
3038000	3040000	Also Facebook, facebook.com slash
3040000	3042000	OrangeLoungeRadio and Google Plus
3042000	3044000	Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio
3044000	3046000	I do want to mention a few things with VOG Network
3046000	3048000	Again our show tapes live
3048000	3050000	The Voice of the Geeks Network
3050000	3052000	That's vognetwork.com
3052000	3054000	If you haven't checked out the new TV reviews section
3054000	3056000	TV reviews by Critical Myth
3056000	3058000	I really urge you guys to check it out
3058000	3060000	Because the crew over at that show
3060000	3062000	Critical Myth has been really diligently every week
3062000	3064000	Like they're pushing like 10 to 15
3064000	3066000	New reviews of TV shows to our site
3066000	3068000	It's like all this new content, it's great
3068000	3070000	And you can interact with it
3070000	3072000	And when you interact with it you might receive some
3072000	3074000	Loot and the loot helps you
3074000	3076000	Get raffle tickets
3076000	3078000	And the raffle tickets
3078000	3080000	We do have a raffle, the raffle's been on hiatus
3080000	3082000	For a few months just because you know we fund it
3082000	3084000	Completely out of pocket so
3084000	3086000	Sometimes we would rather
3086000	3088000	Pay to keep the site running than pay for a new raffle
3089000	3091000	But we do have a raffle this month and it is
3091000	3093000	I believe season 1 of Arrow
3093000	3095000	The new series on the CW on Blu-ray
3095000	3097000	So if you want to win that
3097000	3099000	You're curious to check it out, you want to win it
3099000	3101000	Or maybe you're a fan of Arrow and you just want to get it for free
3101000	3103000	Because you don't want to buy it because I don't think it's a cheap Blu-ray
3103000	3105000	Go enter the raffle
3105000	3107000	And you can get participation points at VOG Network
3107000	3109000	Just for listening to this program
3109000	3111000	Somewhere in the show you're going to hear
3111000	3113000	If you're listening live you can check in on the site
3113000	3115000	As the show is broadcasting live
3115000	3117000	But if you're listening on the podcast at some point during the show
3117000	3119000	You're going to hear that little doodle-a-doo
3119000	3121000	And then it will say to register participation
3121000	3123000	The pass phrase is and then you type in that phrase
3123000	3125000	You get your five points and that's five tickets into the raffle
3125000	3127000	Really cool stuff
3127000	3129000	And that's just a little something we give our
3129000	3131000	Fans and participators
3131000	3133000	Just to try and increase awareness of the site
3133000	3135000	And all the cool things that we have there
3135000	3137000	So check that out once again
3137000	3139000	vognetwork.com
3139000	3141000	Alright, do remember though
3141000	3143000	The raffle is opt-in
3143000	3145000	You have to go say
3145000	3147000	Yes, I want to enter the raffle
3147000	3149000	You are not entered automatically
3149000	3151000	So you're going to want to check that out at vognetwork.com
3151000	3153000	Slash raffle
3153000	3155000	You are not entered automatically
3155000	3157000	And I believe this particular contest is US residents only
3157000	3159000	I am so sorry to our overseas listeners
3159000	3161000	It's just that the cost of mailing
3161000	3163000	And all that, we can't do everything
3163000	3165000	But we do try once in a while to have something
3165000	3167000	Digital or something
3167000	3169000	That is much more lightweight
3169000	3171000	That we can send overseas
3171000	3173000	We have done some overseas
3173000	3175000	Unbelievable ones
3175000	3177000	So I just want to make sure you guys know
3177000	3179000	It's not that we don't like our overseas listeners
3179000	3181000	Because we love them very much
3181000	3183000	But the reality is the cost to include you guys
3183000	3185000	Is a lot more
3185000	3187000	So check that out, vognetwork.com
3187000	3189000	Slash raffle
3189000	3191000	Alright, now let's get into some gaming news
3191000	3193000	There's plenty of it
3193000	3195000	Despite the fact that we're only a few weeks away from E3
3195000	3197000	There's still lots coming
3197000	3199000	So Loki, start us off
3199000	3201000	Yes, if you thought that Comcast
3201000	3205000	Well, EA is looking to Comcast to sign a deal
3205000	3209000	That would make EA published games available on Comcast
3209000	3212000	This doesn't make it confusing enough
3212000	3215000	X1 television operating system
3215000	3217000	Yes, there's the X1 Comcast box
3217000	3219000	And the Xbox One
3219000	3221000	And both now play games
3221000	3223000	Wow, confusing
3223000	3225000	I guess they're saying that
3225000	3228000	The X1 is an HTML5 based streaming platform
3228000	3230000	And I guess it has
3230000	3232000	Now, I thought that was only a DVR
3232000	3234000	But I guess they're saying it's gonna have
3234000	3236000	Internet cloud support
3236000	3238000	Apps and that kind of stuff
3238000	3240000	But now you'll be able to stream
3240000	3242000	Games to it
3242000	3244000	The lineup so far is probably gonna include
3244000	3246000	A new FIFA, Madden, Monopoly
3246000	3248000	And Plants vs. Zombies
3248000	3250000	So not necessarily like
3250000	3252000	Battlefield 4 or anything like that
3252000	3255000	But more of kind of a
3255000	3258000	Not casual, but just kind of for everybody type stuff
3259000	3262000	Of course, they're still figuring out revenue share
3262000	3264000	And release date stuff
3264000	3266000	But yeah, so you'll be able to
3266000	3268000	Another platform you'll be able to stream games to
3268000	3272000	I just think, man, the name of that is just fucking
3272000	3275000	X1 and Xbox One
3275000	3277000	And now they both do games
3277000	3280000	I wonder if that will cause some legal ruffles
3280000	3282000	But it's Xfinity
3282000	3284000	I think Xfinity had the X1
3284000	3286000	Before the Xbox One
3287000	3289000	Wow, okay, that's gonna be interesting
3289000	3292000	Yeah, the newer Comcast boxes
3292000	3294000	Are pretty powerful little things
3294000	3297000	They're basically Apple TV type units
3297000	3299000	They're little computer things
3299000	3300000	They're really powerful
3300000	3302000	The old clunker we have
3302000	3304000	Was one of the first HD units
3304000	3306000	So that's what it does, but that's about it
3306000	3308000	And I think it does DVR too
3308000	3310000	But we don't pay for it
3310000	3313000	I think these do the room to room DVRs
3313000	3314000	And that kind of stuff
3314000	3316000	So they have all that functionality
3316000	3317000	But I wouldn't imagine
3317000	3318000	Oh yeah, the new ones do everything
3318000	3319000	I'm surprised
3319000	3322000	I don't think you're gonna find a Netflix app on this thing
3322000	3323000	Or anything like that
3323000	3325000	You might in the future
3325000	3326000	For money, yeah
3326000	3328000	What doesn't have Netflix nowadays?
3328000	3329000	Well, I would think though
3329000	3333000	Comcast, a pay-per-view content provider
3333000	3336000	Would probably be less likely to want to include
3336000	3339000	A service that you can get same content
3339000	3341000	No, Comcast and Netflix are playing nice nice now
3341000	3343000	Thanks to Net Neutrality being fucked over
3343000	3345000	Netflix is paying Comcast money
3345000	3347000	Which is bull, absolute bull
3347000	3350000	But what can we do right now
3350000	3352000	Besides petition our lawmakers
3352000	3354000	Which is what people are trying to do
3354000	3355000	And need to do a little more of
3355000	3358000	To push the importance of this issue
3358000	3360000	That we need Net Neutrality
3360000	3362000	Or this type of wheeling and dealing
3362000	3364000	We're gonna be the losers in it
3364000	3365000	And when you guys bitch about
3365000	3366000	It costs too much
3366000	3368000	Or Comcast sucks because they limit
3368000	3369000	And I can't do it
3369000	3372000	Then maybe you should have complained about it before
3372000	3374000	How long until we see someone streaming a game
3374000	3377000	To an Xbox One through an Xbox One
3378000	3380000	Well, if we are able to stream games at all anymore
3380000	3383000	That aren't, you know, Comcast approved
3384000	3385000	Who knows
3385000	3388000	Hey, that's why EA's getting into the ground floor of that, right?
3388000	3389000	Yeah
3389000	3390000	I guess
3391000	3393000	They know evil when they see it
3393000	3394000	So they're attracted to it
3394000	3397000	Both, of course, winners of the worst company in America
3397000	3398000	Yeah, right
3398000	3399000	A few times over
3399000	3401000	So, you know, they're in good company
3401000	3402000	Oh boy
3402000	3405000	So, alright, you know, I'm all for more games
3405000	3406000	Getting out there and everything
3406000	3409000	But this is just kind of one of those things where it's like
3409000	3411000	This is why I need Net Neutrality
3411000	3415000	Because I don't want this to be the only way to play games
3415000	3417000	That makes sense
3417000	3418000	So
3419000	3421000	Yeah, I
3421000	3423000	This is all still rumor status, though, right?
3423000	3426000	Although it's one of those things that seems very plausible
3426000	3427000	I don't think it's rumor status
3427000	3428000	I think that they're actually working on it
3428000	3430000	It's just, I don't think it's gonna be that big of a thing
3430000	3432000	It's just because they're gonna be streaming games
3432000	3434000	It doesn't mean a lot of people are gonna take advantage of it
3434000	3438000	Because I think people that are gonna play like, you know, Plants vs. Zombies or something
3438000	3441000	Aren't probably gonna do it through a cable box
3441000	3444000	They're probably gonna do it on a PC or tablet or whatever
3444000	3445000	I think it's just
3446000	3448000	It's more exposure to those games, I guess
3448000	3450000	And, you know, exposure's not terrible
3450000	3453000	It's just, you know, they have to weigh the cost and benefit, I guess
3453000	3456000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
3457000	3460000	Rama says, just what we need, a multimedia cable box, pass
3460000	3462000	Well, that's kind of already here, I think
3462000	3463000	But Rama also says
3463000	3464000	I think that was a joke
3464000	3468000	The X1 box was made by Motorola, which is now ARIS
3468000	3469000	That sounds like Yaris
3469000	3471000	Um, Loki, here's an FAQ
3471000	3473000	And links you to something there about more information
3473000	3475000	ARIS won survivor one year
3476000	3478000	No, this one's spelled A-R-R-I-S
3478000	3479000	Oh, okay
3479000	3480000	Alright
3480000	3483000	And let's see, Kaijuto says, Netflix sounds like they want to become a cable network
3483000	3485000	And not what people love about it
3485000	3491000	I don't know, I mean, I sort of saw the Netflix originals not really wanting to be their own network
3491000	3495000	Just so much as, you know, I always thought it was kind of a way to kind of compete with cable
3495000	3498000	I think that's, it's just, you know, why do I need to get Netflix
3498000	3500000	You know, save contents on TV
3500000	3502000	Well, it's because you can get this other stuff
3502000	3505000	You know, they want to, it's like, why do I want to subscribe to HBO
3505000	3507000	Because there's a show I want to watch on it
3507000	3509000	Or there's a couple shows I want to watch on it
3509000	3510000	It's not like a ton of
3510000	3511000	I want to see Game of Thrones boobies
3511000	3513000	You know, they have tons of movies on there
3513000	3516000	But they're trying to be like, you know, an HBO or Showtime
3516000	3520000	And yes, the way they can do that is more boobies, more skinimax
3520000	3522000	So that's what they need on Netflix
3522000	3524000	They do have the women in prison show
3524000	3529000	That's not entirely skinimax, but yeah, I understand what you're saying, but
3529000	3533000	Alright, well speaking of television and so forth
3533000	3537000	You know what, Netflix isn't the only one that wants to put their own programming out there
3537000	3540000	I think you guys remember, Xbox is getting into this
3540000	3543000	We talked at length last week about the whole, they dug up ET in the desert
3543000	3546000	That was all for an Xbox original
3546000	3549000	Xbox wants to do original television
3549000	3552000	Somewhere in between major game releases
3552000	3556000	They're talking about premium television experiences
3556000	3562000	And you know, they hired some big TV executives to kind of do all this stuff
3562000	3566000	And yeah, they want to do these Xbox originals
3566000	3570000	And things out of the Xbox entertainment studios to hold you over between major game releases
3570000	3573000	And see, that's another thing that they're trying to do
3573000	3576000	Like this, you know, they want to be an HBO or something
3576000	3579000	So that you would buy their system so you can watch this content
3579000	3581000	I just don't see that happening
3581000	3585000	By the way, they are going to be bringing to the Xbox originals
3585000	3587000	The Halo television series
3587000	3591000	Every Street United, which is an unscripted, so reality show
3591000	3594000	Series of eight 30 minute episodes and a one hour finale
3594000	3596000	It's soccer, soccer players
3596000	3599000	Bonnaroo, which is the music and arts festival
3599000	3600000	They're doing something with that
3600000	3602000	And then Signal to Noise, Atari Game Over
3602000	3604000	These are a film documentary series
3604000	3607000	And Atari Game Over is about the whole stuff in the ground
3607000	3609000	And then something called Humans
3609000	3613000	Which is produced with UK broadcaster Channel 4
3613000	3616000	And it's going to be an hour long eight episode series
3616000	3618000	So, hmm
3618000	3620000	So yeah, they're going to start cranking these out
3620000	3625000	By the way, they say that everything is fair game for these TV shows
3625000	3628000	Talking at a press event in San Francisco
3628000	3630000	The Vice President of Xbox Entertainment Studios, Jordan Levin
3630000	3638000	Said that games like Forza Motorsport, Fable, Gears of War
3638000	3641000	Not off the table when it comes to making TV shows
3641000	3644000	I thought you meant when you said everything is fair game
3644000	3648000	I was like, okay, so it's going to have Halo porn and Forza porn
3648000	3651000	No, if they really wanted to make money
3651000	3654000	Isn't Forza kind of car porn already?
3654000	3658000	Well, there are a lot of exhaust pipes you can do things with
3658000	3659000	What?
3659000	3660000	Gas tanks
3660000	3661000	What?
3661000	3663000	I'm just giving them ideas
3663000	3664000	You have issues
3664000	3665000	For free, dang it
3665000	3667000	You have issues
3667000	3670000	So are you guys going to be turning to your TV to watch
3670000	3674000	Or are you turning to your Xbox to watch TV shows pretty soon?
3675000	3676000	Let me go get an Xbox
3676000	3678000	Oh wait, no, I don't care for an Xbox
3678000	3680000	I think they're coming to 360 as well
3680000	3681000	I don't have a 360
3681000	3682000	Oh, you got rid of it?
3682000	3684000	Long time ago, I don't care about Xbox
3684000	3685000	We have to
3685000	3687000	Am I going to my Xbox to watch TV shows?
3687000	3690000	Maybe if my boxie dies
3690000	3692000	And then I'll watch Netflix on it
3692000	3694000	But I don't think
3694000	3696000	It's just like that Halo movie
3696000	3698000	The Ford on the Don and stuff
3698000	3700000	They're like, oh, Halo movie
3700000	3703000	But it looks like a sci-fi original movie
3704000	3706000	I'd be curious about this
3706000	3708000	I want to see the documentaries
3708000	3710000	Gaming documentaries might be really interesting
3710000	3711000	Especially this Atari one
3711000	3713000	Even though I gave my thoughts last week
3713000	3714000	About what's the biggest one
3714000	3716000	When it leaks out to YouTube or whatever
3716000	3719000	But you were just talking about piracy
3719000	3722000	I could do that with the TV shows today too
3722000	3724000	But that's not how you're supposed to do it, Logie
3724000	3726000	But I have a 360
3726000	3729000	I can get up to the TV and watch the Atari documentary
3729000	3731000	I'm sure they'll all be on Windows 8 too
3731000	3733000	Because they're trying to get people to buy Windows 8
3733000	3737000	Yeah, I know all about that
3737000	3739000	Let's move on with some more news
3739000	3741000	Shane, what do you have for us tonight?
3741000	3744000	Since I just said how big a fan of Microsoft I am
3744000	3747000	Let's talk about how they are committed
3747000	3750000	To making more interactive programs
3750000	3754000	You can't accurately finger quote when you're on the radio
3754000	3756000	Interactive programming
3756000	3759000	In the same vein as 1 vs 100
3759000	3761000	Like they did on the Xbox 360
3761000	3763000	What's her name?
3763000	3765000	This is ads
3765000	3768000	Nancy Tellum, the president of entertainment and digital media
3768000	3771000	Said that there is now infrastructure there
3771000	3775000	I think it was just Xbox One, right?
3775000	3778000	Every time I hear her name I think of Soulja Boy
3778000	3780000	Why?
3780000	3784000	Because it wasn't one of his songs like you tell him
3784000	3786000	Or something like that
3786000	3787000	Oh my god
3787000	3788000	I don't know
3788000	3790000	Please be seated
3790000	3791000	Shane
3791000	3796000	Anyway, I guess the infrastructure there for the 1 and the 360
3796000	3801000	It's there so they know now how to accurately make these style games
3801000	3806000	They're looking into not remaking 1 vs 100
3806000	3812000	But a game in the similar vein that you can get a lot of people together and have fun
3812000	3814000	I never got to play it
3814000	3815000	I don't know how much fun it was
3815000	3816000	I hear it was great
3816000	3817000	I loved it
3817000	3819000	That was like the best thing that ever happened on the 360
3819000	3821000	When they got rid of it I was so pissed
3821000	3825000	If they said 1 vs 100
3825000	3827000	And I know they're saying not that specifically
3827000	3829000	But if they said for whatever reason 1 vs 100
3829000	3831000	Is coming out to the Xbox One
3831000	3833000	And it's going to be out on such and such date
3833000	3835000	And here are the screenshots
3835000	3837000	I would go out and buy an Xbox One
3837000	3839000	I love the game that much
3839000	3841000	And that would push me over the edge
3841000	3842000	Because there's already things on Xbox One
3842000	3843000	I'm kind of like
3844000	3846000	I'm kind of on the edge
3846000	3848000	I know there's some of the stuff coming
3848000	3850000	But I'm not ready to put down the credit card just yet
3850000	3852000	But if 1 vs 100 was coming out
3852000	3853000	You know I would
3853000	3857000	Didn't they have a poker game that came out that flopped?
3857000	3859000	I don't think it flopped
3859000	3861000	It flopped with me
3861000	3865000	It flopped in terms of the same sort of buzz that 1 vs 100
3865000	3867000	I think it has its fans
3867000	3869000	I know there are people that play it
3869000	3871000	There's also fans of Ni No Kuni
3872000	3876000	But I don't think it's necessarily as huge as 1 vs 100 was
3876000	3878000	I love the idea of game shows
3878000	3881000	But I don't know what other game shows could they do
3881000	3883000	But then again when we first heard about 1 vs 100
3883000	3884000	It was like what are they going to do?
3884000	3886000	It's going to be a lot of miming stuff
3886000	3887000	So like Wheel of Fortune
3887000	3889000	So you have to like spin the wheel
3889000	3890000	Or Price is Right
3890000	3891000	And you go like this
3891000	3892000	Like you're spinning the big wheel
3892000	3896000	Price is Right would legit be a lot of fun actually
3896000	3897000	That would be a good one
3897000	3898000	Family Feud
3898000	3900000	That could be one
3901000	3902000	Survey says
3902000	3904000	Press your luck you just go like this
3904000	3906000	However many people said the answer
3906000	3909000	Don't they have like a live version of You Don't Know Jack
3909000	3912000	Yeah a long time ago they had with Paul Rubens
3912000	3913000	It was okay
3913000	3915000	Just go back to the old night
3915000	3917000	I always fucking bring this up on the show
3917000	3919000	Whenever we talk about 1 vs 100
3919000	3921000	This was the highlight in PC gaming for me
3921000	3924000	Was when Berkley Systems was around doing stuff like Acrophobia
3924000	3926000	Acrophobia I used to play the crap out of that
3926000	3929000	Just put Acrophobia on Xbox One
3930000	3931000	I would be happy
3931000	3932000	I don't think I'd play it now
3932000	3933000	I'd play it now
3933000	3937000	Especially if you could still have the After Dark Rooms
3937000	3940000	Where every acronym was just like
3940000	3942000	Fuck, Cunt, Cock
3942000	3947000	Like it's just every dirty word acronym you could think of
3947000	3949000	I miss the After Dark Rooms
3949000	3951000	And they had other games too
3951000	3954000	Like there was the one where you went up and down the tower
3954000	3955000	I don't know that one
3955000	3956000	Yeah there was other stuff too
3956000	3958000	So there's ideas out there
3958000	3960000	Just jack all the old Berkley Systems games
3960000	3961000	They can do it
3963000	3964000	Alright
3964000	3965000	Anyway
3965000	3967000	Let's move on
3967000	3968000	Loki what do you have
3968000	3970000	Let's go to another company
3970000	3971000	Alright
3971000	3972000	So
3972000	3973000	Nintendo
3973000	3975000	Of course
3975000	3980000	They're not doing the stage presentation like they did a couple years ago
3980000	3983000	They're going to be doing a livestream press event
3983000	3985000	Or a Nintendo Direct type thing
3985000	3988000	That's scheduled I guess to air on
3988000	3992000	Was it 9 AM Pacific Time 12 PM Eastern
3992000	3994000	On June 10th
3994000	3997000	And the Nintendo Treehouse will be
3997000	3999000	I guess conducting that
3999000	4003000	And they're also going to have livestream unscripted game demos
4003000	4007000	From their E3 booth during the show as well
4007000	4010000	And I hope to hell they're using multiple providers
4010000	4012000	And not just Ustream
4012000	4015000	Because that was the worst part of E3 last year
4015000	4017000	Was Ustream's Nintendo Direct was awful
4017000	4019000	I thought I did
4019000	4021000	Didn't they have YouTube as well
4021000	4023000	I think they did later
4023000	4026000	Yeah YouTube and then I think now they're using Twitch
4026000	4028000	Twitch can handle that crap
4028000	4030000	So they need to just use Twitch
4030000	4034000	YouTube I think they also do livestream YouTube at the same time
4034000	4036000	Well here's an idea
4036000	4037000	Let's check the press release
4037000	4040000	Because it might say if they're going to be doing
4040000	4042000	Twitch or whatever
4042000	4044000	No
4044000	4046000	It might be too early for those specifics
4046000	4048000	They did say though
4048000	4050000	One of the things that was kind of a little teaser video
4050000	4052000	Is that they're going to be doing this Super Smash Brothers thing
4052000	4054000	At Best Buy
4054000	4056000	Remember like last year you could test out stuff from Best Buy
4056000	4058000	You know play different games and things
4058000	4060000	For the Wii U
4060000	4062000	Well now they're going to be doing that with Smash Brothers U
4062000	4064000	Or Smash Brothers for the Wii U
4064000	4066000	At certain Best Buys
4066000	4068000	So you can check that out as well
4068000	4070000	And they go along with that
4070000	4074000	They're going to be hosting a tournament at E3 for Smash Brothers
4074000	4076000	So
4076000	4078000	I wonder how much of the final roster
4078000	4080000	Will get for Smash Brothers by E3
4080000	4082000	Because the 3DS one comes out this summer
4082000	4084000	Whenever that time period really is
4084000	4086000	So the rosters are supposed to be the same
4086000	4088000	So
4088000	4090000	I would imagine the final roster
4090000	4092000	Is out at E3
4092000	4094000	If the game is coming out in the summer
4094000	4096000	Final roster at E3 with maybe one or two surprises
4096000	4098000	Probably not hidden characters if there are any
4098000	4100000	Yeah
4100000	4102000	So
4102000	4104000	I think that's
4104000	4106000	That's what you expect at E3 I think
4106000	4108000	Interesting they're putting so much focus on Smash Brothers
4108000	4110000	It's their big game
4110000	4112000	Mario Kart 8 is out at that point
4112000	4114000	I'm wondering if Zelda is not coming out this year
4114000	4116000	Because of the lack of focus so far
4116000	4118000	Because of the fact that they pushed Smash Brothers to fall
4118000	4120000	I'm wondering if Zelda is coming out this year
4120000	4122000	I'm wondering if Zelda is coming out this year
4122000	4124000	Because they're expecting Smash Brothers to fall
4124000	4126000	I'm wondering if that was the original
4126000	4128000	I'm wondering if they were expecting
4128000	4130000	Smash Brothers to be released in the summer
4130000	4132000	And have Zelda for quarter 4
4132000	4134000	I don't think
4134000	4136000	Zelda was ever going to be this year
4136000	4138000	Or do you think maybe because those are
4138000	4140000	Two separate genres that they might not really care
4140000	4142000	They could still release both because they did that
4142000	4144000	With Wind Waker and the new Mario
4144000	4146000	I think Zelda's
4146000	4148000	Holiday 2015 people
4148000	4150000	I think you guys are being way too optimistic
4150000	4152000	About how fast they're going to crank that out
4152000	4154000	Zelda's Holiday 2015
4154000	4156000	I'm sure they'll put out Bayonetta 2
4156000	4158000	I was going to say
4158000	4160000	That's the other big thing they've been talking about
4160000	4162000	That's not going to sell systems I'm sorry
4162000	4164000	It won't
4164000	4166000	I love the game but I would not buy a Wii U
4166000	4168000	For that game
4168000	4170000	But will you buy the game if you already have a Wii U?
4170000	4172000	No
4172000	4174000	Well I bet a lot of people disagree with you and will
4174000	4176000	I'll buy it
4176000	4178000	And I think Nintendo needs to not just sell systems
4178000	4180000	They need to be able to sell games
4180000	4182000	And especially a game that wasn't
4182000	4184000	Necessarily made in house by Nintendo
4184000	4186000	I mean kinda, sorta
4186000	4188000	Well they also have their Dicey Warriors
4188000	4190000	Zelda game too that's supposed to be coming out
4190000	4192000	At some point, that'll probably be summer as well
4192000	4194000	I don't know, we'll see
4194000	4196000	But yeah, so
4196000	4198000	Invitational tournament that's going to run
4198000	4200000	From June 10th through 12th
4200000	4202000	During E3
4202000	4204000	Alright well we mentioned there
4204000	4206000	That before E3 happens Mario Kart 8
4206000	4208000	Will be happening and a big
4208000	4210000	Nintendo Direct came out this week that
4210000	4212000	Talked pretty much all about what we can
4212000	4214000	Expect with the launch including a $330
4214000	4216000	Wii U bundle that will
4216000	4218000	Come with Mario Kart 8
4218000	4220000	It will have the 32 gig
4220000	4222000	Black Wii U and a red
4222000	4224000	Wii U wheel and a Mario Wii remote plus
4224000	4226000	As we mentioned a little bit about
4226000	4228000	Earlier in the show
4228000	4230000	Here's the part that I don't think anybody was expecting
4230000	4232000	All copies of Mario
4232000	4234000	Kart 8, this is how big this game is
4234000	4236000	To Nintendo and they want to make sure it succeeds
4236000	4238000	No matter what they have to do
4238000	4240000	And this is huge
4240000	4242000	All copies of Mario Kart 8
4242000	4244000	Come with a free download code
4244000	4246000	For one of four Wii U
4246000	4248000	Games, if you register the game
4248000	4250000	On Club Nintendo before July 31st
4250000	4252000	Which anybody with an internet's gonna do
4252000	4254000	You're gonna get a code for a
4254000	4256000	Free copy of New Super Mario Brothers U
4256000	4258000	Wind Waker HD
4258000	4260000	Peekman 3
4260000	4262000	Or Wii Party U
4262000	4264000	Here's a pro tip
4264000	4266000	Don't pick Wii Party U
4266000	4268000	It's not a bad game
4268000	4270000	But like the
4270000	4272000	Box one comes with a little attachment
4272000	4274000	For your controller that makes it a lot more fun
4274000	4276000	To play
4276000	4278000	Well I think a lot of Nintendo fans I know
4278000	4280000	Already own the other three
4280000	4282000	Even I already own New Super Mario Brothers U
4282000	4284000	So I'm probably gonna do Wind Waker
4284000	4286000	Just because Peekman doesn't
4286000	4288000	I've never really been super interested in that game
4288000	4290000	Sorry I know some people are really into it
4290000	4292000	Even though
4292000	4294000	But in Europe by the way
4294000	4296000	They have more choices
4296000	4298000	I don't know why they got more but they did
4298000	4300000	Because in Europe you can get Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate
4300000	4302000	Nintendo Land, Wonderful 101
4302000	4304000	Sonic Lost World
4304000	4306000	Which would have been the one I would get if I could get it here
4306000	4308000	Mario and Sonic the Olympic Winter Games
4308000	4310000	And Game and Wario
4310000	4312000	All those extra ones in Europe
4312000	4314000	In addition to?
4314000	4316000	It's like ten choices in Europe
4316000	4318000	That was Game and Wario
4318000	4320000	It's a really decent game
4320000	4322000	But it won't last you very long
4322000	4324000	Like most WarioWare games
4324000	4326000	Multiplayer information coming out of the Direct
4326000	4328000	Twelve people can play at once
4328000	4330000	Voice chat will be available
4330000	4332000	Good job Nintendo
4332000	4334000	You did it!
4334000	4336000	You did it!
4336000	4338000	Finally!
4340000	4342000	You can choose from four modes
4342000	4344000	Worldwide, Regional, Friends, and Tournament
4344000	4346000	Does that mean voice chat
4346000	4348000	Is going to be in the public matches?
4348000	4350000	I could have sworn
4350000	4352000	Hey Nintendo!
4352000	4354000	Like I watched that Direct
4354000	4356000	I thought the voice chat was really only for lobby stuff
4356000	4358000	I don't think it was for
4358000	4360000	When you're actually racing
4360000	4362000	It doesn't matter even if it's just lobby
4362000	4364000	Oh my gosh
4364000	4366000	I really hope you can mute people
4366000	4368000	Also some new items revealed
4368000	4370000	The Super Horn
4370000	4372000	And the Crazy Eight
4372000	4374000	Which will whirl eight different items that you unleash
4374000	4376000	Awesome, it's protection against blue shells
4376000	4378000	You're right
4378000	4380000	That is pretty cool
4380000	4382000	I think you could just make them as rare as they were in Mario Kart 64
4382000	4384000	Also
4384000	4386000	Last but not least
4386000	4388000	More characters announced
4388000	4390000	Baby Rosalina will be a character as well
4390000	4392000	And
4392000	4394000	Pink Gold Peach
4394000	4396000	What the fuck is a Pink Gold Peach?
4396000	4398000	I've heard of rose gold
4398000	4400000	Pink Gold Peach
4400000	4402000	I can't help
4402000	4404000	But I can't help but think of that scene
4404000	4406000	From Project Runway
4406000	4408000	Where she's like
4408000	4410000	I'm going to use this blood orange
4410000	4412000	And it cuts to the scene of the guy going
4412000	4414000	She's so pretentious, that blood orange
4414000	4416000	Shut up, it's fucking red
4416000	4418000	I can't help but think of that
4418000	4420000	When we talk about Pink Gold Peach
4420000	4422000	Which in reality
4422000	4424000	Pink Gold Peach is like
4424000	4426000	Metal Mario
4426000	4428000	But instead of metal peach, it's Pink Gold Peach
4428000	4430000	It's the heavyweight peach
4430000	4432000	It's terrible is what it is
4432000	4434000	All these baby characters
4434000	4436000	And all this metal Mario
4436000	4438000	Metal Mario is not a fucking character
4438000	4440000	It's a texture swap
4440000	4442000	It's not a fucking new character
4442000	4444000	Come on
4444000	4446000	Branch out a little bit
4446000	4448000	Yes, I understand it's called Mario Kart
4448000	4450000	But throw in a Zelda level
4450000	4452000	And have two Link or something like that
4452000	4454000	I was a little pissed there's no Birdo
4454000	4456000	It looks like Birdo got cut
4456000	4458000	Or Birdo
4458000	4460000	Fuck, there's a ton of different things
4460000	4462000	I would have much rather had Birdo than
4462000	4464000	Blood Orange Peach
4464000	4466000	They should have gone back and picked random enemies
4466000	4468000	Mouser would have been cool
4468000	4470000	I do love the fact
4470000	4472000	They put all the Koopa kids in there
4472000	4474000	But it makes it hard for me to pick between
4474000	4476000	Lemmy, Larry or Toad
4476000	4478000	What about a Goomba?
4478000	4480000	What about a Goomba, why not?
4480000	4482000	They have no arms
4482000	4484000	How are they supposed to drive?
4484000	4486000	They could use their feet but then what's pushing
4486000	4488000	The gas pedal
4488000	4490000	Is it two Goombas?
4490000	4492000	Nope, it's tank style
4492000	4494000	Despite all this crap we're giving it
4494000	4496000	I am so there and I am so playing
4496000	4498000	Wendy O Koopa
4498000	4500000	On fucking Toad's Highway
4500000	4502000	The day this thing comes out
4502000	4504000	Oh, and thank you
4504000	4506000	For mentioning Toad's Highway
4506000	4508000	Because I would like to say
4508000	4510000	While Nintendo has done all this fantastic shit
4510000	4512000	Making the game look awesome
4512000	4514000	And they brought back Battle Mode
4514000	4516000	What the fuck did they do to Battle Mode?
4516000	4518000	Hey guys, you know
4518000	4520000	We could totally take all these really kick ass
4520000	4522000	Battle Mode tracks that we had
4522000	4524000	But no, instead we're gonna take
4524000	4526000	Just the regular tracks
4526000	4528000	They're all fucking loops that they slightly tweaked
4528000	4530000	And that's what they are
4530000	4532000	That you play Battle Mode on a fucking track
4532000	4534000	Because god forbid
4534000	4536000	It would be so damn hard to
4536000	4538000	Bring Block Fortress in or something
4538000	4540000	I'm gonna take a wait and see approach
4540000	4542000	I'm gonna take a wait and see approach
4542000	4544000	I'm not ready to get low key
4544000	4546000	No, it's just
4546000	4548000	They don't get it, they tried the same shit with
4548000	4550000	Like, what is it?
4550000	4552000	It was either Double Dash or
4552000	4554000	The 3DS one
4554000	4556000	We don't talk about Double Dash
4556000	4558000	Rama in chat says
4558000	4560000	Calling it now, DLC for older tracks
4560000	4562000	With all due respect Rama
4562000	4564000	I think everybody is calling that
4564000	4566000	This is such an obvious extension
4566000	4568000	There are some tracks I would pay for
4568000	4570000	Half the tracks in the game are older tracks
4570000	4572000	But that's not out of character
4572000	4574000	For a Mario Kart game
4574000	4576000	Besides, of course, the first one
4576000	4578000	Yeah, it's not out of character
4578000	4580000	It is out of character though
4580000	4582000	To completely ignore any regular
4582000	4584000	Battle Mode track for Battle Mode
4584000	4586000	That makes no sense
4586000	4588000	That's the DLC
4588000	4590000	That's stupid
4590000	4592000	Hey, we broke this on purpose
4592000	4594000	So that we can fix it with paid content
4594000	4596000	That's dumb
4596000	4598000	They said they needed more third party ideas
4598000	4600000	Make the model a fucking Battle Mode track
4600000	4602000	Calm down
4602000	4604000	Mario Kart 8 is gonna
4604000	4606000	Be the bomb and you know it
4606000	4608000	Stop it
4608000	4610000	Like two hours tops
4610000	4612000	To do all four of them
4612000	4614000	Have a seat
4614000	4616000	I also wanted to say
4616000	4618000	That means 30 characters playable
4618000	4620000	Also, you can play as your Mii
4620000	4622000	Which is all you're ever gonna see online, probably
4622000	4624000	I just really hope they change the Mii voices
4624000	4626000	Cause
4626000	4628000	Like the voices
4628000	4630000	Those Miis have is scary
4630000	4632000	Maybe they'll just have you
4632000	4634000	They should have you record
4634000	4636000	Only with friends
4636000	4638000	But
4638000	4640000	I fully
4640000	4642000	I still hope
4642000	4644000	Like they did with Mario Kart Wii
4644000	4646000	And I don't remember if they did with the 3DS version
4646000	4648000	But I hope they actually have your Miis in the background
4648000	4650000	Love this idea from Tigerclaw
4650000	4652000	And I think even Loki has to like this one
4652000	4654000	Tigerclaw says, what if they do
4654000	4656000	DLC tracks based on other games
4656000	4658000	You remember how Sonic Lost World
4658000	4660000	Had levels based on some classic Nintendo games
4660000	4662000	What if Nintendo made a deal and made
4662000	4664000	DLC tracks based on Sonic
4664000	4666000	So, what if somebody
4666000	4668000	Got your Sonic Mega All-Stars
4668000	4670000	Racing courses in my Mario Kart 8
4670000	4672000	No
4672000	4674000	How about a Bayonetta 2 course
4674000	4676000	Come on
4676000	4678000	Come on, Loki
4678000	4680000	What would that be? I mean, driving up the hair
4680000	4682000	No, you'd just basically drive into her vagina
4682000	4684000	That's a Bayonetta 2
4684000	4686000	I was trying to hint at that, but you know, whatever
4686000	4688000	That's fine
4688000	4690000	Just go for the direct approach
4690000	4692000	On a serious thought, you're driving around
4692000	4694000	These mountains that are just her boobs
4694000	4696000	On a serious note
4696000	4698000	What about like a Hyrule level
4698000	4700000	You laugh at that, but actually one time I did have a concept
4700000	4702000	For a kart racing game, and that was gonna be
4702000	4704000	You know, that was gonna be my level
4704000	4706000	Battle of Ariola Mountain
4706000	4708000	It's gonna be all bacon
4708000	4710000	And fucking giant breasts
4710000	4712000	Like, bounce on like those
4712000	4714000	You know, mushrooms and shit
4714000	4716000	What was the name of the game, Bacon and Boobs?
4716000	4718000	Oh, it was VoG Kart Racing, of course
4718000	4720000	Did you run that by Bobby?
4720000	4722000	No, I didn't, I don't really care
4722000	4724000	This was a long time ago
4724000	4726000	Ah, the ideas
4726000	4728000	I had for that
4728000	4730000	Alright, now what about like
4730000	4732000	A Hyrule level
4732000	4734000	Like, that would be rad
4734000	4736000	What did they just say a second ago?
4736000	4738000	Yeah, it'd be awesome if they had a Zelda level and
4738000	4740000	Finally, that was
4740000	4742000	Either here or there
4742000	4744000	Alright, moving on, Shane
4744000	4746000	We gotta keep it moving, we're like at an hour twenty
4746000	4748000	And we're not even halfway through the show
4748000	4750000	Okay, well
4750000	4752000	There are some Mega Man games headed to Virtual Console
4752000	4754000	Thanks to the votes of fans
4754000	4756000	Capcom posted a poll
4756000	4758000	Asking
4758000	4760000	When you want to see
4760000	4762000	Select Mega Man games show up on the Virtual Console
4762000	4764000	That poll is over
4764000	4766000	How'd Mega Man Legends 3 do?
4766000	4768000	It got first place
4768000	4770000	I'm glad that Capcom's listening to
4770000	4772000	User feedback now
4772000	4774000	But you know
4774000	4776000	Back when we wanted a new Mega Man game
4776000	4778000	Well, fuck you guys, we know better
4778000	4780000	That's awesome
4780000	4782000	Thanks, Capcom
4782000	4784000	Sorry, Shane
4784000	4786000	Anyway, so
4786000	4788000	The votes are in
4788000	4790000	Capcom has announced the schedule
4790000	4792000	For release
4792000	4794000	On the week of May 1st
4794000	4796000	Which has already happened
4796000	4798000	Mega Man Xtreme will be available
4798000	4800000	The following week
4800000	4802000	5-8
4802000	4804000	Both Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 will be available
4804000	4806000	Week of the 15th
4806000	4808000	Mega Man 4
4808000	4810000	Week of the 22nd
4810000	4812000	Mega Man 5
4812000	4814000	And then the week of the 29th
4814000	4816000	Mega Man Xtreme 2
4816000	4818000	Now, these are for
4818000	4820000	I believe the 3DS Virtual Console
4820000	4822000	Yeah, they are
4822000	4824000	The Game Boy versions
4824000	4826000	The end
4826000	4828000	The games were all coming anyway
4828000	4830000	That vote meant nothing
4830000	4832000	All it was was the order that you wanted them in
4832000	4834000	Which it looks pretty much like
4834000	4836000	Numerical order is what we went with
4836000	4838000	Apparently
4838000	4840000	There you go
4840000	4842000	Oh my gosh
4842000	4844000	Some people in chat
4844000	4846000	Capcom needs to lose that IP
4846000	4848000	I don't think they're letting go of it that easy
4848000	4850000	Well, let's travel around the world
4850000	4852000	That are coming out a little sooner than Mega Man Legends 3
4852000	4854000	Loki, US
4854000	4856000	Yes, well this week
4856000	4858000	There's a few things coming out
4858000	4860000	Starting off with Bound by Flame
4860000	4862000	Which is actually coming out on
4862000	4864000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
4864000	4866000	And on PS4
4866000	4868000	Sorry, Xbox One
4868000	4870000	You don't get that game
4870000	4872000	It looks pretty cool though
4872000	4874000	The PlayStation 4 version of
4874000	4876000	MLB 14, the show
4876000	4878000	Will be making it out this week as well
4878000	4880000	Today, actually we had a couple
4880000	4882000	3DS games
4882000	4884000	There was Mario Golf
4884000	4886000	World Tour
4886000	4888000	So that came out on 3DS and
4888000	4890000	Kirby Triple Deluxe
4890000	4892000	Let's see
4892000	4894000	What else was coming out later this week here
4894000	4896000	We also have
4896000	4898000	There's so much stuff
4898000	4900000	Smooth dates
4900000	4902000	Hakuoki Stories of the Shinsu
4902000	4904000	Goomy on PlayStation 3
4904000	4906000	If you like your visual novel games
4906000	4908000	For the Vita, God of War
4908000	4910000	Collection
4910000	4912000	That's coming out on the Vita
4912000	4914000	Also the amazing
4914000	4916000	Spider-Man 2 which kind of got delayed
4916000	4918000	A little bit
4918000	4920000	That's coming out on Xbox One
4920000	4922000	And this is pretty sweet
4922000	4924000	Borderlands 2
4924000	4926000	Going to be coming out
4926000	4928000	Later this week
4928000	4930000	Actually, that might be next week
4930000	4932000	13th, is that a Friday?
4932000	4934000	13th is a Tuesday
4934000	4936000	I'm sorry, that's the following week
4936000	4938000	It was originally supposed to come out this week
4938000	4940000	Anyways, that's it
4940000	4942000	Alright, well moving to Japanese
4942000	4944000	Release dates, there is nothing on the schedule
4944000	4946000	For this week, literally nothing
4946000	4948000	It probably has to do with Golden Week going on right now in Japan
4948000	4950000	So there is nothing
4950000	4952000	Sales, I need to take advantage of still on PlayStation
4952000	4954000	There are the sales stuff
4954000	4956000	And some other little tie-ins like that
4956000	4958000	But as far as official releases go, nothing this week in Japan
4958000	4960000	How about the UK?
4960000	4962000	The UK has a few games
4962000	4964000	Starting with May 7th
4964000	4966000	You get Peggle 2 on
4966000	4968000	Xbox 360
4968000	4970000	Titan Attacks on PS4, Vita
4970000	4972000	And PS3
4972000	4974000	On May 8th, Age of Mythology's
4974000	4976000	Extended Edition for PC
4976000	4978000	And the God of War collection on Vita
4978000	4980000	May 9th brings Bound by Flame
4980000	4982000	For PS3, PC
4982000	4984000	PlayStation 4
4984000	4986000	And Xbox 360
4986000	4988000	And then last on here, and I don't think this is right anymore
4988000	4990000	But Killer is Dead on PC
4990000	4992000	Didn't that get pushed back by a couple weeks?
4992000	4994000	I believe, everywhere
4994000	4996000	Yeah, I want to see, I just saw
4996000	4998000	I think it was my birthday, I think
4998000	5000000	On the 23rd, so Killer is Dead
5000000	5002000	On my birthday
5002000	5004000	Well maybe you can get Killer is Dead for free
5004000	5006000	No, I don't even know what that is, I don't want it
5006000	5008000	Killer is Dead is the, I can't remember the guy's name
5008000	5010000	It's the guy that does the new Killer 7
5010000	5012000	And No More Heroes and stuff like that
5012000	5014000	It was there, they came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
5014000	5016000	I think about a year ago
5016000	5018000	Last August, I want to say
5018000	5020000	Kajudo in chat says
5020000	5022000	Japan has stopped making games
5022000	5024000	No, that's not what happened
5024000	5026000	I will say this, May 15th, it's going to pick up again
5026000	5028000	And I'll tell you what, guess what's coming out on May 15th
5028000	5030000	A new Idolmaster game in Japan
5030000	5032000	So those are huge
5032000	5034000	Yeah, we should be getting a new
5034000	5036000	Not Idolmaster, but
5036000	5038000	Hatsune Miku? Yeah, maybe this year
5038000	5040000	Hatsune Miku is opening for Lady Gaga, did we talk about that on the show?
5040000	5042000	That is some crazy shit
5042000	5044000	Lady Gaga is having Hatsune Miku
5044000	5046000	Yes, the video game character
5046000	5048000	Well, it's more than a video game character in Japan
5048000	5050000	But with the holograms and shit
5050000	5052000	Is actually opening for the art pop
5052000	5054000	Whatever they're calling it in select cities
5054000	5056000	I don't think on this coast, but on the east coast
5056000	5058000	Hatsune Miku is opening for Lady Gaga
5058000	5060000	I feel like that would be this coast
5060000	5062000	Not the east coast
5062000	5064000	You would think, right?
5064000	5066000	You would think that she could just call herself Gem
5066000	5068000	And she could have the hologram
5068000	5070000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys
5070000	5072000	And then the classic game of the week
5072000	5074000	Which, look out guys
5074000	5076000	Because Shane's filling in for Jamie tonight
5076000	5078000	Guess who I picked for the classic game of the week
5078000	5080000	But I'm going to tell you what, Loki, I already know
5080000	5082000	Is going to love this pick
5082000	5084000	Let's get to those other
5084000	5086000	I will tell my first pick before we go with that
5086000	5088000	Okay, well let's get these other stories out of the way real quick
5088000	5090000	This was actually kind of a surprise
5090000	5092000	I mean, I knew that they were teasing that they're going to have
5092000	5094000	Marvel Super Heroes as part of the new
5094000	5096000	Disney Infinity, but I just figured
5096000	5098000	Hey, it's going to be another pack
5098000	5100000	Or something like that, it's not necessarily
5100000	5102000	Going to be the whole game, but guess what
5102000	5104000	Disney Infinity 2.0, Marvel Super Heroes
5104000	5106000	Is going to be announced
5106000	5108000	Or it was announced
5108000	5110000	And it is full of Marvel Super Heroes
5110000	5112000	So, yeah, it's going to be pretty sweet
5112000	5114000	Launching with the game
5114000	5116000	They said it's going to be Iron Man
5116000	5118000	Thor and Black Widow, but along with that
5118000	5120000	Hulk, Captain America
5120000	5122000	And Hawkeye will also be
5122000	5124000	Launching alongside it
5124000	5126000	And of course
5126000	5128000	With it, they're saying that, you know
5128000	5130000	You can have higher levels in your characters
5130000	5132000	New skill trees
5132000	5134000	Also, the toy box mode is coming back
5134000	5136000	And all the old characters will be supported by it
5136000	5138000	So you'll be able to play as the old characters
5138000	5140000	In toy box mode only
5140000	5142000	And they kind of
5142000	5144000	Showed some more
5144000	5146000	Well, they showed some other things
5146000	5148000	They have the Avengers characters in there
5148000	5150000	They've got Spider-Man
5150000	5152000	They showed off a lot of different
5152000	5154000	The characters from
5154000	5156000	Guardians of the Galaxy
5156000	5158000	Are going to be in there, so obviously
5158000	5160000	They'll have that toy box come out
5160000	5162000	Maybe when the movie comes out or something
5162000	5164000	Although that's a summer movie, I want to say
5164000	5166000	It's interesting to see these worlds
5166000	5168000	Coming together, though
5168000	5170000	We know what Disney Infinity 3.0 is then
5170000	5172000	Yeah, right, with the Star Wars, absolutely
5172000	5174000	Or maybe it's 3PO
5174000	5176000	Oh, God
5176000	5178000	You just wrote their entire
5178000	5180000	Advertising campaign
5180000	5182000	Patent pending, quick
5182000	5184000	It's not surprising
5184000	5186000	Infinity 3.0 is going to be Star Wars stuff
5186000	5188000	I'll be pretty
5188000	5190000	Exciting, too
5190000	5192000	There's some
5192000	5194000	Characters that were in the
5194000	5196000	Trailer as well
5196000	5198000	Stitch, although that could have been
5198000	5200000	Maybe a different playable character
5200000	5202000	Or not necessarily
5202000	5204000	Merida
5204000	5206000	Maleficent
5206000	5208000	Nick Fury
5208000	5210000	Loki
5210000	5212000	It's not only Avengers
5212000	5214000	Some of the newer
5214000	5216000	The chick from Brave and the
5216000	5218000	Frozen characters
5218000	5220000	The Frozen characters were from
5220000	5222000	The last pack that came out
5222000	5224000	Frozen characters are already out
5224000	5226000	But they're only in the toy box mode
5226000	5228000	It's kind of lame
5228000	5230000	Is Brave out, too?
5230000	5232000	No, no
5232000	5234000	They have
5234000	5236000	What's-her-name from Tangled
5236000	5238000	Rapunzel
5238000	5240000	Miss Tangled?
5240000	5242000	Yeah, from Tangled
5242000	5244000	And then they have
5244000	5246000	Green Goblin, MODOK
5246000	5248000	And they showed off
5248000	5250000	Rocket Raccoon and Groot
5250000	5252000	Kind of mimicking the scene that they had in the trailer
5252000	5254000	Well, I can see where Marvel nerds are going to be really happy about this
5254000	5256000	I don't know how I feel about the whole
5256000	5258000	Old characters only work in toy locks mode
5258000	5260000	Let's put it this way
5260000	5262000	I think what the problem was before is with Disney Infinity
5262000	5264000	It kind of skewed too much
5264000	5266000	Too young, maybe
5266000	5268000	And so now that they've got all this Marvel stuff
5268000	5270000	They're trying to capitalize on
5270000	5272000	Skylanders, young boys
5272000	5274000	And honestly
5274000	5276000	I think they've got a stronger license
5276000	5278000	Because people that are just getting into it
5278000	5280000	Who the fuck are the Skylanders?
5280000	5282000	I know who the Avengers are
5282000	5284000	I don't know who the fuck the Skylanders are
5284000	5286000	Well, Skylanders is getting more and more
5286000	5288000	They've been around for a few years now
5288000	5290000	So I think it's getting more and more out there
5290000	5292000	I understand that, but I'm just saying
5292000	5294000	Marvel's been around a lot longer than
5294000	5296000	Skylanders
5296000	5298000	I think that they stand a little bit better of a chance
5298000	5300000	But I'll be interested to see
5300000	5302000	It's supposed to be coming out in September
5302000	5304000	And on this also
5304000	5306000	There are going to be
5306000	5308000	Last Gen and
5308000	5310000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
5310000	5312000	So you can step up
5312000	5314000	To the PlayStation 4 with this cycle
5314000	5316000	Yes
5316000	5318000	Moving on to one other story here
5318000	5320000	We're about to get into the Classic Game of the Week
5320000	5322000	So it's appropriate that I talk about some free classic games
5322000	5324000	That are available
5324000	5326000	And they're actually coming from Blizzard
5327000	5329000	Now you may or may not know, over at Battle.net
5329000	5331000	If you have an account over there, you can download
5331000	5333000	Blackthorn for free, that's one of their old games
5333000	5335000	From the Super Nintendo days
5335000	5337000	That's been out for a while
5337000	5339000	Well, Blizzard decided to add a little more to that
5339000	5341000	By putting out some of the other classic Blizzard games
5341000	5343000	I think this goes all the way back to when they were
5343000	5345000	A different named company
5345000	5347000	The Lost Vikings
5347000	5349000	There's actually some Lost Vikings
5349000	5351000	Jokes in World of Warcraft
5351000	5353000	You actually see them in one of the dungeons
5353000	5355000	So the Lost Vikings, you can actually now play that
5355000	5357000	Free via Battle.net
5357000	5359000	You can go download it, it's completely legal and all that stuff
5359000	5361000	You play it through Battle.net, it's pretty cool
5361000	5363000	Also available, Rock and Roll Racing
5363000	5365000	Although they say that Rock and Roll Racing
5365000	5367000	Might actually be just the demo
5367000	5369000	Because there's only three songs
5369000	5371000	Available in Rock and Roll Racing
5371000	5373000	There's some issues with the licensing
5373000	5375000	That game was awesome
5375000	5377000	Rock and Roll Racing had all these
5377000	5379000	Actual Rock and Roll songs
5379000	5381000	They fear the licensing may have screwed that up
5381000	5383000	Because they say, the reports are
5383000	5385000	That if you download the game
5385000	5387000	It's really only the three tracks from the demo
5387000	5389000	Put new music in there
5389000	5391000	Yeah, you would think, or something
5391000	5393000	But yeah, unfortunately
5393000	5395000	So Rock and Roll Racing has hobbled a little bit
5395000	5397000	But you still can get that for free
5397000	5399000	And Lost Vikings
5399000	5401000	Those, again, are available at Battle.net
5401000	5403000	Pretty cool way to convince people to go get
5403000	5405000	A Battle.net account
5405000	5407000	To register participation
5407000	5409000	For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
5409000	5411000	At vognetwork.com
5411000	5413000	Anyways, Squash
5413000	5415000	Alright, well speaking of
5415000	5417000	Classic games, it's time to take
5417000	5419000	A journey to the past
5421000	5423000	As we open up the gaming vault
5423000	5425000	And step in and find a game
5425000	5427000	That we think, hey, you should
5427000	5429000	Check out this classic game this week
5429000	5431000	Now usually Dark Sakura dives into the vault
5431000	5433000	And finds a game for y'all
5433000	5435000	But with Shane filling in tonight, we thought
5435000	5437000	Alright, let's let our guests have the honor
5437000	5439000	Of selecting the classic game of the week
5440000	5442000	What were the rules that Jamie set?
5442000	5444000	You said it was ten years old
5444000	5446000	That's what she said, she wanted to do Kingdom Hearts
5446000	5448000	At one point, I think
5448000	5450000	So it has to be ten years or older
5450000	5452000	So Shane, you stepped into the vault
5452000	5454000	And what game did you find for us tonight?
5454000	5456000	Well, first I found Power Rangers the movie The Game
5456000	5458000	And I was like, I love that game
5458000	5460000	I should talk about that
5460000	5462000	But then, I had a much more
5462000	5464000	Better idea to pick
5464000	5466000	And I picked Final Fantasy XI
5469000	5471000	So
5471000	5473000	This game is amazing
5473000	5475000	Final Fantasy XI meets this criteria
5475000	5477000	Because it came out
5477000	5479000	Actually on PC in America
5479000	5481000	In 2003
5481000	5483000	So we are well past that
5483000	5485000	Final Fantasy XI is
5485000	5487000	Square's online entry
5487000	5489000	Their first online entry into the Final Fantasy
5489000	5491000	For the Final Fantasy series
5491000	5493000	Oh my god, I'm sorry
5493000	5495000	This music brings back so many memories for me
5495000	5497000	I remember when this game came out
5497000	5499000	I was living with
5499000	5501000	Because this show was on
5501000	5503000	I was living with Loki
5503000	5505000	I stayed home from work the day this came out
5505000	5507000	I requested that day off from work to get the game
5507000	5509000	I remember I was the first one on the server
5509000	5511000	And I had to get everybody else
5511000	5513000	You kept deleting and re-rolling until you got it
5513000	5515000	Yeah, we had to get the world pass
5515000	5517000	I got world passes for everybody
5517000	5519000	I had to go out and kill a million sprouts
5519000	5521000	Or whatever to go get the stupid passes
5521000	5523000	I'm going to actually switch to
5523000	5525000	Some gameplay noises here
5525000	5527000	From the theme song
5527000	5529000	That theme song takes me back
5529000	5531000	So this is a standard
5531000	5533000	MMORPG
5533000	5535000	You fight things
5535000	5537000	You get experience
5537000	5539000	You level up
5539000	5541000	The game, which launched in Japan a little bit before we got it
5541000	5543000	Launched with six jobs
5543000	5545000	And then when the game came out in America
5545000	5547000	We not only got the original game
5547000	5549000	But we also got the first expansion
5549000	5551000	Which added
5551000	5553000	Oh my god, so many more jobs
5553000	5555000	Three, four, five, six, seven, eight
5555000	5557000	Nine, ten
5557000	5559000	Or eight, what?
5559000	5561000	All the advanced jobs
5561000	5563000	Except for, I'm sorry
5563000	5565000	The game did launch with the advanced jobs
5565000	5567000	Paladin, Dark Knight, Beastmaster, Ranger, Bard
5567000	5569000	And Summoner
5569000	5571000	The expansion, which was the base game for us
5571000	5573000	Also gave us Samurai Ninja Dragoon
5573000	5575000	And that's it
5575000	5577000	The game had
5577000	5579000	Let's see, one, two, three
5579000	5581000	Four main expansions
5581000	5583000	It's still going strong
5583000	5585000	Had an expansion last year
5585000	5587000	The Seekers of Adulin
5587000	5589000	Which added two more jobs
5589000	5591000	Bringing to a total of
5591000	5593000	I believe twenty-four jobs
5593000	5595000	The President of Square-
5595000	5597000	Oh my god, this video is of the Rama fight
5597000	5599000	Sorry
5599000	5601000	I just got excited
5601000	5603000	These Primal fights were so hard
5603000	5605000	Oh my god
5605000	5607000	We only did them as the solo ones
5607000	5609000	You can get a full party to do them as well
5609000	5611000	But we always did the babier versions
5611000	5613000	Where it's just you and carbuncle
5613000	5615000	In 2012, Yoichi Wada
5615000	5617000	Announced that Final Fantasy 11
5617000	5619000	Had become the most profitable title
5619000	5621000	In the Final Fantasy series
5621000	5623000	Probably because of all the monthly fees
5623000	5625000	And the cost for extra characters
5625000	5627000	And stuff like that
5627000	5629000	Yeah
5629000	5631000	This game has an amazing story
5631000	5633000	It spans across, you know, the four
5633000	5635000	Expansions, the little mini scenario
5635000	5637000	Expansions they put out as well
5637000	5639000	I couldn't tell you anything about that story either
5639000	5641000	No, it's really good
5641000	5643000	I've gone on the wiki and just read
5643000	5645000	The story at times
5645000	5647000	The game has changed
5647000	5649000	So much from when it launched to what it is now
5649000	5651000	Used to be everything required a party
5651000	5653000	Nowadays
5653000	5655000	Everything does not require a party
5655000	5657000	In fact, a party is a hindrance
5657000	5659000	Up until the very end of the game
5659000	5661000	Which is level 99
5661000	5663000	And you can increase your character's
5663000	5665000	Skills and stats
5665000	5667000	Beyond level 99 too
5667000	5669000	Through various means
5669000	5671000	It's awesome
5671000	5673000	Yeah, these guys are just duoing the fight
5673000	5675000	That used to take six people
5675000	5677000	I recently went back and played this game
5677000	5679000	Like two months ago to see
5679000	5681000	What all was different and it's
5681000	5683000	Still really fun
5683000	5685000	I got to level
5685000	5687000	65 or something like that
5687000	5689000	I was fully AF'd as a dancer
5689000	5691000	I played this game for fucking three years
5691000	5693000	I never got anywhere
5693000	5695000	Did I play that last January
5695000	5697000	Or was it this January
5697000	5699000	I think it was last January
5699000	5701000	I bought everything
5701000	5703000	Up to the last
5703000	5705000	The very last piece of
5705000	5707000	DLC and the expansion for it
5707000	5709000	It was like
5709000	5711000	It must have been like $8
5711000	5713000	I was like, dude, how can I not
5713000	5715000	Play this for another month
5715000	5717000	This was also the game that introduced
5717000	5719000	The hard drive to the PS2
5719000	5721000	That used
5721000	5723000	Or that was used for so many games like
5723000	5725000	Resident Evil Outbreak
5725000	5727000	And Resident Evil Outbreak 2
5727000	5729000	I think that was probably it
5729000	5731000	Oh, EverQuest
5731000	5733000	Yeah, EverQuest as well
5733000	5735000	Which is another online game
5735000	5737000	But yeah, this game still goes strong
5737000	5739000	The servers are a little bit more dead
5739000	5741000	Than they used to be
5741000	5743000	Because of Final Fantasy 14
5743000	5745000	A lot of the online Final Fantasy people moved over into that game
5745000	5747000	Is what you would think
5747000	5749000	But the people I was playing with
5749000	5751000	Were like, we went to 14, we didn't like it
5751000	5753000	We came back to 11
5753000	5755000	I love 14
5755000	5757000	I don't need to look back to 11 myself
5757000	5759000	I do, because it has so many amazing jobs
5759000	5761000	Blue Mage, Dancer
5761000	5763000	Geomancer, Rune Fencer
5763000	5765000	Puppet Master
5765000	5767000	Alright
5767000	5769000	Well there it is, your classic game of the week
5769000	5771000	Final Fantasy 11
5771000	5773000	It's constantly on sale on Steam
5773000	5775000	If you ever want to just pick it up for a little bit
5775000	5777000	For a month
5778000	5780000	And Xbox 360
5780000	5782000	I wish it would go free to play
5782000	5784000	Free to play, free to play
5784000	5786000	Come on, free to play
5786000	5788000	Never
5788000	5790000	I still get the emails, newsletters
5790000	5792000	Like, come check out what you're missing
5792000	5794000	Well, another good thing is that they update the game monthly now
5794000	5797000	So there's always a content patch of some sort every month
5797000	5799000	Whether it be job adjustments
5799000	5801000	Or quality of life changes
5801000	5803000	It's pretty nice
5803000	5805000	Square is pouring a lot into their MMOs
5805000	5807000	Meaning that they won't release Dragon Quest X here
5809000	5811000	Don't get me started
5811000	5813000	I'm about to get started
5813000	5815000	Alright
5815000	5817000	A classic near and dear to my heart
5817000	5819000	Many years of my life wasted on Final Fantasy 11
5819000	5821000	And soon to be 14
5821000	5823000	And Loki as well
5823000	5825000	And Shane
5825000	5827000	Actually, Shane and I probably became better friends
5827000	5829000	Because of Final Fantasy 11
5829000	5831000	I mean, we knew each other through LiveJournal and stuff
5831000	5833000	We really talked everyday through Final Fantasy 11
5834000	5836000	Pretty much, pretty much
5836000	5838000	Alright, well there it is
5838000	5840000	A classic game of the week, Final Fantasy 11
5840000	5842000	Let us take a break, when we come back
5842000	5844000	We've got the FUGL question of the week
5844000	5846000	Rapid fire news to come
5846000	5848000	Some shifting and so forth going on at some game companies
5848000	5850000	And email bag
5850000	5852000	Participate at orangelandtrady.com
5852000	5854000	A follow up to last week's email
5854000	5856000	Did we tell our listener
5856000	5858000	What game they were looking for
5858000	5860000	We're gonna find out
5860000	5862000	They wrote back this week
5863000	5865000	So we will get that follow up coming up next
5865000	5867000	On Orange Lounge Radio after this break
5875000	5877000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
5877000	5879000	Live on this
5879000	5881000	May the 4th of 2014
5881000	5883000	With episode 551 of our show
5883000	5885000	And yes
5885000	5887000	If you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network
5887000	5889000	VoGnetwork.com
5889000	5891000	Yes, we got the May the 4th jokes
5891000	5893000	Out of the way, I'm sure your Facebook feed already
5893000	5895000	Blew up with them earlier today
5895000	5897000	So there you go, done
5897000	5899000	As far as Star Wars and video games goes
5899000	5901000	We must talk about that a little bit
5901000	5903000	We kind of already talked
5903000	5905000	During the last segment about Disney
5905000	5907000	Infinity
5907000	5909000	3.0 is most likely gonna be Star Wars
5909000	5911000	Bank on it for Disney Infinity 3.0
5911000	5913000	Otherwise, anybody played a Star Wars game
5913000	5915000	Recently?
5915000	5917000	They don't make them like Super Star Wars
5917000	5919000	Star Wars is a crappy IP anyway
5919000	5921000	Oh be quiet, that's not true
5921000	5923000	I don't like Star Wars
5923000	5925000	I don't like them, the movies are crap
5925000	5927000	The new ones are
5927000	5929000	Well all of them that I've seen which are 4, 5, and 6
5929000	5931000	You're wrong, they're not that bad
5931000	5933000	But the old republic keeps doing stuff
5933000	5935000	So that's still going
5935000	5937000	There's a Star Wars game
5937000	5939000	Yoda and Darth Vader were cool in Soul Calibur 4
5939000	5941000	By the way, if you listen to my little rant
5941000	5943000	Last week on Soul Calibur Lost Swords
5943000	5945000	I tried
5945000	5947000	I tried again this week, I booted
5947000	5949000	I think there was even a comment on VOG
5949000	5951000	But I saw that they fixed it
5951000	5953000	There was an article on a blog site
5953000	5955000	That said they fixed everything
5955000	5957000	Nope, it's getting deleted tonight
5957000	5959000	I tried, I'd win it one more time
5959000	5961000	I brought up the thing and it's still loading, loading, loading, loading, loading, loading
5961000	5963000	I want to see it before you delete it
5963000	5965000	I got to the, well here's the thing
5965000	5967000	I get to the menu screen, can't move up or down
5967000	5969000	Can't hit the button, can't do anything
5969000	5971000	Saya said, I'm out
5971000	5973000	I didn't even get into the full game, I said I'm done with this garbage
5973000	5975000	But I tried
5975000	5977000	I tried
5977000	5979000	Tigerclaw says
5979000	5981000	You think Shane is going to hate Star Wars Episode 7?
5981000	5983000	Yes I do, he will hate Star Wars
5983000	5985000	Most likely
5985000	5987000	Unless the series gets a decent story
5987000	5989000	And not terrible acting
5989000	5991000	Which I don't have high hopes for
5991000	5993000	Bobby Blackwolf says
5993000	5995000	Shanehateseverything.com
5995000	5997000	That's not true
5997000	5999000	Just things that are awful
5999000	6001000	He loves Power Rangers, Pokemon, and
6001000	6003000	Skylanders in the color blue
6003000	6005000	And Taco Bell and
6005000	6007000	Del Taco
6007000	6009000	Alright
6009000	6011000	Anyhow, let's get into some
6011000	6013000	rapid fire news because there is
6013000	6015000	a lot of other stuff going on in gaming
6015000	6017000	Loki
6017000	6019000	So finally
6019000	6021000	After months of wondering
6021000	6023000	Where's Drive Club? Isn't that supposed to be out by now?
6023000	6025000	They have
6025000	6027000	Made it official that
6027000	6029000	Drive Club will be out October 7th
6029000	6031000	In North America, October 8th
6031000	6033000	In Europe
6033000	6035000	And of course
6035000	6037000	They had planned for the game to come out early
6037000	6039000	2014
6039000	6041000	But they ran into
6041000	6043000	A problem being able to deliver
6043000	6045000	On their ambitious
6045000	6047000	Yeah ambitious promise
6047000	6049000	And apparently
6049000	6051000	The whole issue with it was
6051000	6053000	That they wanted it to be a
6053000	6055000	Socially connected game
6055000	6057000	And they were having trouble with
6057000	6059000	The social networking part of that
6059000	6061000	Wait, their ambitious promise
6061000	6063000	Is that the promise of releasing a game?
6063000	6065000	Is that the ambitious promise?
6065000	6067000	That is ambitious as far as
6067000	6069000	Socially connected
6069000	6071000	We need to make sure that all the connectivity
6071000	6073000	That surrounds the game
6073000	6075000	Whether it be joining clubs or sending challenges
6075000	6077000	Or even interacting with iOS and Android
6077000	6079000	Drive Club apps
6079000	6081000	That had to be slick
6081000	6083000	And that had to be absolutely seamless
6083000	6085000	And that was one of the areas that we need
6085000	6087000	To put extra time into
6087000	6089000	We were able to polish the cars
6089000	6091000	The tracks and stuff
6091000	6093000	Or just a fantastic byproduct
6093000	6095000	Part of me
6095000	6097000	Is wondering that maybe the reason why
6097000	6099000	They delayed it a little bit
6099000	6101000	Was because of all these launch
6101000	6103000	Issues that they've had with games
6103000	6105000	Like Soul Calibur and stuff
6105000	6107000	Where their servers were just fucked up
6107000	6109000	And they were worried that if they weren't able
6109000	6111000	To talk to each other that you may have some issues
6111000	6113000	And stuff
6113000	6115000	Also they were saying what we originally had
6115000	6117000	That was not necessarily as smooth or
6117000	6119000	Transactions
6119000	6121000	Or transitions
6121000	6123000	Where the way it connected you
6123000	6125000	Or other players weren't as intuitive as we
6125000	6127000	Intended them to be
6127000	6129000	So we had to go back and re-look at those areas
6129000	6131000	And kind of look at different ways
6131000	6133000	And new techniques to get people
6133000	6135000	Socially connect
6135000	6137000	And we changed that with a new
6137000	6139000	Dynamic menu system
6139000	6141000	So we really feel like we've solved
6141000	6143000	All those problems
6144000	6146000	Also
6146000	6148000	You may be wondering
6148000	6150000	Well are we still going to be getting
6150000	6152000	Drive Club for free as part of PlayStation Plus
6152000	6154000	Well yes that is still going to happen
6154000	6156000	It's actually going to be
6156000	6158000	Taking place in one country
6158000	6160000	With five tracks
6160000	6162000	And ten cars
6162000	6164000	So that's going to be the free portion of the game
6164000	6166000	And you'll be able to
6166000	6168000	Buy stuff a la carte
6168000	6170000	If you want
6170000	6172000	On top of that
6173000	6175000	So
6175000	6177000	It's pretty neat
6177000	6179000	Of course people are getting pissed off
6179000	6181000	It's 1080p and only 30 frames per second
6181000	6183000	Not 60 so there's that whole debate
6183000	6185000	But who gives a shit about that
6185000	6187000	I'm glad they're still doing the
6187000	6189000	PlayStation Plus free-ish mode
6189000	6191000	Definitely
6191000	6193000	And then
6193000	6195000	I'm a little disappointed about this
6195000	6197000	You may remember
6197000	6199000	Adam Sandler
6199000	6201000	Their studio
6202000	6204000	For pixels
6204000	6206000	Which was a kind of a short
6206000	6208000	That came out
6208000	6210000	A digital short that was on YouTube
6210000	6212000	Where it was a bunch of
6212000	6214000	This blob of pixels flying through the air
6214000	6216000	And then all of a sudden
6216000	6218000	Oh look Donkey Kong is there throwing barrels at people
6218000	6220000	And all sorts of pandemonium
6220000	6222000	The Tetris blocks are destroying buildings
6222000	6224000	And everything kind of went all pixely
6224000	6226000	Well
6226000	6228000	Now there's a little bit more information regarding this
6228000	6230000	It's supposed to be coming
6230000	6232000	In 2015
6232000	6234000	It's of course going to have Adam Sandler
6234000	6236000	And all those crew
6236000	6238000	Peter Dinklage is going to be in it as well
6238000	6240000	And apparently the plot
6240000	6242000	This is really weird
6242000	6244000	The plot centers around I guess
6244000	6246000	Aliens who discover video footage of classic arcade games
6246000	6248000	And apparently after seeing that
6248000	6250000	The aliens believe that Earth is
6250000	6252000	Trying to wage war with them
6252000	6254000	And
6254000	6256000	You know apparently the aliens
6256000	6258000	Invade Earth using the games
6258000	6260000	As bullets for their attack
6260000	6262000	Of course they're going to have some people
6262000	6264000	That are arcade aficionados
6264000	6266000	That are going to take them on
6266000	6268000	And defeat the aliens and save the day
6268000	6270000	But it sounds really weird
6270000	6272000	Originally it was like all these
6272000	6274000	Classic arcade characters
6274000	6276000	Are kind of waging war
6276000	6278000	Against everybody
6278000	6280000	And then to this really strange plot line
6280000	6282000	I don't know I think it's just going to sound kind of cheesy
6282000	6284000	But whatever
6284000	6286000	That's coming out next year
6286000	6288000	I sounded like the last star fighter almost
6288000	6290000	I just
6290000	6292000	It's just Adam Sandler
6292000	6294000	He's like poisoned for anything nowadays
6294000	6296000	Back in the day you know the Adam Sandler movie
6296000	6298000	Hell yeah I got to watch it because it's going to be hilarious
6298000	6300000	Nah it's just not so much
6300000	6302000	So I'm going to have to wait and see
6302000	6304000	Also this week
6304000	6306000	They announced the brand new Call of Duty
6306000	6308000	Game in
6308000	6310000	It's going to come out in November
6310000	6312000	Called Call of Duty Advanced Warfare
6312000	6314000	And it takes place in the year 2059
6314000	6316000	And following I guess a bunch of different
6316000	6318000	Private military contractors
6318000	6320000	One I know which is Atlas
6320000	6322000	And I don't know if they're supposed to be the
6322000	6324000	Good guys or the bad guys
6324000	6326000	But I know
6326000	6328000	That Kevin Spacey is going to be in
6328000	6330000	The game as well
6330000	6332000	He has a character that he's voicing
6332000	6334000	I guess
6334000	6336000	Parents kind of based off of
6336000	6338000	Apparently he has
6338000	6340000	Some sort of
6340000	6342000	I don't know if he's going to be the good guy
6342000	6344000	Or if he's trying to take over the United States
6344000	6346000	But anyways
6346000	6348000	Stuff happens
6348000	6350000	The Golden Gate Bridge gets destroyed
6350000	6352000	At one point and it's got a lot of the tech
6352000	6354000	That you see in some of these
6354000	6356000	Near sci-fi movies like Elysium
6356000	6358000	Or was that new one with
6358000	6360000	Tom Cruise coming out
6360000	6362000	The exoskeleton suits
6362000	6364000	And all sorts of
6364000	6366000	That kind of tech
6366000	6368000	Like the wearable armor type things
6369000	6371000	Oh and hoverbikes
6371000	6373000	That's kind of cool
6373000	6375000	So we're going to get our hovercars
6375000	6377000	In the next 30 or so years
6377000	6379000	But yeah that'll be coming out in November
6379000	6381000	Great! Bunch of information on Call of Duty
6381000	6383000	I didn't know about
6383000	6385000	Yeah that's completely new information
6385000	6387000	Alright let's move on
6387000	6389000	Talking about a game that I do know something about
6389000	6391000	Because I've played it before
6391000	6393000	I just haven't played it on the Wii U
6393000	6395000	But it's Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams
6395000	6397000	There is a patch that will be hitting the Wii U
6397000	6399000	In off TV mode
6399000	6401000	Some of the in-game sounder music
6401000	6403000	Wouldn't come through to the Wii U gamepad
6403000	6405000	Oops! So that will be a
6405000	6407000	Patch that will hit so if you want to check out
6407000	6409000	Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams
6409000	6411000	Which is a pretty solid platformer I gotta say
6411000	6413000	I've been playing it on PC
6413000	6415000	But if I didn't have a nice PC
6415000	6417000	I think the Wii U would be a great place
6417000	6419000	To check that out
6419000	6421000	Yeah check that out
6421000	6423000	Especially after that patch goes in
6423000	6425000	This is interesting, this game came out a while ago
6425000	6427000	With the Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection
6427000	6429000	I had no idea this was a thing
6429000	6431000	But thanks to some forum posts
6431000	6433000	This week some screenshots
6433000	6435000	Leaked of what was supposed to be
6435000	6437000	A full HD remake
6437000	6439000	Of the Mortal Kombat collection
6439000	6441000	Meaning new characters
6441000	6443000	I'm sorry, same characters
6443000	6445000	But new grabs
6445000	6447000	Like the sprites were all new
6447000	6449000	New actors dressed up in the costumes
6449000	6451000	That would be hilarious
6451000	6453000	And they actually have lots of screens
6453000	6455000	That people posed in
6455000	6457000	Luke Kang and Katana
6457000	6459000	Completely different people
6459000	6461000	And you see that they're grabbed
6461000	6463000	In HD
6463000	6465000	Kind of neat huh
6465000	6467000	But then they actually show some pictures
6467000	6469000	Behind the scenes of these actors on a green screen
6469000	6471000	In the costumes
6471000	6473000	They were ready to
6473000	6475000	They had the Mortal Kombat 3
6475000	6477000	Katana and the 2 and all that stuff
6477000	6479000	I'm imagining that's
6479000	6481000	Sonya in one of these pictures
6481000	6483000	Which I know makes for great radio
6483000	6485000	New actors
6485000	6487000	Stryker's
6487000	6489000	Kind of chubby isn't he
6489000	6491000	That's alright
6491000	6493000	No he just looks derpy
6493000	6495000	And it's so sad because the newest
6495000	6497000	Mortal Kombat game made Stryker almost
6497000	6499000	Cool and now they're just like
6499000	6501000	No we're gonna take that away from him
6501000	6503000	So I don't know what they changed
6503000	6505000	They cancelled this and just
6505000	6507000	Did it with the regular actors instead
6507000	6509000	Maybe it was too much of a shock
6509000	6511000	Maybe on playing it with new people
6511000	6513000	They were just like no this doesn't
6513000	6515000	Like this defeats the purpose, people are gonna hate this
6515000	6517000	No I imagine somewhere in testing
6517000	6519000	This fell out that like people were gonna
6519000	6521000	Reject it
6521000	6523000	I kinda think though they should've done it anyway
6523000	6525000	With both
6525000	6527000	Why not have the new and the old
6527000	6529000	Let people choose what they wanna play as
6529000	6531000	I think the new ones for the most part
6531000	6533000	Except for maybe Stryker and Kano
6533000	6535000	Look pretty decent
6535000	6537000	They should've kept it
6537000	6539000	It would've been weird that they would spend all that money
6539000	6541000	And then nope nevermind
6541000	6543000	Psych
6543000	6545000	Speaking of, nevermind, psych
6545000	6547000	We had a story last week I think on the show
6547000	6549000	About Silent Hill Origins and Shattered Memories
6549000	6551000	Coming to the Playstation Vita
6551000	6553000	Oh no that was a mistake
6553000	6555000	The Konami blog
6555000	6557000	That announced this apparently was some type of
6557000	6559000	Either a mistranslation
6559000	6561000	Or just plain wrong
6561000	6563000	Because now it's two Silent Hill
6563000	6565000	Titles headed to the Playstation Network
6565000	6567000	Even though Konami of the UK tweeted
6567000	6569000	That they're coming to the Vita
6569000	6571000	Oops
6571000	6573000	They made a follow up tweet
6573000	6575000	Regretfully the games aren't available on Playstation Vita
6575000	6577000	We're afraid
6577000	6579000	If this changes however we'll let you know
6579000	6581000	Well you can download them for the PSP
6581000	6583000	On Playstation Network and I'm thinking
6583000	6585000	That's where the error came from
6585000	6587000	Somewhere they said oh we need to run an announcement
6587000	6589000	That it's coming to the Playstation Portable
6589000	6591000	And somebody said oh that means the Vita
6591000	6593000	Totally forgot about the PSP
6593000	6595000	Like a lot of people did
6595000	6597000	Well don't the PSP games play on the Vita though?
6597000	6599000	Most do
6599000	6601000	Most do
6601000	6603000	So
6603000	6605000	It's not entirely unsure I guess
6605000	6607000	I guess not but yeah I think people
6607000	6609000	Had it in their minds that it was new ports or something
6609000	6611000	And that is not a period of games
6611000	6613000	So there you go
6613000	6615000	Oh well I don't think I mean last week when we
6615000	6617000	Talked about it people didn't seem to be too excited
6617000	6619000	About the idea anyway actually it was the week that
6619000	6621000	Flaco was here so it was two weeks ago
6621000	6623000	But anyway it turned out to be
6623000	6625000	Psych just kidding
6625000	6627000	Shane do you have some stuff for us?
6627000	6629000	Yeah DuckTales Remastered the soundtrack if you enjoyed
6629000	6631000	It from the recent release
6631000	6633000	Is now available on the
6633000	6635000	Amazon MP3 store
6635000	6637000	iTunes and Spotify
6637000	6639000	You can get the
6639000	6641000	47 track
6641000	6643000	I didn't realize there were that many songs
6643000	6645000	In it
6645000	6647000	You can get the 47 track album
6647000	6649000	For 949 on Amazon
6649000	6651000	Because they have the retro stuff on there too
6651000	6653000	So it's the original and the retro
6653000	6655000	That's what fills it up
6655000	6657000	And it's somehow $11.99
6657000	6659000	On iTunes I don't know
6659000	6661000	Why that's kind of
6661000	6663000	Really dumb
6663000	6665000	Also
6665000	6667000	Gran Turismo 5
6667000	6669000	They're pulling the plug on its
6669000	6671000	Online services so
6671000	6673000	They are holding a special event
6673000	6675000	To commemorate it
6675000	6677000	It will consist of two stages
6677000	6679000	With the first having a focus
6679000	6681000	On the Mazda
6681000	6683000	Roadster touring car
6683000	6685000	Of $11 I guess
6685000	6687000	And then the other
6687000	6689000	One is the Top Gear
6689000	6691000	Or sorry
6691000	6693000	Is the Nissan GTR N24
6693000	6695000	I don't know how to pronounce these car names
6695000	6697000	Scholes
6697000	6699000	Motorsports $11
6699000	6701000	I don't know whatever
6701000	6703000	Participating in the event will give players
6703000	6705000	It's alright Shane it's like me reading Japanese release dates
6705000	6707000	I could do that way better than I can read
6707000	6709000	Car things
6709000	6711000	Not during Golden Week
6711000	6713000	Not during Golden Week
6713000	6715000	I could do that better too
6715000	6717000	I wouldn't say anything also
6717000	6719000	But better
6719000	6721000	Just playing in these events will give players
6721000	6723000	Five free vehicles in Gran Turismo 6
6723000	6725000	If they use the same PSN
6725000	6727000	ID as they did from
6727000	6729000	Gran Turismo 5
6729000	6731000	You will also earn
6731000	6733000	The
6733000	6735000	Golf Grande Punto 09
6735000	6737000	Wasn't
6737000	6739000	Barth the name of the burger chain
6739000	6741000	And you can't do that on television
6741000	6743000	This is a Barth
6743000	6745000	Yes you're right
6745000	6747000	The Renault Sport
6747000	6749000	RS
6749000	6751000	Trophy 11
6751000	6753000	The Nissan
6753000	6755000	Fairlady Z
6755000	6757000	Why don't you just say
6757000	6759000	A bunch of car stuff
6759000	6761000	You'll get cars does it really matter
6761000	6763000	And you get a car
6763000	6765000	It's just some stupid car
6765000	6767000	For Gran Turismo
6767000	6769000	You get five stupid cars
6769000	6771000	For Gran Turismo 6
6771000	6773000	There
6773000	6775000	In lighter news Bob Hoskins died
6781000	6783000	At age 71
6783000	6785000	That means no Mario 2
6785000	6787000	For anyone
6787000	6789000	Never coming now
6789000	6791000	It's alright you know what
6791000	6793000	They can just recast him with Danny DeVito
6793000	6795000	It's almost the same right
6795000	6797000	I guess
6797000	6799000	Bob Hoskins didn't care for the Mario Brothers movie
6799000	6801000	Oh god I hope not
6801000	6803000	Well nobody did well apparently John Lee
6803000	6805000	Was almost put out a tweet about the whole thing
6805000	6807000	And I think he even responded to somebody
6807000	6809000	That said like well didn't you guys hate the Mario
6809000	6811000	Movie and he kind of said something to the effect
6811000	6813000	Of and I'm paraphrasing here
6813000	6815000	It's grown on them over the years
6815000	6817000	Probably the fan response
6817000	6819000	And the fact that people care about it now
6819000	6821000	Probably has grown on at least John Leguizamo
6821000	6823000	It kind of sucks I mean imagine like you're
6823000	6825000	John Leguizamo back and you're kind of almost like
6825000	6827000	A no name actor at that point
6827000	6829000	And they're like hey we're gonna
6829000	6831000	Ok whatever yeah that's fine but he's a little bit more known
6831000	6833000	Now I mean he's more known now
6833000	6835000	He was in Moulin Rouge
6835000	6837000	And he was also in Kick-Ass 2 by the way
6837000	6839000	And they're like
6839000	6841000	Hey we're making a movie based on Super Mario
6841000	6843000	Brothers you want to be in it?
6843000	6845000	And it's like fuck yeah well he probably wasn't like that
6845000	6847000	He probably auditioned for it but you know hey we're making a movie
6847000	6849000	His agent was probably like fuck yeah
6849000	6851000	Yeah it's like seriously
6851000	6853000	You know probably the same thing happened when Double Dragon
6853000	6855000	Had a movie too and we know how that turned out so
6855000	6857000	It's just
6857000	6859000	It's just one of those things you know it's unfortunate
6859000	6861000	And now we'll never know if
6861000	6863000	You know a sequel really could have happened because they left
6863000	6865000	It wide open at the end
6865000	6867000	Or Tiger Claws has no
6867000	6869000	Sequel to who framed Roger Rabbit either
6869000	6871000	Yeah that movie scared the crap out of them
6871000	6873000	Well wasn't the end of like the Super Mario Brothers movie
6873000	6875000	Wasn't that kind of like the same premise that they can basically do
6875000	6877000	In the end of the new
6877000	6879000	Or the beginning of the new Tron movie you know
6879000	6881000	Where they invade Earth or whatever
6881000	6883000	Well but in the Mario movie it was like
6883000	6885000	Was it Daisy that was in there?
6885000	6887000	She just shows up at the end and she's like guys we got trouble
6887000	6889000	Or something stupid like that
6889000	6891000	And they're like okay Marty it's your kids
6893000	6895000	She had like plunger guns or something I don't remember
6895000	6897000	That movie was so awful
6897000	6899000	Rama in chat says in heaven right now
6899000	6901000	There's two Marios and a Luigi
6901000	6903000	I think Bowser, Koopa around
6903000	6905000	Yeah because Dennis Hopper's passed away
6905000	6907000	I didn't know that
6907000	6909000	You didn't know that? Yeah Dennis Hopper died a few years ago
6909000	6911000	It was while he was on that TV show Crash
6911000	6913000	That they made out of the movie
6913000	6915000	And then
6915000	6917000	Yeah Captain Lou Albano
6917000	6919000	Who played Mario on the TV show passed away
6919000	6921000	And the guy who played Luigi Danny Wells
6921000	6923000	Passed away
6923000	6925000	So yeah
6925000	6927000	John Leguizamo better watch out
6927000	6929000	Not to be crass but
6929000	6931000	Better watch out
6931000	6933000	Maybe we can get the pest too
6933000	6935000	No
6935000	6937000	My favorite Bob Hoskins
6937000	6939000	Role will always be Smee
6939000	6941000	In Hook
6941000	6943000	My favorite will always be Who Framed Roger Rabbit
6943000	6945000	There you go
6945000	6947000	I didn't like Who Framed Roger Rabbit actually
6947000	6949000	I know that's sacrilege
6949000	6951000	Actually that's my favorite Christopher Lloyd role
6951000	6953000	Oh yeah he was actually really good
6953000	6955000	Not even Back to the Future
6955000	6957000	Professor Plum in Clue
6957000	6959000	Never
6959000	6961000	Alright but Christopher Lloyd's still alive
6961000	6963000	Just for the record
6963000	6965000	And I gotta be honest
6965000	6967000	And I gotta be honest I'm absolutely surprised he's still alive
6967000	6969000	Because he looks older than dirt right now
6969000	6971000	Stop you guys are so
6971000	6973000	I mean no don't get me wrong
6973000	6975000	I hope he lives forever but
6975000	6977000	He looks old
6977000	6979000	I know he can't but
6979000	6981000	He looks fucking old but
6981000	6983000	That's why if we're gonna get another Back to the Future
6983000	6985000	Movie or something
6985000	6987000	Hurry up on that shit
6987000	6989000	He's not getting any younger
6989000	6991000	If they don't do a reboot isn't that what they do now?
6991000	6993000	It's a reboot
6993000	6995000	What happened to reboot the movie?
6995000	6997000	I thought that was coming at some point
6997000	6999000	What happened to reboot the show?
6999000	7001000	They really fucked that one up
7001000	7003000	That was cool for like the first season
7003000	7005000	We're gonna have all these characters in there
7005000	7007000	And now it's something weird
7007000	7009000	Fifth Dream says the only ones surviving
7009000	7011000	Are Princess and Toad that's suspicious
7011000	7013000	I don't even remember Toad in that movie
7013000	7015000	I don't either but
7015000	7017000	Alright let's move on let's get to the foogle question of the week
7025000	7027000	You take Facebook, you take Google
7027000	7029000	As in Google Plus you slam those
7029000	7031000	Together and you get foogle
7031000	7033000	And so that's why we go to our fan communities every week
7033000	7035000	And ask a question of our
7035000	7037000	Listeners and we read some of our favorite answers
7037000	7039000	Here on air
7039000	7041000	Maybe I'll read them all tonight
7041000	7043000	I'm gonna start on Google Plus
7043000	7045000	With the question which is about the whole Disney
7045000	7047000	Infinity, Skylanders
7047000	7049000	Because I knew we'd be talking about these games that come with figures
7049000	7051000	Tonight because of the Marvel news and the fact
7051000	7053000	That Shane made me play Skylanders
7053000	7055000	I will point out
7055000	7057000	That when you actually played it
7057000	7059000	You asked me to go get it
7059000	7061000	Like I've been saying we need to play this
7061000	7063000	We need to play this and then out of the blue you're like
7063000	7065000	Okay let's play this
7065000	7067000	I was ready to do the live stream
7067000	7069000	I was like if we're gonna do this let's do it
7069000	7071000	And then we asked you guys
7071000	7073000	Now that it's been a few years for Skylanders
7073000	7075000	And a year for Disney Infinity
7075000	7077000	It looks like these games are here to stay
7077000	7079000	How do you feel about these games
7079000	7081000	Involving sold separately figures
7081000	7083000	Do you really enjoy the games and collecting the figures
7083000	7085000	Or do you think these are cheap cash grabs
7085000	7087000	That aren't worth your time
7087000	7089000	We just kind of wanted to know generally what do the listeners think of these games
7089000	7091000	Retertainment on Google Plus says
7091000	7093000	I haven't given these games much thought
7093000	7095000	But I'm not a kid and I don't have any children of my own
7095000	7097000	Sure I could buy these video game or toy combinations
7097000	7099000	My sister's family has enough problems keeping themselves
7099000	7101000	In government subsidized housing
7101000	7103000	Does anyone else remember Captain Power
7103000	7105000	I do I do
7105000	7107000	Act Def says
7107000	7109000	I still think these type of games are really big cash grabs right now
7109000	7111000	But they're good ones at least for the most part
7111000	7113000	A lot of people both children and adults
7113000	7115000	Like both Skylanders and Disney Infinity
7115000	7117000	Collect the figurines and play the games
7117000	7119000	The only one that got close to getting me to buy
7119000	7121000	Figurines was Pokemon Rumble U
7121000	7123000	But I heard the game was crap and didn't do it
7123000	7125000	I'm still kind of tempted by them though
7125000	7127000	It was crap
7127000	7129000	Don't do it
7129000	7131000	Alright and going over to
7131000	7133000	Facebook I can probably read most of these
7133000	7135000	I might make some of them a little shorter though
7135000	7137000	Andy R says
7137000	7139000	In a way it doesn't seem all that different than DLC to me
7139000	7141000	Only your DLC nets you a collectible
7141000	7143000	You can put on a shelf
7143000	7145000	DLC is its own love it or hate it gaming trend
7145000	7147000	But getting physical collectibles with it
7147000	7149000	Is all upside I'd say
7149000	7151000	I've never been into Skylanders or Disney Infinity
7151000	7153000	But as someone who collects and plays Magic
7153000	7155000	People may get addicted to it
7155000	7157000	The only problem I have with that is that
7157000	7159000	DLC tends to be
7159000	7161000	Not always but tends to be more robust
7161000	7163000	Like when I think about Mass Effect 3
7163000	7165000	Story DLC
7165000	7167000	Great! Whole bunch of stuff I'm getting for my 10 or 15 bucks
7167000	7169000	But then I think about horse armor
7169000	7171000	In Oblivion
7171000	7173000	Not great right
7173000	7175000	The reason why I bring that up is that
7175000	7177000	When you get through these doors and things
7177000	7179000	It's not that much
7179000	7181000	It's like one room that has a hat in it
7181000	7183000	One puzzle to do
7183000	7185000	It's not like a whole bunch
7185000	7187000	Technically for the case of Skylanders
7187000	7189000	You buy the starter pack
7189000	7191000	Because that's what they're forcing you to do every single time
7191000	7193000	You get characters there
7193000	7195000	You don't need to buy anybody else
7195000	7197000	You can beat the entire game
7197000	7199000	Everything else would be optional
7199000	7201000	That is horse armor
7201000	7203000	That's all it is
7203000	7205000	Haseo Sumeruagawa responds
7205000	7207000	I can't I just can't
7207000	7209000	Rene our friend from the podcast
7209000	7211000	Killer Queens from Outer Space says
7211000	7213000	It's a great way to keep a game in players minds
7213000	7215000	By offering expansions
7215000	7217000	To keep replayability high
7217000	7219000	But it's just not my bag
7219000	7221000	Gamer Girl says
7221000	7223000	On one hand I think it's good for the collector in mind
7223000	7225000	But on the other hand I think it's a waste of money for parents
7225000	7227000	Whose kids lose interest rather quickly
7227000	7229000	Blood Drunk says
7229000	7231000	It's a giant cash grab gimmick to get children hooked
7231000	7233000	To make the parents buy figurines for the game
7233000	7235000	In my book at least
7235000	7237000	Critical Myth responds
7237000	7239000	And even though he's beat each of the three games
7239000	7241000	Many times over
7241000	7243000	There's still plenty of those damn figurines sitting unused
7243000	7245000	Their idea is neat
7245000	7247000	But there has to be a better way to implement it
7247000	7249000	To make it less of a cash grab
7249000	7251000	Ciala responds and says
7251000	7253000	If Nintendo ever does this with Pokemon
7253000	7255000	They'll become a leading world economy
7255000	7257000	Well again they started to do it
7257000	7259000	But they did it half-assed
7259000	7261000	They did it really half-assed
7261000	7263000	I'm not huge on this method myself
7263000	7265000	But I might collect some if they have cool figures
7265000	7267000	From something I enjoy
7267000	7269000	Shay C. replied
7269000	7271000	And agreed with the first answer I read from Andy R.
7271000	7273000	It's essentially DLC
7273000	7275000	And should be held to the same standard
7275000	7277000	It can be fine
7277000	7279000	But if you're shipping a full price game where say
7279000	7281000	Half or more of the content is gated
7281000	7283000	Oh the boss is behind a door you need a fire grind to open
7283000	7285000	Buy additional figures
7285000	7287000	That crosses the line
7287000	7289000	As long as the amount of gameplay provided for all combinations of purchases
7289000	7291000	Is in line with the cost
7291000	7293000	I've got no real problem with it
7293000	7295000	And if we're going to be fair
7295000	7297000	This is all on this DLC by the way
7297000	7299000	In my book
7299000	7301000	I did think it was cool
7301000	7303000	I did think it was really cool
7303000	7305000	That those figures save
7305000	7307000	Data in them
7307000	7309000	Through the little chips
7309000	7311000	I had never played the game on my Playstation 4 before
7311000	7313000	But when Shane put the little bird figure
7313000	7315000	It's like oh this is level 10
7315000	7317000	And you have all these abilities on it
7317000	7319000	So is your Wii remote but no one gives a shit about that
7319000	7321000	So I thought it was a neat use of that technology
7321000	7323000	For what it's worth
7323000	7325000	But I just want to say about the DLC question
7325000	7327000	Since Shane already answered it
7327000	7329000	You can beat the game with just what it comes with
7329000	7331000	In my opinion
7331000	7333000	Those figures are not worth it
7333000	7335000	Just for the DLC in the game
7335000	7337000	You really have to like it
7337000	7339000	You have to like the figure
7339000	7341000	Like that it lights up or whatever
7341000	7343000	And you get a little bit of an enhancement
7343000	7345000	A little bit of an incentive
7345000	7347000	You could eat a pizza that's just cheese
7347000	7349000	But really you want pepperoni
7349000	7351000	For some people
7351000	7353000	That's how it's going to be
7353000	7355000	Two more answers left
7355000	7357000	I hope I don't mispronounce this
7357000	7359000	It's either Felipe or Felipe
7359000	7361000	Felipe A replies and says
7361000	7363000	When I was a kid my parents bought me a lot of cheap toys
7363000	7365000	From the store that I would end up playing for maybe
7365000	7367000	Two to three hours and forget about them
7367000	7369000	I equate Skylanders and all other figures to those
7369000	7371000	They are cheap distractions that keep kids entertained
7371000	7373000	For a couple hours
7373000	7375000	I got my parents to use their money to give me a couple hours
7375000	7377000	Of entertainment back then
7377000	7379000	And then I gave the game to a couple more extra
7379000	7381000	Not for me since I'm in my twenties
7381000	7383000	But I'm not the addressable market for them either
7383000	7385000	Shane might disagree with you there
7385000	7391000	I think once you start putting like age restrictions on stuff
7391000	7393000	You get kind of ridiculous
7393000	7395000	Like you could say the same thing about any video game
7395000	7397000	Can we talk about your Power Rangers toy?
7397000	7399000	Yeah I don't care
7399000	7401000	Talk about my Power Rangers
7401000	7403000	You want me to go get it? I'll play it over the stupid thing
7403000	7405000	After I'm done, yes go get your Power Rangers toy
7405000	7407000	I brought all three
7407000	7409000	You didn't know I brought three
7409000	7411000	It's like a train
7411000	7413000	That's not even the series we have here
7413000	7415000	It's a train thing in Japan
7415000	7417000	And it makes choo choo noises
7417000	7419000	And you paid $60 for it
7419000	7421000	It's their Morpher in the new Japanese series
7421000	7423000	I love it, it's amazing
7423000	7425000	You know what though?
7425000	7427000	Everybody has their thing
7427000	7429000	I do this Rocky Horror thing
7429000	7431000	And you always look at me going
7431000	7433000	You are wasting all of your time
7433000	7435000	Don't tell me to tell you that too though
7435000	7437000	So I'll remind you
7437000	7439000	There's all that going on
7439000	7441000	But then you spend $60 on a Power Rangers toy
7441000	7443000	And I'm fine with it
7443000	7445000	People spend money on whatever makes them happy
7445000	7447000	Yes, now you can keep reading it all over our back
7447000	7449000	Alright
7449000	7451000	Well I only have one more answer so you better hurry
7451000	7453000	And again I'm probably going to mispronounce this
7453000	7455000	So I apologize
7455000	7457000	Amanojeko
7457000	7459000	I think is how I say that
7459000	7461000	Amanojeko says the idea of Skylanders
7461000	7463000	is a fun concept with a variety of
7463000	7465000	figures to choose from so you can play
7465000	7467000	the way you want. The only drawback is
7467000	7469000	the fact that some Skylanders giant figures
7469000	7471000	can't be used in Swap Force and vice versa
7471000	7473000	For the money people put in the game
7473000	7475000	they should be able to use them as they
7475000	7477000	see fit
7477000	7479000	Alright, I agree with that
7479000	7481000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says
7481000	7483000	I'd be more interested in Disney Infinity because
7483000	7485000	of recognizable characters. I wouldn't
7485000	7487000	mind having a Tron action figure that also
7487000	7489000	works in a video game, but no, they didn't release
7489000	7491000	any Tron figures for Disney Infinity
7491000	7493000	Yeah, I'm a little
7493000	7495000	bitter about that
7495000	7497000	Yeah, I agree. They did have some Tron things in the
7497000	7499000	toy box, but yeah, no Tron figure
7499000	7501000	unfortunately
7501000	7503000	Best you could do is have these little
7503000	7505000	citizens or whatever
7505000	7507000	toy things running around
7507000	7509000	you can dress them up like Tron, that's about it
7509000	7511000	Whoopee
7511000	7513000	So answering the questions for ourselves here real quick
7513000	7515000	Loki, all the sass
7515000	7517000	and anger stuff aside, how do you really
7517000	7519000	feel about these games?
7519000	7521000	I mean, I tried Disney Infinity and
7521000	7523000	once again, it was
7523000	7525000	too young
7525000	7527000	of a demographic for me
7527000	7529000	You bought it and sold it on eBay, right?
7529000	7531000	It wasn't
7531000	7533000	It's cool, like the figurines
7533000	7535000	are pretty neat. I kind of wish that you could
7535000	7537000	do something with them, like that they actually were figurines
7537000	7539000	that you could pull off the base and
7539000	7541000	do stuff with
7541000	7543000	But as far as collecting them goes, I mean, they're not
7543000	7545000	bad. I mean, they're kind of cool looking
7545000	7547000	I just think though it is
7547000	7549000	pretty obvious in both games
7549000	7551000	of how much of a cash grab they are
7551000	7553000	and yeah, I know that people compare it to
7553000	7555000	DLC, but dude
7555000	7557000	there's 60 pieces of
7557000	7559000	DLC if you want to call it that
7559000	7561000	60 pieces plus
7561000	7563000	that are like 10 bucks each
7563000	7565000	You don't really have to buy
7565000	7567000	like as Shane said earlier, you need one of each
7567000	7569000	element or one of each power, you don't need all
7569000	7571000	You don't have to, but then why offer 60 pieces?
7571000	7573000	Because they want you to buy all of them
7573000	7575000	And there will be people that will buy all of them
7575000	7577000	And some of the figures are kind of neat, like they light up and shit
7577000	7579000	remember? Anyhow
7579000	7581000	Yeah, and those cost an extra $5
7581000	7583000	Here's the thing, after
7583000	7585000	finally getting my hands on Skylanders this week
7585000	7587000	it's not as bad of a game as I thought it would be
7587000	7589000	like the game itself, I was expecting it to be a lot worse
7589000	7591000	and a lot more in your face of a cash grab
7591000	7593000	No, it's pretty sweet, but it wouldn't be
7593000	7595000	just the same game if you just
7595000	7597000	played it and you unlocked characters via
7597000	7599000	progression or whatever, finding
7599000	7601000	them, I mean, that would be
7601000	7603000	I don't know, like a game that they released
7603000	7605000	years ago, but now they're like, hey we can make
7605000	7607000	an extra $600 off of that
7607000	7609000	Fuck you
7609000	7611000	I can hear you on that
7611000	7613000	And you know what? There's going to be stuff
7613000	7615000	when the Tron figures come out eventually for Disney
7615000	7617000	Phoenix, like
7617000	7619000	that's really cool, but nope
7619000	7621000	Alright, got to move on with the show, but quickly
7621000	7623000	Shane's back with his toys, remember it's a radio show
7623000	7625000	so help explain it for us a little bit
7625000	7627000	what you brought back. So, first of all I couldn't find one of my toys
7627000	7629000	but I have the original Dragonzord dagger
7629000	7631000	from like 1990 something here
7631000	7633000	and it still
7633000	7635000	still works
7635000	7637000	I haven't ever changed the batteries
7637000	7639000	I don't know how it works
7639000	7641000	But this other thing is
7641000	7643000	you put a train in
7643000	7645000	and it makes train noises, hold on
7645000	7647000	What do trains have to do with Power Rangers?
7647000	7649000	That's just the theme this time, is their train theme
7649000	7651000	Oh yeah
7651000	7653000	So he's putting this little train
7653000	7655000	in the, it looks like a rocket
7655000	7657000	launcher or something that has
7657000	7659000	Well no, these are like
7659000	7661000	the crossing signal things. Anyway, so like
7661000	7663000	you want to morph, so you hit this
7671000	7673000	That's train noises, and you put the
7673000	7675000	train in
7675000	7677000	You push the gates down
7681000	7683000	And because of the way
7683000	7685000	the train is molded at the bottom
7685000	7687000	and it hits certain sensors
7687000	7689000	and it knows which train you put in there
7689000	7691000	so it knows that this is the Red Rangers train
7691000	7693000	so it tells me that I just wanted to
7693000	7695000	The look on Loki's
7695000	7697000	face right now is priceless
7697000	7699000	He spent $60 on that
7699000	7701000	I was over at Flaco Jones' house
7701000	7703000	and I showed his kid this series
7703000	7705000	and he would not quit watching it
7705000	7707000	so watch out
7707000	7709000	And Flaco Jones isn't going to be inviting you back
7709000	7711000	anytime soon
7711000	7713000	You know what though?
7713000	7715000	I respect the fact that they can do that
7715000	7717000	straight face throughout the whole thing
7717000	7719000	even though it's kind of ridiculous
7719000	7721000	but I do want to see some really
7721000	7723000	I want them to kind of take that and run with it
7723000	7725000	Maybe next year they can do
7725000	7727000	household appliances
7727000	7729000	Well, toaster ranger
7729000	7731000	Yeah, mow the lawn ranger
7731000	7733000	It's Japan, they do crazy things
7733000	7735000	like last time was dinosaurs
7735000	7737000	but the other half of that was samba dancing
7737000	7739000	and they had guns that they would spin
7739000	7741000	and would make music and they had to dance to it
7741000	7743000	This is pretty awesome
7743000	7745000	You know what? That's the next one we get here
7745000	7747000	I'm excited
7747000	7749000	Syallen Chat says, you're not alone
7749000	7751000	because Syallen Chat says, Shane Alinko
7751000	7753000	I need that in my life
7753000	7755000	Yes, I see that
7755000	7757000	live.vognetwork.com
7757000	7759000	Alright, let us move on with more show
7759000	7761000	We've got more news to get into
7761000	7763000	and your emails to get to as well
7763000	7765000	I mean, I don't know
7765000	7767000	I've watched the Transformers
7767000	7769000	slash Thomas thing that they did
7769000	7771000	on YouTube, it's hilarious
7771000	7773000	and they have that
7773000	7775000	so maybe Power Rangers thing would be so bad
7775000	7777000	Anyways, ok
7777000	7779000	so
7779000	7781000	this is kind of
7781000	7783000	I don't know, it's kind of disappointing if you're a fan of
7783000	7785000	maybe Tony Hawk and stuff
7785000	7787000	Neversoft, a company that used to do
7787000	7789000	some pretty awesome games
7789000	7791000	Tony Hawk included
7791000	7793000	They are now being rolled into
7793000	7795000	Infinity Ward or what is now Infinity Ward
7795000	7797000	and
7797000	7799000	because I think Neversoft
7799000	7801000	actually did some Call of Duty
7801000	7803000	work before
7803000	7805000	I want to say that they worked on
7805000	7807000	either certain versions of the game or DLC
7807000	7809000	or something like that
7809000	7811000	a portion of the game
7811000	7813000	well now
7813000	7815000	they worked with them for
7815000	7817000	Call of Duty Ghost
7817000	7819000	so now they're actually going to be part of Infinity Ward
7819000	7821000	and Neversoft is no more
7821000	7823000	so
7823000	7825000	but it's
7825000	7827000	did I hear no layoffs?
7827000	7829000	the name is No More
7829000	7831000	Didn't they make the Guitar Hero 3 and after
7831000	7833000	and all that too?
7833000	7835000	I wanted to say that they did, yeah
7835000	7837000	well moving on, this is involving layoffs
7837000	7839000	this is Future
7839000	7841000	is going through some restructuring and
7841000	7843000	redundancies or layoffs
7843000	7845000	Future, they don't make games
7845000	7847000	but they make some gaming commentaries, magazines
7847000	7849000	things like OXM, PC Gamer, CVG
7849000	7851000	and Edge, so some of these magazines
7851000	7853000	and websites, they're going through
7853000	7855000	global restructuring, this means
7855000	7857000	layoffs and according to CEO
7857000	7859000	no part of the business will be unaffected
7859000	7861000	they also say that Future
7861000	7863000	will no longer, this is not from the CEO but from Media Week
7863000	7865000	Future will no longer be structured around
7865000	7867000	content types like technology
7867000	7869000	but instead a single content and marketing
7869000	7871000	team will produce all content
7871000	7873000	basically the whole move to digital
7873000	7875000	they say diluted focus and distracted
7875000	7877000	the talent, so interesting
7877000	7879000	all these brands range from
7879000	7881000	cars to tech, music, sports and so on
7881000	7883000	it sounds like they're probably going to combine
7883000	7885000	similar things and try to push out
7885000	7887000	similar content in both paper and
7887000	7889000	digital forms or something along those lines
7889000	7891000	kind of where it sounds like this is going
7891000	7893000	it doesn't totally surprise me
7893000	7895000	in this day and age we live in, it's so
7895000	7897000	much easier for people to make homegrown
7897000	7899000	media content, hi
7899000	7901000	how you doing?
7901000	7903000	so that's just the reality
7903000	7905000	of the industry, but still
7905000	7907000	no funding, and not get paid for it
7907000	7909000	well for us yeah, but
7909000	7911000	well yeah we do it for free
7911000	7913000	so it makes it that much harder for the people
7913000	7915000	and I'm not just saying we, but I mean there's tons
7915000	7917000	of websites and tons of even
7917000	7919000	homegrown mags and
7919000	7921000	video shows and so forth, it makes it that
7921000	7923000	much harder for the people that do want to get money to do it
7923000	7925000	but you know
7925000	7927000	that's the reality
7927000	7929000	but layoffs are never fun to talk about
7929000	7931000	so best of luck to those
7931000	7933000	folks that are affected, hope you can find
7933000	7935000	another job in the industry that you enjoy
7935000	7937000	Shane
7937000	7939000	oh sorry I was chatting
7939000	7941000	oh now the chat room wants to talk
7941000	7943000	Power Rangers, you're all in it right?
7943000	7945000	yeah I'll talk Power Rangers for days
7945000	7947000	so from software makers of
7947000	7949000	games like Otogi, because that's really the only one
7949000	7951000	I remember, but I guess
7951000	7953000	they also do like Dark Souls
7953000	7955000	or Armored Core
7955000	7957000	but Otogi
7957000	7959000	enchanted arms
7959000	7961000	like the first RPG on 360
7961000	7963000	Awful, that was such a bad game
7963000	7965000	yeah, that was from software
7965000	7967000	did From Software also do
7967000	7969000	or did they have a part in
7969000	7971000	what was it, ChromeHounds?
7971000	7973000	I think that was mostly Sega I think
7973000	7975000	I could be wrong
7975000	7977000	but they have published recently
7977000	7979000	they've done a lot more than what
7979000	7981000	Shane's leading on, but mostly Otogi
7981000	7983000	still, because that was a really good game
7983000	7985000	but they also published Killer's Dead
7985000	7987000	and the lollipop
7987000	7989000	chainsaw in Japan
7989000	7991000	they have been acquired by
7991000	7993000	Kadokawa Corporation
7993000	7995000	which is a
7995000	7997000	corporation
7997000	7999000	that publishes manga
7999000	8001000	like I guess
8001000	8003000	Gundam and Neon Genesis
8003000	8005000	Evangelion
8005000	8007000	Bobby says
8007000	8009000	From did do ChromeHounds, you're right
8009000	8011000	and I'm wrong
8011000	8013000	sorry Shane
8013000	8015000	no that's really it, they were acquired by a
8015000	8017000	manga publishing company
8017000	8019000	interesting, interesting combination
8019000	8021000	I hope they make Otogi 3
8021000	8023000	crossing your fingers and your toes
8023000	8025000	just my fingers, I don't want that
8025000	8027000	much
8027000	8029000	lowkey
8029000	8031000	let's see
8031000	8033000	so this is kind of cool
8033000	8035000	one of the games I want to see, I think this was
8035000	8037000	GameSpy, yeah it was GameSpy
8037000	8039000	so one of the games that was affected by GameSpy
8039000	8041000	was a PC version of Halo Combat Evolved
8041000	8043000	and you know
8043000	8045000	the Halo franchise
8045000	8047000	they were rabid fans when it comes to
8047000	8049000	multiplayer, you may remember Halo 2
8049000	8051000	multiplayer on Xbox, there's a ton of people
8051000	8053000	that stayed in after you know they kind of
8053000	8055000	closed off the matchmaking
8055000	8057000	servers and stuff and they stayed in as long as they could
8057000	8059000	and they kind of drug it out, well
8059000	8061000	thanks to a
8061000	8063000	third party matchmaking online gaming
8063000	8065000	company called
8065000	8067000	GameRanger, the multiplayer service
8067000	8069000	is actually going to still
8069000	8071000	be continuing
8071000	8073000	and they're going to be
8073000	8075000	taking over I guess handling
8075000	8077000	the multiplayer for that game
8077000	8079000	so
8079000	8081000	oh and also I guess the demo and
8081000	8083000	the custom edition of that
8083000	8085000	so that's pretty sweet
8085000	8087000	on top of that
8087000	8089000	there's also, and this is good news
8089000	8091000	for me because I'm a fan of you know a lot of these
8091000	8093000	the Rockstar games but
8093000	8095000	Grand Theft Auto 4
8095000	8097000	and Red Dead
8097000	8099000	what was it, Red Dead Redemption
8099000	8101000	the multiplayer for that is actually
8101000	8103000	being, Rockstar is going to
8103000	8105000	make sure that keeps continuing
8105000	8107000	at least for those two games
8107000	8109000	Midnight Club 3 dub edition, dub edition
8109000	8111000	remix, Grand Theft Auto, Chinatown
8111000	8113000	Wars and
8113000	8115000	Beta Raider though are going to have their multiplayer shut
8115000	8117000	off although I can't imagine a lot of people play
8117000	8119000	multiplayer for Chinatown Wars, I didn't even
8119000	8121000	realize they had multiplayer
8121000	8123000	and of course you know Grand Theft Auto 5 is not
8123000	8125000	effective because that was never 3 games by the first place
8125000	8127000	Max Payne 3 also
8127000	8129000	not being affected by that
8129000	8131000	we're seeing though that
8133000	8135000	oh I'm sorry
8135000	8137000	Mac users in Max Payne 3 are not going to be able to
8137000	8139000	play multiplayer anymore, PC though you're ok
8139000	8141000	Red Dead Redemption though
8141000	8143000	no problems there
8143000	8145000	and then the PS3 version of
8145000	8147000	Grand Theft Auto 4 is losing its
8147000	8149000	leaderboards as well
8149000	8151000	so
8151000	8153000	I don't know
8153000	8155000	I'm glad to see that some of these companies are
8155000	8157000	stepping in to make sure their games don't go dark
8157000	8159000	as far as multiplayer is concerned
8159000	8161000	so that's
8161000	8163000	pretty cool
8163000	8165000	alrighty
8165000	8167000	let us go into the mailbag
8167000	8169000	we're going to open up the mailbag and read some of our emails
8169000	8171000	participate at orangelawandtrady.com
8171000	8173000	the place to send those emails
8173000	8175000	and every week DarkSakura
8175000	8177000	suits up and dives into the emailbag and
8177000	8179000	picks some emails to read, however she's not here
8179000	8181000	she has the night off so
8181000	8183000	I will borrow the hazmat suit
8183000	8185000	and dive on in and pick out some emails to read
8185000	8187000	for y'all
8187000	8189000	we are going to start with this email from
8189000	8191000	Dee
8191000	8193000	Dee does not want to have their full name read
8193000	8195000	and so
8195000	8197000	can we just make up a name then?
8197000	8199000	sure, make up a name
8199000	8201000	but what if the name you make up
8201000	8203000	and you don't know because you can't see the email
8203000	8205000	what if it happens to be the same name
8205000	8207000	it's going to be awkward
8207000	8209000	this person's name is DuckSauce
8209000	8211000	DuckSauce?
8211000	8213000	this person's name is not DuckSauce
8213000	8215000	it's because they don't want their full name read
8215000	8217000	so DuckSauce emailed us
8217000	8219000	and
8219000	8221000	DuckSauce has some insider info for us
8221000	8223000	let's get to it
8243000	8245000	I'm not, I don't give a shit about grammar
8245000	8247000	and B, even if Jamie had been here
8247000	8249000	and I would have been like, look Jamie
8249000	8251000	he speaks two languages
8251000	8253000	and until you can speak
8253000	8255000	two languages fluently, you're going to cut him a break
8255000	8257000	so please don't ever
8257000	8259000	be afraid to email us just because English isn't your
8259000	8261000	first language. Jamie will give you a break
8261000	8263000	because, you know, she expects if you're going to
8263000	8265000	speak one language, speak it well
8265000	8267000	but if you're going to speak more than one, then you get
8267000	8269000	a little room for error, so don't worry about it
8269000	8271000	LDuckSauce? Is that what we're
8271000	8273000	calling him now? Yes, LDuckSauce
8273000	8275000	LDuckSauce, ok, act-def says that would be
8275000	8277000	El PatoSauce
8277000	8279000	but that doesn't have a D in it
8279000	8281000	alright
8281000	8283000	alright, anyway
8283000	8285000	however, I am too excited to not tell
8285000	8287000	anyone about this, I am currently a beta
8287000	8289000	tester for PlayStation Now
8289000	8291000	I wanted to hear your opinions, please
8291000	8293000	keep my name private so I don't get in trouble for
8293000	8295000	opening my big mouth, you've got it
8295000	8297000	LDuckSauce, alright, I finally
8297000	8299000	received the code to get into the private
8299000	8301000	beta of PlayStation Now
8301000	8303000	I want to know your opinions about the service
8303000	8305000	do you think it's going to be a great, great
8305000	8307000	service? What are the problems you see
8307000	8309000	with this service? What do you want this service
8309000	8311000	to be when all is said and done? Do you think
8311000	8313000	it can be a type of future for gaming?
8313000	8315000	That's a lot of questions, LDuckSauce
8315000	8317000	but I will try to kind of summarize
8317000	8319000	my thoughts on it
8319000	8321000	I think it's a very exciting and creative way
8321000	8323000	to get the PlayStation games
8323000	8325000	backwards compatible. I am not
8325000	8327000	too exciting at the prospect of paying
8327000	8329000	for games again. I really wish
8329000	8331000	that if I had a PlayStation 3 disc
8331000	8333000	I could just enable that in my library
8333000	8335000	I realize why that's probably not going to
8335000	8337000	be possible, even if the digital games
8337000	8339000	carry over, I'll be mostly happy
8339000	8341000	about that, so I'm hoping
8341000	8343000	I'm a little worried about the technology
8343000	8345000	sometimes with streaming games
8345000	8347000	it's not always perfect
8347000	8349000	the delay concerns
8349000	8351000	me quite a bit
8351000	8353000	but I commend
8353000	8355000	them for trying and I'm open
8355000	8357000	to it and again I'm really
8357000	8359000	curious to see how much they charge for some
8359000	8361000	of these games because it's very interesting
8361000	8363000	what LDuckSauce breaks down
8363000	8365000	here
8365000	8367000	BlackWolf says
8367000	8369000	I want to hear LDuckSauce's opinion because he's
8369000	8371000	actually used it
8371000	8373000	and BlackWolf says it's hard to answer these
8373000	8375000	questions without having used the service
8375000	8377000	so let's get into actually
8377000	8379000	you're lucky Bobby because LDuckSauce actually
8379000	8381000	answers these questions
8381000	8383000	my experience so far is as follows
8383000	8385000	I'm using a Playstation 3 and a wireless
8385000	8387000	connection, the beta only has about 20
8387000	8389000	games and so far in the beta
8389000	8391000	I believe it's a good selection, they have good games
8391000	8393000	like Saints Row 3, Luminous Supernova
8393000	8395000	Puppeteer, BlazBlue, Disgaea
8395000	8397000	Catherine Knights Grid, Fuel, and Skullgirls
8397000	8399000	as you can see they have a good selection
8399000	8401000	or choices for anyone
8401000	8403000	for now all the games are free
8403000	8405000	I was going to say those are all the Playstation Plus games
8405000	8407000	for the most part
8407000	8409000	not Luminous, I would have grabbed that
8409000	8411000	well some of these are, some of these are
8411000	8413000	not, maybe those are upcoming
8413000	8415000	free titles
8415000	8417000	alright, when you select a game
8417000	8419000	you need to pick how many days you want to
8419000	8421000	rent this game, you have three options
8421000	8423000	one day, seven, or thirty days
8423000	8425000	I will assume that these prices will eventually
8425000	8427000	show up after beta, the game
8427000	8429000	themselves ran great, I do have to admit that
8429000	8431000	I never had a problem with the actual gameplay, sounds
8431000	8433000	or frame rate, however I did have
8433000	8435000	trouble with the video quality, there's this weird
8435000	8437000	YouTube dream effect going on
8437000	8439000	I don't know how to explain it, it's like when you watch a
8439000	8441000	YouTube HD video on your iPhone
8441000	8443000	and the quality drops to 720 or lower
8443000	8445000	for a couple seconds, this happens sometimes
8445000	8447000	on Playstation 3 games that I was streaming
8447000	8449000	at first it was super distracting, but eventually
8449000	8451000	you got used to the video dip, when I plugged
8451000	8453000	in the connection, this problem was resolved
8453000	8455000	my second concern is that I am worried
8455000	8457000	about online gaming with this program
8457000	8459000	I haven't tried that part yet, but I love
8459000	8461000	fighting games and I can't truly see anyone
8461000	8463000	playing fighting games online with some
8463000	8465000	service like this, I'm really
8465000	8467000	impressed by this technology, I know
8467000	8469000	that there was something like this before
8469000	8471000	I think it was called OnLive, I feel
8471000	8473000	that this could become like a Netflix meets
8473000	8475000	RedBox and specifically if you mix it with
8475000	8477000	Playstation Network Plus, no need
8477000	8479000	to ask for demos, just pay 99 cents
8479000	8481000	and rent the game for a day, maybe
8481000	8483000	a program like this will also discourage game
8483000	8485000	companies to make short games, like a game
8485000	8487000	like the most recent Metal Gear, I would have
8487000	8489000	rented it for a day or week instead of buying a disc
8489000	8491000	version, I know there will be problems like
8491000	8493000	internet connections, licensing fees and other things
8493000	8495000	that Sony can't control, I truly
8495000	8497000	wish this is part of the future for gaming
8497000	8499000	I know I only test it for two days so far
8499000	8501000	but I'm loving it, I know we all want to know
8501000	8503000	what the future for gaming is, but this could be something
8503000	8505000	that Sony can release quietly and catch on
8505000	8507000	really good once we all give it a chance
8507000	8509000	Sorry for the long email, just wanted to hear
8509000	8511000	your opinions and give mine, keep up
8511000	8513000	the great podcast, love you guys
8513000	8515000	Lducksauce
8515000	8517000	There it is, so
8517000	8519000	thank you for the email and actually your English
8519000	8521000	is very good, I did correct some of your tense
8521000	8523000	as I was reading it, that's really
8523000	8525000	the only thing I see is that sometimes you have to put
8525000	8527000	the D at the end of the word because it's in the past
8527000	8529000	but otherwise you did a great job
8529000	8531000	and considering I can speak no Spanish
8531000	8533000	really, although that won't
8533000	8535000	stop me from trying to watch Telemundo because that
8535000	8537000	shit's great, I'm very impressed
8537000	8539000	and please do email us in the future
8539000	8541000	What did you guys think about, what do you have to say about PlayStation Now?
8541000	8543000	I just have to make, you know
8543000	8545000	as long as it works and the
8545000	8547000	pricing is right, because I mean honestly
8547000	8549000	with some of these older games and stuff, why am I
8549000	8551000	going to rent it if I can buy a used
8551000	8553000	copy of it for just about the same price
8553000	8555000	you know, like hell fuck, I just bought
8555000	8557000	Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 for five bucks
8557000	8559000	I'm not going to rent it
8559000	8561000	Is this why GameStop
8561000	8563000	might think they're in trouble though, like they're thinking the opposite
8563000	8565000	you're thinking, that people will want to rent
8565000	8567000	because it's so convenient? No, because that's why rental
8567000	8569000	stores are around, I mean you can rent games if you want
8569000	8571000	to usually, I mean depending on your area
8571000	8573000	I guess, and those are kind of
8573000	8575000	gone by the wayside anyways, and they already have
8575000	8577000	they have games in Redbox so you can get
8577000	8579000	like for example Metal Gear Solid
8579000	8581000	or Metal Gear Solid 5, Ground Zeroes
8581000	8583000	you probably could have rented that for like two bucks
8583000	8585000	or whatever and
8585000	8587000	that's available to you
8587000	8589000	but it's just whether you want to do it or not
8589000	8591000	Shane, what are your thoughts on PlayStation Now?
8591000	8593000	Well as someone who may or may not
8593000	8595000	have played it
8595000	8597000	I may or may not agree
8597000	8599000	with what he said, especially
8599000	8601000	the parts about
8601000	8603000	it not being laggy
8603000	8605000	or
8605000	8607000	responsive, like
8607000	8609000	say for example, hypothetical
8609000	8611000	hypothetical
8611000	8613000	playing Luminesce
8613000	8615000	if I were in the beta
8615000	8617000	I may have problems
8617000	8619000	or may have had problems
8619000	8621000	playing Luminesce because
8621000	8623000	of the responsiveness
8623000	8625000	of the controller or
8625000	8627000	that stupid music
8627000	8629000	game shooter thing where you play
8629000	8631000	backwards and it's all based on the
8631000	8633000	retrograde which I liked. No, no
8633000	8635000	I'm saying based on a PlayStation
8635000	8637000	Now experience that I may or may not have had
8637000	8639000	yeah
8639000	8641000	that was ridiculously hard
8641000	8643000	because of that, or would have been
8643000	8645000	if I was playing it
8645000	8647000	but I think
8647000	8649000	otherwise I agree with what he said
8649000	8651000	I
8651000	8653000	worry about that delay between
8653000	8655000	input because it makes music
8655000	8657000	games hell, it makes a lot of action games or anything
8657000	8659000	especially a very demanding
8659000	8661000	platformer that you have to time
8661000	8663000	your jumps perfectly and shit
8663000	8665000	NES Remix which I know isn't a PlayStation
8665000	8667000	game but hear me out
8667000	8669000	that would be murder on that so they really need to
8669000	8671000	tighten that up. It's murder on any game
8671000	8673000	like maybe in the
8673000	8675000	past when they had Guacamelee up
8675000	8677000	to play and if I had been
8677000	8679000	playing it just normal jumps would
8679000	8681000	have been awful to get to
8681000	8683000	various parts in that game
8683000	8685000	making me turn off the system
8685000	8687000	alright
8687000	8689000	well I
8689000	8691000	really appreciate the email from
8691000	8693000	ElDuckSauce so please
8693000	8695000	who has a new nickname thanks
8695000	8697000	to Shane? You never had
8697000	8699000	one before but you do know. I can nickname everybody
8699000	8701000	that you have for the mailbag
8701000	8703000	so let's go with the next one
8703000	8705000	we'll get to it, hold on because in the chat TigerCaw
8705000	8707000	asks, Sky you tried watching
8707000	8709000	Sabado Higante, yes I have
8709000	8711000	that shit is amazing, it's like a
8711000	8713000	game show, variety show
8713000	8715000	that's the type of stuff that used to
8715000	8717000	be on the TV in the golden age here
8717000	8719000	in America and you don't see it anymore
8719000	8721000	but you're still doing that stuff on Sabado Higante
8721000	8723000	which Act F corrects
8723000	8725000	is on Univision
8725000	8727000	not Telemundo, yes it's the other
8727000	8729000	big Spanish network
8729000	8731000	so there you go
8731000	8733000	yes I do enjoy watching Sabado Higante
8733000	8735000	I have no idea what they're saying but some of the
8735000	8737000	sketches are still hilarious and I can
8737000	8739000	I can pick up enough words
8739000	8741000	you know
8741000	8743000	like if I'm watching a
8743000	8745000	telenovela
8745000	8747000	and one chick calls another
8747000	8749000	a peta, like I know what they're saying
8749000	8751000	no
8751000	8753000	alright, moving on
8753000	8755000	we have another email from
8755000	8757000	this one is from
8757000	8759000	Martin from
8759000	8761000	Belgium, Martin
8761000	8763000	from Belgium, he's emailed us before
8763000	8765000	I thought I was giving a nickname, well that's
8765000	8767000	that's the name, what should Martin
8767000	8769000	but there's no nickname, Martin is I think their real
8769000	8771000	name, like you know
8771000	8773000	Martin but Belgium, what you gonna give
8773000	8775000	a nickname or not, not now?
8775000	8777000	you're protesting? I'm protesting, I was going
8777000	8779000	to give it before
8779000	8781000	we, okay we'll assume I didn't say his
8781000	8783000	name, it's too late, I can't do that
8783000	8785000	cause now I'm like oh his nickname
8785000	8787000	will be Martin
8787000	8789000	alright
8789000	8791000	Dear Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, I wanted to email
8791000	8793000	you this week since you were kind enough to remember
8793000	8795000	on last week's show that you have listeners in Belgium
8795000	8797000	I got your back, I got your back
8797000	8799000	I remember, why are you laughing?
8799000	8801000	I just took that as a dig at you
8801000	8803000	yeah cause I usually forget
8803000	8805000	a lot of things, I really do
8805000	8807000	congratulations on your 550th episode
8807000	8809000	that's an impressive number, now on to
8809000	8811000	666
8811000	8813000	I listened to the show on my commute to work, a welcome
8813000	8815000	distraction, I've been playing FTL
8815000	8817000	faster than light this week, my god is it
8817000	8819000	addictive, again, they just released
8819000	8821000	a free expansion pack adding new ships, weapons
8821000	8823000	and events which made the game interesting again
8823000	8825000	since I got burned out on it last time
8825000	8827000	is it the kind of game that incites
8827000	8829000	it is the kind of game that incites comments
8829000	8831000	such as crap, it is that time already
8831000	8833000	I just played FTL for 5 hours and it felt like
8833000	8835000	5 minutes, it seems to make time move
8835000	8837000	around you faster than light
8841000	8843000	that came with a winky face, that's an apology
8843000	8845000	for that pun, definitely recommend
8845000	8847000	it, also wanted to share
8847000	8849000	something gaming hardware related, I just
8849000	8851000	got a new Retina MacBook Pro recently which
8851000	8853000	is pretty good hardware for gaming, an Nvidia
8853000	8855000	750M, but tends to get very hot
8855000	8857000	due to the thin form factor, I came
8857000	8859000	up with a cooling solution for when I'm using it at my desk
8859000	8861000	for gaming, I prop up the MacBook on
8861000	8863000	a giant heat sink and have a
8863000	8865000	120mm fan blowing
8865000	8867000	cool air through it, the heat at the
8867000	8869000	bottom of the aluminum case is conducted through the
8869000	8871000	heat sink and blown away, I attached a
8871000	8873000	picture, this lowers the system temperature
8873000	8875000	significantly while gaming
8875000	8877000	anyway, keep up the great show so I have something to do
8877000	8879000	on my commute to work, greetings from
8879000	8881000	Belgium, the land of beer and waffles
8881000	8883000	just one 120mm fan?
8883000	8885000	you forgot fries
8885000	8887000	by the way, I went to a place
8887000	8889000	in New York City once, it was nothing but Belgian fries
8889000	8891000	and dips, it was so fucking good
8891000	8893000	I went to a place that was just all fries
8893000	8895000	this weekend, it's called
8895000	8897000	Potato Corner, and they have
8897000	8899000	six types of fries and they're all different flavors
8899000	8901000	where is this at? This sounds amazing
8901000	8903000	Paladio, it's in the food court
8903000	8905000	I'm gonna have to check that out, I don't know what that is
8905000	8907000	alright, there's a PS
8907000	8909000	by the way before I get to the picture, PS I'm on my way
8909000	8911000	to go paintballing right now which I also recommend
8911000	8913000	it's like a real life video game and also good exercise
8913000	8915000	well that's something Loki used to do, the paintballing
8915000	8917000	I did airsoft
8917000	8919000	paintball's a little bit more honest because you can actually
8919000	8921000	see when you hit somebody and can't say
8921000	8923000	I didn't hit, what are you talking about?
8923000	8925000	and here's the picture
8925000	8927000	of the heat sink and the fan
8927000	8929000	against the laptop, that seems to be
8929000	8931000	pretty, I bet if Loki had
8931000	8933000	did that when he was doing Titanfall
8933000	8935000	his laptop would not have melted
8935000	8937000	I did not have my
8937000	8939000	heat sink or fan
8939000	8941000	when I was playing Titanfall because I was at work
8941000	8943000	and I don't bring it with me because it's fucking huge
8943000	8945000	and also requires an external
8945000	8947000	12 volt power supply in order to run
8947000	8949000	those fans, and I actually don't use those fans anymore
8949000	8951000	because my new laptop's pretty cool
8951000	8953000	I just have to
8953000	8955000	use that tray because it still gets warm
8955000	8957000	on the bottom, just not to the point where
8957000	8959000	it's gonna break
8959000	8961000	damn you aces
8961000	8963000	if I still buy you
8963000	8965000	alright
8965000	8967000	now onto our last
8967000	8969000	email tonight
8969000	8971000	which is a follow up to an email we got
8971000	8973000	last week, which Shane you let me know during the break
8973000	8975000	you don't listen to OLR so you didn't hear
8975000	8977000	of this email, you know I was asleep
8977000	8979000	alright, well
8979000	8981000	last week we had an email
8981000	8983000	from Dr. Noir
8983000	8985000	who emailed us from Lima, Peru
8985000	8987000	and said they could not remember the name
8987000	8989000	of a game, it was an 8 or 16
8989000	8991000	bit game where you place
8991000	8993000	so here's the description of the game for you Shane
8993000	8995000	cause you asked, so here it is, Shane
8995000	8997000	you gotta guess, you ready?
8997000	8999000	it's an 8 or 16 bit game
8999000	9001000	where you place mythical creatures
9001000	9003000	I remember unicorns and dragons
9003000	9005000	on a hex board to do battle
9005000	9007000	against monsters on a turn based
9007000	9009000	strategy system, the creatures
9009000	9011000	level up after they acquire kills
9011000	9013000	the name and platform for the game
9013000	9015000	is what I'm after, and a source
9015000	9017000	would be appreciated since I wanna play it
9017000	9019000	with my kids, Shane
9019000	9021000	can you name that game?
9023000	9025000	no
9025000	9029000	what is
9029000	9031000	crappy RTS on
9031000	9033000	the Genesis or Super Nintendo
9035000	9037000	and he wagered
9037000	9039000	one dollar, no I put
9039000	9041000	everything, it was like 30 million
9041000	9043000	alright, well
9043000	9045000	somebody last week got it right
9045000	9047000	Dr. Noir's emailing
9047000	9049000	us again, hi OL Army
9049000	9051000	greetings from Buenos Aires, Argentina
9051000	9053000	he's moving around
9053000	9055000	he explains why in the email
9055000	9057000	thanks for the answer
9057000	9059000	Master of Monsters it is
9059000	9061000	I played the Genesis version
9061000	9063000	oh I got some of that right
9063000	9065000	yeah Genesis or
9065000	9067000	Super Nintendo, yeah but it could've been
9067000	9069000	8 bit, so I was still
9069000	9071000	half right, so there it is Master of
9071000	9073000	Monsters it is, and somebody in chat had
9073000	9075000	yelled that out last week and I think Sega gave him a
9075000	9077000	free game for getting it, so
9077000	9079000	thank you chatters, you saved the date, that's why
9079000	9081000	I love doing this live show, and I fully
9081000	9083000	admit, sometimes I don't know it
9083000	9085000	when we're talking about video games, and Loki don't
9085000	9087000	know it, and Jamie doesn't know it, and Shane sure
9087000	9089000	don't know it, sorry I don't know all the obscure RTS
9089000	9091000	back from the 8 bit days, but we had
9091000	9093000	the chat room to save the day, and it was Master
9093000	9095000	of Monsters was the game, and
9095000	9097000	he goes on to say Sky, sorry for the
9097000	9099000	headache, it wasn't
9099000	9101000	really your question that was causing the headache
9101000	9103000	I had a lot going on during the show last week
9103000	9105000	there was a lot going on, everything's
9105000	9107000	better now, and
9107000	9109000	Dr. Noir wants to clarify, I'm Mexican
9109000	9111000	but I travel a lot for my
9111000	9113000	sales job, listen to you soon
9113000	9115000	we'll say hello to everybody in Argentina if you
9115000	9117000	haven't already left, so there it is
9117000	9119000	Dungeon Buster, taking a bow in
9119000	9121000	a victory lap in our chat room for remembering
9121000	9123000	Master of Monsters, and
9123000	9125000	all of our listeners as well can finally
9125000	9127000	go, finally
9127000	9129000	and it's funny because my buddy Jonko
9129000	9131000	from Koopa Club actually left
9131000	9133000	a comment on the Orange Launch Radio page
9133000	9135000	it was like, what if like
9135000	9137000	somebody just made something up that didn't exist
9137000	9139000	and sent it to your email bag, like how
9139000	9141000	I was like, I kind of thought that's what
9141000	9143000	happened, like not that I thought Dr. Noir would lie
9143000	9145000	I certainly wouldn't think he would lie, but you know
9145000	9147000	how like memory can change details
9147000	9149000	sometimes, like you think it was one
9149000	9151000	thing but it was- I know, there was
9151000	9153000	seriously, there was seriously
9153000	9155000	one of those fucking meditroid
9155000	9157000	energy tanks in one spot, and I wrote
9157000	9159000	down on like, cause back in the day I used
9159000	9161000	to have like a place I'd write down you know where stuff
9161000	9163000	was, and it wasn't fucking there
9163000	9165000	any other time I went back there, and I know
9165000	9167000	was there cause I got it one time
9167000	9169000	and it was never there again
9169000	9171000	damn anomalies
9171000	9173000	Well Dungeon Buster did not go away
9173000	9175000	unrewarded, he does clarify in chat
9175000	9177000	Seg gave away a copy of
9177000	9179000	Dominique Pamplemousse, which Seg was here
9179000	9181000	on the show promoting about a month or so
9181000	9183000	ago, which is available on Steam, check
9183000	9185000	it out, if you like kind of artsy
9185000	9187000	games that are kind of click adventures
9187000	9189000	that are musicals, check
9189000	9191000	that out, Dominique Pamplemousse, and thanks Seg
9191000	9193000	for giving that out
9193000	9195000	Black Wolf says master of monsters for classic game
9195000	9197000	of the week, I was trying to pressure
9197000	9199000	Jamie into doing that tonight actually
9199000	9201000	but then she ended up not being here and I was like
9201000	9203000	alright well, Shane doesn't always get to pick
9203000	9205000	so I'll let him pick, and I would not have agreed
9205000	9207000	with that, this
9207000	9209000	crappy RTS came out
9209000	9211000	in some stupid time
9211000	9213000	stop it
9213000	9215000	alright, anyhow
9215000	9217000	moving
9217000	9219000	on, that is
9219000	9221000	that is that, that's it for the mailbag
9221000	9223000	get to the FUs of the week, thank you guys very much
9223000	9225000	for emailing us, participate
9225000	9227000	at Orangeloungeradio.com
9227000	9229000	is the place where you can send us emails
9229000	9231000	if you want to try and stump
9231000	9233000	the hosts
9233000	9235000	or ask Shane for an answer, then he'll just
9235000	9237000	go, well it's maybe
9237000	9239000	black or white or kind of in between
9239000	9241000	it might be anything actually
9241000	9243000	no, I gave an answer, it was pretty
9243000	9245000	like the only thing I was wrong on
9245000	9247000	or you know, not sure if it was the Genesis
9247000	9249000	or Super Nintendo part
9249000	9251000	but it was stupid RTS with unicorns
9251000	9253000	or whatever
9253000	9255000	alright, alright
9255000	9257000	let's move on and
9257000	9259000	get into the FUs of the week
9275000	9277000	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight
9277000	9279000	because Jamie's not here
9279000	9281000	I guess FU2
9281000	9283000	or future FU2
9283000	9285000	I'm gonna have to make
9285000	9287000	actual levels for my game
9287000	9289000	and I was thinking about it today
9289000	9291000	I'm like, out of all the things I'm gonna have to do for this
9291000	9293000	that's gonna be the hardest
9293000	9295000	so, as fun as it will be
9295000	9297000	making stuff, that's not gonna be fun to
9297000	9299000	actually do because you have to
9299000	9301000	you know, find a
9301000	9303000	nice balance between detail
9303000	9305000	and optimization
9305000	9307000	little voxels
9307000	9309000	a little difficult
9311000	9313000	alright, Shane, do you have an FU of the week?
9313000	9315000	I sure don't
9315000	9317000	alright
9317000	9319000	I'm gonna take one that I think you wish
9319000	9321000	you would have thought of, my FU of the week
9321000	9323000	goes to PG&E
9323000	9325000	man, it was fun
9325000	9327000	who banged on my door at 9 o'clock this morning
9327000	9329000	that were like
9329000	9331000	we're here to shut off the gas because you don't have an account
9331000	9333000	through us
9333000	9335000	I'm like, because you remember, we just moved into this house
9335000	9337000	about 6 weeks ago at this point
9337000	9339000	and I'm like, da fuck?
9339000	9341000	I'm like, yes we do, I called in to get it arranged
9341000	9343000	I logged into the website and gave this lady my account number
9343000	9345000	and she was like, dumbstruck, like awestruck
9345000	9347000	like, how could this happen?
9347000	9349000	what is this internet that you've talked about?
9349000	9351000	I know, well she even admitted, she's like, I'm an older lady
9351000	9353000	I don't know anything about this internet
9353000	9355000	when she realized I wasn't
9355000	9357000	like, that I had the receipts
9357000	9359000	I'm like, here's the receipts, lady
9359000	9361000	here they are
9361000	9363000	I know, she backed off a lot
9363000	9365000	she became very apologetic, she's like
9365000	9367000	oh, something's going on, let me take that down
9367000	9369000	well yeah, it's like, god dammit, someone
9369000	9371000	all of us fucked up again
9371000	9373000	well first off, Shane was like, how do you even know that was real
9373000	9375000	and maybe I don't, like it could have been a fake truck
9375000	9377000	or something, but
9377000	9379000	well she was just so crazy in her knocking
9379000	9381000	and doorbell ringing
9381000	9383000	they didn't ask for my social security or anything
9383000	9385000	so I was like, alright, whatever
9385000	9387000	but yeah, I was like, that was a little weird
9387000	9389000	I think cops knock on like
9389000	9391000	criminals' doors nicer, because this is what she did
9391000	9393000	okay, etiquette dictates
9393000	9395000	that you ring the doorbell
9395000	9397000	you wait a couple moments
9397000	9399000	no answer, you knock politely
9399000	9401000	you wait a couple moments
9401000	9403000	you may repeat these steps again
9403000	9405000	she was, knock, knock, knock
9405000	9407000	doorbell, doorbell, doorbell, doorbell
9407000	9409000	knock, knock, doorbell, doorbell
9409000	9411000	so she was my wife
9411000	9413000	this is what my wife does
9413000	9415000	whenever she goes to her parents' house
9415000	9417000	and they're like, yep, it's Nellie
9417000	9419000	it's 9 AM on a Sunday
9419000	9421000	and I have a rock and roll lifestyle
9421000	9423000	yes, I am still asleep
9423000	9425000	and Alan
9425000	9427000	obviously I made Alan
9427000	9429000	get up
9429000	9431000	I know, I'm poking Alan
9431000	9433000	get the door
9433000	9435000	Alan gets up and gets it and is like, the lawn
9435000	9437000	better be on fucking fire
9437000	9439000	so yeah, that's what it was
9439000	9441000	so
9441000	9443000	F you to PG&E for getting me up
9443000	9445000	early on a Sunday morning, and then I was up
9445000	9447000	you should complain
9447000	9449000	I did what people do in the year 2014
9449000	9451000	and I sent a passive aggressive tweet
9451000	9453000	that's what I did
9453000	9455000	I would have called them up and complained
9455000	9457000	because then you would be like, listen, they woke me up
9457000	9459000	you said that I didn't have an account
9459000	9461000	and you were threatening to shut off my stuff
9461000	9463000	I had to show you
9463000	9465000	this information that's available in your system
9465000	9467000	maybe they would have knocked off some money on your bill
9467000	9469000	we'll see what happens, I'm gonna see if I get a response on Monday
9469000	9471000	because then if I don't get a response
9471000	9473000	then that's two strikes
9473000	9475000	they knocked on my door
9475000	9477000	and didn't acknowledge my passive aggressive tweet
9477000	9479000	come on, check what year it is
9481000	9483000	I needed to get somebody that knew how to use a computer
9483000	9485000	that was my problem
9485000	9487000	alright, computer? what?
9487000	9489000	what is computer? there's no computer in this house
9489000	9491000	it's too small
9491000	9493000	how do you internet?
9493000	9495000	alright, which room do you have
9495000	9497000	dedicated to said computer?
9497000	9499000	couple more news stories for you guys
9499000	9501000	then we're gonna get to you guys at
9502000	9504000	where does the reel-to-reel tape go?
9504000	9506000	or our username on skype
9506000	9508000	orange lounge radio, all one word
9508000	9511000	let's get to a couple more stories, Loki
9511000	9513000	alright, so, talking about
9513000	9515000	like, really strange accusations
9515000	9517000	um
9517000	9519000	ZeniMax
9519000	9521000	they're claiming that
9521000	9524000	IPs were thefted
9524000	9526000	thefted
9526000	9528000	um, see
9528000	9530000	to el-duckface
9530000	9532000	verbs?
9532000	9534000	oh, sorry, el-duck-sauce
9534000	9535000	I couldn't remember the name
9535000	9537000	I hate, I did that on purpose
9537000	9539000	ok, that was purposefully mispronounced
9539000	9540000	alright, fine
9540000	9541000	because it was funny
9541000	9542000	tense is hard
9542000	9543000	it's for humor, ok
9543000	9545000	so yes, basically they claim that
9545000	9547000	when John Carmack left he took
9547000	9549000	some proprietary VR
9549000	9551000	information and now
9551000	9553000	they're pissed off and they think that
9553000	9555000	money should be owed
9555000	9557000	little do they realize that
9557000	9559000	oculus was around before he left
9559000	9561000	for oculus
9561000	9563000	so, I don't understand that
9563000	9565000	part of it, but whatever
9565000	9567000	um, basically
9567000	9569000	seeing as ZeniMax
9569000	9571000	um, you know
9571000	9573000	they send a formal notice
9573000	9575000	regarding its legal rights to oculus concerning
9575000	9577000	its ownership of key technology used by oculus
9577000	9579000	to develop and market the oculus rip
9579000	9581000	I just don't buy that, I mean
9583000	9585000	I don't know, I
9585000	9587000	maybe John Carmack was working on some
9587000	9589000	VR stuff separate to the oculus rip
9589000	9591000	but I don't think that, it's not like he
9591000	9593000	left, formed oculus
9593000	9595000	rift, and then that
9595000	9597000	all happened, you know, it was
9597000	9599000	he came and joined them after
9599000	9601000	they already kind of had a prototype and
9601000	9603000	everything, so I don't really understand what
9603000	9605000	the point is
9605000	9607000	um, I'm guessing that they just want a piece
9607000	9609000	of that 2 billion dollars maybe
9609000	9611000	maybe, now that Facebook's involved, the timing
9611000	9613000	of it is a little suspicious
9613000	9615000	of course, you know, John Carmack has, you know
9615000	9617000	responded saying, no work I have ever done
9617000	9619000	has been patented
9619000	9621000	ZeniMax owns the code that I wrote
9621000	9623000	but they don't own VR
9623000	9625000	ouch
9625000	9627000	you know, Bobby told a very, you know, as
9627000	9629000	I'm nice in promoting Bobby, even though he keeps
9629000	9631000	telling me tonight I'm wrong, and Loki's right
9631000	9633000	but Bobby told a very interesting story tonight
9633000	9635000	on his show, uh, Bobby Blackhole's show
9635000	9637000	that, uh, about getting hired
9637000	9639000	for tech companies, cause he's been job hunting lately
9639000	9641000	and, you know, some of the things that they
9641000	9643000	expect that they're gonna own of you if you go
9643000	9645000	for this company, and like, if you write any code
9645000	9647000	even if you're not on the clock, but you're with the company
9647000	9649000	they potentially own it, so
9649000	9651000	I'll let him tell the story, you can go listen to
9651000	9653000	his show for the full details, but uh, yeah
9653000	9655000	you know, it's kind of interesting how legally
9655000	9657000	that all works when you're on somebody's payroll
9657000	9659000	like that, so that's
9659000	9661000	what they're trying to make the case
9661000	9663000	they're trying to say that someone possibly owns the rights to flappy vog
9663000	9665000	they could
9665000	9667000	if Bobby did not put a clause
9667000	9669000	in his contract or whatever, that's like
9669000	9671000	vog is a pre-existing thing and you can't
9671000	9673000	touch it, basically, if he didn't do that
9673000	9675000	uh, which I think
9675000	9677000	if I remember, I'm probably gonna be wrong again
9677000	9679000	but I believe if I listen to his show correctly
9679000	9681000	one of the people he was talking to
9681000	9683000	and getting employed at was like, we will own everything
9683000	9685000	basically, and he said no
9685000	9687000	because he didn't want them owning vog
9687000	9689000	but he got another employer that was like
9689000	9691000	you know, willing to write out, you know
9691000	9693000	things that, they, like
9693000	9695000	who's interested in vog, the types of companies he was
9695000	9697000	working for shouldn't have an interest in vog, it's not
9697000	9699000	like, not the same industry or whatever
9699000	9701000	we're interesting, what the hell
9701000	9703000	I mean, they should be interested
9703000	9705000	we're just not worth it to you guys
9705000	9707000	we've only been on the internet forever
9707000	9709000	but you know, whatever, I guess we're just not good
9709000	9711000	we're not an IGN or Kotaku
9711000	9713000	we don't run, you know
9713000	9715000	Loki, you can't get a fucking NeoGaf account, okay?
9715000	9717000	we've been doing this for 12 years
9717000	9719000	I don't even fucking care anymore about NeoGaf
9719000	9721000	it's just like, seriously
9721000	9723000	it doesn't mean shit, unfortunately
9723000	9725000	if I write another forum thread about
9725000	9727000	what game should I buy
9727000	9729000	it's like, seriously, that is worthy of a friend
9729000	9731000	that person deserved an account
9731000	9733000	you know, to, you know
9733000	9735000	that was worth it
9735000	9737000	fuck it, I don't give a shit anymore
9737000	9739000	well, speaking of things
9739000	9741000	that have been on the internet forever and forever
9741000	9743000	yet a lot of people don't seem to care
9743000	9745000	Twin Galaxies made an announcement this week
9745000	9747000	I thought they were gone!
9747000	9749000	oh, hold on, let me sip my tea
9749000	9751000	I thought they were gone though, didn't they go under or something?
9751000	9753000	nope, they're back
9753000	9755000	I think they have a new owner or something
9755000	9757000	but Twin Galaxies has announced that there's a
9757000	9759000	24-7 internet channel
9759000	9761000	dubbed Twin Galaxies Live
9761000	9763000	using Skype and Twitch
9763000	9765000	to foster interaction between broadcasters and audience members
9765000	9767000	and there's also like a schedule
9767000	9769000	of all these things so they can see what's coming up next
9769000	9771000	the COO of Twitch said in a press release
9771000	9773000	that since records are constantly being set
9773000	9775000	and broken in real time on Twitch
9775000	9777000	having Twin Galaxies on our platform
9777000	9779000	is a perfect fit
9779000	9781000	we look forward to seeing great gaming content from the Twin Galaxies team
9781000	9783000	hmm, 24-7 internet channel
9783000	9785000	fully interactive
9785000	9787000	featuring things like Skype and video
9787000	9789000	never heard of it!
9789000	9791000	never heard of it!
9791000	9793000	the only thing I'm kind of
9793000	9795000	worried about
9795000	9797000	is some of those records
9797000	9799000	especially when they're doing like these
9799000	9801000	high score records and stuff
9801000	9803000	require like 48 hours of playing
9803000	9805000	I'm not gonna fucking watch somebody play Donkey Kong
9805000	9807000	for 48 hours or however long it takes
9807000	9809000	it's several hours
9809000	9811000	I don't really mean to shade Twin Galaxies
9811000	9813000	because I do respect the site
9813000	9815000	and what it is an awful lot I do
9815000	9817000	but with all due respect
9817000	9819000	I have to go here, Logie
9819000	9821000	with all due respect
9821000	9823000	to our former home, All Games
9823000	9825000	All Games Radio, right?
9825000	9827000	I seem to remember back in the day
9827000	9829000	during All Games Interactive
9829000	9831000	somebody that he had on the show a lot
9831000	9833000	was Walter Day
9833000	9835000	from where?
9835000	9837000	Twin Galaxies
9837000	9839000	fully interactive content
9839000	9841000	I'm just an observation
9841000	9843000	I'm just...
9843000	9845000	just interesting
9845000	9847000	to be fair
9847000	9849000	there's a lot of people doing this
9849000	9851000	I think that they have now
9851000	9853000	because remember they have the awesome
9853000	9855000	games done quick type thing
9855000	9857000	where they had an event where they did that
9857000	9859000	I think they're actually continuing on with that
9859000	9861000	and that's still going
9861000	9863000	as its own channel now
9863000	9865000	where you can watch people do speedruns and stuff
9865000	9867000	it's more interesting than watching someone try to go for
9867000	9869000	the world record score in
9869000	9871000	some game
9871000	9873000	what's to say that they're actually
9873000	9875000	going to achieve that
9875000	9877000	score?
9877000	9879000	so all I'm doing is watching some person
9879000	9881000	who may not even be
9881000	9883000	a celebrity even in the gaming
9883000	9885000	scene or anything
9885000	9887000	making an attempt at a high score
9887000	9889000	so basically I'm just watching someone play a game
9889000	9891000	which is any channel on Twitch
9891000	9893000	any channel
9893000	9895000	and these people
9895000	9897000	who's giving commentary
9897000	9899000	we're in hour 46
9899000	9901000	of the
9901000	9903000	high score challenge
9903000	9905000	some people would make fun of the
9905000	9907000	Starcraft and League of Legends type of commentary
9907000	9909000	so whatever
9909000	9911000	what do you talk about at that point though
9911000	9913000	when it's gone on for several
9913000	9915000	hours you can't talk about the game
9915000	9917000	wow this part of the game is really interesting
9917000	9919000	he's gonna have to
9919000	9921000	not die in order to make sure that he
9921000	9923000	keeps a high score
9923000	9925000	that's why they have
9925000	9927000	those long videos that Twin Galaxy watches
9927000	9929000	so you don't have to watch
9929000	9931000	the 48 hour attempt to get
9931000	9933000	whatever it is high score
9933000	9935000	and granted yes I know not every high score is gonna take
9935000	9937000	48 hours but it's still several hours
9937000	9939000	usually
9939000	9941000	in all seriousness good luck to them
9941000	9943000	please tell me that they're gonna go for the records for the quickest times
9943000	9945000	finishing these games because
9945000	9947000	then they've totally ripped off the other channel
9947000	9949000	alright
9949000	9951000	yeah we're done moving to the Skype calls

10017000	10019000	guys night out I don't know if I call it
10019000	10021000	playing around you know Shane's
10021000	10023000	just running his mouth but what else is new
10023000	10025000	I'm not running my mouth I had my
10025000	10027000	microphone on mute
10027000	10029000	but uh
10029000	10031000	sure it can be it can be a bro down tonight
10031000	10033000	what do you want to um what do you want to chat with us about
10033000	10035000	alright I want to talk about something different
10035000	10037000	I don't know if you saw this but
10037000	10039000	last week you know
10039000	10041000	how Nintendo is releasing
10041000	10043000	the limited edition Mario
10043000	10045000	Kart 8 green
10045000	10047000	edition in Europe right
10047000	10049000	now I posted it on my
10049000	10051000	Facebook and I said that
10051000	10053000	they want $300 or I guess
10053000	10055000	$330 for this
10055000	10057000	fuck you Nintendo
10057000	10059000	wait till the price drops to $250 then
10059000	10061000	we can talk because I personally think
10061000	10063000	that it's overpriced for the technology
10063000	10065000	that's behind it and if you
10065000	10067000	saw it became a very interesting
10067000	10069000	conversation now a couple
10069000	10071000	days later I checked my I noticed
10071000	10073000	I have a message waiting for me on
10073000	10075000	Facebook in my other folder I go check it out
10075000	10077000	somebody was
10077000	10079000	really so butthurt
10079000	10081000	that they decided to write
10081000	10083000	a flame essay
10083000	10085000	to me about
10085000	10087000	why the Wii U
10087000	10089000	doesn't suck
10089000	10091000	and this is how Facebook
10091000	10093000	is ruining America to be
10093000	10095000	quite honest I just
10095000	10097000	sat there and I just laughed
10097000	10099000	and he's telling me
10099000	10101000	that I'm a moron for thinking
10101000	10103000	that and as he's
10103000	10105000	trying to tell me it's better he goes
10105000	10107000	into reviewing some
10107000	10109000	new Mario Brothers or something else
10109000	10111000	how it's so much better and I'm just like
10111000	10113000	if you're going
10113000	10115000	to flame me at least be a little bit
10115000	10117000	more precise
10117000	10119000	flame me straight forward
10119000	10121000	I understand everybody has their
10121000	10123000	consoles what they like and don't like
10123000	10125000	because when I first got my 360
10125000	10127000	I dealt with the same thing
10127000	10129000	I bought the 360 because at the time
10129000	10131000	it has more games
10131000	10133000	that I will play on it
10133000	10135000	now that I have a 360 and a PS3
10135000	10137000	if you look at my library
10137000	10139000	I think it's
10139000	10141000	3 to 1 of
10141000	10143000	360 games of PS3 games
10143000	10145000	some of the Nintendo fans
10145000	10147000	are extremely passionate
10147000	10149000	and you know
10149000	10151000	I understand
10151000	10153000	you know what's funny Rama
10153000	10155000	there's people that listen to this show that call me
10155000	10157000	a Nintendo fanboy and that I'm
10157000	10159000	blind to all this other stuff you know or whatever
10159000	10161000	and I kind of think
10161000	10163000	I usually think I'm pretty equally
10163000	10165000	critical and fanboy
10165000	10167000	you know there's things I love about
10167000	10169000	Nintendo but there's things that really bother me
10169000	10171000	about them too
10171000	10173000	I don't think you're being fanboy-ish at all
10173000	10175000	maybe you are but for every single
10175000	10177000	console that comes out
10177000	10179000	we rejoice
10179000	10181000	for a while and then we're like
10181000	10183000	wait what are you doing
10183000	10185000	we gotta call you out and just
10185000	10187000	play it down the middle
10187000	10189000	you know
10189000	10191000	so I mean personally
10191000	10193000	I just look at it from a technological
10193000	10195000	point of view I just personally feel
10195000	10197000	Nintendo is asking for too
10197000	10199000	much money but as we all know
10199000	10201000	Nintendo is probably the only company
10201000	10203000	that makes a profit off of their
10203000	10205000	consoles
10205000	10207000	right they do now
10207000	10209000	I don't think they used to but they do now
10209000	10211000	well from my understanding
10211000	10213000	from back as
10213000	10215000	8-bit NES they were making profit
10215000	10217000	over every single console till the 3DS
10217000	10219000	then they had to do the price
10219000	10221000	cut and I think they're
10221000	10223000	now making money off of that and
10223000	10225000	did they profit on GameCube? I thought GameCube
10225000	10227000	was one where they didn't profit I could be wrong
10227000	10229000	I think they made like between $15
10229000	10231000	to $20 off of every
10231000	10233000	GameCube sold
10233000	10235000	that's part of their strategy
10239000	10241000	like I said the power behind it
10241000	10243000	if Nintendo was to knock it down to $250
10243000	10245000	I
10245000	10247000	had no problem going to Nintendo World
10247000	10249000	or Best Buy whatever and giving them my money
10249000	10251000	and walking out with a system I'm just waiting
10251000	10253000	for the price to come down and I'm not gonna
10253000	10255000	make the same mistake I did with the N64
10255000	10257000	buying it for one game and realizing that I'm not
10257000	10259000	really liking this game
10261000	10263000	so
10263000	10265000	where are things now with you and this guy
10265000	10267000	like did you just end up banning him
10267000	10269000	or what? no no he sent the
10269000	10271000	message and he blocked me after
10271000	10273000	he sent it so I went to my personal
10273000	10275000	blog and I
10275000	10277000	just said my piece and walked away
10279000	10281000	I mean what did he hope to gain
10281000	10283000	from that whole thing I mean when you come out swinging
10283000	10285000	like that he's figured out that I'm right
10285000	10287000	and the fact that he's like
10287000	10289000	I'm wrong he's like
10289000	10291000	he also bought it for his kid I'm like
10291000	10293000	you are not setting a
10293000	10295000	proper precedent sir you need
10295000	10297000	to stop yeah like I don't know
10297000	10299000	like I just don't think that's the right way to win somebody's
10299000	10301000	opinion over going fuck you you
10301000	10303000	fucking fuck you know like I just don't think
10303000	10305000	that's the right way to do it like I think just kind of like
10305000	10307000	Rama are you considering this
10307000	10309000	or something like that might be like a better
10309000	10311000	way to do it right exactly
10311000	10313000	so if
10313000	10315000	only more people in the gaming industry could kind of think
10315000	10317000	that way not I shouldn't say the industry gaming fandom
10317000	10319000	really could think that way right
10319000	10321000	not just gaming fandom
10321000	10323000	ain't that the truth
10323000	10325000	alright Rama anything else to share

10447000	10449000	915 here on the west coast
10449000	10451000	our first part of the show was a little bit long
10451000	10453000	I'm actually trying to
10453000	10455000	go to the twitter right now I didn't see a whole lot of links
10455000	10457000	or anything come through but I think I saw some
10457000	10459000	like FYI
10459000	10461000	heads up types of things coming over
10461000	10463000	I see darkdetsuya sending us a tweet saying
10463000	10465000	apparently one of our other local indie
10465000	10467000	podcast Fistful of Potions
10467000	10469000	was taping at a local comic shop during
10469000	10471000	free comic book day that's pretty cool
10471000	10473000	cool yeah I wouldn't have thought to do that
10473000	10475000	but I know a lot of people getting out during
10475000	10477000	free com- excuse me
10477000	10479000	free comic book day so that's pretty awesome that they
10479000	10481000	participated I on the
10481000	10483000	other hand missed free comic book day
10483000	10485000	and I missed what was the other
10485000	10487000	free day they did not let it all go I'm missing
10487000	10489000	all the free days it's sad
10489000	10491000	but anyway we have another call coming in hi you're on
10491000	10493000	Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
10493000	10495000	Hey Zaku long time no chat how you
10495000	10497000	doing?
10497000	10501000	Yeah me too except without
10501000	10503000	Gran Turismo oh you got a little
10503000	10505000	rig look at that he can explain those cars
10505000	10507000	he explained all the car names
10507000	10509000	that Shane butchered earlier
10509000	10511000	are you saying your goodbyes to Gran Turismo 5
10511000	10513000	or are you on 6 now?
10513000	10515000	So I mean they're calling online multiplayer
10515000	10517000	so I kind of well I'm kind of
10517000	10519000	regretting the fact that I never partaken in it
10519000	10521000	so this kind of makes up for it
10521000	10523000	I kind of you know
10523000	10525000	after a while I had to
10525000	10527000	you know give in and buy 6
10527000	10529000	but at least I have a steering wheel for it though
10529000	10531000	so that's probably the only
10531000	10533000	good the only good thing about it
10533000	10535000	yes nice shiny
10535000	10537000	Logitech G27
10537000	10539000	yeah
10539000	10541000	let me see
10541000	10543000	yeah that whole
10543000	10545000	I guess that whole stick
10545000	10547000	with the you know
10547000	10549000	with call of duty
10549000	10551000	essentially like jumping the shark again
10551000	10553000	you know releasing the
10553000	10555000	trailer for the new version
10555000	10557000	and I'm just like wondering
10557000	10559000	whether or not like
10559000	10561000	Activision is repeating history in terms
10561000	10563000	of saturating the market with one particular
10563000	10565000	genre of video game to the point
10565000	10567000	where it's critical mass
10567000	10569000	and it basically
10569000	10571000	it just crashes
10571000	10573000	well it's only one a year right?
10573000	10575000	I mean this has been happening in sports games
10575000	10577000	since video games existed
10577000	10579000	so maybe not
10579000	10581000	sports games it's kind of expected
10581000	10583000	you know
10583000	10585000	you know players expect
10585000	10587000	an updated roster to reflect
10587000	10589000	the you know the current
10589000	10591000	state of the
10591000	10593000	Zaku you were a big time Bamani fan
10593000	10595000	you used to put out new DDR's every year
10595000	10597000	and I think it was very disappointing when they stopped
10597000	10599000	true but I got over it
10599000	10601000	and that's why I have 2DX to
10601000	10603000	fall back on
10603000	10605000	but even then you do have a point
10605000	10607000	in that you know they also release
10607000	10609000	arcade mixes every year
10609000	10611000	for certain of theirs
10611000	10613000	but I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that
10613000	10615000	everything that Activision
10615000	10617000	has pretty much you know
10617000	10619000	taken to the extreme ran with
10619000	10621000	has pretty much at some point
10621000	10623000	fizzled out for them
10623000	10625000	and so I'm just wondering whether or not
10625000	10627000	Call of Duty is the next one because
10627000	10629000	at this point Activision isn't really
10629000	10631000	doing anything other than
10631000	10633000	Call of Duty and Skylanders
10633000	10635000	wait a minute though
10635000	10637000	because Activision has Blizzard
10637000	10639000	which has a whole other thing going on there
10639000	10641000	Activision is partnered with Bungie
10641000	10643000	Activision is going to have Destiny
10643000	10645000	that has the potential to be huge
10645000	10647000	they also have Skylanders
10647000	10649000	yeah well he said Skylanders
10649000	10651000	aside from that it's just licenses
10651000	10653000	like you would expect
10653000	10655000	someone to be diversified
10655000	10657000	let's say like EA for example
10657000	10659000	which learned the hard way to not
10659000	10661000	really rest on
10661000	10663000	you know on a short thing
10663000	10665000	wait are you counting out Cabela's?
10665000	10667000	but that's like
10667000	10669000	that's a cash grab
10669000	10671000	that's what
10671000	10673000	I just mentioned
10673000	10675000	you know what EA did
10675000	10677000	what EA did to diversify their
10677000	10679000	portfolios they bought a bunch of other
10679000	10681000	companies with the cash on hand
10681000	10683000	they have the partnership with BioWare
10683000	10685000	they freaking own PopCap
10685000	10687000	and have just kind of ruined it
10687000	10689000	as we all knew they would and so on
10689000	10691000	who's more likely to take a chance
10691000	10693000	on something new?
10693000	10695000	them or Activision?
10695000	10697000	neither, what's going to end up happening
10697000	10699000	is that indies are going to be the ones
10699000	10701000	that take a chance on something new
10701000	10703000	the thing is the trend in the gaming industry
10703000	10705000	right now especially the big AAA publishers
10705000	10707000	you publish less titles
10707000	10709000	but better titles and that's what they're doing
10709000	10711000	they're sticking with titles that they're going to
10711000	10713000	have no problems with
10713000	10715000	although Activision occasionally will take like
10715000	10717000	a license like
10717000	10719000	Walking Dead or The Fast and the Fierce
10719000	10721000	and take a big pile of shit on top of it
10721000	10723000	I don't know how you fucking ruin
10723000	10725000	a Walking Dead game
10725000	10727000	the game of the year version
10727000	10729000	Zaku, Loki makes a great point about
10729000	10731000	the indies are going to be the ones that really innovate
10731000	10733000	EA and Activision are probably kicking
10733000	10735000	themselves that they didn't think of Minecraft
10735000	10737000	they probably tried to write
10737000	10739000	I bet you both those companies
10739000	10741000	have offered to write Notch a blank
10741000	10743000	check to get Minecraft
10743000	10745000	and you know as much as Notch's stubbornness
10745000	10747000	kind of drives us all bonkers in the industry
10747000	10749000	sometimes when it comes to things like Oculus Rift
10749000	10751000	you have to hand it to him that he has
10751000	10753000	not sold that out
10753000	10755000	true, that is true, he basically
10755000	10757000	I mean with the whole Facebook
10757000	10759000	deal he pretty much flat out
10759000	10761000	explained why he didn't want
10761000	10763000	why he didn't want to back that
10763000	10765000	horse anymore because it was pretty much
10765000	10767000	funded by a mega
10767000	10769000	corporation that started out small
10769000	10771000	but then it became
10771000	10773000	a lot larger than it
10773000	10775000	it just became something huge
10775000	10777000	and something critical in everyday lives
10777000	10779000	and that's not what he wants to happen to Mojang
10779000	10781000	exactly, they don't want to
10781000	10783000	jump the shark essentially in their own
10783000	10785000	corporate culture, they believe in terms
10785000	10787000	of not being
10787000	10789000	the man instead of
10789000	10791000	as opposed to just them going against
10791000	10793000	the man which is what they're doing and
10793000	10795000	so far I mean you know
10795000	10797000	Mojang's doing pretty damn well
10797000	10799000	especially for something that was essentially
10799000	10801000	a beta for most of its existence
10801000	10803000	I mean that was like one of the
10803000	10805000	best selling betas you know
10805000	10807000	long before DayZ
10807000	10809000	on Steam and that's not even out
10809000	10811000	yet and people are still paying
10811000	10813000	$30 just to try the game
10813000	10815000	that still might have
10815000	10817000	still rough around the edges
10817000	10819000	alright well
10819000	10821000	Zaku I've got to wrap things up because we're going to be
10821000	10823000	wrapping up the show but any other thoughts real quick
10823000	10825000	I guess
10825000	10827000	the only one I had that I was
10827000	10829000	trying to get to last week was the whole
10829000	10831000	Nintendo basically
10831000	10833000	doing everything
10833000	10835000	in their power to shoo away independent
10835000	10837000	developers meanwhile Sony
10837000	10839000	and Microsoft I would imagine
10839000	10841000	have like developer outreach divisions
10841000	10843000	just for independent developers
10843000	10845000	Sony sure does at this point
10845000	10847000	did you see this week on their blog
10847000	10849000	Sony was like on just some
10849000	10851000	random ass Wednesday or Thursday it was just
10851000	10853000	like hey guess what BAM
10853000	10855000	announcement BAM announcement
10855000	10857000	BAM Spelunky PlayStation 4
10857000	10859000	BAM I mean like it was like all these indie
10859000	10861000	announcements came out in advance of E3 this week
10861000	10863000	on Sony I mean not to mention
10863000	10865000	I even bought Guacamelee
10865000	10867000	like an hour ago
10867000	10869000	on PSN I was just
10869000	10871000	like trying to grab whatever you know
10871000	10873000	some of the flash sales some of the things selling this
10873000	10875000	weekend so I mean it
10875000	10877000	gives credence to the fact that
10877000	10879000	Sony and Microsoft
10879000	10881000	they you know they try to diversify
10881000	10883000	and not just AAA
10883000	10885000	games but just something that would give
10885000	10887000	you a reason to buy their platform even
10887000	10889000	if it's a small one. I would say
10889000	10891000	Nintendo's got a
10891000	10893000	has got an image problem in
10893000	10895000	the development community right now
10895000	10897000	both large and small both third party
10897000	10899000	and independent and people can argue with me
10899000	10901000	all they want on that I think we would be fighting
10901000	10903000	over the severity of that honestly but
10903000	10905000	I think no matter where you look at it Nintendo's got an image
10905000	10907000	problem they've got to fix.
10907000	10909000	And it goes it further
10909000	10911000	reinforces the point why developers
10911000	10913000	are running away from the Wii U it's like
10913000	10915000	it's like a redhead stepchild that
10915000	10917000	they don't want to talk about because it's
10917000	10919000	dated it's just
10919000	10921000	like a I use this expression
10921000	10923000	from the Simpsons of an episode
10923000	10925000	where you know they try to reinvent Malibu
10925000	10927000	Stacy but all they end up doing is just
10927000	10929000	repackaging her with a new hat
10929000	10931000	trying to get the Wii U
10931000	10933000	it's basically the Wii with just an
10933000	10935000	HDMI port
10935000	10937000	we'll see what happens come E3
10937000	10939000	and what Nintendo can do to fix that image problem
10939000	10941000	but Zaku I'm going to let you go so we wrap up the show
10941000	10943000	take care buddy. Have a good one. Alright you too.
10943000	10945000	Alright that is going to do it for the skype line
10945000	10947000	tonight because we're damn near 9.30
10947000	10949000	so I've got to wrap up the show I'm very sorry to those
10949000	10951000	that didn't get through if you wanted to get on
10951000	10953000	tonight's show and you weren't able to get through please consider
10953000	10955000	sending us an email participate at orangelandtrady.com
10955000	10957000	or you can send us a tweet
10957000	10959000	on twitter.com slash o-l-r
10959000	10961000	I'm going to check in with Loki real quick to see if he has
10961000	10963000	any last minute stories
10963000	10965000	yeah real quick there's a couple things
10965000	10967000	one there's this game
10967000	10969000	I actually saw on Kickstarter it's
10969000	10971000	sort of looks like Jet Set Radio
10971000	10973000	it's called
10973000	10975000	Hover Revolt of Gamers
10975000	10977000	and there's gameplay
10977000	10979000	they kind of describe it like
10979000	10981000	Mirror's Edge and Jet Set Radio
10981000	10983000	well to make it even
10983000	10985000	more like Jet Set Radio or
10985000	10987000	Grind Radio
10987000	10989000	they have a stretch goal of 60,000
10989000	10991000	which is going to add the
10991000	10993000	composer Hideki
10993000	10995000	Naganuma
10995000	10997000	which I hope I didn't mispronounce
10997000	10999000	that but he was the original producer
10999000	11001000	or the original composer for
11001000	11003000	that's right Jet Set Radio
11003000	11005000	oh interesting
11005000	11007000	so
11007000	11009000	that would be pretty cool
11009000	11011000	and then this is kind of
11011000	11013000	neat looking
11013000	11015000	this thing called Project Evo
11015000	11017000	and it's apparently an
11017000	11019000	iOS game made by this company
11019000	11021000	Akili Interactive Labs
11021000	11023000	and apparently playing this game
11023000	11025000	will be able to kind of
11025000	11027000	evaluate you to see if you might be
11027000	11029000	susceptible
11029000	11031000	for
11031000	11033000	what is it? Alzheimer's
11033000	11035000	so that's
11035000	11037000	kind of interesting and they're also saying that they're
11037000	11039000	attempting to use
11039000	11041000	the same research I guess to
11041000	11043000	diagnose ADHD, autism
11043000	11045000	and depression
11045000	11047000	kind of neat game that can
11047000	11049000	basically
11049000	11051000	evaluate your state of being
11051000	11053000	and
11053000	11055000	last but not least
11055000	11057000	this game actually I saw a while ago
11057000	11059000	Hat in Time
11059000	11061000	it was also another Kickstarter project and
11061000	11063000	what's kind of cool about it is it looks very much like
11063000	11065000	Wind Waker and
11065000	11067000	apparently now they're having the
11067000	11069000	alpha version of the game available if you
11069000	11071000	backed it or if you have it on pre-order
11071000	11073000	and it looks very very very pretty
11073000	11075000	so check that out if you like the
11075000	11077000	Wind Waker platformer type games
11077000	11079000	and your games look very very pretty
11079000	11081000	alright
11081000	11083000	well that is going to wrap up another episode of
11083000	11085000	Orange Lounge Radio but I do have one other
11085000	11087000	last minute story, this involves next week's
11087000	11089000	show, this is pretty cool, Loki I don't even
11089000	11091000	think I've had a chance to tell you about this yet
11091000	11093000	but next week on the show we're going to have a special guest
11093000	11095000	we are going to have a live interview
11095000	11097000	and this is pretty cool, we're going to have
11097000	11099000	a live interview here on the show with
11099000	11101000	Christopher Tin who is the
11101000	11103000	composer of
11103000	11105000	Baba Yetu the song that won a Grammy
11105000	11107000	the first song that ever won a Grammy
11107000	11109000	from a video game
11109000	11111000	so Christopher Tin is going to be on next week's show
11111000	11113000	he'll be here live to take your questions
11113000	11115000	so
11115000	11117000	make sure you're here next week
11117000	11119000	live Sunday night May 11th 6 o'clock Pacific
11119000	11121000	9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network
11121000	11123000	live.vognetwork.com
11123000	11125000	Christopher Tin is promoting a new album
11125000	11127000	and we'll talk of course about his experiences
11127000	11129000	winning the Grammy and composing
11129000	11131000	for SIV and I definitely want to get into some of the
11131000	11133000	questions about how video games kind of continue
11133000	11135000	to influence him if they do and all
11135000	11137000	that so he will be here live and your questions
11137000	11139000	as well in the chat room live.vognetwork.com
11141000	11143000	alright that is going to do
11143000	11145000	it for tonight's episode, we're going to go around and get everybody's
11145000	11147000	final thought here first
11147000	11149000	Shane, thanks for filling in tonight
11149000	11151000	appreciate it, I'm sure
11151000	11153000	in the coming weeks we'll see more of you
11153000	11155000	especially now that you're back here in Northern California
11155000	11157000	but do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?
11157000	11159000	no
11159000	11161000	unless you guys can give me some stuff in
11161000	11163000	Pokemon
11163000	11165000	what Pokemon do you need, what ones are left?
11165000	11167000	I don't know, I have their Dex numbers written down somewhere
11167000	11169000	I am like 7 away from being done
11169000	11171000	wow, you made progress tonight
11171000	11173000	you're 17 at the start of the show
11173000	11175000	go you, I know, I'm awesome
11175000	11177000	alright, my final thought tonight
11177000	11179000	is they
11179000	11181000	need to fix that freeway faster
11181000	11183000	because I'm not looking forward to getting Alan from work
11183000	11185000	with all that stupid freeway mess
11185000	11187000	stupid highway 50
11187000	11189000	what freeway mess?
11189000	11191000	highway fix 50, that whole thing
11191000	11193000	haven't you heard about that?
11193000	11195000	I saw, I keep seeing the things for it
11195000	11197000	with your commute and everything, you never really go through downtown
11197000	11199000	I have to do this
11199000	11201000	I fucking hate downtown
11201000	11203000	I know, I know, I like downtown
11203000	11205000	but I don't like driving there
11205000	11207000	I like the shops and stuff downtown but I fucking hate driving
11207000	11209000	I hate driving to any major city
11209000	11211000	well, Sacramento is a pre-major city
11211000	11213000	but it's not like San Francisco
11213000	11215000	but I hate metropolitan areas
11215000	11217000	I hate driving and that kind of stuff
11217000	11219000	alright, Loki, your final thought tonight
11219000	11221000	my final thought is hopefully I have enough
11221000	11223000	caffeine or consciousness
11223000	11225000	in me to get some more
11225000	11227000	coding done this weekend
11227000	11229000	hopefully I'm going to work a little bit more on
11229000	11231000	asset stuff so that the next video I do
11231000	11233000	will actually be interesting
11233000	11235000	and I have something to show
11235000	11237000	it was funny, the first video I recorded
11237000	11239000	the microphone from my webcam
11239000	11241000	was on, I'm like
11241000	11243000	why do I hear clicking?
11243000	11245000	oh, it's picking that up
11245000	11247000	and the second video, of course, I talk a little bit
11247000	11249000	but see, I talk really quietly
11249000	11251000	because I'm up at night
11251000	11253000	like at 11 o'clock at night
11253000	11255000	my wife's asleep, so I can't talk
11255000	11257000	loud because I didn't wake everybody up
11257000	11259000	be very quiet
11259000	11261000	alright, that does it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio
11261000	11263000	if you listen to the whole show
11263000	11265000	thank you very much for sticking with it tonight
11265000	11267000	we really appreciate it, you know
11267000	11269000	we don't ask for money for doing this show
11269000	11271000	I mean, we wouldn't necessarily turn it down either
11271000	11273000	but no, in all seriousness, all we ask
11273000	11275000	tell a friend or two about the show
11275000	11277000	help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio
11277000	11279000	and help grow our family, because like Loki said earlier
11279000	11281000	we've been doing this show for 12 years
11281000	11283000	and no one knows
11283000	11285000	so help us break that by
11285000	11287000	getting more people to listen to our show
11287000	11289000	we appreciate it, grow our family
11289000	11291000	thank you guys very much for supporting independent radio
11291000	11293000	and that's going to do it for this week
11293000	11295000	I should be back, Christopher Tin will be here
11295000	11297000	it's going to be a big show, so don't miss it
11297000	11299000	next week, we'll see you then, good night
11323000	11325000	but you know they were all still true
11329000	11331000	see you next week
11353000	11355000	thanks for watching!
