Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's a host, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, May 11th, 2014, we're joined by the Grammy Award winning Christopher Tin, composer of Baba Yetu on Civilization IV.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As if that wasn't enough, it's been a very busy week in gaming. From Tomodachi to Amplitude, we've got everyone's opinions on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live for this episode number 552 on May the 11th of 2014.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Happy Mother's Day to all you moms out there or motherly figures. Pets need moms too and so forth.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Step moms and god moms and all those moms. Happy Mother's Day to all you guys.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys live as we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My name is Rob Roberts here in studio with our co-hosts. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hi.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hi, how are you?

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm alright.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're alright?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We've been having some tech problems here in studio tonight. We're on take two of the show but these things happen.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hopefully your tablet will stay connected throughout the show this time.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm considering taking a narcotic.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A narcotic? Is that how you cope with the program?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Cause my hip still hurts.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How'd you hurt your hip if you don't mind me asking?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It was already sore and a little bit out of alignment and then I reached over to pick up something and ended up pulling, it's called iliotibial syndrome.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Meaning that it's the muscle band going from the very top of the hip down to the knee.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mine's on my right leg. It's not sciatica. Completely different thing.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Getting old sucks.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, it has nothing to do with getting old. It has something to do with having, no.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It had to do with my old car accident and since my hip already goes out of alignment, bending over with my hip out of alignment.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Just sorta, and so I was told not to drive for the three days.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you able to sit for long periods and play video games at least?

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Uh oh.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I still have to get up and move it around or else it's a little good stuff.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you able to play some DDR once in a while?

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But today is the first time in two weeks I've done squats.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, there you go.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And so that's fine. I'm back to doing yoga and squats. It just still hurts.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright. Well, hopefully you got to play some games. We'll check in with you on that a little bit later.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll play something.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But we also have, say hello in studio to Tech Master, Loki.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hi.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hi, Loki. How are you doing?

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Doing alright.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah? What's new with you?

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Um, not too much.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So how goes the coding of Project Loki or whatever you're calling your game that you're making?

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Um, okay. I kinda took a break from what I was doing because I have to make assets for things.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But, you know, I'll get into that later on.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But so I've been working on a, I don't know, editor if you will, I guess, to make my own 3D models.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wow.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And it's coming along good.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah? And that's like all you do now, right?

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's all I do in my free time, yeah.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Awesome, awesome.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You know, I tried to play Call of Duty, but people don't seem to line up as far as, you know, when they're online.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We have a scheduled time each week that we play and no one was there.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And they're like, well, I can't play until like 10. I'm like, well, I'm not waiting.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's my problem too is one of the games, and I'll get into this a little more when we get into our gaming weeks later.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But one game I've been playing is the Heroes of the Storm Technical Alpha that Blizzard has out there.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I have some friends that play it, but we can never seem to line up at the same time.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And a lot of that has to do with the fact that, you know, I have a lot of friends on the East Coast and I'm here on the West Coast.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And that screws things up more than you'd think.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So it can be tricky trying to schedule up that time to do things with friends.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So, all right.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We also have here in studio joining us, he's back, guys, after a few months break.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm back.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Welcome back.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, then where is your voice at the top of the show?

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm just kidding. I'm giving you a hard time.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
One of those things where you pack everything except for one thing.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because my mic is XLR, I have a converter to actually plug into my computer via USB.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And I'm pretty sure I put it in its case and then decided not to bring it with me because I didn't think I would need it for another audio obligation that I had as a part of this trip.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And I completely forgot about passphrase show roll.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's fine.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well...

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's fine.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Which is I had to dispel the rumors last week when he didn't do the intro.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It was like, was Jason sacked?

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's like, no, no, no.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sometimes the kid needs a break.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So he's been working hard on the YouTubes and all that other stuff.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Last week I was driving and I didn't wake up early enough to take care of it before I had to check out of the hotel.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And I wasn't going to pull over on the side of the road.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And...

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The signal on the radio...

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah, it wasn't going to happen.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Plus, I didn't have my converter.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, geez.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Sorry, guys, and all of your speakers and possibly eardrums.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, last week I was driving out to Portland initially.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Today, like I said, I went to do it and realized I didn't have a required piece of audio gear.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So...

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, that settles that one pretty quick.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hopefully I'll have a solution for weekends going forward, though.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, going to our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The now deaf chat room.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can join us at live.vognetwork.com.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, please, they're used to it by now.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, I know, they've heard Loki rant before, come on.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And we've got lots of Nintendo news tonight, so just you wait, y'all.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Just you wait.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
In all seriousness, going to our chat room, we do have people welcoming Jason to the show.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Bobby Black Wolf, our buddy, saying Jason destroyed the internet.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Which could be the possibility for some of the internet...

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I bring additional devices into the house.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
For some of the internet issues we've been having in the studio tonight.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can you believe that?

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The destroyer of tech.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
25 devices on our router, but it makes sense.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I mean, we have three nerds that live here now, and then you bring three more nerds in here on Sunday night.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not surprised at all when you consider laptops and some phones and all that.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
3DSs, and phones, and iPads, and multiple computers to a single person.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Exactly.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And gaming consoles.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We are a connected world, my friend.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ain't we ever.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh my gosh.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Alright, let's get into, before we get into our gaming weeks, and our interview with Christopher Tin, as you heard in the intro.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We do have Christopher Tin on the show tonight.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He'll be joining us live in about 15 minutes to talk about his new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea.

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
As well as classic songs of his, including the one I think y'all know as Gamers Baba Yetu, which he won the Grammy for, from Civilization IV.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Our chatroom also asking, how many Final Fantasy XIV clients were online?

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Just two. So I had to ask them both to take a little break.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Only two.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I feel bad.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Christopher Tin has one night off of work this week in celebration of Mother's Day.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And he can't play the game he wants to play because of his boyfriend's show, but it is what it is.

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Anyway, before we get to our interview with Christopher Tin, before we get to our gaming weeks, I want to get into tonight's kickoff topic.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm actually kind of glad the time we get to spend on this topic is limited.

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So I think this is a good reason that we bring this up first.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Jamie, if you wouldn't mind, let us know one of the big controversial things going on in the news this week.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, yeah, it's a pretty big one. And it involves Pokémon. No, it doesn't.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But it does involve the...

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That news was controversial too, actually. We'll get into that later.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But it does involve Nintendo.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Nintendo basically says that when Tomodachi Life comes out in the US, it is going to still not have same-sex relationships in them.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because, as they say, and they are recognizing that it's not the best step, but they're saying that because of the programming of the game,

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
that it's not something they can patch out before it ships, that they're going to leave it intact.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But for future versions of it that come out, that they're going to, as they say, strive to design gameplay experience from the ground up.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That is more inclusive.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So basically they know, we done fucked up, but we're going to fix it.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Which, good on them for making the statement they needed to make.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And again, I don't want to dwell too much on this, so thank you to Christopher Tin for limiting our time tonight on this topic.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But I do want to make clear that there was two distinct statements that came out.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And, you know, what you're talking about here is kind of where we're at now, where all is kind of calmed down a little bit because Nintendo has acknowledged,

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you know what, maybe this was not the best course of action for us and in the future we should consider this.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But what's going on is that the first time they put something out, it was really just tacky, like what they said.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And to back up even further, I think many of you that listen to this show are probably astute on what's going on because this has been everywhere.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This was one of those stories that had wheels that made it onto the local news in various places.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like, does Nintendo hate gay people? That's like, you know, that's what the media does when it blows these things, you know, sky high and so forth.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And what happened is that in Japan, Tomodachi Life is out and it's kind of like, it's like a life simulator type game.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Like, think The Sims meets Animal Crossing meets Mii Plaza.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There's kind of all those things kind of thrown in a blender, a very Japanese twist.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, in the game, you can, you know, have a baby and all this, but you will have to enter in a relationship with somebody of the opposite gender, you know, in order to start that family.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Which, you know, as far as Japan goes and Japanese culture and so forth, and again, a big key word here is perception.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Remember that word, folks, perception.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The perception in Japan and everything, it's, you know, it's just accepted as this is the way the game is and it doesn't cause a lot of social ruffling

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:13,000
until a bug is found in the game allowing folks to get into same-sex relationships by basically registering the same-sex partner as somebody of the opposite sex the game thinks they are or whatever.

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And so you get into a relationship and actually there was kind of a subculture in Japan.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Think like Japan's Tumblr blew up with these pictures and fans everywhere of like, look, I've got this same-sex couple in Tomodachi Life, isn't that rad and so forth, you know.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But then, because this bug also broke the game, Nintendo said, we gotta patch it out.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And I truly don't think Nintendo was trying to make a, oh, we gotta patch out the gay.

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, they had to patch out a mistake for something that truly wasn't intended.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You say that like it's also, you say the patch out the gay like the pray away the gay.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Kind of.

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But I think, I think what really happened is that, you know, it was just ignorance, people.

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's what it was.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When the game was created, it was kind of ignorant in a way to a lot of the people that wanted to play it.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Now, I made the mistake when this, when this story went big, I made the mistake of logging onto websites and reading the comments.

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Will people please remind me not to do that?

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hey, Rob, don't do that.

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't fucking help myself.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I always want to go on and see, gosh, I wonder what the commenters on Joystiq have to say about this.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Gosh, I wonder what the YouTube comments have to say on this.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And I know what I'm going to fucking get and I get so angry.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Just do what I do.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Stop giving a fuck.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's hard.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's, Dark Sakura, it's so hard.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Run out of fucks to give. Use them up.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's hard when on one hand you're really, really-

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I said fucks and you said it's hard.

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's really difficult when on one hand you're really, really rooting for Nintendo and then on the other hand you're like,

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
God damn it, stop making it worse for yourself.

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I've used this comparison a lot in my broadcast days,

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but one of my favorite television moments ever was on America's Next Top Model

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
when Tyra Banks started yelling at one of the contestants,

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Be quiet, Tiffany!

192
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Be quiet! We were rooting for you!

193
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We were all rooting for you!

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's how I felt about Nintendo this week.

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I just wanted to put my finger out and be like, be quiet, Nintendo!

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Be quiet!

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're not listening to what the people are really saying.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And they put out this comment about the whole, oh well it's just this whimsy,

199
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
we're not trying to make social commentary, it's a whimsical world.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I'm like, oh my God, be quiet, you're making it worse.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because now you're basically saying, in our whimsical, magical world,

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
we've made a place where gays don't exist.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Perception-

204
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Boy play girl!

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Perception is everything.

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The porn game.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And whether that's how they meant it or not,

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
that's how their statement came across,

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
is that, don't you want to buy this game where gays don't exist?

210
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And you may not want to make social commentary,

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
but you can't sit there and say,

212
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm Switzerland, I'm not making social commentary, I'm not being involved.

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You don't get to say that.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
By making a video game, which haven't we argued time and time again,

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
video games are art, right?

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Haven't we tried to convince Roger Ebert and other critics out there,

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
haven't we tried to convince video games are art?

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What is art supposed to do?

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Provoke.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Provoke what?

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Just provoke.

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Provoke.

223
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And one of those things it provokes?

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Emo.

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Social commentary.

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah.

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So you can't come out and say a video game does not get into social commentary,

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
because it did.

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And that's the problem, guys.

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm telling you, like, I know many of you are out there listening to Orange on the Star.

231
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Maybe we have some new listeners tonight, thanks to Christopher Tin being on,

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and just everything else going on.

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I just need to tell you something.

234
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
As a gay gamer, okay?

235
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And I've made no secret about that over the time.

236
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm not the type of guy that goes out there and is like,

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm gay, I'm gay, I'm gay, and I play video games.

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm not really that type of person.

239
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm not ashamed of who I am, absolutely.

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I put myself out there as, this is how I am, deal with it.

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is the way my creator made me, right?

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And so I am a video game fan who happens to be gay.

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And let me tell you what kind of goes through your mind when you see something like this,

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is that it's...

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Imagine if you're playing this game that's supposed to be fun.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Imagine you're a heterosexual male out there, because, you know, that's a big demographic,

247
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and you're playing this game that's just whimsical commentary.

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But that game forces you to enter into a relationship that maybe you don't want to get into.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And if you're trying to create a me that looks like yourself,

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and you're trying to play a character with good values because that's how you feel about yourself,

251
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and you're trying to create a character in a life simulation game that's a reflection on yourself,

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
but you hit a wall that you thought in many parts of society we've climbed over time and time again,

253
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and you can't actually accurately reflect yourself, it's very frustrating.

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And it's a huge setback, like emotionally.

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Like, I play video games to escape this shit.

256
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Now, some of you guys might bring up, well, in Mass Effect I can do this,

257
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and, you know, in these other games, you know, in Dragon Age there's that one character who, you know,

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
maybe I didn't want to romance the same gender, but I have to.

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There's a difference. Those games are storytelling.

260
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're not playing a reflection of yourself in a life simulator game or a reflection of a character you want to be.

261
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're playing somebody else's narrative.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There is a huge difference whether Nintendo wants to say there is or not.

263
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Anyway, sorry, I'm hogging the conversation, but obviously I had a lot to say on that.

264
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I do want to just say kudos to Nintendo. They realized the mistake.

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They came out and they said exactly what they needed to say the first time.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They came out and said it was an oversight not to do this in the game.

267
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We realize we made a mistake. In the future we'll try to do better.

268
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Thank you. That's all I wanted the first time.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's all I wanted was, like, you know, just acknowledge.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't put all this smoke and mirrors shit of it's a social whimsy world.

271
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Just come out and say we are too lazy to reprogram the game because that's essentially what it is.

272
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a port. They don't want to go back and recode the whole damn thing.

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I accept that.

274
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And I would believe that.

275
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I do.

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Too lazy to reprogram a game? Hmm, virtual console? Yeah.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah.

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It seems to have an accurate...

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Going to our chat room. I'm sure the chat room is lighting up over at live.vognetwork.com.

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I apologize because I wasn't reading as I was ranting there.

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So I'm kind of looking at some stuff now.

282
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Bochikawa in chat says,

283
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Regardless of this news and outcry of this, I would have really liked to see this bug not affect the game in drastic ways.

284
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because that community that would have been born of this would be quite an interesting force to add to our gaming culture.

285
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Might even be a subset of gamer, but we will never know.

286
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, it could be the sequel. We'll see what happens.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Eric RPG says,

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's a really tough topic for me to get into.

289
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And I am going to say I am not the most well educated when it comes to Japanese culture because I've never lived there.

290
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So I'm not going to try to make a statement on that.

291
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But I will just say from what I've gathered,

292
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Japan is not as progressed as we are at this point.

293
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But change is coming, folks.

294
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Because more and more people are beginning to know somebody who is gay.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And the more you know people that are gay, you start to realize they're really not different.

296
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Know what you know and know what you don't know.

297
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Kinda. Kinda, right?

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Anyhow, let's see.

299
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Going to our chatroom as well.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
ActDeft says,

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I truly believe Nintendo did have the best intentions at heart, but it was just ignorance that came into play.

302
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So let's use this to educate them a little bit.

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But when they came out and released that first statement, it was like, it was kinda just gross and ignorant and so on.

304
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Here's why I'm going to stick with Animal Crossing for my fun little cutesy sim.

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And the actual sims for the adult angle.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
For the maturity angle. How's that sound?

307
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Because I can have alien babies.

308
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What if Animal Crossing had forced you to get into a relationship with Ed?

309
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That the only way you could have a baby in that game is to make a baby with Ed. How would you feel?

310
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Well, that's what I feel about the only way to make a baby in Tomodachi Life is to get married.

311
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's the same thing to me.

312
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Interesting perspective.

313
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Marriage and having children have nothing to do with each other. I'm just saying this.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I've been married for almost nine years with my husband for almost 17 years.

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And yeah, maybe I wanted a baby for a little while, but it wasn't the sole basis of our marriage.

316
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know, I see those assholes, oh my wife won't give me a baby, I'm leaving her.

317
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Fuck you! You marry someone because you love them.

318
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And that's the whole point. If you have the game and you have the ability to get married,

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
it should be because you are playing a relationship in that game, not just to fucking breed.

320
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And sometimes difficulties come into play where mom or dad may not be able to have a child.

321
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Exactly.

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And so, you know, that's why I always get, like, I don't mean to get on a political tangent,

323
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm going to take this tangent train on a very quick trip, okay?

324
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's why I always get really, like, my feathers get really ruffled when I hear the arguments about,

325
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
it takes a man and a woman to raise a baby and that's a proper family is to have a man and a woman.

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What about that family where mom passed away during childbirth?

327
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,000
How offensive is a statement like that to that family where the dad is doing everything to raise that child appropriately?

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah.

329
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Think before you open your fucking mouth. Why don't you just say, I think gay people are gross?

330
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Because that's what I hear. Again, perception, folks.

331
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They've got the cooties.

332
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
When you make a comment like that, Loki, you and I lived together for what, two and a half years?

333
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Did you catch gay living with me?

334
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Did you catch it?

335
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No. But then again, you throw like a girl, so.

336
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So do you.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, what about this too? I mean, I'll just talk about my, you know, my mom left my dad when I was a baby

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
because at the time my dad was not a very stable individual.

339
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You know, she left because of domestic abuse.

340
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Would we have all rather than that my mom had stayed with my dad and have him not get any better,

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
beat on her, beat on me and have that kind of a broken childhood as opposed to her,

342
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
you know, raising me with my grandmother and having me raised.

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I was raised in a matriarchal house.

344
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You're not, you know, I'm just saying, you know, look at these people who have to make tough decisions like this.

345
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What about women or women who are raped and decide that, you know, because of moral reasons or whatever,

346
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
they're going to have that kid.

347
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Do you want them to hunt down their rapist and say, help me raise this baby?

348
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, I got to, we're getting, I mean, these, these are all very tough social questions.

349
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Obviously, you're asking some very uncomfortable questions.

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But I think what people have to realize is that, yeah, it might be just a video game,

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but when it's supposed to be a life reflection, there's, life is a little more complicated than that.

352
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's a lot more complicated. Yeah.

353
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So, and sometimes we play video games to escape life.

354
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But then when the game sets down all these rules that seem very arbitrary, it can be very difficult.

355
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's actually why I really like the whole approach of The Sims to it.

356
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Because you can, you can, you know, bang somebody, get knocked up and kick them out of the house if you want to.

357
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You know, you can raise the baby by yourself if you want to.

358
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I have had a character do it.

359
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You know, I, you can have, you know, same sex parents, opposite sex parents, and aliens and vampires.

360
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Basically, no one looks at you weird because no one gives a shit. It's not their business.

361
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I like that approach. Don't make it anything that's, oh, weird. Just make no one care.

362
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because really, no one should care. It's no one else's business.

363
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
All right. Well, we've got to move on because it is about half past six, and I've got to move into our interview tonight.

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You know, we've been talking a lot in this opening about how Civilization has changed.

365
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And, you know, there is another simulator out there, one of my favorites of all time, Civilization, that is, that has existed through, through five different games.

366
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And the third Civilization game, I'm going to be honest y'all, Civ III, not my favorite in the series.

367
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's still a good game. It's like, it's like ice cream. Even a bad flavor is still ice cream. It's still pretty good.

368
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's how I feel about Civ III. But then, you know, when I first played Civ IV for the first time, and I fired up that, you know, loading screen and saw that opening movie,

369
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:24,000
it was very much like, yes, this is a new, this is the rebirth of Civilization. This is a new game. This is going to be awesome.

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And so Civ IV, you know, a lot of that is credited to the soundtrack of the game.

371
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And one of the most influential songs in the game that had such an impact was a song called Baba Yetu.

372
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And we are going to be welcoming the composer of Baba Yetu to the show tonight, Christopher Tin.

373
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Before we give him a call, let's take a listen to a clip because it is an audio download.

374
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I can't play the entire song for you because you got to, you got to go to Christophertin.com and get this album for yourself.

375
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But we're going to play a clip here to set the mood of Baba Yetu from Civilization IV here on Orange Lounge Radio before we welcome Christopher Tin.

376
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And we're going to play the song called Baba Yetu.

377
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Baba Yetu

378
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Baba Yetu

379
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Baba Yetu

380
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Baba Yetu

381
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Baba Yetu

382
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Baba Yetu

383
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Baba Yetu

384
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I still get chills listening to that. I don't know about you guys, but that's like such a great song there.

385
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Again, that's a clip of Baba Yetu from Civilization IV.

386
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And we are going to get the composer of Baba Yetu on the line right now.

387
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We're going to do this live here. We're going to give Christopher a call and get him on the show to talk about Baba Yetu as well as his brand new album.

388
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Hi there, is this Christopher?

389
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes it is.

390
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Hey Christopher, how you doing? It's Rob from Orange Lounge Radio. You're on the air. How's it going?

391
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Hi Rob.

392
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Hi.

393
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Welcome.

394
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Hi.

395
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Welcome to the show. Congratulations. You just released your brand new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea this week, right?

396
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yes I did. This Thursday in fact.

397
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Wow, that's awesome. Now if people want to pick up a copy of The Drop That Contained the Sea, where's the best place to go to pick that up?

398
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Well the best place is my own website, ChristopherTin.com. You can also get it at iTunes and Amazon.

399
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But they take a big cut, so my website is definitely the best place to do it.

400
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So if you want to make sure that Christopher is actually the one getting your money, because he deserves it for this soundtrack, check out ChristopherTin.com.

401
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We see some folks in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw is asking, will you take questions from the chat room?

402
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Absolutely. If you have a question for Christopher Tin, head on over to our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.

403
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I've also got some questions from social media we will get to in just a little bit.

404
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But Christopher, if you don't mind, I want to take a step back, because we are a show primarily about video games and gaming culture.

405
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:51,000
So you have an awesome title by your name. You are the first person to win a Grammy for a song that was composed for a video game.

406
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
How does that feel when you hear that?

407
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's kind of cool. The history of video games is littered with all sorts of trivia, and it's kind of cool that I get to be a little footnote in that history.

408
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So it's cool. I really enjoy it.

409
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You might end up a Jeopardy question someday. That's pretty awesome.

410
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That would be hilarious if that happened. I would love that.

411
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Which would feel better? The Grammy or the Jeopardy question? No, don't answer that.

412
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I don't know. That's a tough one, you know? Yeah.

413
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Don't answer that. That was a dumb question. All right. Let's take a step back. Since we are a video game show, I want to talk about Civilization IV, obviously.

414
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm a huge fan of the Civ series, and I just talked about how Civ III, for me, was not the strongest Civ game.

415
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But Civ IV, that was such a rebirth for the series for me, and a huge part of that was the music.

416
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
When you fire up that game for the first time and you hear Baba Yetu and you see the full motion video of Civilization is being created,

417
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
it really sets the mood for this epic rebirth for Civilization.

418
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I know you've probably been asked this question a million times, but for the sake of our audience, how did you end up being asked to do Baba Yetu for Civ IV?

419
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's a pretty funny story, actually. The lead designer of Civilization IV is a guy named Soren Johnson, who happened to be my roommate back in college.

420
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I went to my five-year college reunion and I ran into Soren and I said,

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Soren, what are you up to? He said, I'm a video game designer now. I was like, oh yeah, that's cool.

422
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
He said, I'm working on a game. Actually, he said he just finished a game. It was Civilization III.

423
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I said, oh, fantastic. I love the Civ series. I grew up playing it. He said, that's great.

424
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Well, I'm working on Civ IV. Have you ever considered writing music for video games?

425
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I hadn't at the time, but obviously it was a thrilling idea for me because, like I said, I grew up playing Civilization.

426
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Like many other people, I logged hundreds of hours playing that game.

427
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
A few months later, I got a call from him saying, hey, Chris, we took some of the music that you produced in college and we stuck it on the game and we really like it.

428
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:10,000
We were wondering if we could hire you to write a new piece of music that had an African influence as well as an orchestral influence with lots of big taiko drums.

429
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I said, yeah, I'd love to do it. That was kind of my version of the breaking into the business story.

430
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Just a pure chance encounter with my old college roommate, which led to pretty much the biggest break of my life.

431
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It seems so crazy that they talk about sometimes, and I was just having a conversation with a colleague before the show tonight,

432
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
that a lot of the gaming industry sometimes is about who you know.

433
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's so interesting that, yeah, it was this chance encounter or whatever, but it worked out so perfectly.

434
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You can't imagine Civ IV without that soundtrack now.

435
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Yeah, it's kind of weird, isn't it? You think about it.

436
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
This was like 10 years ago that I ran into him at our reunion, maybe 11 years, something like that.

437
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It's almost one of these things where it almost never happened for me.

438
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
My life would be very different now if I hadn't run into Soren.

439
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
It's a cool thing, I gotta say.

440
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Well, congratulations. Your music is incredible, and you're very deserving of the success, so congratulations to you.

441
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Thanks, Rob. I appreciate that.

442
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
No worries. Baba Yetu, it's had a lasting presence.

443
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Here we are still talking about, they're on Civ V and talking about Civ V and a half now with the After Earth and all this or whatever they're making this year.

444
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Yet, here we are talking about Baba Yetu. This song's had such a lasting presence.

445
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
How did it feel to win a Grammy for a song that you'd written years ago?

446
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It was a great feeling. It was kind of surreal, and it actually didn't sink in for about a year until the following year when I went to the Grammys as a spectator.

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I knew some people at that time who were nominated for Grammys, and one by one I saw them all not win.

448
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
At that point, I was just like, oh my god, I can't believe I managed to get through. I can't believe it happened for me.

449
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That's when it really sank in. It was kind of a surreal experience when I actually got it, though.

450
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Baba Yetu is really a staple of the Video Games Live Tour. I'm sure you're probably familiar with the Video Games Live Tour that Tommy Tallarico puts on, and he's still touring the world with this.

451
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I was actually just telling a story to Bobby on the show prior to us tonight that when I went and saw Video Games Live, I remember them playing Baba Yetu.

452
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:40,000
That was one of the memorable pieces in the show for me. Have you seen or participated in Video Games Live, and how do you feel about your song being such a staple of the tour?

453
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I love it. I'm very heavily involved in the show. I conducted it from time to time. I conducted the Canada Tour last year.

454
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We went coast to coast in Canada and did the show for a number of different audiences.

455
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm going to be conducting Baba Yetu again this June at the LA E3 Video Games Live Show.

456
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I love it. They were the ones who premiered the song live. They performed it at the Hollywood Bowl back in, I think, 2006.

457
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I got to give credit to Tommy and Jack Wall as well, who is conducting it. They really brought that song out of purely the video game world and into this new world that I'm connected to, which is the classical world.

458
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Because of Video Games Live, the sheet music got published by Alfred Publishing, which is a large sheet music publisher.

459
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Alfred issued it, and it became a hit amongst high school choirs. Suddenly, thousands of choirs around the world were singing this song, just for their spring concerts and whatever.

460
00:32:48,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It introduced my music to a brand new audience. I like to think that this was a big step in me. I think it's kind of difficult for video game composers to hop over to the mainstream.

461
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think this was my particular way of doing so. It was purely through the fact that my music got performed so much, and the sheet music, that I found an audience outside of video games.

462
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Wow, that's amazing. Do you still plan to work with video games composed for future video games? Now you're on this different path where you're able to express the world music on your own through these albums. Do you see yourself working with video games again in the future?

463
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I actually have a new song coming out in a game that I can't tell you the game, but I can tell you that it'll be announced in a few days, actually. But if people like Baba Yetu, it's similar in terms of the style of it.

464
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:02,000
The game itself that it's coming out in, let's just say it's in that same world. There'll be an announcement pretty soon, within the next week, I think.

465
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, I have a guess what that might be, but we'll see. That'd be awesome. I'm hoping it's true. I'm sure whatever it is will be awesome. Let's continue to talk about the future. I know that you have a new album that's out there, so I definitely want to let you talk about that new album.

466
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So what do your fans have to look forward to from your new release, The Drop That Contained the Sea?

467
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Well, it's a lot more epic, world-influenced, orchestral, choral music, I guess is the way to describe it. If people like Baba Yetu, then there's a lot of tracks on there that I think blow Baba Yetu away, but we'll see what other people think.

468
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But I'm really proud of it, actually. I think it's been my way of maturing over the last couple of years as a composer. I think the level of writing is a lot deeper. My level of expression is a lot more personal and a lot more grandiose, I think.

469
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I feel really good about it on a purely artistic level. So far, the response that I've gotten from people has been very positive as well. People have been saying that it's like the evolution of my writing. A lot of people have said it surpasses my previous album, so I feel really good about it, I gotta say.

470
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That's a great point, because when you talk about that this is where you're at now and things have evolved and so forth, I think everybody always asks me, how can I go listen to Orange Lawn's radio episode 1? I don't know if you know, we're on episode 552 now, so we've been doing this a very long time.

471
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And I'm kind of like, don't worry about episode 1, guys, it's not even as good as what we're doing now.

472
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, totally. You always want to push yourself as an artist and you always want to evolve, right? And what's a little difficult sometimes is some people, especially if you're an artist that releases an album once every five years or something, they're kind of locked into a time capsule in terms of who you were five years ago and what you were writing then.

473
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But you always do want to push yourself as a writer because you want to grow, right? And if people just want to listen to the stuff I was writing five years ago, there's already an album for that, but I do sort of want to bring people along for a ride and of course I hope to reward their participation on this journey by delivering a good product and I hope that I've done that.

474
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I think you have. I think when people listen to The Drop That Contained the Sea, they will not be disappointed. We're going to play a track from that in a little bit at the end of the interview so people can get a little taste of that. But if you want to hear more of it, check out The Drop That Contained the Sea at ChristopherTinn.com.

475
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Christopher, our chat room is lighting up with questions. In fact, I'm not even going to be able to get to all these. I feel awful. But I do want to ask you some of these questions that are coming from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

476
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm going to go with this one from Dark Tetsuya who asks, is there a particular genre of game you've always wanted to compose music for?

477
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Hmm, interesting. A particular genre. I think it's a role-playing game of some sort. I think that would be great. Or an MMO actually. You know what, I love the idea of working on an MMO. Something where people give me kind of a world to populate with my ideas, so to speak.

478
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, something like that. I'm not so drawn to things like first-person shooters. Whatever gives me the opportunity to write good music. But honestly, I just love working on games anyway. Whatever people ask me to do, I'm probably thrilled to do it.

479
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Well, I was going to say, if Blizzard is out there listening, Christopher is waiting for your call. So just know that.

480
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, I know all those Blizzard guys. And one of these days, maybe I'll come begging at their doorstep or something.

481
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I don't think they'd mind.

482
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
No, I love them. They're a really talented bunch of guys. I have a lot of respect for them.

483
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Let me do a question from Dungeonbuster, who saw your AMA recently on Reddit. Dungeonbuster asks, can he share what about Katamari Damacy's sound makes it amazing to him? I love the soundtrack too, but I'm curious to know what excites him about it.

484
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah, I gotta admit, Christopher, when I hear your music, I don't necessarily see Katamari Damacy influence. What's that about?

485
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
But it's so good. I don't know, I can't explain it, but I just love the energy and the zaniness of it.

486
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:33,000
We're not just talking about the main theme, which is fantastic, of course, but in my mind, the entire soundtrack to all the Katamari games is genius.

487
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I second that.

488
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:47,000
There's a wide diversity of styles in there. I mean, some great vocal performances, some great tracks being produced by a number of different DJs and producers and so forth. I think it's just really, really cool.

489
00:38:47,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And I think it takes a special, really quirky game like Katamari to pull off a soundtrack like that. You're never going to hear that in any other game. And I don't know, I think it's just fantastic writing.

490
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I kind of miss that series myself.

491
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I have to say, though, it combines anything from old swing to jazz to the whole crooner style. My two favorite tracks are completely, stylistically different from each other. The Moon and the Prince and then Que Sera Sera.

492
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Totally, right? I mean, it's all over the place. And I think that's why it's so fun, too, because it's like this giant amalgamation. It's like a Katamari in musical form.

493
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
It is. It really is.

494
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's like a giant amalgamation of random songs thrown together. And I just think it's fantastic.

495
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Let's go to another question from our chat room from Gamer Girl, who asks, is there an influence outside of video games that you get your inspiration for the music you compose?

496
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
There's got to be plenty, right?

497
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh, there's a lot. I mean, I'll tell you what inspired me to write the latest album is I got really turned on to the band Florence and the Machine a couple of years ago.

498
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Oh, yes.

499
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I totally dig her. And I, you know, this album was kind of inspired by that feeling that I got when I first listened to her debut album Lungs.

500
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I mean, I was just, I just loved the rocket-ness of it. And I loved the lyrics and I loved her vocal performance and sort of the gospel influence.

501
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:28,000
She was, I mean, that album, you know, really, you know, there's absolutely no direct influence on any of the songs. I mean, they're so stylistically different.

502
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But the energy that I got from her really made me want to create an album like my latest one.

503
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And then, you know, there's all the other sort of influences that I have from being a classically trained composer and playing jazz and, you know, doing all these other different things growing up and listening to world music and performing in world music groups.

504
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
But honestly, the influence comes from all over the place.

505
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,000
That's amazing to hear because Florence is one of my favorites. I got to say Shake It Out is probably one of my 10 favorite songs ever written.

506
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Oh, I know, right? Oh, my God, yeah.

507
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
She wrote it in like 15 minutes, apparently. She's like, like, she just literally-

508
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I have one that I like better, though, and that's My Boy Builds Coffins.

509
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That one I can just sing.

511
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Yeah, so good.

512
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But she's very diverse in her styles, too, if you really think about it. And I know on your albums, you have all these songs in different languages and it's very diverse as well.

513
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I just, it's, I would have never made that connection to Florence. That's so funny.

514
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah, I mean, it's purely on a fan level that I'm connected to her. I mean, there's no sort of like, it's not like our music is related in any sort of level, but I just, I'm just a huge fan.

515
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I understand the feeling very well.

516
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
If I may, actually, one tiny question for me.

517
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Of course.

518
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I did happen to notice it sounded like you had a little bit of a minimalist influence as well, like Philip Glass.

519
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Hmm, actually, I was a big John Adams fan all through college, actually. That's well spotted. I'm not sure where you spotted that, but you know, that's woven into my DNA musically. So I mean, it's all this sort of stuff surfaces at one point or another, so good catch.

520
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I just sort of got the feeling across the board, you know, it's like, you know, how there's just that, it'll start with one thing and then build and build and build, but it's so subtle that you don't notice it until one point.

521
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Well, what were we talking about a minute ago? Art always provokes response, and it's always interesting how that response comes in all these different ways.

522
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I actually, when I'm a designer, as my hobby now, I do it only for volunteer work now, but when I listen to you, actually, when I draw, I listen to Philip Glass.

523
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And depending on the style of what I'm doing, depends the style of music I'm going to listen to. It's like, I will fully throw on, you know, Ella Fitzgerald if I'm doing, you know, 30s and 40s style, so.

524
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:56,000
All right, well, I just, I don't want to take up too much of Christopher's time. I just have a couple more questions from our chatters and our listeners. One more question from chat here, Christopher, from Tiger Claw, who asks, have you ever thought of composing, speaking of diversity, have you ever thought of composing for feature films or TV?

525
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, you know, I've never really given TV much of a thought until recent years, and I think that's because, like, I think TV's gotten really good recently, and, you know, I've started to become more of a fan of TV.

526
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Films, my original intent was to write for movies, but along the way, I sort of got sidetracked by commercials, games, and, you know, this career that I have now. I would love to write for films. I think collaborative work is a lot of fun, and films are a great medium to work in.

527
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:35,000
So, I mean, I have done a number of films, and I'd certainly like to do more. So, I mean, I'm just, you know, I'm keeping all my options open at this point.

528
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:44,000
All right, I'm going to go to one more question. This one's actually from Facebook, and I know this guy is a huge fan of yours, so he'd be so devastated if I didn't ask his question, and I'm going to.

529
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:53,000
So, Awesome Unicorn is on our Facebook and asked you this question earlier this week, who said, I'd like to hear about the process of selecting vocalists for the songs.

530
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Some of your work seems very tailored to a specific type of performance or singing style, and then others seem like a wider range of vocalists would be able to perform the songs.

531
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Do you tend to write songs with specific performers in mind to sing them, or do the songs come first and the quest for the vocalists later?

532
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Well, hello, Awesome Unicorn, first of all. Yes, I do actually write specifically with vocalists in mind.

533
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I mean, usually what will happen is I'll listen to a bunch of records, and I'll identify who I want to work with, and then I'll just track them down on the internet and write to them.

534
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:43,000
If they're game, I will write with them in mind. With a lot of the singers I've reached out to, they've totally been game, and so the songs were pretty much tailored to them.

535
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I think there's a real advance to doing that. First of all, if you have a specific singer in mind, you can write to their strengths.

536
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:03,000
When you write to their strengths, they'll perform the hell out of it. When they perform the hell out of it, you get an immensely dramatic and gratifying performance.

537
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:10,000
You maybe won't always get that when you write something in the abstract and have someone else come in and sing it later.

538
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:20,000
There are times when I've done that as well, and it works some of the times, but generally speaking, I prefer to have someone in mind when I'm writing for them.

539
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
When I'm writing a song, I prefer to have a particular voice in mind. Let me put it that way.

540
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Good to know. I'm glad we could resolve Awesome Unicorn's inquiry there.

541
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Before we let Christopher go and get to the other song preview, Jamie, you mentioned you had one other quick question you wanted to sneak in.

542
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
What is your favorite non-standard time signature?

543
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Probably, I don't know, maybe 7-8 or 5-8, something like that. I'm going to start exploring more and more complex ones as I get further and further into Bulgarian music and Bulgarian rhythms, which are very complicated.

544
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
7-8, 9-8, 11-8, 13-8, things like that. I'm just going to start exploring a little more.

545
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But I think there's plenty of great music that can be written in 4-4, I gotta say.

546
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I agree with that. I just keep thinking about the first time I ever, I was a band nerd, the first time I ever played Mars Bringer of War, and learning how to do 5-8, and I was like, I want more of this.

547
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Yeah, right? Totally. There's a little bit of a Mars Bringer of War influence on one of the songs on my new album, too, actually.

548
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Ooh, I'm excited, because that's like my favorite in the planets.

549
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh my god, yeah, it's fantastic. Actually, the ninth track of my album, it's called Has Gengor Fridum, which is a sort of setting of an Old Norse Viking text.

550
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I mean, that's one, there's a piece where, you know, there's a little bit of Mars Bringer of War, there's a little bit of Carmina Burana, there's a little bit of Nobuo Amatus, Liberi Fatali, you know, there's all these influences.

551
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:08,000
And, you know, I'm speaking to a gamer crowd here, but, and this is why I feel comfortable saying this, like, there's a lot of game soundtracks out there which have this sort of bombastic, you know, Gustav Holst, Mars Bringer of War sound to them, you know, these gothic choirs and things like that.

552
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And I've never really had the opportunity to write for a game like that. And I sort of resisted writing a piece like that, sort of for my own projects.

553
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:33,000
So after I conducted Video Games Live, and after I conducted Liberi Fatali a number of times, I was just like, I want to write a piece like this, I, you know, screw it, I just want to do this, you know, I don't care, you know, if it's been done 1000 times, I'm gonna write my own version of this type of gothic bombastic thing.

554
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:44,000
And so, you know, I channel Stravinsky and Karl Orff and you know, all these other guys and, and, you know, crank up this big old Viking tune, which I was a lot of fun to do, you know,

555
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Well, I'm sitting here excited now.

556
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Well, only Dark Sakura would go there and take it to a whole nother music nerd level. But the chat room is eating it up. Just so you know, Christopher, chat room is Bobby Black Wolf saying 7-8 is my favorite too.

557
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And kind of causing to a music nerd high five and they're they're they're music nerding out there. So that's

558
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
High five guys, high five.

559
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
My first major in college was a music major. So

560
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Fantastic.

561
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I was a band nerd and I was a clarinet player in high school myself.

562
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Oh, fantastic. I was a trumpet player.

563
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
I was sax and contra alto clarinet just to be different.

564
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
All right.

565
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Wow.

566
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Music nerds and band nerds and video game nerds everywhere have a reason to check out Christopher Tin.

567
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
You can check check him out on his website, Christophertin.com.

568
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And you can check out the new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea, which I'm sure many of you haven't heard yet because it just came out this week.

569
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
So no excuses. Go check that out at Christophertin.com.

570
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Christopher, as we say goodbye to you, we're going to check out one of these songs from the new album.

571
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,000
This is track four. And I apologize if I horribly butchered the name, but it's Eza

572
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Nomso, I believe.

573
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It's Eza Nomso, which means come tomorrow.

574
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And this is also performed by the Soweto Gospel Choir who performed Baba Yetu and a little bit of trivia about this song.

575
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I wrote this at the last minute. I was on a plane to Johannesburg.

576
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And it's a long story, but I was being flown around for this commercial project I was doing for Emirates Airlines and they're flying me all around the world business class.

577
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So I had a very cushy seat and I was on my way to Johannesburg and I thought I need to write another song for these guys to sing.

578
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,000
And so I wrote this song and it's about clouds, which is kind of a fitting thing to write about when you're flying.

579
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So it's got a sort of a brisk sort of breezy feel like you're sort of flying through the clouds.

580
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And the lyrics are about, you know, the lyrics translate to things like, like a bird, I fly, I sing, like a bird, I'm holding on to the wind.

581
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Very sort of poetic stuff about, you know, clouds and flying through the air.

582
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Well, we're going to check this out right after I say goodbye.

583
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Christopher, thank you so much for taking the time out today with us.

584
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I know today is a big day for a lot of people with Mother's Day and everything.

585
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
So thank you for spending time with us and best of luck with the new album.

586
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And I really encourage people everywhere to check it out on your website.

587
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Thanks, guys. It was a lot of fun.

588
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And I look forward to the surprise announcement this week.

589
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah, yeah. Keep an eye out.

590
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
All right. Take care, Christopher. It was a real honor.

591
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Likewise.

592
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
All right. Bye bye.

593
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Bye.

594
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
That was Christopher Tin, everybody. And you can check out his new album, The Drop That Contained the Sea, at ChristopherTin.com.

And in the meantime, here is a clip.

596
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Again, I can't play the whole thing for you guys, but I think it's on his website if you want to check it out over at ChristopherTin.com.

597
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
This is a clip of track four from the album, Iza Nomso.

598
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I think I said that right. Come tomorrow is what it means.

599
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Nyomso.

600
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Nyomso. Here it is. Come tomorrow. I'll just say come tomorrow.

601

02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:33,000
oh,

1380
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:40,000
oh,

1381
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:46,000
oh,

1382
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:52,000
oh,

1383
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:58,000
oh,

1384
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:05,000
oh,

1385
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:11,000
oh,

1386
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:17,000
oh,

1387
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:23,000
oh,

1388
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:30,000
oh,

1389
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:36,000
oh,

1390
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:42,000
oh,

1391
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:48,000
oh,

1392
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:54,000
oh,

1393
02:11:54,000 --> 02:12:00,000
oh,

1394
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:06,000
oh,

1395
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:12,000
oh,

1396
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,000
oh,

1397
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:23,000
oh,

1398
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:29,000
oh,

1399
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:35,000
oh,

1400
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:41,000
oh,

1401
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1402
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
This is a real game, people, only in Japan.

1403
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Omega Quintet, coming to you September.

1404
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,000
It's Idol Master meets the beep.

1405
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Drop that beep.

1406
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
All right, lastly but not leastly,

1407
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
this made me exclaim a lot of excited things

1408
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
that had to get beeped, because I was excited to hear that Tetsuya Mizuguchi

1409
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
is back in game development.

1410
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
That's right.

1411
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
We thought he was taking a break

1412
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:12,000
or was going long-term or whatever to focus on the college stuff,

1413
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
but in the new issue of Edge,

1414
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
which is available in print form and so on,

1415
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
he talks about how he left Q Entertainment.

1416
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
He took up a role as a lecturer,

1417
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
but he is not giving up on video games.

1418
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
So he's right now, quote, helping with a few games,

1419
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
but they are not like his previous work,

1420
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
like Res or Space Channel 5.

1421
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,000
He says, I'm helping with some social games in Japan.

1422
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,000
I'm just helping.

1423
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
I want to start a new project on my own,

1424
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
maybe this year or next year.

1425
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Yes.

1426
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Very excited, because I'm a Mizuguchi fanboy.

1427
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
That you are.

1428
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
I am, very much.

1429
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,000
All right, Dark Sakura.

1430
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Well, there is a new comerage for the Left 4 Dead franchise,

1431
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
and it is an arcade game that's planned for Japan

1432
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,000
that basically it's going to,

1433
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I don't know if this is going to be something like

1434
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
the Gun Survivor series,

1435
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
if it's going to be one of those,

1436
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:11,000
but it looks like Taito is working with Valve

1437
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
to put this out,

1438
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
and it's been thought of,

1439
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
announced before as Project Z,

1440
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
but now it's Left 4 Dead.

1441
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Next up, Shaq Fu, a Legend Reborn.

1442
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,000
It got funded.

1443
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Next.

1444
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
What an interesting world we live in,

1445
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
where Amplitude probably won't get,

1446
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
on its current path anyway,

1447
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:32,000
won't get funded,

1448
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,000
yet Shaq Fu got funded.

1449
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Just let that sink in for a minute.

1450
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:38,000
But.

1451
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
And then have a drink.

1452
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
But.

1453
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
There is something good coming out of this.

1454
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Okay.

1455
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Five percent of all the profits will be donated

1456
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.

1457
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Okay.

1458
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Better than five percent going to Kickstarter,

1459
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
but that's a great thing to hear.

1460
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Last but not least, we have,

1461
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
you know how there's just two new tracks for Outrun?

1462
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Well, now there are going to be three

1463
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Outrun soundtracks coming out.

1464
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
You can get them for $9.49 for each soundtrack

1465
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
on Amazon or $9.99 on the iTunes store,

1466
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
or you can just get them individual

1467
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
in case you're like me

1468
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
and only care about Magical Sound Shower.

1469
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Fair enough.

1470
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And don't already have other Outrun soundtracks.

1471
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Alright, fair enough.

1472
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Alright, we're going to move on.

1473
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
There is no frugal question.

1474
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I was going to say, for the record,

1475
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
one of my horses in Derby Owners Club

1476
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
was called Magical Sound.

1477
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,000
I remember that.

1478
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
I think because there wasn't enough characters

1479
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,000
to be Magical Sound Shower.

1480
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
But you did have Beat Politary.

1481
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Just Politary.

1482
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
No, Politary, so that you could whip Politary.

1483
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Yes.

1484
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:41,000
And that Politary would cry.

1485
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Although it's kind of tasteless in retrospect,

1486
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
but I don't really wish harm upon this individual,

1487
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
but it was just a running gag with Bamani music

1488
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
because her songs were really bad.

1489
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I had one called Just a Horse

1490
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,000
that ended up being awesome.

1491
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Didn't you have one called Glue?

1492
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Yeah, I did have one called Glue,

1493
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
and Glue ended up being my best sire.

1494
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I remember I think I had one called Briton Spears.

1495
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Yeah.

1496
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
And then...

1497
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
I missed Derby Owners Club.

1498
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
That was the day.

1499
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I know it's still around, but it's not the same.

1500
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,000
I found my folder.

1501
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Did you really?

1502
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
It has my horses in it.

1503
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Anyway.

1504
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Alright, anyway.

1505
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
No frugal question of the week this week

1506
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
because I knew we would be running along

1507
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
because of the interview

1508
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
and I wanted everybody to ask our guest questions,

1509
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
but it'll return next week.

1510
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
So Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

1511
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
or Google.com slash plus Orange Launch Radio.

1512
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
There is a game Sega should bring

1513
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
to the Wii U.

1514
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
What?

1515
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Derby Owners Club.

1516
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Hey, now you're talking.

1517
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Because then you can whip the horses

1518
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:34,000
with the Wii remotes.

1519
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Yeah.

1520
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
And Sega's in bed with Nintendo now.

1521
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
And you'd use your little sub screen for training.

1522
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
This is a good idea.

1523
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Why isn't this happening?

1524
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
I don't understand.

1525
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
I don't understand.

1526
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Because licensing everything that goes into that game

1527
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
is actually kind of fucking expensive.

1528
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
That's why the cabinets are premium.

1529
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
That's true.

1530
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Aren't those like six digits for those cabinets?

1531
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I would not doubt it,

1532
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
especially for that main screen that always shows the running race.

1533
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Crazy.

1534
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
That alone is easily high fives.

1535
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
All right, let's move on to some other

1536
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Take the card with you.

1537
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
longer gaming news stories.

1538
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
We'll get into maybe a little bit more in depth.

1539
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Loki.

1540
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
All right.

1541
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
So once again we're talking about Nintendo here.

1542
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
They're planning to approach emerging markets,

1543
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
you know, like China and stuff,

1544
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
a little differently than they do the rest of the world,

1545
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:25,000
including that they are going to actually target those markets

1546
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
with different hardware or new hardware, I guess.

1547
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
They're basically saying, you know,

1548
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
we want to make new things,

1549
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,000
you know, thinking rather a cheaper version of what we currently have.

1550
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,000
The product and price balance must be made from scratch.

1551
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:44,000
So if you kind of take it like, you know,

1552
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
how they made the Wii mini, you know,

1553
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:50,000
doing something like that for maybe like the Wii U or something.

1554
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Or, you know, 2DS or something like that.

1555
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Where it's slightly cheaper than the stuff that's out there,

1556
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
you know, to help drive sales, I guess.

1557
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I don't know.

1558
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
I mean, I guess that's a good idea.

1559
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,000
I just, I can't imagine what they would strip out feature wise for like a Wii U.

1560
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,000
You know, the 3DS obviously, the 2DS works.

1561
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,000
NFC.

1562
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Yeah, I think with the handhelds it would be really easy to get.

1563
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
The gamepad might be tethered.

1564
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Yeah, it would be really easy to get a lower cost console for the handhelds.

1565
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
The other consoles, I mean, what about just a Wii?

1566
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Like, why the Wii U? Why not just a Wii?

1567
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Well, they have the Wii mini, so they could do that.

1568
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
This is for other markets that don't have video games

1569
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:37,000
as much as they do in Japan, USA, Europe as it is.

1570
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Well, as of recently, they haven't had any consoles because they were banned.

1571
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
It's an interesting change in strategy for Nintendo,

1572
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:50,000
especially considering a lot of the crap that we use getting here in the States and in Japan and so forth.

1573
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:55,000
It's an interesting way to try to turn things around by taking a proven success and launching it in other places.

1574
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I mean, it's not like China is a small country, you know.

1575
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Something like the Wii has the potential to do very well there, so it's a very interesting strategy.

1576
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Maybe a good way to cut the losses in the home department.

1577
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I don't like that term.

1578
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
What?

1579
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Proven success.

1580
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Well, what would you call the Wii in that regard?

1581
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,000
It is. Come on, Wii Sports. Best video game ever, sales-wise.

1582
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I've, you know, saved the argument that I've made at least three times on the show previously.

1583
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I call it a lightning bolt.

1584
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:28,000
It came, it landed, it's done.

1585
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Other markets, I don't know.

1586
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,000
I truly don't know how could I know the state of gaming in China.

1587
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I really don't want to make any claims to that, but it's one of those things like,

1588
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
it was truly media fervor.

1589
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:50,000
It wasn't technically, low barrier to entry, gaming, games, games from real life that we all know,

1590
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:54,000
and you can do, you can put to use with less investment.

1591
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:57,000
It was a lightning bolt.

1592
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:04,000
You are not guaranteed the success if you give it to somebody else with cultural differences.

1593
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Bowling isn't a worldwide thing.

1594
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Soccer, you probably know.

1595
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I don't know. I just, like that term has a place that we use, not it, in my opinion.

1596
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Alright, well, we will see what happens.

1597
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,000
I think we'll get more information of this at E3.

1598
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Maybe, maybe.

1599
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:26,000
In the meantime, as far as the Wii U is concerned, you know, I mentioned that one of the other markets,

1600
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:31,000
besides just the US, is Japan, and Japan, some information for what they're going to be getting Wii U-wise.

1601
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Bayonetta 2 and Hyrule Warriors set for summer debuts in Japan.

1602
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:41,000
This surprised me. I figured Hyrule Warriors was probably a summer, like, early fall game,

1603
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:47,000
but the fact that Bayonetta 2, it's fucking happening this year, OMG, and it might even be summer,

1604
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
especially in Japan, that's pretty exciting to hear.

1605
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:54,000
So, yeah, finally we'll get to see what this, you know, hype with Bayonetta 2 is all about,

1606
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
because the first game was pretty awesome.

1607
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Of course, Bayonetta 2 bringing a two-player mode into the game, analog and touch-based controls,

1608
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
and, of course, new hair for Bayonetta, very important.

1609
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Yeah, that's really exciting.

1610
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:18,000
The only other Wii U games confirmed for this year for the West, those games, Mario Kart 8, Smash Brothers,

1611
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
X by Monolith Soft, which I'm actually very curious about that one, that looks like it could be a winner as well,

1612
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,000
and whatever else they announce at E3.

1613
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:32,000
So I'm fully expecting at E3, we're going to get release dates for Bayonetta 2 and Hyrule Warriors here in the US.

1614
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:37,000
That's pretty exciting, so some things to get excited about on the Wii U.

1615
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Is it going to be enough to really push sales of that system?

1616
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:45,000
I don't know, I think another price cut would go a long way in helping that, but we shall see.

1617
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Meanwhile, Dark Soccer are going to talk about a game that should be on the Wii U, but probably won't.

1618
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:58,000
That isn't. Alas, Minecraft, specifically the PS4 and Xbox One versions,

1619
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,000
they are not going to have the infinite world size that the PC version does.

1620
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It will have borders. You will find the end of the world, and then you'll fall off of it.

1621
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Basically, they are constrained for size limits so that you can't...

1622
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I mean, they have bigger worlds than the PS3 and 360 versions,

1623
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:24,000
but they still are limited because there's only so much memory, only so much space.

1624
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Not infinite.

1625
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:33,000
People make a big deal about the PC worlds being infinite and so forth, but it's really infinite in theory.

1626
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
You get the equivalent of a kill screen, where the data starts...

1627
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Yeah, at some point you're going to run out of server space.

1628
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:49,000
It's going to be forever. You would be challenged to ever be able to run from one end of the world to the end.

1629
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Well, people do actually make that look up. I think it's called the Endlands.

1630
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
It's a thing in Minecraft where people basically go until the game starts having corrupted data,

1631
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:03,000
and the calculations won't apply anymore because they've already used up what they can.

1632
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Wow. Has anybody found that on the VoG server yet?

1633
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Everybody stays in one little area on the VoG server.

1634
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Everybody stays in one area, and also...

1635
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I tried to go out a ways when I built my house, and to come to find out, it really wasn't that far.

1636
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
That's why you fly.

1637
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
The other thing, too, is I occasionally...

1638
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
Well, I don't anymore, because I haven't really messed with the server in a while,

1639
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:30,000
but I'd occasionally cut all the area that's around...

1640
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Because I did that so that new terrain would generate, because when we upgraded,

1641
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:39,000
there's new biomes and stuff that weren't generating, so I did that.

1642
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
And so I clamped it all down to where we were just at.

1643
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:50,000
So if some idiot goes straight for a long ways away, I'm just going to probably...

1644
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Unless there's some interesting stuff over there, I'm probably just going to erase that terrain and...

1645
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Clip it out, yeah.

1646
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Yeah.

1647
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Okay, fair enough.

1648
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
It's really boring, though. There's not a lot of terrain that's interesting over there.

1649
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
There's a lot of great stuff on the VoG server, though.

1650
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I know we haven't talked about it in a while, but there have been people working hard on there

1651
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
to connect everything with trains everywhere.

1652
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Seattle said it best, the Farlands. That was it.

1653
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Well, yeah, the problem right now is when they upgraded Bucket,

1654
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:19,000
it's because they've added all this new stuff now,

1655
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
because they're giving you the ability where you're going to be able to change your username,

1656
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,000
and so they're tied into IDs now, and so all the systems that are based off usernames are all broken,

1657
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:31,000
and so it's just a big ol' mess. The whole infrastructure is kind of being rewritten,

1658
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:34,000
so a lot of those plugins aren't available.

1659
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
And I've spent all my time programming, so I haven't really messed with...

1660
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Because honestly, I looked at the server logs and there's nobody on there, so whatever.

1661
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:45,000
How do you guys feel about the limited space on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?

1662
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I kind of feel that even though it's limited, it's going to be very hard to push the boundaries of it.

1663
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:53,000
It's going to be a lot of space to work with. I don't think it's a big deal.

1664
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Well, they're saying it was because of save file limitations, so how big of a save file are we talking?

1665
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Because save files aren't normally that big, at least on consoles.

1666
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I would imagine, even with a couple megs, which some games have 30-meg save files.

1667
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I mean, they're huge, some of them.

1668
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I'm surprised you couldn't just make an exception. I mean, come on, it's Minecraft.

1669
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,000
They're like, nope, nope, nope, sorry, we have this rule in place here that we can't do this.

1670
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
We're not flexible at all.

1671
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
It might have something to do with the RAM or something. I don't know.

1672
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
But I'm pretty sure those save files are going to be able to be pretty big.

1673
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:29,000
You know, I was just thinking. Remember when 30 megs were hard drive limits?

1674
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Yes, right?

1675
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
When we moved out here, we had a 60-meg hard drive.

1676
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Yeah. My first PC had a 40-megabyte hard drive. Like, that couldn't even fit an episode of this show.

1677
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:46,000
The day the gigabyte was standard, I was like, ahhh.

1678
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Exactly.

1679
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:51,000
My first computer had a 0-megabyte hard drive.

1680
02:25:51,000 --> 02:26:00,000
My first computer, mine, it actually was in my bedroom. It had no hard drive and two 5.25-inch flash drives.

1681
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Yeah, I remember when those 5.25-inch disks could hold, what, 720 kilobytes?

1682
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
And when you measured your hard drive by height?

1683
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Yeah.

1684
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I used to use a full-height hard drive as a paperweight.

1685
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
We're reminiscing again. Let's go do more news.

1686
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Because we're old.

1687
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I know. Low-key.

1688
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:25,000
Alright. So, this is kind of, I don't know.

1689
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Everyone's been kind of wondering since they announced Unreal Engine 4.

1690
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Hey, so when do we get in the next Unreal Tournament game?

1691
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Because it's been like, what, six years since Unreal Tournament came out?

1692
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Maybe even more than that.

1693
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:46,000
So, now Epic is going to put out an Unreal Tournament game, but they're kind of going a different route with it.

1694
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
They're actually making it open source.

1695
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
And so, they're going to be creating the game.

1696
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:56,000
It's going to be on, I want to say it was going to be on GitHub or something like that.

1697
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Oh, that was fun.

1698
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Well, maybe not GitHub. I don't know.

1699
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Oh, it is on GitHub.

1700
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:10,000
But it's going to be available to the people that actually pay for the Unreal Engine.

1701
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I don't know if I trust those crazy people at GitHub anyway.

1702
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1703
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:28,000
And apparently, there's going to be discussion with people that work at Epic developing the game and fans of the game.

1704
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:33,000
And you're actually going to be kind of helping mold how the game is.

1705
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And they're going to have Twitch streams showing stuff like that.

1706
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Also, like I said, all the code that's created during the development of the game will be available on GitHub if you're an Unreal Engine 4 developer.

1707
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:50,000
So, you need to pay that $19.99 a month or whatever it is.

1708
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:54,000
So, that's kind of neat.

1709
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:59,000
And when the game does come out, it will be free to play.

1710
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Interesting.

1711
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I'm sorry. Yeah. And not free to play as in you buy stuff. It's free.

1712
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Which is a shocking...

1713
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I really don't want to do Unreal a disservice because they have been a mainstay for so many important things for as long as they have.

1714
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
And so, I really...

1715
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Very specific, the point that I'm trying to make.

1716
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,000
I've always considered Unreal to be kind of second.

1717
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
More engine, less game.

1718
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Exactly as Loki just finished saying.

1719
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Unreal Tournament, not so prolific.

1720
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
But the games that have been built on Unreal Engine, far and wide.

1721
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Phenomenal. That's where their strength is and they make a good game on top of it.

1722
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:48,000
The fact that they're going in the same direction that Valve has with Steam.

1723
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Steamworks and mods for their game aren't new.

1724
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:59,000
But items and all of these other community-driven things that generate interest, revenue for everybody.

1725
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:05,000
It's the right choice for them. It's the way the gaming has gone.

1726
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:12,000
It enables them to do new things and open up Unreal to plenty more players that may not have been able to play it in the past.

1727
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Not condescendingly, welcome to this generation.

1728
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:22,000
It seems like they did it right. They're here. Everything that they've done has been interesting.

1729
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:28,000
The pool of available, capable games has only gotten bigger and it's exciting.

1730
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Some comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1731
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Dark Tetsuya says, not gonna lie, super stoked for the new, free Unreal Tournament.

1732
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Tiger Claw says, Unreal Tournament had a huge mod community behind it.

1733
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:44,000
It's where you can download lots of custom maps, skins, and all sorts of mods for it.

1734
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:49,000
SHG100Matt says, I still have Unreal Tournament 2004.

1735
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Still my favorite Unreal Tournament game and I still play it occasionally.

1736
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Live.vognetwork.com. Those comments.

1737
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Yeah, they recreated the whole end of Hypercube in Gary's mod.

1738
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Yeah, you mentioned that. Crazy. Mod communities are something else.

1739
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
But I mean that in the nicest way.

1740
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Anyhow, let's move on. One community that's on hold for a little bit.

1741
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Need for Speed. After 13 years of a new Need for Speed every year.

1742
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Really? I didn't realize that. My god.

1743
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Well, they took a year off this year.

1744
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:29,000
It will be back in 2015 and this news was broken during an EA conference call about earnings.

1745
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Ghost Games in Gothenburg is working on an innovative new chapter of the Storied franchise.

1746
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:40,000
We've planned an extended development window to ensure we're delivering a high quality experience for Need for Speed players next year.

1747
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
That quote from CEO Andrew Wilson.

1748
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:48,000
So, no other reasons outside of that, but you know what? That's alright.

1749
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Take the time to get it right, folks. There's nothing wrong with that.

1750
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:54,000
And I look forward to playing this new Need for Speed game.

1751
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:59,000
So, alright. Let us take a moment to go to our email bag.

1752
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
You know, every week you guys email us.

1753
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

1754
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Yeah, boy.

1755
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Oops. Not that one. Sorry about that.

1756
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:14,000
This is the song that we use for the emails every week when you guys email us.

1757
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Dark Soccer's gonna dive into the mailbag head first and find some emails worthy of reading on tonight's program.

1758
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
All one of them.

1759
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Just one?

1760
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Yeah.

1761
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Hey OrangeLounge PokeMasters.

1762
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Let's create our own Pokemon on this week's show.

1763
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
With exclamation points.

1764
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
What would your custom Pokemon look like?

1765
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,000
What are his or her powers?

1766
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Example, fire, ice, electricity, etc.

1767
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Don't forget to name it.

1768
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:40,000
Great show as always.

1769
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Keep gaming dudes and dudette.

1770
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
EA skeezy.

1771
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I would have a dark type that would be female and based kind of off of a fox.

1772
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Kind of.

1773
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Named Bob.

1774
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I don't even know where to go with this question.

1775
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I would want a kitty named Sanrio.

1776
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Like my kitty.

1777
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Well, Alan's kitty, but mine by association.

1778
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Do you have a Pokemon you would have, Jason?

1779
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:12,000
I don't have the imagination for this anymore.

1780
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:18,000
It's really strange to say, but like I said earlier, I've owned maybe three of them.

1781
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
And I really appreciate the universe.

1782
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
It's interesting, it's beautiful, and I love what they continue to do.

1783
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:26,000
But Jason would like a brain for his Pokemon.

1784
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
That's it.

1785
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Jason's Pokemon is going to be Mother Brain.

1786
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
I don't have the courage.

1787
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I need a heart.

1788
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I want to go home.

1789
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Jason's is going to be Mother Brain.

1790
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Well that makes that battle very interesting.

1791
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
That was a great Facebook meme I saw, by the way.

1792
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Happy Mother's Day with Mother Brain.

1793
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Did you see the Cubone one?

1794
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I forgot what side it was, but someone said,

1795
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:52,000
Cubone's having the worst Mother's Day ever.

1796
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Because Cubone wears his mother's skull.

1797
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Awful.

1798
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
I think it was Geekology or something.

1799
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Loki, do you have a Pokemon in mind?

1800
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I don't fucking know anything about Pokemon.

1801
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I don't care.

1802
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:08,000
We have to do our various shows as Pokemon.

1803
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Where we only say our names the entire show.

1804
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Rah rah!?

1805
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Thank you for the email.

1806
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Team America. World police to me.

1807
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
No. We love the random questions.

1808
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
If you have some random questions for us.

1809
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Participate at Orangelawandtrady.com

1810
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I would think with the new-

1811
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
I'm a Digimon fan anyway.

1812
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I would think with the new stories we've had this week

1813
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
You all have some things to say, so participate at Orangelawandtrady.com

1814
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Why did you just make crossed fingers at Dark Soccer

1815
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
when she said she liked Digimon

1816
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
You don't even know Pokemon anymore

1817
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I know Pokemon a hell of a lot more than I know Digimon

1818
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Did you ever watch any of the Japanese Digimon?

1819
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
No, definitely not

1820
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Digimon Zero 2 is like the best anime in the universe

1821
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I'm just going to say this

1822
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
This guy I dated once

1823
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:55,000
This is years before Alan obviously

1824
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:58,000
This guy I dated once had me watch the Digimon movie

1825
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I thought you said Disgaea

1826
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Needless to say it didn't work out

1827
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
No no no no

1828
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
We have to have you

1829
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Whomp whomp whomp

1830
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
You need to watch it in Japanese

1831
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,000
It's actually a true story

1832
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
But anyway

1833
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:17,000
I am disappointed Rob, my heart is break

1834
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
I'm just giving you shit

1835
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Although that is a true story

1836
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
But that wasn't the reason

1837
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
I won't go into the reasons here on this show

1838
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Because I'm classy

1839
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Let's get into the FUs of the week

1840
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Speaking of classy

1841
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
It's time for us to say fuck you

1842
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
To things that are pissing us off

1843
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Why do we do this on a video game talk show?

1844
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
It's called tradition, deal with it

1845
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Dark soccer

1846
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
This one is private

1847
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I'm leaving it at that

1848
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I actually know I have another one

1849
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Fuck you to my grandmother's doctor

1850
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Who thinks that people give a shit that he used to play

1851
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
For the University of Alabama football team

1852
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
And isn't actually taking care of her needs

1853
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
So fuck you

1854
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
With a sandpapery giant three foot dildo

1855
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Ouch

1856
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Uh, Jason

1857
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:21,000
You wanna follow that?

1858
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:22,000
No

1859
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I don't wanna come anywhere close to that

1860
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Uh

1861
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
FU to highway construction

1862
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Oh god

1863
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Oh yeah

1864
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Oh you had to come through highway 50 to get here didn't you

1865
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Yup

1866
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Oh you poor bastard

1867
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:37,000
You didn't warn me

1868
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
That's my drive home from work every day

1869
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I forgot

1870
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:42,000
It wasn't that bad

1871
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
The good news is you don't have to go through it all the way back

1872
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Eh, I got more traffic in Berkeley

1873
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Shocking me on the way out here than that

1874
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Whatever, minor driver

1875
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I'm enjoying my time in San Francisco

1876
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Thank you France

1877
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Low key

1878
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
I'm not a big fan of cyclists

1879
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:58,000
And I'm really not a big fan of cyclists racing

1880
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:01,000
And the fact that you know

1881
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
They're shutting down Folsom

1882
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
At least most of Folsom

1883
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
For a fucking bike race

1884
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Yes we could have done this on the weekend

1885
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
But no fuck you guys we're gonna do it on a Monday

1886
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
And we're gonna shut down most of you know

1887
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
The part that people actually drive through

1888
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
Oh and it's gonna be during business hours

1889
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Wait they're shutting down Folsom on Monday?

1890
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Yeah they're shutting down like a good section

1891
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Of like Folsom Boulevard and stuff like that

1892
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
So it's just like

1893
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
I fucking hate you guys

1894
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
So much

1895
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
And now you know it's now they're doing it

1896
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Thankfully I don't

1897
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
I'm not going to work right now so it's not a big deal

1898
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
I just don't drive through Folsom that day

1899
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
But you know it's still fucking annoying

1900
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I have to see if that's gonna impact my work tomorrow

1901
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
I was just about to give an FU to the fact

1902
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I have to be up and in work early tomorrow

1903
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
But now I'm worried about this

1904
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Stupid thing that Low key's talking about

1905
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Well it's just in like old Folsom

1906
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
So I don't think it is

1907
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
As long as it doesn't stretch out to

1908
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Rancho Cordova

1909
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Alright

1910
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Then in that case

1911
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
My FU of the week would go to

1912
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
I don't know I guess things have been

1913
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Mostly well this week

1914
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
I've actually had a pretty good week all things considered

1915
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
So my FU of the week would go to

1916
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Just the fact that

1917
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
The year is going by so fast

1918
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Where did it go?

1919
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I know it's May 11th

1920
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
It's crazy

1921
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Alright

1922
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
FU to the fact that frappy hour is over

1923
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
It's actually probably a good thing

1924
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Those things are a lot of calories

1925
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Alright that's it for the FU of the week

1926
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

1927
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
And then we're going to open up the phones

1928
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
At 1877 Game OLR

1929
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Our username on skype

1930
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Orange Lounge Radio

1931
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
But a few more stories for you guys

1932
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I saw this news and I kind of giggled

1933
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Because I was like

1934
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
Damn

1935
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
But yes Elder Scrolls Online has been delayed

1936
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
On consoles

1937
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Six months later

1938
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
So uh

1939
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
That's gotta suck

1940
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Considering that I don't think that MMO's

1941
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Done too well as far as like people being

1942
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Impressed by it or anything

1943
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
The fact that now the

1944
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Console versions aren't coming out until

1945
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
November or December

1946
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
That's gotta hurt

1947
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Especially now that they're coming out instead of a dead period

1948
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Of releases it's

1949
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
In the middle of the fucking 4th quarter

1950
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
When no one's going to give a shit about your fucking game

1951
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
That can have positives and negatives

1952
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Because it could come up on Christmas lists

1953
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
And so forth

1954
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
But Bethesda probably would have another game coming out

1955
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
And it's either going to be maybe like

1956
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Doom 4 or a new Fallout game

1957
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
So who's going to give a fuck about an Elder Scrolls Online game

1958
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Eh we'll see

1959
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I don't know

1960
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Unless it's Dishonored 2 maybe

1961
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
I agree that the reception of uh

1962
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Prey 2 finally

1963
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I agree the reception of Elder Scrolls Online

1964
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Hasn't been the greatest

1965
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
I know we're really into it but

1966
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
It does seem like the other MMO's out there

1967
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Kind of eclipse it like nobody's really

1968
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Going after Elder Scrolls the hardest

1969
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
People are playing it because WoW's boring right now

1970
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Or because WildStar's not out yet

1971
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
You know I kind of fear for Elder Scrolls

1972
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Once everything else kind of gets up and going

1973
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
But we'll see

1974
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
It's not like there's not going to be

1975
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
New MMO's coming out

1976
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Like there's going to be this game that's coming out from

1977
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I don't know just some no name company

1978
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Named Bungie that's

1979
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
You know Destiny and

1980
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Oh I'm sure that game will affect the

1981
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Sales of that at all

1982
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says

1983
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Delayed hopefully to fix all the broken

1984
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Stuff that should have been fixed in the beta

1985
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Welcome to the wide wonderful world of

1986
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Online games where they never work

1987
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
To be fair though

1988
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
It is an Elder Scrolls title so

1989
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
A vast majority of bugs

1990
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Are to be expected usually with hilarious

1991
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Results but you know it is an MMO

1992
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
Correct yeah and an MMO though

1993
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Things are different it's one thing to screw up your world

1994
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
It's one thing to another to screw up everybody else's

1995
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Anyhow

1996
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Some news on Disney

1997
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Infinity which yes Disney

1998
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Infinity there of course there's the new ones

1999
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Coming out and it is a success

2000
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
How much of a success?

2001
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Well Disney Interactive's decision

2002
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Had revenues increase 38%

2003
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
During the second quarter

2004
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
This means they have an operating income

2005
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Of 14 million this compared to a

2006
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
54 million lost last

2007
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Year this business grew quote

2008
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Driven by the strength of Disney Infinity

2009
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
And there's also growth in Japanese

2010
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Mobile markets

2011
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Unfortunately this isn't

2012
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
All good news because they also

2013
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Had to cut 26% of the staff

2014
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
And a 50% reduction in game

2015
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Development so they didn't just get

2016
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Those numbers at the strength of the game

2017
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Because they're not developing any other games other than

2018
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Disney Infinity yeah that's kind of the

2019
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Well I think that there's some mobile

2020
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Stuff too but yeah it's not quite

2021
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
What it used to be so yeah Disney

2022
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Infinity sales over 3

2023
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Million starter packs and an

2024
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Estimated 500 million in global retail

2025
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Sales to date Disney

2026
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Infinity 2.0 this

2027
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
September of course with the Marvel characters

2028
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Well yeah and then here's the other thing too

2029
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
That Disney's doing why they

2030
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Probably laid off people is that

2031
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
They are now outsourcing

2032
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Their games to be developed

2033
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
You know for their movie titles

2034
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
So like for example

2035
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
They're not developing

2036
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Disney planes the sequel game

2037
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
That's coming out the Disney planes 2

2038
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Or whatever Majesco's doing that now

2039
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Or I

2040
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Want to say like Tangled had like a

2041
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Third party doing that one

2042
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Harmonix is doing that Disney

2043
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Fantasia eventually

2044
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Someday yeah

2045
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
I wish it was sooner than later but

2046
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Things happen

2047
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
So well I mean

2048
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
I'm glad to hear you know I'd like to

2049
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Hear about profitability in the gaming industry

2050
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Although I'm a little sad it

2051
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Came at the loss of jobs but

2052
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Hopefully it will lead to

2053
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Job creation in a year or two

2054
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
So that would be some good news

2055
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Speaking of good news I

2056
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Can't think of a better thing to end

2057
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
The show on than talk about

2058
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Free games right Dark Sakura? Yep

2059
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Plants vs Zombies is free on Origin this month

2060
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Go get it Well that's good

2061
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
And bad news Bad

2062
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
You have to get Origin good

2063
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
Brains I don't know it wasn't so bad

2064
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
I got it for the Titanfall thing

2065
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
And you know it hasn't eaten my computer live

2066
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
So whatever The good news about

2067
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
All that despite all the shit we've given Origin

2068
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Over the years it has gotten

2069
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
Better you know it's still

2070
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Kind of I don't think you really need it but

2071
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
It's not quite the pain in the

2072
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Ass it used to be so

2073
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I'll pick up free games on it I'm not gonna

2074
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Buy games on it but I'll pick up

2075
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Free games Well actually I got

2076
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Dead Space for free on there too

2077
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
I got Dead Space a long ass time ago for free

2078
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
They've been giving away

2079
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
They've been trying to entice people to come to Origin

2080
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
By giving away free games in their catalog

2081
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
So hey I'm not gonna complain

2082
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
I got Populous for free too

2083
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
I have quite the library there

2084
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Free games that they put out every now and then

2085
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I haven't played any of them but hey

2086
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
What else is new? Steam

2087
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
See but then you get that client on your desktop

2088
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
And then good old games

2089
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Come out of nowhere and says hey we've got

2090
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Covert action available for five bucks

2091
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
You know that Sid Myers game that you're like the only

2092
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Person on the planet that likes it Rob

2093
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
So I had to buy it

2094
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
I had to buy it it's covert action

2095
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
You guys awesome

2096
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
And I don't know

2097
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Maybe I'll end up getting Titanfall

2098
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Too cause I kinda want it

2099
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
But I'm trying to hold out for a sale

2100
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Trying really hard

2101
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
We'll see Just wait

2102
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
I'm trying Loki I'm trying

2103
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
It's difficult

2104
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
Alright that is it for our

2105
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Stories tonight but we are

2106
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Gonna go to the phones

2107
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
The Skype line is open

2108
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
1877 game OLR or a username on Skype

2109
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you wanna give us a call to talk about

2110
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
Anything we've talked about tonight

2111
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Or possibly something else

2112
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Maybe there's a story we didn't hit that you wanna talk about

2113
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Go ahead and give us a call right now

2114
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
While we wait for some calls to come in

2115
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
With a delay I'll ask Loki if there's any

2116
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Last minute stories and I'm gonna bring up our

2117
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR

2118
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Well real quickly we talked about a really

2119
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Expensive HD NES

2120
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Console that was supposed to be coming out

2121
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Yes

2122
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
So now they're finally selling it

2123
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
It's $500

2124
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
And it will up- $599

2125
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
US dollars

2126
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
$599 US dollars

2127
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
And it will up scale games to 1080p

2128
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Your old

2129
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Nintendo classics in 1080p

2130
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Of course you have to buy

2131
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Controllers if you don't have controllers

2132
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
And it's

2133
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
One solid piece of aluminum but

2134
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Fuck that

2135
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I don't need it to up scale that

2136
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
And I think if you even

2137
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
If you bought an NES and bought an

2138
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Upscaler it would probably be way

2139
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Cheaper than buying this thing so

2140
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
I don't know

2141
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Some people

2142
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
And just as reliable as it was back in the day

2143
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Do I have to blow in the cartridges to get them to work

2144
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
For that authentic feel

2145
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Yeah actually you would probably

2146
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
It's those cartridges still

2147
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Going to our Twitter

2148
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

2149
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Some interesting tweets coming in

2150
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
SSG100Matt sends a tweet

2151
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
This is sure to be polarizing

2152
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
But I'm going to read it

2153
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
SSG100Matt sends a tweet that says

2154
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
According to a study and survey

2155
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
This is from Reason.com

2156
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
More gamers politically align themselves with libertarian

2157
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
I'm not super

2158
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Even though that's not where I personally necessarily go

2159
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
I'm not super surprised to hear that

2160
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Could that potentially be because

2161
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Whenever we talk about these politics

2162
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
About violent video games

2163
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
They're trying to ban them

2164
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Does it drive people away from the two parties

2165
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
That everybody talks about most of all

2166
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Well the two party system is shit anyway

2167
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
So maybe people are actually just getting smart

2168
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
You think?

2169
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Although I am actually turning my interest

2170
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
Toward the after party

2171
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
That's real

2172
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
That's basically what's evolved out of the Occupy movement

2173
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Interesting

2174
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
As long as it's not

2175
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
A pee party

2176
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Anyway

2177
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Let's go to the phones

2178
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
We do have a call coming in

2179
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Hi you're on Orange Lawns Radio who's this?

2180
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
It's the one and only Ronma

2181
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
How is everybody in the studio tonight?

2182
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
It would just not be Orange Lawns Radio without Ronma calling in

2183
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
What's up buddy? We're doing great

2184
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
We had a great interview tonight

2185
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
And Jason's here, it's a full house tonight

2186
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
We have 25 devices on the internet

2187
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
It's great

2188
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Well there's 5 more devices I have wired up right now

2189
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Not much, couple of quick things

2190
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Number 1, I meant to mention last week

2191
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Where you were talking about that

2192
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
Waffle place in New York City that we took you to

2193
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Yes

2194
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
It was called Waffle and Dingles I believe

2195
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
I think that's the name of it but the place is so good

2196
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
So good, still there?

2197
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Yes, yes it is

2198
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
So there's a possibility

2199
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
I will be in New York very soon

2200
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
We're going for Poutine

2201
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Gee I wonder what announcement this is related to

2202
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Because we may also go a weekend without a show

2203
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Potentially yes

2204
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
I will know next week

2205
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Stay tuned

2206
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Rob you don't have to worry about not doing a show

2207
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
I have a small studio here

2208
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
We will jury rig something

2209
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
We'll do an

2210
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
OLR Unauthorized or something

2211
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
There you go

2212
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Yeah there's a lot of interesting things that could be coming up

2213
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
I don't want to say too much

2214
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
But I will know for sure in 7 days

2215
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
You can call it Marmalade Radio

2216
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Because it's Orange Jam

2217
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Tune in for next week's show

2218
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
I'll definitely tune in for next week

2219
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
The second thing

2220
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Not gaming related

2221
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
Something I meant to ask you

2222
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
I don't remember if I did

2223
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
How do you feel knowing

2224
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
That there's going to be Dunkin Donuts

2225
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
In your neighborhood and if it's already there

2226
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Have you been there yet?

2227
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
I'm so fucking excited I'm shaking and crying and screaming and convulsing

2228
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
I'm just like

2229
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
You guys don't understand

2230
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
I know the rest of the US probably looks at me and goes

2231
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
It's just Dunkin Donuts

2232
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Fucking shut up

2233
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Live in California and have no Dunkin Donuts

2234
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
People even ask me

2235
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Where do you get donuts if you don't have Dunkin Donuts?

2236
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
And I go

2237
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
That's a great question

2238
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
I want to see Tim Hortons

2239
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Yes

2240
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
But for the record the grocery store and there's lots of mom and pop stores

2241
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
There's no Winchells anymore

2242
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
There's Winchells in LA

2243
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
One Krispy Kreme

2244
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Actually I've found four Krispy Kremes in town

2245
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
In the area

2246
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
There's a couple in Roseville and one in Atomas

2247
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Everybody finally got off Atkins

2248
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
But anyway

2249
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
As far as Dunkin Donuts goes

2250
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
There is one in California now

2251
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
And I haven't been there yet

2252
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Because it's in Barstow

2253
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Barstow is between Los Angeles and Las Vegas

2254
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Known as Death Valley

2255
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
Um

2256
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Yeah

2257
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
So I'm not going there to get a coffee

2258
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
However it is coming to

2259
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Our neck of the woods

2260
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I think they said 2015

2261
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
So I think we're going to start seeing them next year

2262
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Which I'm excited

2263
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Their coffee is so flipping good

2264
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I have a reason I don't care

2265
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
So terrible for you

2266
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I am not going to care because I can't

2267
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
So you still need me to ship you

2268
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
A few batches of coffee

2269
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
I would love that

2270
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Yeah however we can get the K cups

2271
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
But I'm going to be honest the K cups are not

2272
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Even as good as the real thing

2273
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
We also can get the bags of coffee

2274
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Yeah I think there's better K cups out there

2275
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
I thought it was really horrible when they had like apple

2276
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Whatever flavored fucking coffee

2277
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
I was like what the hell were they eating but the coconut was really good

2278
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
It does not compare to

2279
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
That drink that they give you

2280
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
That's like a little bit of coffee and then

2281
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
Creamer and sugar

2282
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Amazing

2283
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Anyway

2284
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I guess you could bring the discussion on our video game show

2285
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
To food but you know what donuts

2286
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Are a great

2287
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Great snack to game too

2288
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Not healthy but

2289
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Unless you're me you sit there and you

2290
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
Make a batch of popcorn and you sit there and you

2291
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Eat it while you're playing Kingdom Hearts 1.5

2292
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Remix

2293
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Yeah something like that I'll usually play

2294
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Final Fantasy 14

2295
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
And sob quietly to myself

2296
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Into my bowl of potato chips

2297
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
But you know

2298
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Alright anything else you want to talk about tonight

2299
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Last thing I'm getting out of here

2300
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
So yesterday I picked up my

2301
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
Glorious Playstation 3 from the shop

2302
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
And the guy told me that

2303
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
It's working

2304
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
I had it burn in for about 4 hours

2305
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
So you're good to go

2306
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
But I recommend getting a new one cause this one's going to

2307
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Die on you, may die on you soon

2308
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
He pretty much told me don't use it for

2309
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Streaming of anything

2310
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Play a couple of games on it

2311
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
Movies but don't use it

2312
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
As a streaming device

2313
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
He's like get an Apple TV and I'm like

2314
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
What?

2315
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Was there a reasoning behind that?

2316
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Well

2317
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
I took my PS3 in the first time because

2318
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
When I was watching my Ronlef Blu-rays

2319
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
It would lock up after about 10 minutes

2320
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
And then

2321
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
It would not read Blu-rays

2322
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
Now it's working fine. The guy told me

2323
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
I brought it in just in time before it started to

2324
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
To yellow light out

2325
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
He pretty much said he had to disassemble it

2326
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Clean all the thermal paste off

2327
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Put fresh thermal paste on it, reassemble it

2328
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
And get it up and running

2329
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Wow

2330
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
He said that the Playstation 3's were never designed for streaming

2331
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
And I'm like

2332
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
I've been streaming on this device for maybe about

2333
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
2-3 years and I haven't had an issue with it

2334
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Maybe you should just flip it upside down

2335
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Like we used to do with the Playstation 2's

2336
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I fixed everything

2337
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
We used to put them on their side

2338
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
With my PS1

2339
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
That's what I did

2340
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
When this first started acting up I flipped it

2341
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
Horizontal, vertical

2342
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
I'm like, okay, let's see if it works

2343
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Still nothing

2344
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
I always thought mine was going to be full of cat hair

2345
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Because it was like super hot

2346
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Heat coming out of that thing

2347
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
And I took it apart and it was actually completely clean

2348
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
If that Playstation 3 gets hot enough

2349
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Perfect for grilling chicken

2350
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
Mmm, if I ever had one

2351
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
It knows

2352
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
And I remember

2353
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
When you get the PS2's

2354
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
Don't use it for playing DVD's

2355
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
The drive was not designed for normal DVD's

2356
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Spinning, I'm like, well, let me go out and drop

2357
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
50 bucks on a DVD player, you know

2358
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
We used ours for years

2359
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Most of America used theirs for DVD players

2360
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
That's why that thing sold so well

2361
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
I don't understand how a DVD drive isn't used

2362
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
For DVD's

2363
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
You know how it is, somebody says something

2364
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
And everybody follows along with it

2365
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
But I think it was more of a heat issue

2366
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Because when I moved it to this new place

2367
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
My PS3 sits on a little platform

2368
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Under the table

2369
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
It's getting intercooler

2370
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
I mean, my friend had a friend who had an uncle

2371
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Who told me that, you know, they buried

2372
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
ET in the desert in the middle of New Mexico

2373
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
So

2374
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
And lo and behold

2375
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Alright, Rama, I gotta let you go to get more calls

2376
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
But thanks so much for the call, buddy

2377
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Uh oh

2378
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
Internet connection problem

2379
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
We're losing Rama anyway

2380
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
So thanks for calling, Rama

2381
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
If you hear this and your internet didn't cut out

2382
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Boy, that was weird

2383
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Oddly timed

2384
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
Alright, we're still connected

2385
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
It looks like

2386
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
So I'm hoping we're not having those same issues that we were having earlier

2387
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Rama's problem

2388
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Northeast problems

2389
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Oh look, and Rama just left IRC

2390
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
So that's, well, there you go

2391
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
He had to make an exit

2392
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
He was just like, I'm out of here, bye

2393
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
He was all, fuck it, pull the cord

2394
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Yeah, he just said, fuck it, and pulled the plug

2395
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
But we do have another call coming in

2396
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Hey, one man's loss is another man's gain

2397
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Let's get to it, hi, we're just launching

2398
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Who is it?

2399
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
Hey, you're lucky

2400
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
That Rama just pulled the plug out of anger

2401
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Or something

2402
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
What's up, buddy?

2403
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
Well, I could talk about

2404
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
A lot of stuff that happened

2405
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
During the week and especially on Twitter

2406
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
But I want to talk about

2407
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Team Fortress 2

2408
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Don't know why

2409
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Can we talk about Kirby Triple Deluxe

2410
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
And you're gonna have to come up here and kick her butt

2411
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
And by kick her butt, meaning give her a hug

2412
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
And go out for Mexican food together

2413
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait

2414
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Dark Sakura hates Kirby Triple Deluxe?

2415
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Not really

2416
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
I haven't played it yet

2417
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
It was a joke earlier in the show

2418
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Yeah, me neither

2419
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
FedEx screwed up my order

2420
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
It pretty much got lost

2421
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
And I have to wait until Wednesday

2422
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
To report it back to Amazon

2423
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
And say it got lost

2424
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
I'm kind of sad

2425
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I would be playing

2426
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
I would be talking right now about Kirby

2427
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
I am surprised you are not over there right now

2428
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Beating down the door

2429
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
Showing your anger

2430
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
It's very reserved of you

2431
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Anyway, I'm sorry

2432
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
That's not what you called in to talk about

2433
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
What did you want to talk about?

2434
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
You want to talk about Team Fortress 2?

2435
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Yeah, basically

2436
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
I got back into Team Fortress 2

2437
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
After months of not playing

2438
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
And still the game is pretty much the same

2439
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
It hasn't changed that much

2440
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
At least from what I've noticed

2441
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Aside from new hats

2442
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
And some new stuff for the weapons

2443
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
But

2444
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
I don't know

2445
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
I found a new enjoyment on it again

2446
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
And pretty much

2447
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
Where I'm going

2448
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Is if you have

2449
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Played a game recently

2450
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Or maybe not recently

2451
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
But

2452
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
That's a reason

2453
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
That you haven't played

2454
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
For many months or many years

2455
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Before

2456
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
I actually do have an answer to this

2457
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
But you guys are going to roll your eyes so hard

2458
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
You can see your fucking brain

2459
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
But it's my honest to god answer

2460
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
And that is because I had the new computer

2461
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
And all the new graphics and everything

2462
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
The one game I had to go back and see

2463
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Was Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

2464
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
And play that again

2465
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
I totally did do that this week too

2466
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
It was so sexy

2467
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
The graphics were about the same

2468
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Because Mass Effect 3 was only set for a certain bench level of graphics

2469
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
And I wasn't using HD textures or anything

2470
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:54,000
So not to be all Jamie about my gaming week

2471
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
But I definitely played some Mass Effect 3 multiplayer

2472
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
And that was a sexy thing to revisit

2473
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
I'm trying to think

2474
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Because I've had the new computer

2475
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
There's been other things I've been revisiting too

2476
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Getting to go back and play

2477
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
Some of the games I've had

2478
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
Diablo and stuff was pretty cool too

2479
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
But what about you guys?

2480
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Is there a game?

2481
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
You've played for the first time in a very long time

2482
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
You just kind of went back and revisited

2483
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
It wasn't a long time

2484
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
But I've had the conversation a couple times

2485
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
About comparing Titanfall on the 360

2486
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Versus the Xbox One

2487
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
And they're not terribly different

2488
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
I think more of the differences that I see

2489
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Are the fact that I sit closer to the TV

2490
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
At work than I do at home

2491
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
And I think it may have those

2492
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
120, 240 hertz features on

2493
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
And not on game mode

2494
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Flat 60, etc.

2495
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I played

2496
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
I don't know if this actually counts

2497
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
But I did download Jetmoto 2

2498
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Onto my PSP

2499
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Not Vita

2500
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Onto my PSP

2501
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
The other day

2502
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I bought it a while back

2503
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
Graphically I don't remember anything

2504
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
But not having all of the shoulder buttons

2505
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Completely fucks that game up

2506
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Because the R1, L1, and R2, L2

2507
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Do very distinct things

2508
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
I really wish they'd bring that game series back

2509
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Jetmoto?

2510
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
I saw what they did with 3 though

2511
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
I played Fairy Solitaire

2512
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
Fairy Solitaire?

2513
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Can't get it old school

2514
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I was bored

2515
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
So I played Fairy Solitaire

2516
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Especially when you have some of those free games

2517
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
I played Portal 2 not that long ago

2518
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
And that was the first time since probably the game came out

2519
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
It was kind of fun to relive that one

2520
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
I should just give you my Portal 2 shirt that I don't wear

2521
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Cool, free clothes

2522
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
I played

2523
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
While I was restocking my 360

2524
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
I downloaded and played Discs of Tron

2525
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
That didn't look any different

2526
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
My 360 hasn't been hooked up for like 6 months

2527
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
I had so many downloadable games it was disgusting

2528
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
So I should plug that in and play some of that old school stuff

2529
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
I did have the Tron

2530
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
They released that

2531
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
The arcade Tron

2532
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
4 minigames

2533
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
The Overworld is a game

2534
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Although it's not

2535
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
I can travel in 4 directions

2536
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Hey in the 80's that was modern stuff

2537
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Well there you go Act Deaf

2538
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
There's some of our walks down memory lane

2539
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Yeah those are pretty cool games

2540
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Especially like Portal

2541
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:22,000
It's a game I usually try to play at least a few times a year

2542
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Even I played Portal the first one a few weeks ago

2543
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
I did a stream on it too

2544
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Good times

2545
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Good times

2546
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
When these companies give away games for free

2547
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Even though they might be a few years old

2548
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
They're always worth picking up

2549
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Let's say Plants vs Zombies being given away free

2550
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Right now on Origin

2551
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
As long as you're cool and have an Origin on your computer

2552
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Most of you probably already have it

2553
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
I would say go grab it while it's free

2554
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Because maybe you haven't played Plants vs Zombies

2555
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Since it was first out on the

2556
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
IOS or Android devices

2557
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Or when it was first out on Xbox 360

2558
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
It might be a whole different experience on PC

2559
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Definitely worth picking up

2560
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Especially if you don't have it

2561
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
Because it's a really great game

2562
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
Absolutely

2563
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
I already have it on Steam

2564
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Act Deaf I'm going to let you go so we can get a couple more calls

2565
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
Thank you very much for the call

2566
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Good question trip down memory lane

2567
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Hey thanks for having me

2568
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
And I hope you get your copy of Kirby already

2569
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
I can't have Kirby's number one fan here on OLR

2570
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Being robbed of his Kirby

2571
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
It's not cool

2572
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
It's sad

2573
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Oh FedEx we're coming after them too if they don't get it worked out

2574
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
Alright

2575
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Take care

2576
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Alright

2577
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
1877 Game OLR or username on Skype

2578
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

2579
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
We can probably squeeze in one more call if someone can get in here pretty quick

2580
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
DarkTetsuya sends us a note that Fistful of Potions

2581
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Was taping from a comic shop during free comic book day

2582
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
That was last week

2583
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
But yes I read that one last week

2584
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
That was during the

2585
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Wait did you?

2586
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
If they tweet during the show I usually get to it

2587
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Jason if you let me do my segment

2588
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
I'm just kidding

2589
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Well we are being invited to Concord Ontario

2590
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Being a Catholic school board trustee

2591
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
What the hell is that?

2592
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
We get all these random ass tweets that are like

2593
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
Oh I went to church and I saw the

2594
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
OLR and I'm like what the fuck is this

2595
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
I've been trying to figure out who they are

2596
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
I don't know who OLR is

2597
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
It's a church I just don't remember what it was

2598
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
I remember seeing that one time

2599
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Probably Ontario something

2600
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
That's fine

2601
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
But it just cracks me up

2602
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Because I'll see these random tweets

2603
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
It's like somebody tweeting god dammit

2604
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
I heard you talking shit about me on air

2605
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
That was an actual tweet from Gemet this week

2606
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
Or hey read only memories

2607
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Is on Steam Greenlight

2608
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Like Reddertainment tweeted us which is true

2609
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
And then it'll be like oh the worship this Sunday

2610
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Was so good

2611
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
It's Our Lady of Rosary Church

2612
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
In Union City

2613
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Thank you

2614
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
It's like my story that I've told

2615
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
My coworker who has the Twitter name Dice

2616
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
And he retweets

2617
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
Everybody who bitches at him

2618
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
For Battlefield

2619
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:04,000
There's one it's www.OLR.net

2620
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
And then

2621
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
OLRSD.org

2622
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
For the San Diego one

2623
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
I think it's just a church there

2624
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Who owns OLR.com

2625
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Online residential New York source for real estate

2626
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Listings

2627
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
I looked into that some time ago

2628
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
But you know whatever

2629
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Anyway

2630
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
Moving on to another tweet

2631
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Again this is the last chance to get called in

2632
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Or to call in 1877 game OLR

2633
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
username on Skype

2634
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2635
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
I see some people talking about civilization in chat

2636
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
Which ties into the interview we had earlier

2637
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
And it just kind of makes me laugh

2638
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Because Civ is that game you can go back and revisit once in a while

2639
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
But it's going to be a very long while

2640
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
All night long

2641
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
And it's going to look exactly the same

2642
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
And play exactly the same

2643
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
As long as you have the time to spend on it

2644
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
With Civ they have the expansions and everything

2645
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
I kind of hope

2646
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
I have a funny feeling

2647
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
When Christopher Tin was on the show earlier

2648
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Talking about that song of his

2649
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
It might be for that new Civ game

2650
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Is that the impression you got?

2651
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Because that's the impression I got

2652
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
I didn't

2653
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
I was leaning towards some new title

2654
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
I was going to make a tongue in cheek

2655
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Joke about Civ 6

2656
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Civ 5.5, Civ Next DLC

2657
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
Well there's the whole don't call it alpha centari

2658
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Civilization game that's on its way

2659
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
Not my world

2660
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
That was going to be my

2661
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Tongue in cheek joke

2662
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
I would kind of expect it to be a new game personally

2663
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
A different company at least

2664
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
I was surprised

2665
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
It was next week because I would have thought

2666
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
E3, but now is the time of year

2667
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Where all the companies are getting a jump on E3

2668
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
To say here's the games to get excited

2669
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
About E3

2670
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
As big as some other companies

2671
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Right, yeah I know about that one

2672
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Or even just need to shove some of the news out of the way

2673
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Before what they're going to announce there

2674
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
All these companies that weren't cool enough to get in the door

2675
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Anyway, going to another tweet

2676
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
From 13X forever

2677
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Or cross forever, 13 forever

2678
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Who tweets us and says

2679
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Did you know that Kiro Blaster

2680
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
A new game from Pixel from Cave Story fame

2681
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Is available right now

2682
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
And tweets us a link to playism-games.com

2683
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
I did not know that, but you have educated me

2684
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
I've checked that out because

2685
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Pixel games, like all the

2686
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
That stuff was great

2687
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
With Cave Story and all that

2688
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
So, excited

2689
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Hooray hooray

2690
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
Unfortunately, Shane's not in the room right now

2691
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
But I had to read this tweet from Andy Scout

2692
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Who tweeted at us saying

2693
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
I can't trust game recommendations from someone who doesn't like

2694
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
Ni No Kuni

2695
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
Me neither, Andy, me neither

2696
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Alright, I guess that's it for tweets

2697
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
How about any other last minute stories?

2698
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
No

2699
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Well, I guess that means we're out of here

2700
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Because the phone is not ringing

2701
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
So I'm going to go ahead and close that on up

2702
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
And we're well past 9 o'clock anyway

2703
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
I want to thank you guys for staying up late with us tonight

2704
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
Really appreciate it

2705
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
What a great show, thank you guys all for being a part of it

2706
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
If you like what you heard here at Orange L'Antrado

2707
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Please, all we ask, tell a friend or two

2708
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
About the show, help spread the word

2709
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Of the show, that's all we've got

2710
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Is word of mouth

2711
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
We really appreciate a nice review

2712
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
On a website where you found this show

2713
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
Those reviews go a long, long way in helping us be visible

2714
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
So please, help us out

2715
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
Really appreciate it

2716
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Jason, I want to thank you for being here

2717
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
Absolutely

2718
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
I know we didn't get to talk as much tonight

2719
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
Because I didn't get to budget you any stories

2720
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
And we had another guest on tonight

2721
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
Who, you know, with all due respect, Jason, you didn't win a Grammy

2722
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
That's a tough act to follow

2723
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Maybe next year

2724
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
I give him all of the accolations and lauds I possibly can

2725
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
But it's a pleasure to have you here

2726
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
And come back again sometime

2727
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
You said you might be here next week?

2728
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
Make a weekend of Scandia next week

2729
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
And I can stick around here for the weekend

2730
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
Then we can hear that schmexy voice of yours all over again next week

2731
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
It'll be fun

2732
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
I'll be here

2733
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
We'll give you some stories

2734
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
I can be here

2735
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
It's like Jason the sequel

2736
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
That'd make it sound like a Friday the 13th movie

2737
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Wasn't it?

2738
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
The funny slash sad thing

2739
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
That may turn out to be more accurate

2740
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
Not the Jason movie part

2741
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
You're going to be here for months and months again?

2742
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
It's fucking possible

2743
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Oh boy

2744
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Keep that fourth chair nice and warm for Jason

2745
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Alright

2746
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Moving on, DarkSakura

2747
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
Thanks for being here

2748
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
As you always are

2749
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
You're welcome

2750
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2751
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
I really want a burrito

2752
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
A burrito?

2753
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
I may go to Adelbertos

2754
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
Do you want to get me a burrito?

2755
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
I'm going in the opposite direction

2756
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
I'm going that way, far away

2757
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Well, poop

2758
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
Well, if you eat a big enough burrito

2759
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Jason, I didn't properly give you a chance to give your final thought

2760
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Did you have a final thought?

2761
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
No, actually

2762
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
I really don't

2763
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:57,000
I have literally nothing left in my mind right now

2764
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Besides maybe telling your dryer to hurry up

2765
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
Hey, it's got a timer on it

2766
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
It'll tell you when it's done

2767
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
Alright, my final thought

2768
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
I love the fact too that you are literally on your last clean thing you own

2769
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
It's a radio show

2770
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
He can wear whatever he wants

2771
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
But he's got pajama pants with little chilis on them right now

2772
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
It's hilarious

2773
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
This was a very explicit plan

2774
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
I have more than a week's worth of pants

2775
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
But I like having all of them just in case for some reason

2776
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
I don't get a chance to do laundry

2777
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
Because doubling up

2778
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
Yeah, pajama life

2779
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
Exactly, that's alright

2780
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
It's radio, they don't look at us

2781
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:37,000
The audience is lucky I'm wearing any pants at all

2782
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
But you know

2783
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
We're lucky you're wearing pants at all

2784
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:45,000
I do that out of respect to you guys who come here in the studio

2785
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
But trust me, the minute you guys leave

2786
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
I did

2787
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
Sorry, Jason

2788
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
I did say as soon as I walked in here

2789
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
That lounge has gotten more appropriate

2790
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Because we're not all crammed around a dining room table

2791
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
And we're actually spread out

2792
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
What do you think of Studio N7?

2793
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
It's fucking open, there's space to move

2794
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:07,000
And not have to shift and get out of people's way and contort

2795
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:11,000
Most families would have a dining room

2796
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
Well you do have a dining room, it's literally right there

2797
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
You remember what we did with our dining room

2798
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
Pinball

2799
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
We called it Pinball Alley

2800
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
I'm just saying, wouldn't a baby Pac-Man machine fit right here?

2801
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
Just saying

2802
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
Wouldn't it be great?

2803
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
I'm gonna turn into Dark Sakura's house

2804
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:31,000
Get a table, I have a freaking bar top cabinet that could go right there

2805
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
Where's that in my video capture card?

2806
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
You know, I thought about it before I came here

2807
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
And I thought about it after I came here

2808
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
And I was like, oh, forgot it

2809
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
I'm messing with you

2810
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
N7 is wonderful, that is my final thought

2811
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
Alright, fantastic

2812
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
My final thought tonight is

2813
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
It is really stupid to drink a cup of coffee

2814
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
At 8 o'clock in the evening

2815
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
When you realize, oh yeah, I have to go to bed early tonight

2816
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Cause I gotta be up at 6.30 in the morning

2817
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
That's not true, you have awesome dreams

2818
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
When you're caffeinated

2819
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
And they're weird

2820
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
That's a good way of looking at it

2821
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
Alright, last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight

2822
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
My final thought is I hate my fucking touchpad

2823
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
For some reason it keeps clicking the right button

2824
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Even though I'm not touching the right button at all

2825
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
It's really annoying

2826
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
And it's just some stupid

2827
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
Aces gesture garbage

2828
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Which I disabled, but it's still doing it

2829
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
You have a rough life

2830
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
Yeah, and I'm trying to figure out

2831
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
How to fucking do texture atlases correctly

2832
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
Cause I don't want to buy this one program to do it

2833
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
And it's just a pain in the ass

2834
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
Alright, well that's gonna do it for another week

2835
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
At Orange Lounge Radio

2836
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000

2841

Happy Mother's Day once again

2842
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
