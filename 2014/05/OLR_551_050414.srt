Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Repeat after me, I will not believe everything I read on the internet

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Nintendo hardware, Smash Brothers rosters, the time to fake is high before E3

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But could a relationship between EA and Comcast per video games on your cable box be true?

Find out this week on the show where every gamer has a voice

Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Live on this May the 4th of 2014

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
With the 551st episode of our show

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And yes, let me get it out of the way right now

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
May the 4th be with you, blah-di-blah-di-blah

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But, for me, as a fan of Arrested Development

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Maybe not as hardcore as some other people I know

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I would say it's actually Happy Cinco de Cuatro

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And yes, I know it's totally wrong Spanish

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you see Arrested Development, you kn-

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ah, forget it

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Alright, anyway, my name is Rob Roberts

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
With my co-host, sadly not here tonight, DarkSakura

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
She has the night off tonight

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But we do have here in studio, Loki

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hi

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Doing okay

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hi

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Good, good to hear

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's new with you?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Not much, just looking at pictures of Legos

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Pictures of Legos? Why, are you planning on investing a bunch of money on Legos or something?

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No, just ideas

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I see

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Have you ever fiddled around with that program that allows you to build your own things offline

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then order the exact right Legos to make the thing?

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No, I'd be afraid of how expensive it is

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I mean, I just, yeah, it's gonna be expensive

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We actually have a local Legos shop over here

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That they sell cut, you know, pieces and whatever

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So I haven't really gone in there because once again I'm afraid of how expensive it is

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's an expensive hobby from what I understand, so

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There you go, good luck

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I noticed to the show tonight you brought your very own pizza

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But you got your pizza well done

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yeah, I always do

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why is that?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know, I like it well done

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Fair enough

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Alright, well since we don't have Dark Soccer here tonight

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We do have another friend of the show here in studio to fill in and help host tonight

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's always good to see him and we might be seeing him a lot more often in the coming weeks

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Say hello everybody to Shane

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hello

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Shane Olinko here with us tonight, how you doing?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm good

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah?

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So you live here now?

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I do

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You do, you're back in Northern California, welcome back

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And so we might be seeing more of you on OLR in the coming weeks?

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Depends on if I'm awake or not

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How's your rock and roll lifestyle going?

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you sleep all day and party all night or what?

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, partying is trying to catch Pokemon all night till like 5 in the morning, yeah

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well how was the experience in Northern California?

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You came here from Kansas, for the listeners that didn't know

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And you've been on the show on and off literally over

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Like a decade

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All the whole years, yeah

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think I first met you, my god, when you were like 19 years old I think

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And it was when I was living with Loki, when we had that first, like, episode numbers less than 100

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Was it 19?

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think so

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No it was because we did episode 69 from the apartment

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah, no, Shane was only like 19

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh I was 19, I thought you said you were 19

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh god no, no I was 24 when the show started, actually technically 23

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Cause the show started like 3 days longer

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah it was probably like 19

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, so crazy stuff

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So you're back from Kansas, and how does Northern California compare to Kansas?

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's better

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In what ways?

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Name one and I'll agree

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The weather

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, it was 100 today, where I'm from back there, and they had humidity which makes it like 743

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And let's see, how about the arcade scene, the games

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well there's not really one here either

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We can go to Golfland and have some sadness

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh my friend has his own DDR machines

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I hear it's not so bad anymore because it's like one of the local Bimani enthusiasts actually runs a lot of that

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
See, when

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Scandia had Pump It Up, so I was happy about that

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They also have the new Beat Media 2DX

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay I don't get that because when we went there, Shane and I went there when he was visiting like a couple months ago

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
None of that

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah it wasn't there a couple months ago

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Shane we gotta take a trip

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We can go play Spada

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's what it is

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright, I want to say hi to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We are at The Voice of Geeks Network, and we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Right after the Bobby Blackwell show at The Voice of Geeks Network

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
www.vognetwork.com

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, Shane likes California better because Del Taco

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, it's actually pretty good

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, true story you guys, true story

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
First off, the first part of the true story

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Shane, as long as I've known him, has been like addicted to Taco Bell

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Like he's eaten a lot of Taco Bell

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
A lot

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why do you like Taco Bell of all places?

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I really don't

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I've had Jim Boys

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I've not had Jim Boys

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What a convincing answer

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But their breakfast is really good at Taco Bell now

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I have to vouch for that

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Again, I've known you since you were 19, and to put things into perspective you're 30 now

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So I've known you a long time

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And in that entire time, I've always said when you come to visit California, I'm like we should go to Del Taco

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You like Taco Bell, you're gonna like Del Taco

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's a very California thing, it's even better

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And you're like, no, Del Taco sucks, Del Taco's stupid

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm like, oh, he must have had it once and he never liked it

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well come to find out, I just found out this past week

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You never had Del Taco, so you wouldn't have had it

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nope

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And you were like, oh, this is so good

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, except for their french fries

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Which, one, you're a Mexican restaurant, you shouldn't have french fries

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're stupid

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Two, refer back to one

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And three, they were way too salty

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There might have been some french fries under that salt somewhere, but I couldn't find them

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
People are gonna think we're on their payroll

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Their french fries are terrible

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think they're good, but people are gonna think we're on their payroll, we're not

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And they have a hamburger, what the crap

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not gonna eat your hamburger

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No more free advertising

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now the bacon double del is pretty good though

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No more free advertising, they want more advertising, they don't have to pay for it

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Alright

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I haven't been there in like

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There's one right by

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There's one, not to give away where I live

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I mean, there's a few Del Tacos in Sac

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm just gonna say, there's one like right near us

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So it's like, probably less than a mile

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So it's painfully addicting

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I haven't been there since the first studio

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Oh wow, that was a long time ago

160
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, so like, you know

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Alright

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Also, I wanted to say, cause some people are asking

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Like, where was Jason in the intro? Is Jason gone?

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No, Jason's not gone, gone

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's just gone for the week

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Jason's traveling right now, so he had to drive a lot today

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And we actually do all the shows production on Sunday

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Like I do the show roll on Sunday

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because we want to make sure we get as much news as possible

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And sometimes still there's breaking news during the show

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So he wasn't able to do the production schedule today

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So that was my voice in the intro

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And doing the passphrase this week

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But Jason will be back

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think next week, but he's on a road trip

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So I just didn't want everybody to go like

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh my god, is Jason gone? No, he's still around

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He's still helping with the YouTube

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Which by the way, if you haven't checked out our YouTube channel

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Jason does archive all of our episodes on YouTube

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And you might be like, well, why would I want to watch something on YouTube?

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Because it's really convenient

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Like, you can do YouTube on your 3DS

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can do YouTube on all of the consoles

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sometimes it's a little more convenient than the MP3 files

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And we want people to be able to listen to the show

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
As easily as possible

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So if you want to listen to Orange Dance Radio on your 3DS

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You can do that via YouTube

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The only catch is that it is delayed by one week

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The reason why we do that

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We want to draw people to our site

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
To get the viewers and the numbers and all that

194
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, I'm fully opening and admitting it is kind of a trick

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
To actually retain our listenership

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because we don't want to lose everything to YouTube

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But YouTube is an option

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
For especially the archive stuff

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And Jason works very hard on that

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So we thank him for all that

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And yeah, DarkTitsUya says he just saw that

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Episode 550 went up on YouTube

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It sure did, it sure did

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So that was Jason that did that

205
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He also likes to sync

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When we're talking about the Classic Game of the Week

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He'll actually put the video of the Classic Game of the Week

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He does little things like that too

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
For those that are actually watching

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So as I mentioned, remember on Twitter

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I saw this thing about that they're going to be

212
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Marathoning all the episodes of The Simpsons

213
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And 552 episodes of The Simpsons

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So we have

215
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Recorded, including the E3 specials

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because they don't really number those

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
More episodes than there are of The Simpsons

218
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's scary

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well that's because most TV shows only do

220
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey, hey, hey, don't belittle what we're doing here

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, no, no, no

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We've been doing this way too freaking long

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But I mean, most

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
TV shows only do

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What, 22 to 26

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Episodes in a year? If that

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I mean a lot of them are only like 12

228
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But you think of a show like 24 is a great example

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
24 is coming back

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They're having a shorter run this year with 12 episodes

231
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But usually 24 was 24 episodes

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right? One for each hour

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So most shows do that, but we

234
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Produce something like

235
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
46

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
At least in a year

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It varies depending on how many weeks

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We have off in the year, because obviously if you do one every week

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You get 52, but real life happens

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We don't always have one every week, so we do about 46

241
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Or so a year, so it's pretty

242
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Pretty crazy, a lot of hardworking

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Podcasters out there crank that out

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There's probably, I know

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Some that were on a daily basis

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Got even more than that

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That is dedication, folks

248
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That do the daily shows, that is a lot

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So, alright

250
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Anyhow

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I want to get to the gaming news

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And our kickoff topic and our gaming weeks and everything

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I do want to kind of address

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This in our kickoff topic tonight, because E3

255
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is right around the corner

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We're getting to be about one

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Month from E3, a little over a month

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
From E3, no word as of

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yet if VOG Network will be represented

260
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
At E3 yet, we

261
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Put in our request about two and a half weeks

262
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And still haven't heard back, so Bobby

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And I are getting a little nervous, because we don't know

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Where to do a hotel or any of that if we do get in

265
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But we're hopeful

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But regardless of that

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Situation, E3 is happening

268
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
In about five weeks

269
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And all the big gaming news

270
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A lot of it's being sat on until then

271
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're going to see some of it trickle out

272
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
As people want to get the jump on E3

273
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And people want to build the E3 hype

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You saw Nintendo do some of that this week

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We're going to get into that in the news

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But speaking of Nintendo, a lot of lies

277
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Start to come out around this time

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
About what companies are going to show

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And one of the big ones that's been gaining a lot

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Of steam out there is

281
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Nintendo is going to release new hardware

282
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
At E3

283
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, in a statement to website

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Computerandvideogames.com

285
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Nintendo came out, and this was posted on Friday

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Nintendo came out and said, not happening

287
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay, they basically said

288
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Reps told this

289
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
CVG site on Friday

290
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This reveal is not under consideration

291
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So that's on record

292
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They are not revealing new hardware at E3

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now, I don't know if that necessarily means

294
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's not a new console

295
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Or anything like that

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because I still kind of go

297
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It would not be outside of the realm of all possibility

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
For them to do another DS

299
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Type of remake

300
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not necessarily saying

301
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like a new, like a 4DS

302
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Or, I mean, right

303
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Or a DS that has new powers

304
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But I would think maybe like

305
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What about like a reconfigured 2DS

306
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That would not be outside the realm of all possibility

307
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
To me

308
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But it's like them putting out something

309
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
To trump Wii U or whatever

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Not happening

311
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's reverse

312
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Fanboy wank

313
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, I don't even see them redesigning the Wii U

314
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Because you don't really need to make that

315
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Console smaller, I mean, it's pretty small as it is

316
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And maybe tweaking

317
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The gamepad or something

318
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But I just don't see them doing really

319
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And why would you want to do that anyways

320
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
With everything out there

321
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think it would be, I mean, for Nintendo

322
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
To put out a new Wii U this soon

323
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean, they can tweak the Wii U

324
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The Game Boy Micro Micro

325
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They can tweak the Wii U they have

326
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I mean, I wouldn't think it's outside the realm

327
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Of possibility that they somehow figure a way

328
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
To make the technology cheaper

329
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Maybe they reduce the size of the gamepad

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know, I mean, again

331
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Or increase the storage space or something

332
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
They reconfigure the Wii U that's out there

333
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
For like a Wii U

334
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't even know what they'd call it

335
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Super Wii U or Wii U 2

336
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't even know what you would call this thing

337
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Wii U Lite, Wii U

338
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know, yeah, just Wii U New

339
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Or something, whatever they call it

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I mean, they could slightly reconfigure it

341
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But they're not going to throw everything out

342
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Where none of the games are going to be playable anymore

343
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We know Mario Kart 8, they're hedging a lot on that

344
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And the new Smash Brothers

345
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You know, I just

346
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know why people believe

347
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That this is really going to be true

348
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't know if the rumor is that they're saying

349
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They're launching a system that's called the Fusion

350
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's going to play all these 3DS games

351
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And stuff like that

352
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility

353
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That Nintendo is going to look to marry

354
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Their handheld console

355
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And their home console

356
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't think that's

357
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Like, outside the realm of what is possible

358
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And you see them moving closer and closer

359
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
To that with, what, the GBA games

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You can play now on your

361
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Wii U, right?

362
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And you even said a long time ago

363
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
They're going to do DS or 3DS games on Wii U

364
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then they did, they're going to do DS games on Wii U

365
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, it's going to happen

366
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And I even think they're going to do it with the 3DS

367
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Because they don't really care about 3D too much in those games

368
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And they have the right aspect ratios

369
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
With your TV and your gamepad

370
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
To where you could do it

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I mean, they say they can't emulate it

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But, come on

373
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
They have emulators on PC that can run 3DS stuff

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So, I don't buy that

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Here's my other question

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why do people feel the need to lie about this shit

377
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Going into E3?

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Because they want hits

379
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Because they want, you know, people

380
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Some people get off on tricking people

381
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And some people just want, you know

382
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Page hits or something

383
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, I mean, as far as page hits goes

384
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I've seen some real cheap ass stunts for pages

385
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like, just even this week, on Twitter

386
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There was a site that, and I'm not going to name the site

387
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Because I'm not going to contribute to their

388
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Cheap grab for hits

389
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I didn't look to see if they ever apologized for it

390
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But there was a website that a lot of World of Warcraft

391
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Players kind of visited a lot

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Because I think their roots were kind of in that

393
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or whatever, I see a lot of people in that community

394
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That I follow because of Horde House

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This site ran an article that was like

396
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The top 15

397
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Sexy girls wearing

398
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sexy girls holding controllers

399
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Was the article

400
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And it was literally like one of those

401
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You click one for each picture

402
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And it's just, it's sexy girls holding controllers

403
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And sometimes provocatively

404
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sometimes wearing not so much clothing

405
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Or whatever

406
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It was just, it was a really gross way to try to like

407
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Get hits, because a lot of these pictures

408
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That were put up were from like charity

409
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Events and so forth

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And you know, it wasn't

411
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It wasn't a super diverse

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Group of women either

413
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's just, you know

414
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It kind of reinforces certain

415
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Stereotypes that I don't think are good

416
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
For gaming, so obviously

417
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
This is a really stupid thing that they did

418
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's the types of stuff that you see people do

419
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
For cheap hits

420
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I mean, Buzzfeed has made an industry out of this

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Right?

422
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And sharing stuff on Facebook

423
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Like, we could do more of that

424
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
On VOG if we wanted to, but there's just

425
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's certain lines I'm not gonna cross

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You know what I mean?

427
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So, that's that

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Fifth dream in chat

429
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com says

430
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Those sites seem to finally be dying

431
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know about that

432
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Unfortunately, you know

433
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It got a lot of people talking about it

434
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And people checked out the article out of curiosity

435
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I wouldn't be surprised at all if they didn't

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But it just, I don't know, it really kind of

437
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It irks me to know that

438
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You know, E3 is looking for

439
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Websites of a certain volume

440
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And that's all they're looking for is a traffic volume

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And they use these really archaic methods

442
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Of measuring that traffic

443
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's what they're looking at to see who is media

444
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And who's not for their site

445
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And knowing that somebody is going to reach

446
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
These folks by putting pictures

447
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That they don't even own in the first place

448
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I mean, other debate aside

449
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Of whether the pictures are appropriate or not

450
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They don't even own these pictures in the first place

451
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Of 15 sexy women with controllers

452
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Like, knowing that that's how you do it

453
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know, this is kind of gross to me

454
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like, and it's like

455
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm not willing to go there

456
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Just to feel

457
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Special

458
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
In going to the show or whatever

459
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Like, I am proud of the work that we do here at

460
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And the

461
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The commitment

462
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That all of us, myself, Loki, DarkSakra

463
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Have to it and having done it

464
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
For weeks and weeks and weeks and so forth

465
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Like, I'm not going to stoop to those kind of levels

466
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
To meet these archaic

467
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Qualification things

468
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, fine

469
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I won't get to tell you stories from E3

470
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We won't get to do the interactive stuff

471
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You can be spoon fed the same press release crap

472
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That every other site is going to be running, whatever

473
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But, you know, anyway

474
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sorry about that

475
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Anyhow

476
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Shane, you've been awfully quiet

477
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why do you think people

478
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Want to lie about E3 stories?

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why do people lie about this stuff?

480
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Because they want

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hits for their crappy sites

482
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They just hide behind that

483
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's not always crappy websites

484
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, it is

485
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And a lot of times

486
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
They may be just trying to

487
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Not even say educate guesses

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But just try to take guesses about things

489
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And that way if they're right, they can say

490
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Hey look, we said that first

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And that's supposed to give you some sort of credit

492
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh yeah, the next call of duty

493
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Is going to be on the Golden Gate Bridge, you guys

494
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Now I'll just pull that out of my ass

495
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And take a gamble

496
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
See what happens, right?

497
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yeah

498
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Is that?

499
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Anyway

500
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I had to, I'm sorry

501
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I know that's a sensitive subject, but I had to

502
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Alright, anyhow

503
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's water under the bridge now

504
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know, you thought the usual suspects

505
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Would be reporting on this news, but it is what it is

506
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Alright, anyway

507
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks

508
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The types of video games that we have been playing this week

509
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And then we'll get into some more gaming news

510
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll start with Shane

511
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Dark Soccer's not here tonight, she usually goes first

512
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But Shane, you're our guest

513
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

514
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I've been playing, and I'm currently playing

515
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A lot of Pokemon

516
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I am trying to complete my

517
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Pokedex

518
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That I've been technically working on for years now

519
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I am 12

520
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Pokemon short of the 718

521
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
needed

522
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And I

523
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Have been playing it way too much

524
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Way, way, way, way, way, way, way

525
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Too much

526
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Now, why do you have to collect all

527
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
718 Pokemon?

528
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Because the theme song said so

529
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Way back in the day

530
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And you gotta

531
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can't go against that

532
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And B, you get this item

533
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That makes it so you can find

534
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Shinies easier

535
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And that is what I want to do

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And what does shiny Pokemon do?

537
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
They look shiny

538
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They look different

539
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What does shiny Pikachu look like?

540
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Dark or yellow

541
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That's it?

542
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I get blue

543
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And that is enough for me to want that

544
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You make a big

545
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's not just you, but the Pokemon fandom in general

546
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Makes this big stinking deal out of these shinies

547
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And that's it. They look slightly different

548
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's it. Yep.

549
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
They used to have better stats back in the day

550
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
When they were first introduced

551
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And now, no, it's just

552
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That one might be slightly differently colored

553
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Or sometimes they look really different because of their color

554
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I was doing a livestream the other night

555
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
On Twitch of Final Fantasy 14

556
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
And this person was in the living room with me

557
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And he was playing Pokemon

558
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And he caught a shiny while I was on the stream

559
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I was so happy

560
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And he took over the stream with Pokemon talk

561
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He's literally walking up to the camera

562
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You told me to do it!

563
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Because I wanted to know what the big freaking deal was

564
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Because you're sitting over there going

565
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I got a shiny!

566
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And it was uglier

567
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's like some Pokemon look a lot better as shinies

568
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But this one did not

569
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It looked like somebody threw it in an oven

570
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And took it out

571
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh my god. What shiny did you get?

572
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Swirlix

573
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't even know what that is

574
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's the cotton candy Pokemon

575
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sounds like laundry detergent

576
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
So you are a Pokemon nerd

577
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Of the highest caliber

578
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes, I really am

579
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're 30 and playing Pokemon

580
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Which is fine

581
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I know a lot of folks that play Pokemon

582
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But why after all these years are you still addicted to it?

583
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's still a fun game

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's a little bit like gameplay structure

585
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That works every generation

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Now it looks better on the 3DS

587
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So I'm not going to give it up

588
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's fun to collect them all

589
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Or frustrating

590
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's both of those F words

591
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Alright

592
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Anything else?

593
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I played Final Fantasy 14

594
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Skylanders

595
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm a little bit infamous

596
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
And that's it

597
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What have you been doing in Final Fantasy 14?

598
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Playing Leviathan

599
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Over and over

600
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And that's the new fight

601
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
They patched in about 3 weeks ago

602
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No, we're almost to 3 months

603
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Is this the Leviathan patch really?

604
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Holy crap

605
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
2.2 was Leviathan

606
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
2.3 is coming out in June

607
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
2.2 came out in April

608
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
End of March

609
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh my gosh

610
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Wow

611
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Time flies

612
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So I've been doing that

613
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And getting my items from there

614
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I want my water donkey

615
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And some things to upgrade my items

616
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's it

617
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Alright

618
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
We'll come back to Skylanders in a little bit

619
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But we'll go over to Loki first

620
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How was your gaming week?

621
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I played nothing

622
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Nothing?

623
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What's up?

624
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I've been coding

625
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh that's right

626
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Oh I've been putting stuff up on YouTube

627
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Every now and then

628
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Because I get bored of just looking at code

629
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And I wanted to see some actual progress

630
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
So I'll take breaks from stuff

631
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I was working on

632
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm using this program

633
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Called Cubicle

634
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Which does voxels

635
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
To do the graphics

636
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So I made some test stuff

637
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's hard looking at a box

638
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And a box firing more boxes

639
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Than another box

640
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I wanted it to look like something

641
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So I was just messing around

642
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Learning the program a little bit

643
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I made a ship

644
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Just a really stupid looking missile

645
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But I have video of it

646
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Firing the missiles

647
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Into big ol' volley

648
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So you haven't been disconnected

649
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
From video gaming all together

650
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's just that you are right now obsessed

651
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
With this making your own game

652
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm absolutely obsessed with it

653
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's what I've been spending all my time on

654
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I was trying to play some Call of Duty this week

655
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But unfortunately I missed

656
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The people I play with

657
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
By a few minutes

658
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Baby took longer to

659
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Rock the sleep than

660
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
They normally did

661
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
So they didn't see me on

662
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So they just said oh we're gonna call it

663
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I was like ahhhh I missed you

664
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I checked a few minutes late

665
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Unfortunately it didn't sync up there

666
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So that's what I've been working on

667
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And I actually got in touch with

668
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Because my music that I've been

669
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Picking and stuff I have no budget

670
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So I have to pick free music

671
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And that involves

672
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
A lot of Creative Commons songs

673
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
And so I've been spending

674
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
A lot of hours searching for Creative Commons

675
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Work and I actually found

676
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
One that's gonna work perfectly for

677
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The theme song

678
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
For the whole game

679
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
But the problem was it had some anime

680
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Samples in there so I got in touch with the artist

681
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Who actually is a huge fan of Shmups

682
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And like that type of thing and he actually

683
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Wants to score Shmups and stuff

684
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So I'm like hey

685
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Is there any way that you can make me a version of that

686
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Song without the stuff in there? He's like

687
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Yeah hell yeah! So I'm like

688
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Sweet so that was the big

689
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Exciting news today. I was gonna say you should put a call

690
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You never know we might have listeners out there who are

691
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Kinda musically like they might be

692
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Amateur music just like your amateur

693
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's hard because I actually had someone

694
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Hit me up on Twitter and I don't even think that they

695
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Like knew anything they just was doing

696
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Like a general search for like people

697
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Making games or something

698
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Just like some of that music just didn't work

699
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It was like a lot of hip hop stuff

700
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And it's hard to say like what

701
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Exactly I'm looking for because it's basically

702
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I have to listen to the song and if I can imagine

703
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Like okay this is gonna

704
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It just has the right feel to it

705
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Didn't you try to say like pendulum meets

706
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Daft Punk meets or anything? No that's not even

707
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That and actually you know it's funny because I was looking

708
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
For you know that kind of

709
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Pendulum drum

710
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Drum and bass stuff and I actually found a lot of it

711
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Just recently

712
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's actually I think it's another genre

713
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Of drum step so it's a cross between

714
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Drum and bass and dubstep they have a lot of that

715
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
So I did find a lot of that stuff

716
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
It's just a lot of it

717
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This creative common stuff

718
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Especially the electronic music and

719
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Even there's a ton of dubstep for

720
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
One and two like

721
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
All the dance songs sound

722
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Very similar like they use

723
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Almost the same it's not like the same

724
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Instrument but the way that they

725
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Are structured is just like

726
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh my god I'm just like listening to the same

727
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Fucking song for 50 times

728
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's just ridiculous but that

729
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah it's what I've been working on is just that I've been

730
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I'm trying to get to

731
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Well I'm at a point now where I need to start making some

732
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Of the assets because

733
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You know try not to explain too much

734
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
About the game because I wanted to you know

735
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm still working out stuff but

736
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Basically it's like if you

737
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Crossed a shmup with

738
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Borderlands so you've got you know

739
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It's a 2D shmup but your

740
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Ships are customizable in every

741
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Way so you can customize what weapons

742
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Are on it the way it looks and all that stuff

743
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And each thing has different features and

744
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Stuff so you can literally play this game like

745
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You can't almost any other shmup

746
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You can play it like

747
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
In Igaruga or you can play it like Gradius

748
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Or you can play it like whatever and so it's kind of catering

749
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
It towards you know however you want

750
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Now I know that sounds absolutely complicated Bobby's always

751
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Saying you know don't do something complicated

752
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But you know what fucking simple games

753
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Are fucking boring to me so

754
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm going to do something complicated and you know what

755
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's actually worked out fine I've had no problems figuring out

756
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
How to code anything it's just it takes

757
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
A lot of time and just like right now

758
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's interesting to me too to hear about

759
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
All this little shit that goes into games that

760
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Sometimes people forget like like the soundtrack

761
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
You might want to make a game and you

762
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Might want to but you might not know the first thing

763
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
You have no budget that's hard because

764
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You got it you know otherwise you're going to

765
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Find free music that people want to have in

766
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You know they use their music and then

767
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
On top of that like if you want to have a big soundtrack

768
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You got to pay someone to make that music

769
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Or you have to pay artists to do that kind of stuff

770
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Alright you know Bobby is talking

771
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
About this in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

772
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Live on this Sunday night Bobby

773
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Says Loki is being Peter Molyneux

774
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Right now you will be able to plant a tree on the

775
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Ship and it will grow and Dungeon

776
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Buster says will the ship have a dog

777
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The ship is

778
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Not going to have a dog and no

779
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I hate to be compared to Peter Molyneux

780
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But no seriously

781
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That's what I'm you know I have set up

782
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That's what I've been building is just this customization

783
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Through where you can

784
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Well I'm trying to do all the framework and then when I'm done

785
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I can basically okay create a model

786
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And put stats on it and that's it that's all I have to do

787
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Is create models and stats

788
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And be done with it

789
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So that's why I'm trying to do all the coding

790
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
First but I'm getting to the point now where I need

791
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I have where it creates

792
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
The ship from the parts and I don't have

793
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Parts yet I just have this like stand in

794
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Ship model and a bunch of blank stuff

795
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And so I'm running into

796
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Errors because it can't find these

797
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Generic parts so I need to create a set of generic

798
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Parts first so I can do more testing on that

799
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And then finish what I'm coding

800
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So I'm taking breaks now to

801
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You know well last night like I was like

802
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm too tired to actually code on stuff I'm just gonna listen

803
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
To some music so I listen to

804
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
About 200 Creative Commons tracks

805
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And so I've been picking out

806
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Stuff and just

807
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
You know like okay this works because

808
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Creative Commons you know what was it

809
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
CC by is basically

810
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
All you have to do is attribute

811
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The artist and you can use it in a

812
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Commercial product you don't have to pay

813
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Them you don't have to do anything they just that's it

814
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
There's not a lot of that out there and you have to

815
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Also know where to look and it's hard like

816
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I

817
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's a lot of searching and a lot of it's

818
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Just like ugh

819
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Maybe there's some artists out there who might

820
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Want to help so hit Loki up on Twitter

821
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Sure I mean in the mean time like I said

822
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm gonna post stuff on my YouTube page

823
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And I'm posting stuff on

824
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You know Twitter

825
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And like I'm not going into really any details

826
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Like I know what the title of the game is but I'm not

827
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Gonna say and I'm not gonna go into really

828
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
More details about anything else cause

829
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I just

830
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I don't want it like I just feel like I'll

831
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Jinx it if I do that yeah so

832
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I like hearing how you're

833
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
It helps too because you

834
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Sometimes are a big critic of video games

835
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So having to feel the pain of making one a little bit

836
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I think it's gonna be very good for you well there's a lot of stuff like you know

837
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's like I made a save file

838
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm like holy crap I made a save file

839
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's amazing you know it's like

840
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's like stupid

841
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It doesn't even do anything right now

842
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Other than yeah okay what's it saving

843
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I don't know well it's saving nothing right now

844
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It's a bunch of blank you know data but

845
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You know it's made a save file

846
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It's a save file it's so amazing

847
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Going to the chat room

848
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Bob Blackwolf is saying to be fair Loki

849
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Who did give up multiple times already

850
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But he says in parenthesis I'm actually

851
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Really proud of Loki I just don't want to admit it because

852
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Then I'd be a softy

853
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I was working on a complete different game

854
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And I'll even tell you what it was cause

855
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Unfortunately it was you know it got

856
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Lost when my computer crashed last time

857
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I was working on another like F-Zero

858
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Racer type game I was like what should my first

859
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Game be I don't know I'll make a game that someone else

860
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Wants to play okay Rob likes F-Zero okay I'm gonna

861
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Get an F-Zero game so

862
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I was gonna make an F-Zero game

863
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That wasn't quite F-Zero but you know whatever

864
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And funny enough actually I was looking at some stuff

865
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The other day G1

866
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
No someone actually first off someone made a game that has

867
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The title that I was originally gonna call it

868
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
And then there was another person that made another game that

869
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Looks exactly like the game I was gonna

870
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Make I was like ah well whatever you know

871
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I started over and this was the concept that I'm

872
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Doing now was actually one I had

873
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Like about four or five different things I was throwing around

874
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And at first it was like okay

875
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This is gonna be way too hard I'm not gonna be able to do this

876
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So I gave up on it went to the F-Zero thing

877
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
And then when I lost it all I'm like well crap

878
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I don't even remember how I got on to doing a 2D

879
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Shmoop again but um

880
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Somehow I got on to doing that and then

881
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
That's where I stuck with it and so

882
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
It's been fun it's just

883
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's a lot of work and a lot of like

884
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I have to be in the right mindset to be able to

885
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Code stuff cause like you know I'll stay

886
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Up late I'll be really tired you know

887
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
A lot of Red Bull so uh

888
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's just getting in the right mindset

889
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And I wish I had more to show

890
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's just you know right now it looks very plain

891
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Alright well good luck to you

892
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
We'll be looking for updates in the coming weeks

893
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
And now we'll understand why you're not playing as many

894
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Of other people's games so good luck

895
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Um alright let me uh

896
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Talk about my gaming week cause I've played a variety

897
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
A variety of new games this week actually

898
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Um I played and Shane

899
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Brought this up earlier so I'll get right into this

900
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I played Skylanders for the first time

901
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I had never played these games before

902
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And it was kinda like Shane with Del Taco

903
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
As we were talking about earlier in the show

904
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I was kinda like I don't like Skylanders

905
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And I haven't played it I just know I don't like it

906
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Because uh you know they want to sell you all these figures

907
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
It's a cash grab and da da da da da

908
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So Shane set it up for me and he's like

909
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't own too many Skylanders

910
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't

911
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And he dumps 16 of them out on the table

912
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That's 16 across 3 games

913
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Were any of them Spyro?

914
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
No

915
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Care about Spyro

916
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Neither does Skylanders

917
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So yeah so I played Skylanders which specifically

918
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I played the new one that's on Playstation 4

919
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So Skylanders Swap Force right which is the third game

920
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
On the Playstation 4 so you and I played that

921
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And there's actually we caught

922
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The whole thing on a livestream and I even put it up on my

923
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Youtube channel at Rob Roberts Plays

924
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
If you want to see like us playing it for the first time

925
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I gotta admit it was a pretty good

926
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Looking game like you know it's on

927
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Playstation 4 so the graphics were good and there's like

928
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
These scenes

929
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Which is why I specifically got it on PS4

930
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
There's these scenes where you're like racing down

931
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
A tree branch and around that looks like

932
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Something out of like a Sonic game or something

933
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It actually looks really good

934
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And the quality of that's pretty good

935
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It's geared towards kids so you get a lot of loud colors

936
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Cartoony vibe, big text, short

937
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Sentences, things like that, the game is really

938
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Geared towards kids

939
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
The gameplay itself is very platformy

940
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Like you know

941
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Somebody had called it Diablo

942
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Asked to me but that's

943
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I think the earlier games are more like that

944
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Probably

945
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
It wasn't so platformy back then

946
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
It reminded me like a lot of like

947
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
A kiddie version of

948
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Gauntlet which is fine cause that

949
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Like you smash pots

950
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
To find gold and you use the gold

951
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
To upgrade your characters you know

952
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's pretty basic platforming stuff

953
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And you know as a basic platformer

954
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It works pretty well you know Shane and I

955
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
There were some neat little co-op games in it like to unlock doors

956
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You go through these little puzzles

957
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Where you try to join the green box

958
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And the blue box but you want to collect

959
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Little bolts on the way like it's a little puzzle thing

960
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And they're fun to play co-op so

961
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah it's a fun little platformer

962
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I will admit overall I liked

963
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Skylanders more than I thought I would

964
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
That being said

965
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It is completely obvious

966
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
There's a huge cash grab

967
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Going on here

968
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Especially with the in-game advertisements

969
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah tell us about this Shane

970
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Tell us about the in-game advertisements

971
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
So to get like the final power for each character

972
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
There's these soul gems and they're littered throughout the levels

973
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You go and collect one and

974
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It'll be one for some random character

975
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And like the one we saw was for Popthorn

976
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Well I don't have Popthorn

977
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Thankfully they let you preview

978
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
A video of Popthorn so you can see what

979
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
You're missing out on

980
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Mommy mommy mommy

981
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So that's kind of dumb but

982
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah and

983
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
There's these little gates in the levels

984
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And some of them will be like fire doors

985
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So you have to have a fire guy to get through the door

986
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Or you'll have an ice leaf door

987
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Where you have to have one ice guy

988
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And one leaf guy or cause it's swap force

989
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You have an ice top and a leaf bottom

990
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Or whatever you have to be both elements

991
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
To get through that door

992
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Here's the thing though and this is very important

993
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
It's not like those rooms

994
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Lead to full fledged levels

995
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
They really don't

996
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's like one room

997
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
But the thing is that room's gonna have

998
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What? More coins

999
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Maybe a hat which is their version of armor

1000
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Basically that changes your stats

1001
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
If you want to really collect them all

1002
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
So to speak you're gonna have to have one

1003
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Skylander of each element

1004
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Now thanks to swap force

1005
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Not only are there elements

1006
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
But there's powers

1007
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Oh and don't forget the giant boxes too

1008
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh yeah and the giants

1009
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You only need one giant

1010
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So now you have to have a

1011
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Fire railroad or whatever

1012
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You have to get a railroad guy

1013
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
What the hell else was there?

1014
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
There's stealth, there's the tornado ones

1015
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And you were giving me such crap

1016
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
For not being able to go to so many places

1017
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I was cause I was like why can't we go through that door

1018
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You're like I don't have the figure

1019
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You don't have the right figure

1020
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
No you were missing a lot of them

1021
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah because I do not buy all of them

1022
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I buy the ones I like

1023
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And that's not always a whole bunch

1024
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
So if you're the type that's OCD

1025
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And has to complete everything

1026
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Do yourself a favor

1027
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Stay the fuck away from Skylanders

1028
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Stay the fuck away because

1029
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It's gonna drive your OCD bonkers

1030
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yeah cause they already announced what was in the new game

1031
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It has 60 new characters to collect

1032
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Collect

1033
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Like it's in Pokemon

1034
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah 60 new characters

1035
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Each character is about 10 bucks

1036
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
So that's $600 worth of characters

1037
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Right there

1038
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And I bet the trap team

1039
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The bigger ones are gonna be more expensive

1040
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And then 40 new enemies

1041
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
To capture which means

1042
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm sure that each one of those gems

1043
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Maybe you're gonna only be able to store

1044
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
One enemy per gem or something

1045
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And maybe they'll be cheap and be like $5 each

1046
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
That's how they get you

1047
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That all being said

1048
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
As far as like a platforming experience

1049
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I actually had a decent time

1050
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I would go so far as to say

1051
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I might buy the game for myself

1052
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
If I can find a deal on it

1053
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That's what I do like

1054
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I didn't buy Swap Force when it first came out

1055
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I waited until it was like

1056
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
On sale for 35 bucks

1057
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Which is 40 off the original price

1058
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But I'm gonna repeat to myself over and over and over

1059
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't have to open every door

1060
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Only buy the ones you think that are cool

1061
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And then you can always go back

1062
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Cause the figures work up through the series

1063
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So if you have an old figure

1064
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You can always bring it into the new game

1065
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Find an old figure

1066
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Remember we were at that place you hate yesterday

1067
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And they had like the triple packs

1068
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They had ones that were on sale for like

1069
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
10 bucks so that was 3 characters

1070
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
From an older game that you could use in the new one

1071
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
For 10 bucks

1072
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But they don't level up power wise up to the same as the newer characters

1073
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
That's true but who

1074
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Like I think that falls along the same lines

1075
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
With the people that collect all of them

1076
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I like that little air bird I was playing as

1077
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I know that was one of the newer characters

1078
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I just need him

1079
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Yeah free ranger

1080
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It just depends

1081
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Having played Disney Infinity is just as bad

1082
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
They do advertise the same thing

1083
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And a lot of times you have to have a full set of characters

1084
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
In order to be able to unlock

1085
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Like stupid things

1086
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh yeah and the blind packs are fucking terrible

1087
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I bought a lot of those

1088
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But yeah it was

1089
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
It was not worth it

1090
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But the blind pack thing is not so bad

1091
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Those are really only for the toy box stuff

1092
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And you don't really need them

1093
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Now let me say this

1094
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
The one thing I didn't say about Skylanders

1095
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is the figures themselves

1096
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I have to admit

1097
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm going to call something out when it's bad

1098
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But I'm going to call something out when it's good

1099
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I've got to admit

1100
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Those figures like the 12 year old boy and me

1101
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Really love the figures that light up

1102
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
When you put them on the portal

1103
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
They're more expensive

1104
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Well whatever they're cool

1105
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
When you put them on the thing

1106
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Like the one guy with his little jewel

1107
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The prism

1108
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Is that it?

1109
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
His little arms light up and I was like

1110
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That's fucking cool

1111
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That's fucking magic man

1112
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I was like that's cool

1113
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And do they change the portal

1114
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The only time you're going to see it light up

1115
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Is when you're playing the game

1116
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
The prism dude

1117
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The only time you see him

1118
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Is when he's on the portal right

1119
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
When it lights up

1120
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Or is there other ways to get him to light up

1121
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Not when you're playing the game

1122
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
No no that's the only way

1123
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But it's also like those light core ones

1124
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
In the game they light up more than the regular ones

1125
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Like you could get a regular one

1126
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And a light core one

1127
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And the light core one will play slightly differently

1128
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Because it's a light core one

1129
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Which is neat

1130
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So the bottom line on Skylanders for me

1131
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Is it's not awful

1132
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
It's not even bad

1133
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's a decent platformer

1134
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's a fine platformer

1135
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
But know what you're getting into with this crap

1136
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And don't feel OCD about it

1137
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And realize that there really isn't that much

1138
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Behind all those doors

1139
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And there's a great resale market too

1140
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah I mean can you tell the story about that one figure

1141
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah I have one that I

1142
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Picked up while I was working one time

1143
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And I knew that it was rare

1144
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's just an ugly variant of a figure

1145
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's not painted right

1146
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It's stoned

1147
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It looks like granite

1148
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And that's a legit

1149
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Variant that they put out in packs sometimes

1150
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And that thing

1151
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Can sell up to according to what I saw

1152
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
$750 unopened

1153
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Which is how I have it

1154
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Yeah that's because of those OCD people

1155
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Like oh I've got to get every single variant

1156
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Like your ex right?

1157
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yeah exactly

1158
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And he didn't get that one

1159
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
There's like one that they did

1160
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
For the holidays for Activision

1161
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Blizzard employees too

1162
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I mean I thought it looked pretty cool

1163
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And I know that one sells for a lot also

1164
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And that was the only way you could get it was if you were an employee at that party

1165
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And Bobby says he got one at E3

1166
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That apparently is an early good seller too

1167
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So yeah

1168
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Alright so anyway there you go

1169
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
That's Skylanders

1170
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Not as horrible as some people think

1171
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But yes it's a cheap cash grab

1172
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Be very careful

1173
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Just wait for your kids

1174
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm really surprised they have it

1175
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Well there was the

1176
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Rumble blast

1177
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That wasn't done

1178
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They didn't execute that well at all

1179
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
No

1180
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The figures were like

1181
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
An inch tall

1182
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
They were really crappy figures

1183
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't know what the hell they were thinking

1184
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
They didn't do it right

1185
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
If they were to do it right

1186
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm trying to get 718

1187
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
In a stupid game right now

1188
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's so futile they release a new game every year

1189
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And then it's just you know you have more

1190
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Pokemon you gotta you know

1191
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah but at least now they have that bank feature

1192
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
In this game where I can put all these guys into

1193
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
The Pokemon bank and when the new game comes out

1194
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I can bring them back in so I never have to

1195
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Find them again

1196
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Hope that save doesn't corrupt

1197
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh don't say that

1198
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They all go to the cloud

1199
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
All my Pokemon are in the cloud

1200
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
As long as the cloud doesn't burst

1201
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Or you get hacked

1202
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Chinese or Russian hackers take all your Pokemon

1203
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
They took my Pokemon

1204
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I would declare war on that over country

1205
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Alright

1206
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Other games I played this week

1207
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I played a demo for a game called Child of Light

1208
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's brand new

1209
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I did that one too I forgot about that one

1210
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You played it? I did the demo

1211
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
You turned it off after like 5 minutes

1212
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I liked it I actually liked it quite a bit

1213
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
The thing I liked about it a lot

1214
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Is that it did a lot of

1215
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Different stuff I don't see in RPGs

1216
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Very often like you know a lot of RPGs

1217
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Kind of the same

1218
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Same thing over and over

1219
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But Child of Light did some really neat stuff where

1220
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
The right stick controls this

1221
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Extra little monster that can float around

1222
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
The battle, well I say monster but it's really an ally

1223
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But this extra little fairy or whatever

1224
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They can float around the battlefield and like

1225
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Freeze monsters or

1226
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Heal your people

1227
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I thought that was like a really neat mechanic

1228
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It was a really stupidly simple thing but

1229
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I can't think of another RPG I've seen that in

1230
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Which I really liked that

1231
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah that was neat but

1232
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The gameplay like the actual

1233
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Combat system I thought was crap

1234
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Well it's very basic RPG

1235
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You know either you like it or you don't

1236
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
They really should have just made it a platforming game

1237
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Everything else about the game was great I can't deny that

1238
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It's a really gorgeous game Music is great

1239
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Music is great and

1240
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Everything rhymes which is interesting

1241
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Just a little way to do it but

1242
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Yeah and that's cool but

1243
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It's a decent combat system if you're gonna do that

1244
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
See now here's what I disagree with

1245
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Actdeft in chat says

1246
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Child of Light reminds me of Bravely Default but better

1247
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And by better I mean could

1248
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Wow

1249
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I do not think Child of Light was better than Bravely Default at all

1250
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Bravely Default is amazing and Child of Light

1251
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Is a piece of crap

1252
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
A really pretty sounding and pretty looking piece of crap

1253
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I did not think that rhymes

1254
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I didn't think it was a piece of crap at all but Bravely Default

1255
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Bravely Default on one hand was a very familiar game

1256
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Bravely Default had a very familiar sense about it

1257
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And it did do some new things within that

1258
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
With the whole street passing and some of that stuff that Bravely Default does

1259
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Bravely Default

1260
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Bravely Default was like

1261
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Bravely Default was like

1262
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Bravely Default was like going to see

1263
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Bravely Default was like going to see

1264
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Bravely Default was like going to see

1265
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
A new Harry Potter movie

1266
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That comes out in the series

1267
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Like you know what you're gonna get

1268
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You've read the book already

1269
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
It's kind of the standard stuff

1270
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Whereas Child of Light was different

1271
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
It was more of an art house indie film

1272
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's doing some new things

1273
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You don't necessarily know what to suspect

1274
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
People respond differently to it

1275
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Shane hated it

1276
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Are we saying that Bravely Default would be like Labyrinth

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Whereas Child of Light is like Pan's Labyrinth

1278
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But did you hate Pan's Labyrinth?

1279
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I didn't really care for it

1280
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It was very visually pretty

1281
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Ok then yes

1282
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
That is actually a really good example

1283
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Labyrinth is my favorite movie of all time

1284
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Pan's Labyrinth

1285
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
They're the people that like

1286
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Stupid Child of Light

1287
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And probably Ni No Kuni

1288
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So they're awful people

1289
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Whatever

1290
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
So yeah Child of Light I played that

1291
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I did not actually get the full game yet

1292
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But I probably will to be honest

1293
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Other than that I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I talked about last week

1294
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Shane really enjoys watching me play NES Remix 2

1295
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It's over now though so I'm very sad

1296
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
He says it's over because I beat all the

1297
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Well I didn't beat all the stages

1298
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I will not fucking play Wario's Woods

1299
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I will not

1300
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I tried with Wario's Woods

1301
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
What the fuck is that game seriously?

1302
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And I like puzzlers

1303
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But Wario's Woods has got to be one of the worst

1304
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
ones I've ever played

1305
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I would put that up there with Tetris on the Playstation

1306
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
If you've ever played the Playstation port

1307
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
PS1 port of Tetris

1308
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
It's god awful

1309
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And I would put Wario's Woods up there with that

1310
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It's that bad

1311
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So I refuse to play those stages

1312
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Shane watched me get really frustrated

1313
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
It was so funny

1314
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
The Kirby stages

1315
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Were the worst to me

1316
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Where he had to float up and not get hit

1317
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
By the spikey things

1318
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And it was like 20 minutes of him getting hit by the spikey things

1319
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And I was laughing so hard

1320
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's a bummer you can't

1321
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Live stream that gameplay

1322
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And the whole internet could have had a lull at that

1323
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
But it's so frustrating

1324
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Just remind me seriously

1325
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
To bring my

1326
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Capture thing

1327
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I have a capture thing too

1328
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But it's delayed

1329
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh my god bring it over

1330
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And he can play that stage

1331
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Over and over again

1332
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
What was another one that you sucked at?

1333
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
There were a lot of them

1334
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
ActDeft is screaming at me in chat

1335
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Wario's Woods is awesome

1336
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's different but it's good

1337
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Now I'm talking about Kirby

1338
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I don't dislike Kirby though

1339
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I like Kirby

1340
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I dislike what they did in NES Remix 2

1341
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
But no it was fun

1342
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I gotta say

1343
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Spoiler alert for NES Remix 2

1344
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I don't think this is a big deal

1345
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But the very last stage

1346
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
In the second set of remixes

1347
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The very last stage is

1348
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
You save the princess as the princess

1349
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Meaning you beat Bowser

1350
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
In Mario Brothers 3

1351
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
With Super Mario Brothers 2 princess

1352
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
They showed them the trailer

1353
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Well then it's not that big of a spoiler

1354
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But you know where she does the floaty

1355
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And you can't get hit because if you get hit she dies

1356
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
She's a one hit kill or whatever

1357
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
She's a woman

1358
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Stop it, not cool

1359
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But the frog Mario thing

1360
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Was the same way

1361
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You get hit one hit and they die

1362
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But anyway with the princess you get hit once

1363
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And she dies

1364
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But what's really funny is that when you beat it

1365
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
She goes through the door

1366
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And gets to the castle

1367
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And it's the princess meets the princess

1368
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Sorry but you are in another castle

1369
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Or something like that

1370
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It changes the words

1371
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So that it's an old play on that joke

1372
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm sorry but our princess is in another castle

1373
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But then it's like sorry but you are in another castle

1374
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Ha ha ha just kidding

1375
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And then that's the end of the stage

1376
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
You know what would have been a good remix

1377
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Is something to do with the part in Punch-Out

1378
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Where you're on the bike and your trainer is running after you

1379
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That could have been a fun stage

1380
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
They didn't do enough with Punch-Out in that game

1381
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
They didn't do enough with Punch-Out

1382
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I don't think there was a single remix stage that you just punched out

1383
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
No I think it was like

1384
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You know one of the last remixes

1385
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Where it was like eight different stages

1386
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
The lights went out

1387
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Silly

1388
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
That would be funny to have Punch-Out where he's just

1389
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Punching other things in the air

1390
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Punch the

1391
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Well they did like Mario 2 is in there

1392
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So why couldn't they have put

1393
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Wart in there instead of King Hippo

1394
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So you'd have to punch Wart or something

1395
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That would have been cool

1396
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Punching the eggs from Birdo or something

1397
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah

1398
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Or punching ducks from Duck Hunt

1399
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That would be hilarious

1400
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Go to our chat room

1401
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
As soon as Shane cracked that joke

1402
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Rama's like no Jamie tonight

1403
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Where's Dark Soccer to smack him into place

1404
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
No Jamie is off for the night

1405
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
She wouldn't smack me

1406
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
She would give me a look

1407
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And I would say I'm sorry

1408
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Made a huff yes

1409
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And then I've been like let's go play Final Fantasy 14

1410
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Alright

1411
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
She might be listening be careful

1412
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No I just said my apologies

1413
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I know I know

1414
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
He's not serious guys

1415
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Anyhow

1416
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I think that's really all I have for my gaming week

1417
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I mean otherwise Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3

1418
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
All the same stuff I always play

1419
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So yeah

1420
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I will give a cheap plug for my Twitch channel though

1421
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Because ever since I got my new computer

1422
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I've been doing a lot more with it

1423
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And your PS4 you've been doing a lot more with

1424
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And my PS4 yeah I've been streaming on both

1425
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Rob Roberts

1426
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Oh that's something that you should have said

1427
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
When we were doing Skylanders you could not see chat

1428
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And I wonder if that's something to do with the game

1429
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I don't know

1430
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Yeah they updated because the Playstation update

1431
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Changed some things like the Share Factory is really cool

1432
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I gotta say

1433
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
If you haven't checked out Share Factory

1434
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Check it out because it makes movie making really easy

1435
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
That was a great move on Sony's part

1436
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
To really get people to share more of their

1437
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Gameplay footage that's being saved

1438
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's really a powerful little program

1439
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
But they also upgraded the Twitch functionality

1440
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Now I don't like the new layout

1441
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Because they put chat on the side

1442
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So you could I guess see more of it

1443
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Instead of more than two lines

1444
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
You could see a little more

1445
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
But it word wraps

1446
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It doesn't word wrap at all really

1447
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And then in the bottom it's just elapsed time

1448
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I liked it better with the scrolling messages at the bottom

1449
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And the elapsed time

1450
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But you can get rid of those borders completely

1451
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And just have the camera

1452
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
You couldn't do that before

1453
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So that's pretty cool

1454
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That's the one feature I would like to see

1455
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Because in Final Fantasy XIV I could put the camera

1456
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Over the chat box so that

1457
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
The people in my free company

1458
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
When I'm live streaming

1459
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
They don't feel like they have to censor themselves

1460
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Because what's being said is broadcast on the internet

1461
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Or whatever so

1462
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Bobby Blackwolf in the chat says

1463
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm on Raw TV

1464
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
On a new line

1465
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
That's what it looks like when you're chatting on the

1466
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Twitch TV now

1467
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Quick housekeeping

1468
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I don't have a whole lot to add

1469
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I will say follow us on Twitter

1470
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

1471
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Also Facebook, facebook.com slash

1472
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
OrangeLoungeRadio and Google Plus

1473
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio

1474
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I do want to mention a few things with VOG Network

1475
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Again our show tapes live

1476
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
The Voice of the Geeks Network

1477
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That's vognetwork.com

1478
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
If you haven't checked out the new TV reviews section

1479
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
TV reviews by Critical Myth

1480
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I really urge you guys to check it out

1481
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Because the crew over at that show

1482
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Critical Myth has been really diligently every week

1483
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Like they're pushing like 10 to 15

1484
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
New reviews of TV shows to our site

1485
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It's like all this new content, it's great

1486
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
And you can interact with it

1487
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And when you interact with it you might receive some

1488
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Loot and the loot helps you

1489
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Get raffle tickets

1490
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And the raffle tickets

1491
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We do have a raffle, the raffle's been on hiatus

1492
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
For a few months just because you know we fund it

1493
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Completely out of pocket so

1494
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Sometimes we would rather

1495
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Pay to keep the site running than pay for a new raffle

1496
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But we do have a raffle this month and it is

1497
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I believe season 1 of Arrow

1498
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
The new series on the CW on Blu-ray

1499
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So if you want to win that

1500
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You're curious to check it out, you want to win it

1501
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Or maybe you're a fan of Arrow and you just want to get it for free

1502
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Because you don't want to buy it because I don't think it's a cheap Blu-ray

1503
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Go enter the raffle

1504
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And you can get participation points at VOG Network

1505
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Just for listening to this program

1506
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Somewhere in the show you're going to hear

1507
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
If you're listening live you can check in on the site

1508
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
As the show is broadcasting live

1509
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
But if you're listening on the podcast at some point during the show

1510
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You're going to hear that little doodle-a-doo

1511
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
And then it will say to register participation

1512
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
The pass phrase is and then you type in that phrase

1513
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You get your five points and that's five tickets into the raffle

1514
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Really cool stuff

1515
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And that's just a little something we give our

1516
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Fans and participators

1517
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Just to try and increase awareness of the site

1518
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And all the cool things that we have there

1519
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So check that out once again

1520
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
vognetwork.com

1521
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Alright, do remember though

1522
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
The raffle is opt-in

1523
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You have to go say

1524
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Yes, I want to enter the raffle

1525
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You are not entered automatically

1526
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
So you're going to want to check that out at vognetwork.com

1527
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Slash raffle

1528
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
You are not entered automatically

1529
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And I believe this particular contest is US residents only

1530
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I am so sorry to our overseas listeners

1531
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's just that the cost of mailing

1532
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And all that, we can't do everything

1533
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But we do try once in a while to have something

1534
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Digital or something

1535
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
That is much more lightweight

1536
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
That we can send overseas

1537
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
We have done some overseas

1538
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Unbelievable ones

1539
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So I just want to make sure you guys know

1540
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's not that we don't like our overseas listeners

1541
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Because we love them very much

1542
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
But the reality is the cost to include you guys

1543
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Is a lot more

1544
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So check that out, vognetwork.com

1545
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Slash raffle

1546
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Alright, now let's get into some gaming news

1547
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
There's plenty of it

1548
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Despite the fact that we're only a few weeks away from E3

1549
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
There's still lots coming

1550
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
So Loki, start us off

1551
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yes, if you thought that Comcast

1552
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Well, EA is looking to Comcast to sign a deal

1553
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
That would make EA published games available on Comcast

1554
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
This doesn't make it confusing enough

1555
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
X1 television operating system

1556
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yes, there's the X1 Comcast box

1557
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And the Xbox One

1558
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And both now play games

1559
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Wow, confusing

1560
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I guess they're saying that

1561
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
The X1 is an HTML5 based streaming platform

1562
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
And I guess it has

1563
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Now, I thought that was only a DVR

1564
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
But I guess they're saying it's gonna have

1565
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Internet cloud support

1566
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Apps and that kind of stuff

1567
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
But now you'll be able to stream

1568
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Games to it

1569
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
The lineup so far is probably gonna include

1570
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
A new FIFA, Madden, Monopoly

1571
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And Plants vs. Zombies

1572
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So not necessarily like

1573
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Battlefield 4 or anything like that

1574
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But more of kind of a

1575
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Not casual, but just kind of for everybody type stuff

1576
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Of course, they're still figuring out revenue share

1577
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And release date stuff

1578
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
But yeah, so you'll be able to

1579
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Another platform you'll be able to stream games to

1580
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I just think, man, the name of that is just fucking

1581
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
X1 and Xbox One

1582
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And now they both do games

1583
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I wonder if that will cause some legal ruffles

1584
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
But it's Xfinity

1585
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I think Xfinity had the X1

1586
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Before the Xbox One

1587
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Wow, okay, that's gonna be interesting

1588
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Yeah, the newer Comcast boxes

1589
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Are pretty powerful little things

1590
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
They're basically Apple TV type units

1591
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
They're little computer things

1592
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
They're really powerful

1593
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
The old clunker we have

1594
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Was one of the first HD units

1595
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So that's what it does, but that's about it

1596
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And I think it does DVR too

1597
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But we don't pay for it

1598
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I think these do the room to room DVRs

1599
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
And that kind of stuff

1600
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
So they have all that functionality

1601
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But I wouldn't imagine

1602
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Oh yeah, the new ones do everything

1603
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm surprised

1604
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I don't think you're gonna find a Netflix app on this thing

1605
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Or anything like that

1606
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
You might in the future

1607
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
For money, yeah

1608
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
What doesn't have Netflix nowadays?

1609
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Well, I would think though

1610
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Comcast, a pay-per-view content provider

1611
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Would probably be less likely to want to include

1612
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
A service that you can get same content

1613
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
No, Comcast and Netflix are playing nice nice now

1614
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Thanks to Net Neutrality being fucked over

1615
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
Netflix is paying Comcast money

1616
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Which is bull, absolute bull

1617
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
But what can we do right now

1618
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Besides petition our lawmakers

1619
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Which is what people are trying to do

1620
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
And need to do a little more of

1621
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
To push the importance of this issue

1622
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
That we need Net Neutrality

1623
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Or this type of wheeling and dealing

1624
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We're gonna be the losers in it

1625
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And when you guys bitch about

1626
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It costs too much

1627
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Or Comcast sucks because they limit

1628
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
And I can't do it

1629
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Then maybe you should have complained about it before

1630
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
How long until we see someone streaming a game

1631
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
To an Xbox One through an Xbox One

1632
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Well, if we are able to stream games at all anymore

1633
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That aren't, you know, Comcast approved

1634
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Who knows

1635
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Hey, that's why EA's getting into the ground floor of that, right?

1636
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Yeah

1637
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I guess

1638
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
They know evil when they see it

1639
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
So they're attracted to it

1640
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Both, of course, winners of the worst company in America

1641
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yeah, right

1642
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
A few times over

1643
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So, you know, they're in good company

1644
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh boy

1645
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So, alright, you know, I'm all for more games

1646
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Getting out there and everything

1647
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
But this is just kind of one of those things where it's like

1648
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
This is why I need Net Neutrality

1649
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Because I don't want this to be the only way to play games

1650
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
That makes sense

1651
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
So

1652
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Yeah, I

1653
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
This is all still rumor status, though, right?

1654
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Although it's one of those things that seems very plausible

1655
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't think it's rumor status

1656
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I think that they're actually working on it

1657
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
It's just, I don't think it's gonna be that big of a thing

1658
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's just because they're gonna be streaming games

1659
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It doesn't mean a lot of people are gonna take advantage of it

1660
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Because I think people that are gonna play like, you know, Plants vs. Zombies or something

1661
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Aren't probably gonna do it through a cable box

1662
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
They're probably gonna do it on a PC or tablet or whatever

1663
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I think it's just

1664
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's more exposure to those games, I guess

1665
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And, you know, exposure's not terrible

1666
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's just, you know, they have to weigh the cost and benefit, I guess

1667
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

1668
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Rama says, just what we need, a multimedia cable box, pass

1669
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Well, that's kind of already here, I think

1670
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But Rama also says

1671
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I think that was a joke

1672
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
The X1 box was made by Motorola, which is now ARIS

1673
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That sounds like Yaris

1674
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Um, Loki, here's an FAQ

1675
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And links you to something there about more information

1676
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
ARIS won survivor one year

1677
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
No, this one's spelled A-R-R-I-S

1678
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Oh, okay

1679
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Alright

1680
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And let's see, Kaijuto says, Netflix sounds like they want to become a cable network

1681
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And not what people love about it

1682
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I don't know, I mean, I sort of saw the Netflix originals not really wanting to be their own network

1683
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Just so much as, you know, I always thought it was kind of a way to kind of compete with cable

1684
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I think that's, it's just, you know, why do I need to get Netflix

1685
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You know, save contents on TV

1686
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, it's because you can get this other stuff

1687
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You know, they want to, it's like, why do I want to subscribe to HBO

1688
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because there's a show I want to watch on it

1689
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Or there's a couple shows I want to watch on it

1690
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It's not like a ton of

1691
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
I want to see Game of Thrones boobies

1692
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
You know, they have tons of movies on there

1693
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But they're trying to be like, you know, an HBO or Showtime

1694
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And yes, the way they can do that is more boobies, more skinimax

1695
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So that's what they need on Netflix

1696
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They do have the women in prison show

1697
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's not entirely skinimax, but yeah, I understand what you're saying, but

1698
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Alright, well speaking of television and so forth

1699
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
You know what, Netflix isn't the only one that wants to put their own programming out there

1700
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I think you guys remember, Xbox is getting into this

1701
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
We talked at length last week about the whole, they dug up ET in the desert

1702
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That was all for an Xbox original

1703
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Xbox wants to do original television

1704
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Somewhere in between major game releases

1705
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
They're talking about premium television experiences

1706
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And you know, they hired some big TV executives to kind of do all this stuff

1707
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,000
And yeah, they want to do these Xbox originals

1708
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
And things out of the Xbox entertainment studios to hold you over between major game releases

1709
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And see, that's another thing that they're trying to do

1710
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Like this, you know, they want to be an HBO or something

1711
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
So that you would buy their system so you can watch this content

1712
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
I just don't see that happening

1713
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
By the way, they are going to be bringing to the Xbox originals

1714
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The Halo television series

1715
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Every Street United, which is an unscripted, so reality show

1716
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Series of eight 30 minute episodes and a one hour finale

1717
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It's soccer, soccer players

1718
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Bonnaroo, which is the music and arts festival

1719
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
They're doing something with that

1720
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
And then Signal to Noise, Atari Game Over

1721
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
These are a film documentary series

1722
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And Atari Game Over is about the whole stuff in the ground

1723
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And then something called Humans

1724
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Which is produced with UK broadcaster Channel 4

1725
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And it's going to be an hour long eight episode series

1726
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So, hmm

1727
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So yeah, they're going to start cranking these out

1728
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
By the way, they say that everything is fair game for these TV shows

1729
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Talking at a press event in San Francisco

1730
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
The Vice President of Xbox Entertainment Studios, Jordan Levin

1731
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Said that games like Forza Motorsport, Fable, Gears of War

1732
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Not off the table when it comes to making TV shows

1733
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I thought you meant when you said everything is fair game

1734
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I was like, okay, so it's going to have Halo porn and Forza porn

1735
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
No, if they really wanted to make money

1736
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Isn't Forza kind of car porn already?

1737
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, there are a lot of exhaust pipes you can do things with

1738
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
What?

1739
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Gas tanks

1740
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
What?

1741
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I'm just giving them ideas

1742
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You have issues

1743
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
For free, dang it

1744
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
You have issues

1745
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So are you guys going to be turning to your TV to watch

1746
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Or are you turning to your Xbox to watch TV shows pretty soon?

1747
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Let me go get an Xbox

1748
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Oh wait, no, I don't care for an Xbox

1749
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I think they're coming to 360 as well

1750
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I don't have a 360

1751
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Oh, you got rid of it?

1752
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Long time ago, I don't care about Xbox

1753
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
We have to

1754
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Am I going to my Xbox to watch TV shows?

1755
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Maybe if my boxie dies

1756
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And then I'll watch Netflix on it

1757
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But I don't think

1758
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
It's just like that Halo movie

1759
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
The Ford on the Don and stuff

1760
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
They're like, oh, Halo movie

1761
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
But it looks like a sci-fi original movie

1762
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'd be curious about this

1763
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I want to see the documentaries

1764
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Gaming documentaries might be really interesting

1765
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Especially this Atari one

1766
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Even though I gave my thoughts last week

1767
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
About what's the biggest one

1768
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
When it leaks out to YouTube or whatever

1769
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But you were just talking about piracy

1770
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I could do that with the TV shows today too

1771
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
But that's not how you're supposed to do it, Logie

1772
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
But I have a 360

1773
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I can get up to the TV and watch the Atari documentary

1774
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm sure they'll all be on Windows 8 too

1775
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Because they're trying to get people to buy Windows 8

1776
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Yeah, I know all about that

1777
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Let's move on with some more news

1778
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Shane, what do you have for us tonight?

1779
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Since I just said how big a fan of Microsoft I am

1780
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Let's talk about how they are committed

1781
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
To making more interactive programs

1782
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You can't accurately finger quote when you're on the radio

1783
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Interactive programming

1784
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
In the same vein as 1 vs 100

1785
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Like they did on the Xbox 360

1786
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
What's her name?

1787
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
This is ads

1788
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Nancy Tellum, the president of entertainment and digital media

1789
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Said that there is now infrastructure there

1790
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I think it was just Xbox One, right?

1791
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Every time I hear her name I think of Soulja Boy

1792
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Why?

1793
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Because it wasn't one of his songs like you tell him

1794
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Or something like that

1795
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Oh my god

1796
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I don't know

1797
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Please be seated

1798
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Shane

1799
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Anyway, I guess the infrastructure there for the 1 and the 360

1800
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
It's there so they know now how to accurately make these style games

1801
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
They're looking into not remaking 1 vs 100

1802
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
But a game in the similar vein that you can get a lot of people together and have fun

1803
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I never got to play it

1804
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I don't know how much fun it was

1805
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I hear it was great

1806
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I loved it

1807
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
That was like the best thing that ever happened on the 360

1808
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
When they got rid of it I was so pissed

1809
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
If they said 1 vs 100

1810
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And I know they're saying not that specifically

1811
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But if they said for whatever reason 1 vs 100

1812
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Is coming out to the Xbox One

1813
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
And it's going to be out on such and such date

1814
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
And here are the screenshots

1815
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I would go out and buy an Xbox One

1816
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I love the game that much

1817
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And that would push me over the edge

1818
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Because there's already things on Xbox One

1819
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I'm kind of like

1820
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm kind of on the edge

1821
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I know there's some of the stuff coming

1822
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
But I'm not ready to put down the credit card just yet

1823
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But if 1 vs 100 was coming out

1824
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
You know I would

1825
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Didn't they have a poker game that came out that flopped?

1826
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I don't think it flopped

1827
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
It flopped with me

1828
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
It flopped in terms of the same sort of buzz that 1 vs 100

1829
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I think it has its fans

1830
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I know there are people that play it

1831
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
There's also fans of Ni No Kuni

1832
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But I don't think it's necessarily as huge as 1 vs 100 was

1833
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I love the idea of game shows

1834
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
But I don't know what other game shows could they do

1835
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
But then again when we first heard about 1 vs 100

1836
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It was like what are they going to do?

1837
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's going to be a lot of miming stuff

1838
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
So like Wheel of Fortune

1839
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So you have to like spin the wheel

1840
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Or Price is Right

1841
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And you go like this

1842
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Like you're spinning the big wheel

1843
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Price is Right would legit be a lot of fun actually

1844
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
That would be a good one

1845
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Family Feud

1846
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
That could be one

1847
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Survey says

1848
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Press your luck you just go like this

1849
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
However many people said the answer

1850
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Don't they have like a live version of You Don't Know Jack

1851
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah a long time ago they had with Paul Rubens

1852
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It was okay

1853
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Just go back to the old night

1854
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I always fucking bring this up on the show

1855
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Whenever we talk about 1 vs 100

1856
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
This was the highlight in PC gaming for me

1857
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Was when Berkley Systems was around doing stuff like Acrophobia

1858
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Acrophobia I used to play the crap out of that

1859
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Just put Acrophobia on Xbox One

1860
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I would be happy

1861
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I don't think I'd play it now

1862
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
I'd play it now

1863
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Especially if you could still have the After Dark Rooms

1864
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Where every acronym was just like

1865
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Fuck, Cunt, Cock

1866
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Like it's just every dirty word acronym you could think of

1867
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I miss the After Dark Rooms

1868
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
And they had other games too

1869
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Like there was the one where you went up and down the tower

1870
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I don't know that one

1871
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yeah there was other stuff too

1872
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
So there's ideas out there

1873
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Just jack all the old Berkley Systems games

1874
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
They can do it

1875
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Alright

1876
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Anyway

1877
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Let's move on

1878
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Loki what do you have

1879
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Let's go to another company

1880
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Alright

1881
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So

1882
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Nintendo

1883
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Of course

1884
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
They're not doing the stage presentation like they did a couple years ago

1885
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
They're going to be doing a livestream press event

1886
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Or a Nintendo Direct type thing

1887
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
That's scheduled I guess to air on

1888
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Was it 9 AM Pacific Time 12 PM Eastern

1889
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
On June 10th

1890
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And the Nintendo Treehouse will be

1891
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I guess conducting that

1892
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And they're also going to have livestream unscripted game demos

1893
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
From their E3 booth during the show as well

1894
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,000
And I hope to hell they're using multiple providers

1895
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
And not just Ustream

1896
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Because that was the worst part of E3 last year

1897
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Was Ustream's Nintendo Direct was awful

1898
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I thought I did

1899
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Didn't they have YouTube as well

1900
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I think they did later

1901
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah YouTube and then I think now they're using Twitch

1902
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Twitch can handle that crap

1903
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So they need to just use Twitch

1904
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
YouTube I think they also do livestream YouTube at the same time

1905
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Well here's an idea

1906
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Let's check the press release

1907
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Because it might say if they're going to be doing

1908
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Twitch or whatever

1909
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
No

1910
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
It might be too early for those specifics

1911
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
They did say though

1912
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
One of the things that was kind of a little teaser video

1913
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Is that they're going to be doing this Super Smash Brothers thing

1914
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
At Best Buy

1915
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Remember like last year you could test out stuff from Best Buy

1916
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
You know play different games and things

1917
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
For the Wii U

1918
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Well now they're going to be doing that with Smash Brothers U

1919
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Or Smash Brothers for the Wii U

1920
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
At certain Best Buys

1921
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So you can check that out as well

1922
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And they go along with that

1923
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
They're going to be hosting a tournament at E3 for Smash Brothers

1924
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
So

1925
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I wonder how much of the final roster

1926
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Will get for Smash Brothers by E3

1927
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Because the 3DS one comes out this summer

1928
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Whenever that time period really is

1929
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So the rosters are supposed to be the same

1930
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So

1931
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I would imagine the final roster

1932
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Is out at E3

1933
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
If the game is coming out in the summer

1934
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Final roster at E3 with maybe one or two surprises

1935
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Probably not hidden characters if there are any

1936
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah

1937
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So

1938
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I think that's

1939
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
That's what you expect at E3 I think

1940
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Interesting they're putting so much focus on Smash Brothers

1941
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's their big game

1942
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Mario Kart 8 is out at that point

1943
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I'm wondering if Zelda is not coming out this year

1944
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Because of the lack of focus so far

1945
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Because of the fact that they pushed Smash Brothers to fall

1946
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'm wondering if Zelda is coming out this year

1947
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I'm wondering if Zelda is coming out this year

1948
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Because they're expecting Smash Brothers to fall

1949
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I'm wondering if that was the original

1950
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm wondering if they were expecting

1951
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Smash Brothers to be released in the summer

1952
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And have Zelda for quarter 4

1953
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I don't think

1954
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Zelda was ever going to be this year

1955
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Or do you think maybe because those are

1956
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Two separate genres that they might not really care

1957
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
They could still release both because they did that

1958
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
With Wind Waker and the new Mario

1959
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I think Zelda's

1960
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Holiday 2015 people

1961
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I think you guys are being way too optimistic

1962
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
About how fast they're going to crank that out

1963
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Zelda's Holiday 2015

1964
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm sure they'll put out Bayonetta 2

1965
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I was going to say

1966
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
That's the other big thing they've been talking about

1967
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
That's not going to sell systems I'm sorry

1968
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It won't

1969
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I love the game but I would not buy a Wii U

1970
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
For that game

1971
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
But will you buy the game if you already have a Wii U?

1972
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
No

1973
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Well I bet a lot of people disagree with you and will

1974
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I'll buy it

1975
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And I think Nintendo needs to not just sell systems

1976
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
They need to be able to sell games

1977
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
And especially a game that wasn't

1978
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Necessarily made in house by Nintendo

1979
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I mean kinda, sorta

1980
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well they also have their Dicey Warriors

1981
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Zelda game too that's supposed to be coming out

1982
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
At some point, that'll probably be summer as well

1983
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I don't know, we'll see

1984
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
But yeah, so

1985
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Invitational tournament that's going to run

1986
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
From June 10th through 12th

1987
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
During E3

1988
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Alright well we mentioned there

1989
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
That before E3 happens Mario Kart 8

1990
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Will be happening and a big

1991
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Nintendo Direct came out this week that

1992
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Talked pretty much all about what we can

1993
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Expect with the launch including a $330

1994
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Wii U bundle that will

1995
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Come with Mario Kart 8

1996
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It will have the 32 gig

1997
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Black Wii U and a red

1998
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Wii U wheel and a Mario Wii remote plus

1999
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
As we mentioned a little bit about

2000
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Earlier in the show

2001
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Here's the part that I don't think anybody was expecting

2002
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
All copies of Mario

2003
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Kart 8, this is how big this game is

2004
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
To Nintendo and they want to make sure it succeeds

2005
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
No matter what they have to do

2006
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And this is huge

2007
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
All copies of Mario Kart 8

2008
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Come with a free download code

2009
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
For one of four Wii U

2010
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Games, if you register the game

2011
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
On Club Nintendo before July 31st

2012
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Which anybody with an internet's gonna do

2013
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
You're gonna get a code for a

2014
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Free copy of New Super Mario Brothers U

2015
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Wind Waker HD

2016
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Peekman 3

2017
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Or Wii Party U

2018
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Here's a pro tip

2019
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Don't pick Wii Party U

2020
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It's not a bad game

2021
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
But like the

2022
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Box one comes with a little attachment

2023
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
For your controller that makes it a lot more fun

2024
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
To play

2025
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Well I think a lot of Nintendo fans I know

2026
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Already own the other three

2027
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Even I already own New Super Mario Brothers U

2028
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
So I'm probably gonna do Wind Waker

2029
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Just because Peekman doesn't

2030
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I've never really been super interested in that game

2031
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Sorry I know some people are really into it

2032
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Even though

2033
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
But in Europe by the way

2034
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
They have more choices

2035
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I don't know why they got more but they did

2036
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because in Europe you can get Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate

2037
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Nintendo Land, Wonderful 101

2038
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Sonic Lost World

2039
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Which would have been the one I would get if I could get it here

2040
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Mario and Sonic the Olympic Winter Games

2041
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And Game and Wario

2042
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
All those extra ones in Europe

2043
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
In addition to?

2044
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
It's like ten choices in Europe

2045
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That was Game and Wario

2046
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
It's a really decent game

2047
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
But it won't last you very long

2048
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Like most WarioWare games

2049
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Multiplayer information coming out of the Direct

2050
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Twelve people can play at once

2051
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Voice chat will be available

2052
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Good job Nintendo

2053
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You did it!

2054
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
You did it!

2055
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Finally!

2056
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
You can choose from four modes

2057
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Worldwide, Regional, Friends, and Tournament

2058
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Does that mean voice chat

2059
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Is going to be in the public matches?

2060
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I could have sworn

2061
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Hey Nintendo!

2062
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Like I watched that Direct

2063
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I thought the voice chat was really only for lobby stuff

2064
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I don't think it was for

2065
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
When you're actually racing

2066
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
It doesn't matter even if it's just lobby

2067
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Oh my gosh

2068
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I really hope you can mute people

2069
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Also some new items revealed

2070
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
The Super Horn

2071
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And the Crazy Eight

2072
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Which will whirl eight different items that you unleash

2073
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Awesome, it's protection against blue shells

2074
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
You're right

2075
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
That is pretty cool

2076
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I think you could just make them as rare as they were in Mario Kart 64

2077
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Also

2078
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Last but not least

2079
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
More characters announced

2080
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Baby Rosalina will be a character as well

2081
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
And

2082
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Pink Gold Peach

2083
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
What the fuck is a Pink Gold Peach?

2084
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I've heard of rose gold

2085
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Pink Gold Peach

2086
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
I can't help

2087
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
But I can't help but think of that scene

2088
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
From Project Runway

2089
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Where she's like

2090
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm going to use this blood orange

2091
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And it cuts to the scene of the guy going

2092
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
She's so pretentious, that blood orange

2093
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Shut up, it's fucking red

2094
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I can't help but think of that

2095
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
When we talk about Pink Gold Peach

2096
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Which in reality

2097
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Pink Gold Peach is like

2098
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Metal Mario

2099
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
But instead of metal peach, it's Pink Gold Peach

2100
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
It's the heavyweight peach

2101
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
It's terrible is what it is

2102
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
All these baby characters

2103
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
And all this metal Mario

2104
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Metal Mario is not a fucking character

2105
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It's a texture swap

2106
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It's not a fucking new character

2107
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Come on

2108
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Branch out a little bit

2109
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Yes, I understand it's called Mario Kart

2110
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
But throw in a Zelda level

2111
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
And have two Link or something like that

2112
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I was a little pissed there's no Birdo

2113
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It looks like Birdo got cut

2114
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Or Birdo

2115
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Fuck, there's a ton of different things

2116
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I would have much rather had Birdo than

2117
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Blood Orange Peach

2118
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
They should have gone back and picked random enemies

2119
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Mouser would have been cool

2120
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I do love the fact

2121
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
They put all the Koopa kids in there

2122
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
But it makes it hard for me to pick between

2123
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Lemmy, Larry or Toad

2124
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
What about a Goomba?

2125
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
What about a Goomba, why not?

2126
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
They have no arms

2127
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
How are they supposed to drive?

2128
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
They could use their feet but then what's pushing

2129
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
The gas pedal

2130
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Is it two Goombas?

2131
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Nope, it's tank style

2132
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Despite all this crap we're giving it

2133
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I am so there and I am so playing

2134
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Wendy O Koopa

2135
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
On fucking Toad's Highway

2136
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
The day this thing comes out

2137
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Oh, and thank you

2138
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
For mentioning Toad's Highway

2139
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Because I would like to say

2140
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
While Nintendo has done all this fantastic shit

2141
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Making the game look awesome

2142
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And they brought back Battle Mode

2143
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
What the fuck did they do to Battle Mode?

2144
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Hey guys, you know

2145
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
We could totally take all these really kick ass

2146
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Battle Mode tracks that we had

2147
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But no, instead we're gonna take

2148
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Just the regular tracks

2149
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
They're all fucking loops that they slightly tweaked

2150
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
And that's what they are

2151
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
That you play Battle Mode on a fucking track

2152
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Because god forbid

2153
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
It would be so damn hard to

2154
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Bring Block Fortress in or something

2155
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm gonna take a wait and see approach

2156
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I'm gonna take a wait and see approach

2157
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm not ready to get low key

2158
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
No, it's just

2159
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
They don't get it, they tried the same shit with

2160
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Like, what is it?

2161
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It was either Double Dash or

2162
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
The 3DS one

2163
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
We don't talk about Double Dash

2164
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Rama in chat says

2165
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Calling it now, DLC for older tracks

2166
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
With all due respect Rama

2167
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I think everybody is calling that

2168
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
This is such an obvious extension

2169
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
There are some tracks I would pay for

2170
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Half the tracks in the game are older tracks

2171
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
But that's not out of character

2172
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
For a Mario Kart game

2173
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Besides, of course, the first one

2174
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Yeah, it's not out of character

2175
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It is out of character though

2176
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
To completely ignore any regular

2177
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Battle Mode track for Battle Mode

2178
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
That makes no sense

2179
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
That's the DLC

2180
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
That's stupid

2181
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Hey, we broke this on purpose

2182
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
So that we can fix it with paid content

2183
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
That's dumb

2184
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
They said they needed more third party ideas

2185
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Make the model a fucking Battle Mode track

2186
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Calm down

2187
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Mario Kart 8 is gonna

2188
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Be the bomb and you know it

2189
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Stop it

2190
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Like two hours tops

2191
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
To do all four of them

2192
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Have a seat

2193
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I also wanted to say

2194
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
That means 30 characters playable

2195
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Also, you can play as your Mii

2196
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Which is all you're ever gonna see online, probably

2197
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I just really hope they change the Mii voices

2198
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Cause

2199
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Like the voices

2200
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Those Miis have is scary

2201
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Maybe they'll just have you

2202
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
They should have you record

2203
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Only with friends

2204
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
But

2205
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
I fully

2206
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I still hope

2207
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Like they did with Mario Kart Wii

2208
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And I don't remember if they did with the 3DS version

2209
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
But I hope they actually have your Miis in the background

2210
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Love this idea from Tigerclaw

2211
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And I think even Loki has to like this one

2212
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Tigerclaw says, what if they do

2213
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
DLC tracks based on other games

2214
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
You remember how Sonic Lost World

2215
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Had levels based on some classic Nintendo games

2216
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
What if Nintendo made a deal and made

2217
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
DLC tracks based on Sonic

2218
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
So, what if somebody

2219
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Got your Sonic Mega All-Stars

2220
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Racing courses in my Mario Kart 8

2221
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
No

2222
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
How about a Bayonetta 2 course

2223
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Come on

2224
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Come on, Loki

2225
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
What would that be? I mean, driving up the hair

2226
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
No, you'd just basically drive into her vagina

2227
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
That's a Bayonetta 2

2228
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I was trying to hint at that, but you know, whatever

2229
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
That's fine

2230
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Just go for the direct approach

2231
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
On a serious thought, you're driving around

2232
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
These mountains that are just her boobs

2233
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
On a serious note

2234
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
What about like a Hyrule level

2235
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
You laugh at that, but actually one time I did have a concept

2236
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
For a kart racing game, and that was gonna be

2237
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
You know, that was gonna be my level

2238
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Battle of Ariola Mountain

2239
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's gonna be all bacon

2240
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And fucking giant breasts

2241
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Like, bounce on like those

2242
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
You know, mushrooms and shit

2243
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
What was the name of the game, Bacon and Boobs?

2244
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Oh, it was VoG Kart Racing, of course

2245
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Did you run that by Bobby?

2246
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
No, I didn't, I don't really care

2247
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
This was a long time ago

2248
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Ah, the ideas

2249
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I had for that

2250
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Alright, now what about like

2251
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
A Hyrule level

2252
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Like, that would be rad

2253
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
What did they just say a second ago?

2254
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Yeah, it'd be awesome if they had a Zelda level and

2255
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Finally, that was

2256
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Either here or there

2257
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Alright, moving on, Shane

2258
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
We gotta keep it moving, we're like at an hour twenty

2259
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And we're not even halfway through the show

2260
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Okay, well

2261
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
There are some Mega Man games headed to Virtual Console

2262
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Thanks to the votes of fans

2263
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Capcom posted a poll

2264
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Asking

2265
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
When you want to see

2266
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Select Mega Man games show up on the Virtual Console

2267
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
That poll is over

2268
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
How'd Mega Man Legends 3 do?

2269
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It got first place

2270
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I'm glad that Capcom's listening to

2271
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
User feedback now

2272
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
But you know

2273
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Back when we wanted a new Mega Man game

2274
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Well, fuck you guys, we know better

2275
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
That's awesome

2276
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Thanks, Capcom

2277
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Sorry, Shane

2278
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Anyway, so

2279
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
The votes are in

2280
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Capcom has announced the schedule

2281
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
For release

2282
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
On the week of May 1st

2283
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Which has already happened

2284
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Mega Man Xtreme will be available

2285
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
The following week

2286
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
5-8

2287
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Both Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 will be available

2288
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Week of the 15th

2289
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Mega Man 4

2290
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Week of the 22nd

2291
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Mega Man 5

2292
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
And then the week of the 29th

2293
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Mega Man Xtreme 2

2294
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Now, these are for

2295
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I believe the 3DS Virtual Console

2296
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Yeah, they are

2297
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
The Game Boy versions

2298
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
The end

2299
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
The games were all coming anyway

2300
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
That vote meant nothing

2301
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
All it was was the order that you wanted them in

2302
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Which it looks pretty much like

2303
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Numerical order is what we went with

2304
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Apparently

2305
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
There you go

2306
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Oh my gosh

2307
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Some people in chat

2308
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Capcom needs to lose that IP

2309
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I don't think they're letting go of it that easy

2310
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Well, let's travel around the world

2311
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
That are coming out a little sooner than Mega Man Legends 3

2312
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Loki, US

2313
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yes, well this week

2314
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
There's a few things coming out

2315
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Starting off with Bound by Flame

2316
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Which is actually coming out on

2317
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

2318
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And on PS4

2319
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Sorry, Xbox One

2320
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
You don't get that game

2321
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It looks pretty cool though

2322
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
The PlayStation 4 version of

2323
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
MLB 14, the show

2324
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Will be making it out this week as well

2325
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Today, actually we had a couple

2326
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
3DS games

2327
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
There was Mario Golf

2328
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
World Tour

2329
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
So that came out on 3DS and

2330
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Kirby Triple Deluxe

2331
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Let's see

2332
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
What else was coming out later this week here

2333
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
We also have

2334
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
There's so much stuff

2335
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Smooth dates

2336
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Hakuoki Stories of the Shinsu

2337
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Goomy on PlayStation 3

2338
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
If you like your visual novel games

2339
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
For the Vita, God of War

2340
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Collection

2341
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
That's coming out on the Vita

2342
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Also the amazing

2343
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Spider-Man 2 which kind of got delayed

2344
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
A little bit

2345
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
That's coming out on Xbox One

2346
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And this is pretty sweet

2347
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Borderlands 2

2348
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Going to be coming out

2349
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Later this week

2350
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Actually, that might be next week

2351
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
13th, is that a Friday?

2352
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
13th is a Tuesday

2353
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I'm sorry, that's the following week

2354
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
It was originally supposed to come out this week

2355
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Anyways, that's it

2356
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Alright, well moving to Japanese

2357
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Release dates, there is nothing on the schedule

2358
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
For this week, literally nothing

2359
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It probably has to do with Golden Week going on right now in Japan

2360
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
So there is nothing

2361
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Sales, I need to take advantage of still on PlayStation

2362
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
There are the sales stuff

2363
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And some other little tie-ins like that

2364
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
But as far as official releases go, nothing this week in Japan

2365
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
How about the UK?

2366
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
The UK has a few games

2367
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Starting with May 7th

2368
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You get Peggle 2 on

2369
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Xbox 360

2370
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Titan Attacks on PS4, Vita

2371
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
And PS3

2372
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
On May 8th, Age of Mythology's

2373
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Extended Edition for PC

2374
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And the God of War collection on Vita

2375
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
May 9th brings Bound by Flame

2376
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
For PS3, PC

2377
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
PlayStation 4

2378
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
And Xbox 360

2379
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And then last on here, and I don't think this is right anymore

2380
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But Killer is Dead on PC

2381
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Didn't that get pushed back by a couple weeks?

2382
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I believe, everywhere

2383
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah, I want to see, I just saw

2384
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I think it was my birthday, I think

2385
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
On the 23rd, so Killer is Dead

2386
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
On my birthday

2387
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Well maybe you can get Killer is Dead for free

2388
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
No, I don't even know what that is, I don't want it

2389
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Killer is Dead is the, I can't remember the guy's name

2390
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's the guy that does the new Killer 7

2391
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And No More Heroes and stuff like that

2392
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
It was there, they came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

2393
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I think about a year ago

2394
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Last August, I want to say

2395
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Kajudo in chat says

2396
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Japan has stopped making games

2397
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
No, that's not what happened

2398
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I will say this, May 15th, it's going to pick up again

2399
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And I'll tell you what, guess what's coming out on May 15th

2400
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
A new Idolmaster game in Japan

2401
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So those are huge

2402
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah, we should be getting a new

2403
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Not Idolmaster, but

2404
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Hatsune Miku? Yeah, maybe this year

2405
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Hatsune Miku is opening for Lady Gaga, did we talk about that on the show?

2406
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
That is some crazy shit

2407
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Lady Gaga is having Hatsune Miku

2408
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yes, the video game character

2409
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Well, it's more than a video game character in Japan

2410
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
But with the holograms and shit

2411
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Is actually opening for the art pop

2412
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Whatever they're calling it in select cities

2413
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I don't think on this coast, but on the east coast

2414
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Hatsune Miku is opening for Lady Gaga

2415
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I feel like that would be this coast

2416
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Not the east coast

2417
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
You would think, right?

2418
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
You would think that she could just call herself Gem

2419
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And she could have the hologram

2420
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys

2421
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And then the classic game of the week

2422
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Which, look out guys

2423
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Because Shane's filling in for Jamie tonight

2424
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Guess who I picked for the classic game of the week

2425
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
But I'm going to tell you what, Loki, I already know

2426
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Is going to love this pick

2427
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Let's get to those other

2428
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I will tell my first pick before we go with that

2429
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Okay, well let's get these other stories out of the way real quick

2430
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
This was actually kind of a surprise

2431
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I mean, I knew that they were teasing that they're going to have

2432
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Marvel Super Heroes as part of the new

2433
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Disney Infinity, but I just figured

2434
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Hey, it's going to be another pack

2435
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Or something like that, it's not necessarily

2436
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Going to be the whole game, but guess what

2437
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Disney Infinity 2.0, Marvel Super Heroes

2438
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Is going to be announced

2439
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Or it was announced

2440
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
And it is full of Marvel Super Heroes

2441
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So, yeah, it's going to be pretty sweet

2442
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Launching with the game

2443
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
They said it's going to be Iron Man

2444
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Thor and Black Widow, but along with that

2445
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Hulk, Captain America

2446
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And Hawkeye will also be

2447
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Launching alongside it

2448
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
And of course

2449
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
With it, they're saying that, you know

2450
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
You can have higher levels in your characters

2451
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
New skill trees

2452
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Also, the toy box mode is coming back

2453
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And all the old characters will be supported by it

2454
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
So you'll be able to play as the old characters

2455
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
In toy box mode only

2456
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
And they kind of

2457
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Showed some more

2458
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Well, they showed some other things

2459
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
They have the Avengers characters in there

2460
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
They've got Spider-Man

2461
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
They showed off a lot of different

2462
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
The characters from

2463
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Guardians of the Galaxy

2464
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Are going to be in there, so obviously

2465
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
They'll have that toy box come out

2466
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Maybe when the movie comes out or something

2467
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Although that's a summer movie, I want to say

2468
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
It's interesting to see these worlds

2469
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Coming together, though

2470
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We know what Disney Infinity 3.0 is then

2471
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yeah, right, with the Star Wars, absolutely

2472
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Or maybe it's 3PO

2473
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Oh, God

2474
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You just wrote their entire

2475
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Advertising campaign

2476
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Patent pending, quick

2477
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
It's not surprising

2478
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Infinity 3.0 is going to be Star Wars stuff

2479
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'll be pretty

2480
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Exciting, too

2481
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
There's some

2482
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Characters that were in the

2483
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Trailer as well

2484
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Stitch, although that could have been

2485
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Maybe a different playable character

2486
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Or not necessarily

2487
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Merida

2488
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Maleficent

2489
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Nick Fury

2490
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Loki

2491
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's not only Avengers

2492
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Some of the newer

2493
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
The chick from Brave and the

2494
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Frozen characters

2495
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
The Frozen characters were from

2496
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
The last pack that came out

2497
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Frozen characters are already out

2498
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
But they're only in the toy box mode

2499
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It's kind of lame

2500
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Is Brave out, too?

2501
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
No, no

2502
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
They have

2503
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
What's-her-name from Tangled

2504
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Rapunzel

2505
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Miss Tangled?

2506
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah, from Tangled

2507
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And then they have

2508
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Green Goblin, MODOK

2509
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And they showed off

2510
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Rocket Raccoon and Groot

2511
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Kind of mimicking the scene that they had in the trailer

2512
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Well, I can see where Marvel nerds are going to be really happy about this

2513
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I don't know how I feel about the whole

2514
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Old characters only work in toy locks mode

2515
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Let's put it this way

2516
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I think what the problem was before is with Disney Infinity

2517
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
It kind of skewed too much

2518
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Too young, maybe

2519
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And so now that they've got all this Marvel stuff

2520
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
They're trying to capitalize on

2521
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Skylanders, young boys

2522
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And honestly

2523
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I think they've got a stronger license

2524
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Because people that are just getting into it

2525
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Who the fuck are the Skylanders?

2526
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I know who the Avengers are

2527
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I don't know who the fuck the Skylanders are

2528
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Well, Skylanders is getting more and more

2529
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
They've been around for a few years now

2530
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
So I think it's getting more and more out there

2531
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I understand that, but I'm just saying

2532
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Marvel's been around a lot longer than

2533
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Skylanders

2534
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I think that they stand a little bit better of a chance

2535
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
But I'll be interested to see

2536
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
It's supposed to be coming out in September

2537
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And on this also

2538
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
There are going to be

2539
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Last Gen and

2540
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

2541
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So you can step up

2542
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
To the PlayStation 4 with this cycle

2543
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Yes

2544
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Moving on to one other story here

2545
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We're about to get into the Classic Game of the Week

2546
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
So it's appropriate that I talk about some free classic games

2547
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That are available

2548
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And they're actually coming from Blizzard

2549
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Now you may or may not know, over at Battle.net

2550
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
If you have an account over there, you can download

2551
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Blackthorn for free, that's one of their old games

2552
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
From the Super Nintendo days

2553
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
That's been out for a while

2554
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Well, Blizzard decided to add a little more to that

2555
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
By putting out some of the other classic Blizzard games

2556
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I think this goes all the way back to when they were

2557
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
A different named company

2558
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
The Lost Vikings

2559
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
There's actually some Lost Vikings

2560
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Jokes in World of Warcraft

2561
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
You actually see them in one of the dungeons

2562
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So the Lost Vikings, you can actually now play that

2563
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Free via Battle.net

2564
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
You can go download it, it's completely legal and all that stuff

2565
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
You play it through Battle.net, it's pretty cool

2566
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Also available, Rock and Roll Racing

2567
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Although they say that Rock and Roll Racing

2568
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Might actually be just the demo

2569
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Because there's only three songs

2570
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Available in Rock and Roll Racing

2571
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
There's some issues with the licensing

2572
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
That game was awesome

2573
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Rock and Roll Racing had all these

2574
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Actual Rock and Roll songs

2575
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
They fear the licensing may have screwed that up

2576
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Because they say, the reports are

2577
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
That if you download the game

2578
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
It's really only the three tracks from the demo

2579
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Put new music in there

2580
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Yeah, you would think, or something

2581
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
But yeah, unfortunately

2582
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
So Rock and Roll Racing has hobbled a little bit

2583
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
But you still can get that for free

2584
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And Lost Vikings

2585
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Those, again, are available at Battle.net

2586
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Pretty cool way to convince people to go get

2587
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
A Battle.net account

2588
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
To register participation

2589
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2590
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
At vognetwork.com

2591
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Anyways, Squash

2592
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Alright, well speaking of

2593
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Classic games, it's time to take

2594
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
A journey to the past

2595
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
As we open up the gaming vault

2596
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
And step in and find a game

2597
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
That we think, hey, you should

2598
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Check out this classic game this week

2599
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Now usually Dark Sakura dives into the vault

2600
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
And finds a game for y'all

2601
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
But with Shane filling in tonight, we thought

2602
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Alright, let's let our guests have the honor

2603
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Of selecting the classic game of the week

2604
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
What were the rules that Jamie set?

2605
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
You said it was ten years old

2606
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
That's what she said, she wanted to do Kingdom Hearts

2607
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
At one point, I think

2608
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
So it has to be ten years or older

2609
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
So Shane, you stepped into the vault

2610
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And what game did you find for us tonight?

2611
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Well, first I found Power Rangers the movie The Game

2612
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And I was like, I love that game

2613
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I should talk about that

2614
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
But then, I had a much more

2615
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Better idea to pick

2616
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And I picked Final Fantasy XI

2617
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
So

2618
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
This game is amazing

2619
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Final Fantasy XI meets this criteria

2620
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Because it came out

2621
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Actually on PC in America

2622
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
In 2003

2623
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
So we are well past that

2624
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Final Fantasy XI is

2625
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Square's online entry

2626
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Their first online entry into the Final Fantasy

2627
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
For the Final Fantasy series

2628
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Oh my god, I'm sorry

2629
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
This music brings back so many memories for me

2630
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I remember when this game came out

2631
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I was living with

2632
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Because this show was on

2633
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I was living with Loki

2634
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I stayed home from work the day this came out

2635
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I requested that day off from work to get the game

2636
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I remember I was the first one on the server

2637
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
And I had to get everybody else

2638
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
You kept deleting and re-rolling until you got it

2639
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Yeah, we had to get the world pass

2640
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I got world passes for everybody

2641
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
I had to go out and kill a million sprouts

2642
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Or whatever to go get the stupid passes

2643
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I'm going to actually switch to

2644
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Some gameplay noises here

2645
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
From the theme song

2646
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
That theme song takes me back

2647
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So this is a standard

2648
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
MMORPG

2649
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
You fight things

2650
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
You get experience

2651
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
You level up

2652
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
The game, which launched in Japan a little bit before we got it

2653
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Launched with six jobs

2654
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And then when the game came out in America

2655
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
We not only got the original game

2656
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
But we also got the first expansion

2657
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Which added

2658
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Oh my god, so many more jobs

2659
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight

2660
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Nine, ten

2661
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Or eight, what?

2662
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
All the advanced jobs

2663
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Except for, I'm sorry

2664
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The game did launch with the advanced jobs

2665
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Paladin, Dark Knight, Beastmaster, Ranger, Bard

2666
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And Summoner

2667
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
The expansion, which was the base game for us

2668
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Also gave us Samurai Ninja Dragoon

2669
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
And that's it

2670
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
The game had

2671
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Let's see, one, two, three

2672
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Four main expansions

2673
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
It's still going strong

2674
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Had an expansion last year

2675
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
The Seekers of Adulin

2676
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Which added two more jobs

2677
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Bringing to a total of

2678
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I believe twenty-four jobs

2679
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
The President of Square-

2680
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Oh my god, this video is of the Rama fight

2681
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Sorry

2682
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
I just got excited

2683
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
These Primal fights were so hard

2684
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Oh my god

2685
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
We only did them as the solo ones

2686
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
You can get a full party to do them as well

2687
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
But we always did the babier versions

2688
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Where it's just you and carbuncle

2689
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
In 2012, Yoichi Wada

2690
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Announced that Final Fantasy 11

2691
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Had become the most profitable title

2692
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
In the Final Fantasy series

2693
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Probably because of all the monthly fees

2694
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
And the cost for extra characters

2695
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
And stuff like that

2696
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Yeah

2697
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
This game has an amazing story

2698
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
It spans across, you know, the four

2699
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Expansions, the little mini scenario

2700
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Expansions they put out as well

2701
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I couldn't tell you anything about that story either

2702
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
No, it's really good

2703
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I've gone on the wiki and just read

2704
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
The story at times

2705
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
The game has changed

2706
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
So much from when it launched to what it is now

2707
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Used to be everything required a party

2708
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Nowadays

2709
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Everything does not require a party

2710
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
In fact, a party is a hindrance

2711
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Up until the very end of the game

2712
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Which is level 99

2713
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And you can increase your character's

2714
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Skills and stats

2715
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Beyond level 99 too

2716
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Through various means

2717
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
It's awesome

2718
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Yeah, these guys are just duoing the fight

2719
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
That used to take six people

2720
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I recently went back and played this game

2721
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Like two months ago to see

2722
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
What all was different and it's

2723
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Still really fun

2724
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I got to level

2725
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
65 or something like that

2726
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I was fully AF'd as a dancer

2727
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I played this game for fucking three years

2728
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I never got anywhere

2729
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Did I play that last January

2730
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Or was it this January

2731
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I think it was last January

2732
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I bought everything

2733
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Up to the last

2734
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
The very last piece of

2735
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
DLC and the expansion for it

2736
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
It was like

2737
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
It must have been like $8

2738
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
I was like, dude, how can I not

2739
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Play this for another month

2740
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
This was also the game that introduced

2741
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
The hard drive to the PS2

2742
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
That used

2743
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
Or that was used for so many games like

2744
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Resident Evil Outbreak

2745
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
And Resident Evil Outbreak 2

2746
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I think that was probably it

2747
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Oh, EverQuest

2748
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Yeah, EverQuest as well

2749
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Which is another online game

2750
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
But yeah, this game still goes strong

2751
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
The servers are a little bit more dead

2752
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Than they used to be

2753
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Because of Final Fantasy 14

2754
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
A lot of the online Final Fantasy people moved over into that game

2755
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Is what you would think

2756
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
But the people I was playing with

2757
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Were like, we went to 14, we didn't like it

2758
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
We came back to 11

2759
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
I love 14

2760
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I don't need to look back to 11 myself

2761
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I do, because it has so many amazing jobs

2762
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Blue Mage, Dancer

2763
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Geomancer, Rune Fencer

2764
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Puppet Master

2765
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Alright

2766
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Well there it is, your classic game of the week

2767
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Final Fantasy 11

2768
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
It's constantly on sale on Steam

2769
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
If you ever want to just pick it up for a little bit

2770
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
For a month

2771
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
And Xbox 360

2772
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I wish it would go free to play

2773
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Free to play, free to play

2774
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Come on, free to play

2775
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Never

2776
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I still get the emails, newsletters

2777
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Like, come check out what you're missing

2778
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Well, another good thing is that they update the game monthly now

2779
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
So there's always a content patch of some sort every month

2780
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Whether it be job adjustments

2781
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Or quality of life changes

2782
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
It's pretty nice

2783
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Square is pouring a lot into their MMOs

2784
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Meaning that they won't release Dragon Quest X here

2785
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Don't get me started

2786
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I'm about to get started

2787
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Alright

2788
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
A classic near and dear to my heart

2789
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Many years of my life wasted on Final Fantasy 11

2790
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
And soon to be 14

2791
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
And Loki as well

2792
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
And Shane

2793
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Actually, Shane and I probably became better friends

2794
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Because of Final Fantasy 11

2795
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I mean, we knew each other through LiveJournal and stuff

2796
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
We really talked everyday through Final Fantasy 11

2797
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Pretty much, pretty much

2798
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Alright, well there it is

2799
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
A classic game of the week, Final Fantasy 11

2800
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Let us take a break, when we come back

2801
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
We've got the FUGL question of the week

2802
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Rapid fire news to come

2803
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Some shifting and so forth going on at some game companies

2804
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
And email bag

2805
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Participate at orangelandtrady.com

2806
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
A follow up to last week's email

2807
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Did we tell our listener

2808
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
What game they were looking for

2809
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
We're gonna find out

2810
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
They wrote back this week

2811
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
So we will get that follow up coming up next

2812
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
On Orange Lounge Radio after this break

2813
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2814
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Live on this

2815
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
May the 4th of 2014

2816
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
With episode 551 of our show

2817
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
And yes

2818
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
If you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network

2819
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
VoGnetwork.com

2820
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Yes, we got the May the 4th jokes

2821
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Out of the way, I'm sure your Facebook feed already

2822
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Blew up with them earlier today

2823
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
So there you go, done

2824
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
As far as Star Wars and video games goes

2825
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
We must talk about that a little bit

2826
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
We kind of already talked

2827
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
During the last segment about Disney

2828
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Infinity

2829
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
3.0 is most likely gonna be Star Wars

2830
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Bank on it for Disney Infinity 3.0

2831
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Otherwise, anybody played a Star Wars game

2832
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Recently?

2833
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
They don't make them like Super Star Wars

2834
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Star Wars is a crappy IP anyway

2835
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Oh be quiet, that's not true

2836
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I don't like Star Wars

2837
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
I don't like them, the movies are crap

2838
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
The new ones are

2839
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Well all of them that I've seen which are 4, 5, and 6

2840
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
You're wrong, they're not that bad

2841
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But the old republic keeps doing stuff

2842
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
So that's still going

2843
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
There's a Star Wars game

2844
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Yoda and Darth Vader were cool in Soul Calibur 4

2845
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
By the way, if you listen to my little rant

2846
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Last week on Soul Calibur Lost Swords

2847
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I tried

2848
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
I tried again this week, I booted

2849
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I think there was even a comment on VOG

2850
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
But I saw that they fixed it

2851
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
There was an article on a blog site

2852
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
That said they fixed everything

2853
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Nope, it's getting deleted tonight

2854
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I tried, I'd win it one more time

2855
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I brought up the thing and it's still loading, loading, loading, loading, loading, loading

2856
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
I want to see it before you delete it

2857
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
I got to the, well here's the thing

2858
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I get to the menu screen, can't move up or down

2859
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Can't hit the button, can't do anything

2860
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Saya said, I'm out

2861
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I didn't even get into the full game, I said I'm done with this garbage

2862
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
But I tried

2863
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
I tried

2864
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Tigerclaw says

2865
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
You think Shane is going to hate Star Wars Episode 7?

2866
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Yes I do, he will hate Star Wars

2867
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Most likely

2868
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Unless the series gets a decent story

2869
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
And not terrible acting

2870
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Which I don't have high hopes for

2871
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000

01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
That's not true

2874
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Just things that are awful

2875
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
He loves Power Rangers, Pokemon, and

2876
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Skylanders in the color blue

2877
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And Taco Bell and

2878
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Del Taco

2879
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Alright

2880
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Anyhow, let's get into some

2881
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
rapid fire news because there is

2882
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
a lot of other stuff going on in gaming

2883
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Loki

2884
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
So finally

2885
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
After months of wondering

2886
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Where's Drive Club? Isn't that supposed to be out by now?

2887
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
They have

2888
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Made it official that

2889
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Drive Club will be out October 7th

2890
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
In North America, October 8th

2891
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
In Europe

2892
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And of course

2893
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
They had planned for the game to come out early

2894
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
2014

2895
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
But they ran into

2896
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
A problem being able to deliver

2897
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
On their ambitious

2898
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Yeah ambitious promise

2899
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
And apparently

2900
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
The whole issue with it was

2901
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
That they wanted it to be a

2902
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Socially connected game

2903
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And they were having trouble with

2904
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
The social networking part of that

2905
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Wait, their ambitious promise

2906
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Is that the promise of releasing a game?

2907
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Is that the ambitious promise?

2908
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
That is ambitious as far as

2909
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Socially connected

2910
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
We need to make sure that all the connectivity

2911
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
That surrounds the game

2912
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Whether it be joining clubs or sending challenges

2913
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Or even interacting with iOS and Android

2914
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Drive Club apps

2915
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
That had to be slick

2916
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And that had to be absolutely seamless

2917
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And that was one of the areas that we need

2918
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
To put extra time into

2919
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
We were able to polish the cars

2920
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
The tracks and stuff

2921
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Or just a fantastic byproduct

2922
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Part of me

2923
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Is wondering that maybe the reason why

2924
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
They delayed it a little bit

2925
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Was because of all these launch

2926
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Issues that they've had with games

2927
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Like Soul Calibur and stuff

2928
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Where their servers were just fucked up

2929
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And they were worried that if they weren't able

2930
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
To talk to each other that you may have some issues

2931
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
And stuff

2932
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Also they were saying what we originally had

2933
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
That was not necessarily as smooth or

2934
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Transactions

2935
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Or transitions

2936
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Where the way it connected you

2937
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Or other players weren't as intuitive as we

2938
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Intended them to be

2939
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
So we had to go back and re-look at those areas

2940
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And kind of look at different ways

2941
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
And new techniques to get people

2942
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Socially connect

2943
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
And we changed that with a new

2944
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Dynamic menu system

2945
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
So we really feel like we've solved

2946
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
All those problems

2947
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Also

2948
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
You may be wondering

2949
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Well are we still going to be getting

2950
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Drive Club for free as part of PlayStation Plus

2951
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Well yes that is still going to happen

2952
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
It's actually going to be

2953
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Taking place in one country

2954
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
With five tracks

2955
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And ten cars

2956
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So that's going to be the free portion of the game

2957
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And you'll be able to

2958
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Buy stuff a la carte

2959
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
If you want

2960
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
On top of that

2961
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
So

2962
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
It's pretty neat

2963
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Of course people are getting pissed off

2964
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
It's 1080p and only 30 frames per second

2965
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Not 60 so there's that whole debate

2966
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
But who gives a shit about that

2967
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I'm glad they're still doing the

2968
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
PlayStation Plus free-ish mode

2969
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Definitely

2970
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
And then

2971
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I'm a little disappointed about this

2972
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
You may remember

2973
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Adam Sandler

2974
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Their studio

2975
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
For pixels

2976
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Which was a kind of a short

2977
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
That came out

2978
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
A digital short that was on YouTube

2979
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Where it was a bunch of

2980
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
This blob of pixels flying through the air

2981
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
And then all of a sudden

2982
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Oh look Donkey Kong is there throwing barrels at people

2983
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
And all sorts of pandemonium

2984
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
The Tetris blocks are destroying buildings

2985
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And everything kind of went all pixely

2986
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Well

2987
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Now there's a little bit more information regarding this

2988
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
It's supposed to be coming

2989
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
In 2015

2990
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
It's of course going to have Adam Sandler

2991
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
And all those crew

2992
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Peter Dinklage is going to be in it as well

2993
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And apparently the plot

2994
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
This is really weird

2995
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
The plot centers around I guess

2996
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Aliens who discover video footage of classic arcade games

2997
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
And apparently after seeing that

2998
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
The aliens believe that Earth is

2999
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Trying to wage war with them

3000
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And

3001
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
You know apparently the aliens

3002
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Invade Earth using the games

3003
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
As bullets for their attack

3004
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Of course they're going to have some people

3005
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
That are arcade aficionados

3006
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
That are going to take them on

3007
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And defeat the aliens and save the day

3008
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
But it sounds really weird

3009
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Originally it was like all these

3010
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Classic arcade characters

3011
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Are kind of waging war

3012
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Against everybody

3013
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
And then to this really strange plot line

3014
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
I don't know I think it's just going to sound kind of cheesy

3015
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
But whatever

3016
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
That's coming out next year

3017
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I sounded like the last star fighter almost

3018
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I just

3019
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
It's just Adam Sandler

3020
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
He's like poisoned for anything nowadays

3021
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Back in the day you know the Adam Sandler movie

3022
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Hell yeah I got to watch it because it's going to be hilarious

3023
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Nah it's just not so much

3024
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
So I'm going to have to wait and see

3025
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Also this week

3026
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
They announced the brand new Call of Duty

3027
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Game in

3028
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
It's going to come out in November

3029
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Called Call of Duty Advanced Warfare

3030
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
And it takes place in the year 2059

3031
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
And following I guess a bunch of different

3032
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Private military contractors

3033
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
One I know which is Atlas

3034
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
And I don't know if they're supposed to be the

3035
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Good guys or the bad guys

3036
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
But I know

3037
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
That Kevin Spacey is going to be in

3038
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
The game as well

3039
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
He has a character that he's voicing

3040
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
I guess

3041
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Parents kind of based off of

3042
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Apparently he has

3043
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Some sort of

3044
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I don't know if he's going to be the good guy

3045
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Or if he's trying to take over the United States

3046
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
But anyways

3047
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Stuff happens

3048
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
The Golden Gate Bridge gets destroyed

3049
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
At one point and it's got a lot of the tech

3050
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
That you see in some of these

3051
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Near sci-fi movies like Elysium

3052
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Or was that new one with

3053
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Tom Cruise coming out

3054
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
The exoskeleton suits

3055
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
And all sorts of

3056
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
That kind of tech

3057
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Like the wearable armor type things

3058
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Oh and hoverbikes

3059
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
That's kind of cool

3060
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
So we're going to get our hovercars

3061
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
In the next 30 or so years

3062
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
But yeah that'll be coming out in November

3063
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Great! Bunch of information on Call of Duty

3064
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I didn't know about

3065
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Yeah that's completely new information

3066
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Alright let's move on

3067
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Talking about a game that I do know something about

3068
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Because I've played it before

3069
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
I just haven't played it on the Wii U

3070
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
But it's Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams

3071
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
There is a patch that will be hitting the Wii U

3072
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
In off TV mode

3073
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Some of the in-game sounder music

3074
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Wouldn't come through to the Wii U gamepad

3075
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Oops! So that will be a

3076
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Patch that will hit so if you want to check out

3077
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams

3078
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Which is a pretty solid platformer I gotta say

3079
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I've been playing it on PC

3080
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
But if I didn't have a nice PC

3081
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I think the Wii U would be a great place

3082
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
To check that out

3083
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Yeah check that out

3084
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Especially after that patch goes in

3085
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
This is interesting, this game came out a while ago

3086
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
With the Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection

3087
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I had no idea this was a thing

3088
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
But thanks to some forum posts

3089
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
This week some screenshots

3090
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Leaked of what was supposed to be

3091
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
A full HD remake

3092
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Of the Mortal Kombat collection

3093
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Meaning new characters

3094
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I'm sorry, same characters

3095
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
But new grabs

3096
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Like the sprites were all new

3097
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
New actors dressed up in the costumes

3098
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
That would be hilarious

3099
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
And they actually have lots of screens

3100
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
That people posed in

3101
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Luke Kang and Katana

3102
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Completely different people

3103
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
And you see that they're grabbed

3104
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
In HD

3105
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Kind of neat huh

3106
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
But then they actually show some pictures

3107
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Behind the scenes of these actors on a green screen

3108
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
In the costumes

3109
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
They were ready to

3110
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
They had the Mortal Kombat 3

3111
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Katana and the 2 and all that stuff

3112
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
I'm imagining that's

3113
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Sonya in one of these pictures

3114
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Which I know makes for great radio

3115
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
New actors

3116
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Stryker's

3117
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Kind of chubby isn't he

3118
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
That's alright

3119
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
No he just looks derpy

3120
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
And it's so sad because the newest

3121
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Mortal Kombat game made Stryker almost

3122
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Cool and now they're just like

3123
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
No we're gonna take that away from him

3124
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
So I don't know what they changed

3125
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
They cancelled this and just

3126
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Did it with the regular actors instead

3127
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Maybe it was too much of a shock

3128
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Maybe on playing it with new people

3129
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
They were just like no this doesn't

3130
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Like this defeats the purpose, people are gonna hate this

3131
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
No I imagine somewhere in testing

3132
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
This fell out that like people were gonna

3133
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Reject it

3134
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I kinda think though they should've done it anyway

3135
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
With both

3136
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Why not have the new and the old

3137
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Let people choose what they wanna play as

3138
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I think the new ones for the most part

3139
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Except for maybe Stryker and Kano

3140
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Look pretty decent

3141
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
They should've kept it

3142
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
It would've been weird that they would spend all that money

3143
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
And then nope nevermind

3144
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Psych

3145
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Speaking of, nevermind, psych

3146
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
We had a story last week I think on the show

3147
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
About Silent Hill Origins and Shattered Memories

3148
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Coming to the Playstation Vita

3149
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Oh no that was a mistake

3150
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
The Konami blog

3151
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
That announced this apparently was some type of

3152
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Either a mistranslation

3153
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Or just plain wrong

3154
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Because now it's two Silent Hill

3155
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Titles headed to the Playstation Network

3156
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Even though Konami of the UK tweeted

3157
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
That they're coming to the Vita

3158
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Oops

3159
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
They made a follow up tweet

3160
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Regretfully the games aren't available on Playstation Vita

3161
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
We're afraid

3162
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
If this changes however we'll let you know

3163
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Well you can download them for the PSP

3164
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
On Playstation Network and I'm thinking

3165
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
That's where the error came from

3166
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Somewhere they said oh we need to run an announcement

3167
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
That it's coming to the Playstation Portable

3168
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And somebody said oh that means the Vita

3169
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Totally forgot about the PSP

3170
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Like a lot of people did

3171
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Well don't the PSP games play on the Vita though?

3172
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Most do

3173
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Most do

3174
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
So

3175
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
It's not entirely unsure I guess

3176
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I guess not but yeah I think people

3177
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Had it in their minds that it was new ports or something

3178
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
And that is not a period of games

3179
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
So there you go

3180
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Oh well I don't think I mean last week when we

3181
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Talked about it people didn't seem to be too excited

3182
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
About the idea anyway actually it was the week that

3183
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Flaco was here so it was two weeks ago

3184
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
But anyway it turned out to be

3185
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Psych just kidding

3186
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Shane do you have some stuff for us?

3187
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Yeah DuckTales Remastered the soundtrack if you enjoyed

3188
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
It from the recent release

3189
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Is now available on the

3190
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Amazon MP3 store

3191
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
iTunes and Spotify

3192
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
You can get the

3193
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
47 track

3194
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I didn't realize there were that many songs

3195
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
In it

3196
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
You can get the 47 track album

3197
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
For 949 on Amazon

3198
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Because they have the retro stuff on there too

3199
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
So it's the original and the retro

3200
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
That's what fills it up

3201
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
And it's somehow $11.99

3202
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
On iTunes I don't know

3203
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Why that's kind of

3204
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Really dumb

3205
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Also

3206
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Gran Turismo 5

3207
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
They're pulling the plug on its

3208
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Online services so

3209
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
They are holding a special event

3210
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
To commemorate it

3211
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
It will consist of two stages

3212
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
With the first having a focus

3213
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
On the Mazda

3214
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Roadster touring car

3215
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Of $11 I guess

3216
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
And then the other

3217
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
One is the Top Gear

3218
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Or sorry

3219
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Is the Nissan GTR N24

3220
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
I don't know how to pronounce these car names

3221
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Scholes

3222
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Motorsports $11

3223
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I don't know whatever

3224
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Participating in the event will give players

3225
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It's alright Shane it's like me reading Japanese release dates

3226
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I could do that way better than I can read

3227
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Car things

3228
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Not during Golden Week

3229
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Not during Golden Week

3230
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I could do that better too

3231
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I wouldn't say anything also

3232
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
But better

3233
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Just playing in these events will give players

3234
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Five free vehicles in Gran Turismo 6

3235
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
If they use the same PSN

3236
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
ID as they did from

3237
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Gran Turismo 5

3238
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
You will also earn

3239
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
The

3240
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Golf Grande Punto 09

3241
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Wasn't

3242
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Barth the name of the burger chain

3243
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
And you can't do that on television

3244
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
This is a Barth

3245
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Yes you're right

3246
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
The Renault Sport

3247
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
RS

3248
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Trophy 11

3249
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
The Nissan

3250
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Fairlady Z

3251
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Why don't you just say

3252
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
A bunch of car stuff

3253
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
You'll get cars does it really matter

3254
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And you get a car

3255
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
It's just some stupid car

3256
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
For Gran Turismo

3257
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
You get five stupid cars

3258
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
For Gran Turismo 6

3259
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
There

3260
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
In lighter news Bob Hoskins died

3261
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
At age 71

3262
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
That means no Mario 2

3263
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
For anyone

3264
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Never coming now

3265
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
It's alright you know what

3266
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
They can just recast him with Danny DeVito

3267
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
It's almost the same right

3268
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I guess

3269
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Bob Hoskins didn't care for the Mario Brothers movie

3270
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Oh god I hope not

3271
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Well nobody did well apparently John Lee

3272
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Was almost put out a tweet about the whole thing

3273
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
And I think he even responded to somebody

3274
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
That said like well didn't you guys hate the Mario

3275
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Movie and he kind of said something to the effect

3276
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Of and I'm paraphrasing here

3277
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
It's grown on them over the years

3278
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Probably the fan response

3279
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
And the fact that people care about it now

3280
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Probably has grown on at least John Leguizamo

3281
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
It kind of sucks I mean imagine like you're

3282
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
John Leguizamo back and you're kind of almost like

3283
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
A no name actor at that point

3284
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
And they're like hey we're gonna

3285
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Ok whatever yeah that's fine but he's a little bit more known

3286
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Now I mean he's more known now

3287
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
He was in Moulin Rouge

3288
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And he was also in Kick-Ass 2 by the way

3289
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
And they're like

3290
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Hey we're making a movie based on Super Mario

3291
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Brothers you want to be in it?

3292
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
And it's like fuck yeah well he probably wasn't like that

3293
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
He probably auditioned for it but you know hey we're making a movie

3294
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
His agent was probably like fuck yeah

3295
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Yeah it's like seriously

3296
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
You know probably the same thing happened when Double Dragon

3297
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Had a movie too and we know how that turned out so

3298
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
It's just

3299
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
It's just one of those things you know it's unfortunate

3300
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
And now we'll never know if

3301
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
You know a sequel really could have happened because they left

3302
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
It wide open at the end

3303
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Or Tiger Claws has no

3304
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Sequel to who framed Roger Rabbit either

3305
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Yeah that movie scared the crap out of them

3306
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Well wasn't the end of like the Super Mario Brothers movie

3307
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Wasn't that kind of like the same premise that they can basically do

3308
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
In the end of the new

3309
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Or the beginning of the new Tron movie you know

3310
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Where they invade Earth or whatever

3311
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Well but in the Mario movie it was like

3312
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Was it Daisy that was in there?

3313
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
She just shows up at the end and she's like guys we got trouble

3314
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Or something stupid like that

3315
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
And they're like okay Marty it's your kids

3316
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
She had like plunger guns or something I don't remember

3317
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
That movie was so awful

3318
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Rama in chat says in heaven right now

3319
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
There's two Marios and a Luigi

3320
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
I think Bowser, Koopa around

3321
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Yeah because Dennis Hopper's passed away

3322
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I didn't know that

3323
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
You didn't know that? Yeah Dennis Hopper died a few years ago

3324
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It was while he was on that TV show Crash

3325
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
That they made out of the movie

3326
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
And then

3327
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Yeah Captain Lou Albano

3328
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Who played Mario on the TV show passed away

3329
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And the guy who played Luigi Danny Wells

3330
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Passed away

3331
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
So yeah

3332
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
John Leguizamo better watch out

3333
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Not to be crass but

3334
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Better watch out

3335
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Maybe we can get the pest too

3336
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
No

3337
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
My favorite Bob Hoskins

3338
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Role will always be Smee

3339
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
In Hook

3340
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
My favorite will always be Who Framed Roger Rabbit

3341
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
There you go

3342
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I didn't like Who Framed Roger Rabbit actually

3343
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I know that's sacrilege

3344
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Actually that's my favorite Christopher Lloyd role

3345
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Oh yeah he was actually really good

3346
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Not even Back to the Future

3347
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Professor Plum in Clue

3348
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Never

3349
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Alright but Christopher Lloyd's still alive

3350
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Just for the record

3351
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And I gotta be honest

3352
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
And I gotta be honest I'm absolutely surprised he's still alive

3353
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Because he looks older than dirt right now

3354
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Stop you guys are so

3355
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I mean no don't get me wrong

3356
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I hope he lives forever but

3357
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
He looks old

3358
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I know he can't but

3359
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
He looks fucking old but

3360
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
That's why if we're gonna get another Back to the Future

3361
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Movie or something

3362
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Hurry up on that shit

3363
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
He's not getting any younger

3364
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
If they don't do a reboot isn't that what they do now?

3365
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
It's a reboot

3366
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
What happened to reboot the movie?

3367
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I thought that was coming at some point

3368
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
What happened to reboot the show?

3369
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
They really fucked that one up

3370
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
That was cool for like the first season

3371
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
We're gonna have all these characters in there

3372
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
And now it's something weird

3373
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Fifth Dream says the only ones surviving

3374
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Are Princess and Toad that's suspicious

3375
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I don't even remember Toad in that movie

3376
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I don't either but

3377
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Alright let's move on let's get to the foogle question of the week

3378
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
You take Facebook, you take Google

3379
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
As in Google Plus you slam those

3380
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Together and you get foogle

3381
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
And so that's why we go to our fan communities every week

3382
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
And ask a question of our

3383
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Listeners and we read some of our favorite answers

3384
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Here on air

3385
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Maybe I'll read them all tonight

3386
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I'm gonna start on Google Plus

3387
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
With the question which is about the whole Disney

3388
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Infinity, Skylanders

3389
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Because I knew we'd be talking about these games that come with figures

3390
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Tonight because of the Marvel news and the fact

3391
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
That Shane made me play Skylanders

3392
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I will point out

3393
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
That when you actually played it

3394
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
You asked me to go get it

3395
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Like I've been saying we need to play this

3396
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
We need to play this and then out of the blue you're like

3397
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Okay let's play this

3398
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
I was ready to do the live stream

3399
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I was like if we're gonna do this let's do it

3400
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
And then we asked you guys

3401
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Now that it's been a few years for Skylanders

3402
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
And a year for Disney Infinity

3403
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
It looks like these games are here to stay

3404
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
How do you feel about these games

3405
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Involving sold separately figures

3406
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Do you really enjoy the games and collecting the figures

3407
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Or do you think these are cheap cash grabs

3408
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
That aren't worth your time

3409
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
We just kind of wanted to know generally what do the listeners think of these games

3410
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Retertainment on Google Plus says

3411
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I haven't given these games much thought

3412
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
But I'm not a kid and I don't have any children of my own

3413
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Sure I could buy these video game or toy combinations

3414
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
My sister's family has enough problems keeping themselves

3415
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
In government subsidized housing

3416
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Does anyone else remember Captain Power

3417
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I do I do

3418
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Act Def says

3419
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I still think these type of games are really big cash grabs right now

3420
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
But they're good ones at least for the most part

3421
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
A lot of people both children and adults

3422
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Like both Skylanders and Disney Infinity

3423
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Collect the figurines and play the games

3424
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
The only one that got close to getting me to buy

3425
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Figurines was Pokemon Rumble U

3426
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
But I heard the game was crap and didn't do it

3427
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I'm still kind of tempted by them though

3428
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
It was crap

3429
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Don't do it

3430
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Alright and going over to

3431
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Facebook I can probably read most of these

3432
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I might make some of them a little shorter though

3433
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Andy R says

3434
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
In a way it doesn't seem all that different than DLC to me

3435
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Only your DLC nets you a collectible

3436
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
You can put on a shelf

3437
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
DLC is its own love it or hate it gaming trend

3438
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
But getting physical collectibles with it

3439
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Is all upside I'd say

3440
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I've never been into Skylanders or Disney Infinity

3441
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
But as someone who collects and plays Magic

3442
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
People may get addicted to it

3443
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
The only problem I have with that is that

3444
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
DLC tends to be

3445
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Not always but tends to be more robust

3446
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Like when I think about Mass Effect 3

3447
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Story DLC

3448
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Great! Whole bunch of stuff I'm getting for my 10 or 15 bucks

3449
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
But then I think about horse armor

3450
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
In Oblivion

3451
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Not great right

3452
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
The reason why I bring that up is that

3453
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
When you get through these doors and things

3454
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
It's not that much

3455
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
It's like one room that has a hat in it

3456
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
One puzzle to do

3457
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
It's not like a whole bunch

3458
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Technically for the case of Skylanders

3459
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
You buy the starter pack

3460
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Because that's what they're forcing you to do every single time

3461
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
You get characters there

3462
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
You don't need to buy anybody else

3463
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
You can beat the entire game

3464
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Everything else would be optional

3465
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
That is horse armor

3466
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
That's all it is

3467
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Haseo Sumeruagawa responds

3468
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I can't I just can't

3469
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Rene our friend from the podcast

3470
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Killer Queens from Outer Space says

3471
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
It's a great way to keep a game in players minds

3472
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
By offering expansions

3473
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
To keep replayability high

3474
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
But it's just not my bag

3475
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Gamer Girl says

3476
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
On one hand I think it's good for the collector in mind

3477
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
But on the other hand I think it's a waste of money for parents

3478
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Whose kids lose interest rather quickly

3479
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Blood Drunk says

3480
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
It's a giant cash grab gimmick to get children hooked

3481
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
To make the parents buy figurines for the game

3482
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
In my book at least

3483
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Critical Myth responds

3484
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
And even though he's beat each of the three games

3485
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Many times over

3486
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
There's still plenty of those damn figurines sitting unused

3487
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Their idea is neat

3488
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
But there has to be a better way to implement it

3489
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
To make it less of a cash grab

3490
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Ciala responds and says

3491
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
If Nintendo ever does this with Pokemon

3492
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
They'll become a leading world economy

3493
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Well again they started to do it

3494
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
But they did it half-assed

3495
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
They did it really half-assed

3496
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
I'm not huge on this method myself

3497
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But I might collect some if they have cool figures

3498
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
From something I enjoy

3499
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Shay C. replied

3500
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And agreed with the first answer I read from Andy R.

3501
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
It's essentially DLC

3502
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
And should be held to the same standard

3503
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
It can be fine

3504
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
But if you're shipping a full price game where say

3505
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Half or more of the content is gated

3506
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Oh the boss is behind a door you need a fire grind to open

3507
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Buy additional figures

3508
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
That crosses the line

3509
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
As long as the amount of gameplay provided for all combinations of purchases

3510
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Is in line with the cost

3511
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I've got no real problem with it

3512
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
And if we're going to be fair

3513
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
This is all on this DLC by the way

3514
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
In my book

3515
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
I did think it was cool

3516
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I did think it was really cool

3517
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
That those figures save

3518
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Data in them

3519
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Through the little chips

3520
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I had never played the game on my Playstation 4 before

3521
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
But when Shane put the little bird figure

3522
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
It's like oh this is level 10

3523
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
And you have all these abilities on it

3524
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
So is your Wii remote but no one gives a shit about that

3525
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
So I thought it was a neat use of that technology

3526
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
For what it's worth

3527
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
But I just want to say about the DLC question

3528
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Since Shane already answered it

3529
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
You can beat the game with just what it comes with

3530
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
In my opinion

3531
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Those figures are not worth it

3532
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Just for the DLC in the game

3533
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
You really have to like it

3534
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
You have to like the figure

3535
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Like that it lights up or whatever

3536
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
And you get a little bit of an enhancement

3537
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
A little bit of an incentive

3538
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
You could eat a pizza that's just cheese

3539
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
But really you want pepperoni

3540
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
For some people

3541
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
That's how it's going to be

3542
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Two more answers left

3543
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
I hope I don't mispronounce this

3544
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
It's either Felipe or Felipe

3545
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Felipe A replies and says

3546
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
When I was a kid my parents bought me a lot of cheap toys

3547
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
From the store that I would end up playing for maybe

3548
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Two to three hours and forget about them

3549
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I equate Skylanders and all other figures to those

3550
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
They are cheap distractions that keep kids entertained

3551
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
For a couple hours

3552
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I got my parents to use their money to give me a couple hours

3553
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Of entertainment back then

3554
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
And then I gave the game to a couple more extra

3555
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Not for me since I'm in my twenties

3556
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
But I'm not the addressable market for them either

3557
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Shane might disagree with you there

3558
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I think once you start putting like age restrictions on stuff

3559
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
You get kind of ridiculous

3560
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Like you could say the same thing about any video game

3561
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Can we talk about your Power Rangers toy?

3562
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Yeah I don't care

3563
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Talk about my Power Rangers

3564
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
You want me to go get it? I'll play it over the stupid thing

3565
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
After I'm done, yes go get your Power Rangers toy

3566
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I brought all three

3567
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
You didn't know I brought three

3568
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
It's like a train

3569
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
That's not even the series we have here

3570
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
It's a train thing in Japan

3571
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
And it makes choo choo noises

3572
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
And you paid $60 for it

3573
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
It's their Morpher in the new Japanese series

3574
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I love it, it's amazing

3575
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
You know what though?

3576
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Everybody has their thing

3577
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
I do this Rocky Horror thing

3578
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
And you always look at me going

3579
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
You are wasting all of your time

3580
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Don't tell me to tell you that too though

3581
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
So I'll remind you

3582
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
There's all that going on

3583
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
But then you spend $60 on a Power Rangers toy

3584
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
And I'm fine with it

3585
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
People spend money on whatever makes them happy

3586
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Yes, now you can keep reading it all over our back

3587
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Alright

3588
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Well I only have one more answer so you better hurry

3589
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And again I'm probably going to mispronounce this

3590
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
So I apologize

3591
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Amanojeko

3592
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
I think is how I say that

3593
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Amanojeko says the idea of Skylanders

3594
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
is a fun concept with a variety of

3595
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
figures to choose from so you can play

3596
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
the way you want. The only drawback is

3597
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
the fact that some Skylanders giant figures

3598
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
can't be used in Swap Force and vice versa

3599
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
For the money people put in the game

3600
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
they should be able to use them as they

3601
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
see fit

3602
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Alright, I agree with that

3603
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says

3604
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
I'd be more interested in Disney Infinity because

3605
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
of recognizable characters. I wouldn't

3606
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
mind having a Tron action figure that also

3607
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
works in a video game, but no, they didn't release

3608
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
any Tron figures for Disney Infinity

3609
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Yeah, I'm a little

3610
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
bitter about that

3611
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Yeah, I agree. They did have some Tron things in the

3612
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
toy box, but yeah, no Tron figure

3613
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
unfortunately

3614
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Best you could do is have these little

3615
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
citizens or whatever

3616
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
toy things running around

3617
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
you can dress them up like Tron, that's about it

3618
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Whoopee

3619
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
So answering the questions for ourselves here real quick

3620
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Loki, all the sass

3621
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
and anger stuff aside, how do you really

3622
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
feel about these games?

3623
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I mean, I tried Disney Infinity and

3624
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
once again, it was

3625
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
too young

3626
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
of a demographic for me

3627
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
You bought it and sold it on eBay, right?

3628
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
It wasn't

3629
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
It's cool, like the figurines

3630
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
are pretty neat. I kind of wish that you could

3631
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
do something with them, like that they actually were figurines

3632
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
that you could pull off the base and

3633
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
do stuff with

3634
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
But as far as collecting them goes, I mean, they're not

3635
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
bad. I mean, they're kind of cool looking

3636
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
I just think though it is

3637
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
pretty obvious in both games

3638
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
of how much of a cash grab they are

3639
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
and yeah, I know that people compare it to

3640
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
DLC, but dude

3641
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
there's 60 pieces of

3642
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
DLC if you want to call it that

3643
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
60 pieces plus

3644
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
that are like 10 bucks each

3645
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
You don't really have to buy

3646
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
like as Shane said earlier, you need one of each

3647
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
element or one of each power, you don't need all

3648
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
You don't have to, but then why offer 60 pieces?

3649
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Because they want you to buy all of them

3650
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
And there will be people that will buy all of them

3651
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
And some of the figures are kind of neat, like they light up and shit

3652
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
remember? Anyhow

3653
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Yeah, and those cost an extra $5

3654
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Here's the thing, after

3655
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
finally getting my hands on Skylanders this week

3656
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
it's not as bad of a game as I thought it would be

3657
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
like the game itself, I was expecting it to be a lot worse

3658
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
and a lot more in your face of a cash grab

3659
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
No, it's pretty sweet, but it wouldn't be

3660
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
just the same game if you just

3661
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
played it and you unlocked characters via

3662
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
progression or whatever, finding

3663
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
them, I mean, that would be

3664
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
I don't know, like a game that they released

3665
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
years ago, but now they're like, hey we can make

3666
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
an extra $600 off of that

3667
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Fuck you

3668
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I can hear you on that

3669
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
And you know what? There's going to be stuff

3670
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
when the Tron figures come out eventually for Disney

3671
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Phoenix, like

3672
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
that's really cool, but nope

3673
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Alright, got to move on with the show, but quickly

3674
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Shane's back with his toys, remember it's a radio show

3675
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
so help explain it for us a little bit

3676
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
what you brought back. So, first of all I couldn't find one of my toys

3677
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
but I have the original Dragonzord dagger

3678
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
from like 1990 something here

3679
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
and it still

3680
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
still works

3681
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I haven't ever changed the batteries

3682
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I don't know how it works

3683
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
But this other thing is

3684
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
you put a train in

3685
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
and it makes train noises, hold on

3686
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
What do trains have to do with Power Rangers?

3687
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
That's just the theme this time, is their train theme

3688
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Oh yeah

3689
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
So he's putting this little train

3690
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
in the, it looks like a rocket

3691
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
launcher or something that has

3692
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Well no, these are like

3693
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
the crossing signal things. Anyway, so like

3694
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
you want to morph, so you hit this

3695
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
That's train noises, and you put the

3696
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
train in

3697
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
You push the gates down

3698
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
And because of the way

3699
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
the train is molded at the bottom

3700
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
and it hits certain sensors

3701
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
and it knows which train you put in there

3702
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
so it knows that this is the Red Rangers train

3703
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
so it tells me that I just wanted to

3704
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
The look on Loki's

3705
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
face right now is priceless

3706
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
He spent $60 on that

3707
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I was over at Flaco Jones' house

3708
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
and I showed his kid this series

3709
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
and he would not quit watching it

3710
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
so watch out

3711
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
And Flaco Jones isn't going to be inviting you back

3712
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
anytime soon

3713
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
You know what though?

3714
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I respect the fact that they can do that

3715
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
straight face throughout the whole thing

3716
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
even though it's kind of ridiculous

3717
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
but I do want to see some really

3718
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
I want them to kind of take that and run with it

3719
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Maybe next year they can do

3720
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
household appliances

3721
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Well, toaster ranger

3722
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Yeah, mow the lawn ranger

3723
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
It's Japan, they do crazy things

3724
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
like last time was dinosaurs

3725
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
but the other half of that was samba dancing

3726
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
and they had guns that they would spin

3727
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
and would make music and they had to dance to it

3728
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
This is pretty awesome

3729
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
You know what? That's the next one we get here

3730
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I'm excited

3731
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Syallen Chat says, you're not alone

3732
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
because Syallen Chat says, Shane Alinko

3733
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
I need that in my life

3734
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Yes, I see that

3735
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
live.vognetwork.com

3736
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Alright, let us move on with more show

3737
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
We've got more news to get into

3738
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
and your emails to get to as well

3739
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
I mean, I don't know

3740
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
I've watched the Transformers

3741
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
slash Thomas thing that they did

3742
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
on YouTube, it's hilarious

3743
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
and they have that

3744
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
so maybe Power Rangers thing would be so bad

3745
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Anyways, ok

3746
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
so

3747
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
this is kind of

3748
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
I don't know, it's kind of disappointing if you're a fan of

3749
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
maybe Tony Hawk and stuff

3750
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Neversoft, a company that used to do

3751
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
some pretty awesome games

3752
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Tony Hawk included

3753
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
They are now being rolled into

3754
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Infinity Ward or what is now Infinity Ward

3755
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
and

3756
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
because I think Neversoft

3757
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
actually did some Call of Duty

3758
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
work before

3759
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I want to say that they worked on

3760
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
either certain versions of the game or DLC

3761
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
or something like that

3762
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
a portion of the game

3763
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
well now

3764
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
they worked with them for

3765
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Call of Duty Ghost

3766
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
so now they're actually going to be part of Infinity Ward

3767
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
and Neversoft is no more

3768
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
so

3769
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
but it's

3770
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
did I hear no layoffs?

3771
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
the name is No More

3772
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Didn't they make the Guitar Hero 3 and after

3773
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
and all that too?

3774
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I wanted to say that they did, yeah

3775
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
well moving on, this is involving layoffs

3776
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
this is Future

3777
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
is going through some restructuring and

3778
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
redundancies or layoffs

3779
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Future, they don't make games

3780
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
but they make some gaming commentaries, magazines

3781
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
things like OXM, PC Gamer, CVG

3782
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
and Edge, so some of these magazines

3783
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
and websites, they're going through

3784
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
global restructuring, this means

3785
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
layoffs and according to CEO

3786
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
no part of the business will be unaffected

3787
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
they also say that Future

3788
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
will no longer, this is not from the CEO but from Media Week

3789
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Future will no longer be structured around

3790
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
content types like technology

3791
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
but instead a single content and marketing

3792
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
team will produce all content

3793
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
basically the whole move to digital

3794
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
they say diluted focus and distracted

3795
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
the talent, so interesting

3796
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
all these brands range from

3797
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
cars to tech, music, sports and so on

3798
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
it sounds like they're probably going to combine

3799
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
similar things and try to push out

3800
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
similar content in both paper and

3801
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
digital forms or something along those lines

3802
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
kind of where it sounds like this is going

3803
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
it doesn't totally surprise me

3804
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
in this day and age we live in, it's so

3805
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
much easier for people to make homegrown

3806
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
media content, hi

3807
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
how you doing?

3808
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
so that's just the reality

3809
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
of the industry, but still

3810
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
no funding, and not get paid for it

3811
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
well for us yeah, but

3812
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
well yeah we do it for free

3813
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
so it makes it that much harder for the people

3814
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
and I'm not just saying we, but I mean there's tons

3815
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
of websites and tons of even

3816
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
homegrown mags and

3817
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
video shows and so forth, it makes it that

3818
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
much harder for the people that do want to get money to do it

3819
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
but you know

3820
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
that's the reality

3821
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
but layoffs are never fun to talk about

3822
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
so best of luck to those

3823
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
folks that are affected, hope you can find

3824
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
another job in the industry that you enjoy

3825
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Shane

3826
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
oh sorry I was chatting

3827
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
oh now the chat room wants to talk

3828
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Power Rangers, you're all in it right?

3829
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
yeah I'll talk Power Rangers for days

3830
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
so from software makers of

3831
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
games like Otogi, because that's really the only one

3832
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
I remember, but I guess

3833
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
they also do like Dark Souls

3834
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
or Armored Core

3835
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
but Otogi

3836
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
enchanted arms

3837
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
like the first RPG on 360

3838
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Awful, that was such a bad game

3839
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
yeah, that was from software

3840
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
did From Software also do

3841
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
or did they have a part in

3842
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
what was it, ChromeHounds?

3843
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
I think that was mostly Sega I think

3844
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
I could be wrong

3845
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
but they have published recently

3846
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
they've done a lot more than what

3847
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Shane's leading on, but mostly Otogi

3848
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
still, because that was a really good game

3849
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
but they also published Killer's Dead

3850
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
and the lollipop

3851
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
chainsaw in Japan

3852
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
they have been acquired by

3853
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Kadokawa Corporation

3854
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
which is a

3855
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
corporation

3856
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
that publishes manga

3857
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
like I guess

3858
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Gundam and Neon Genesis

3859
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Evangelion

3860
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Bobby says

3861
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
From did do ChromeHounds, you're right

3862
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
and I'm wrong

3863
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
sorry Shane

3864
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
no that's really it, they were acquired by a

3865
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
manga publishing company

3866
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
interesting, interesting combination

3867
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I hope they make Otogi 3

3868
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
crossing your fingers and your toes

3869
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
just my fingers, I don't want that

3870
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
much

3871
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
lowkey

3872
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
let's see

3873
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
so this is kind of cool

3874
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
one of the games I want to see, I think this was

3875
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
GameSpy, yeah it was GameSpy

3876
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
so one of the games that was affected by GameSpy

3877
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
was a PC version of Halo Combat Evolved

3878
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
and you know

3879
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
the Halo franchise

3880
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
they were rabid fans when it comes to

3881
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
multiplayer, you may remember Halo 2

3882
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
multiplayer on Xbox, there's a ton of people

3883
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
that stayed in after you know they kind of

3884
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
closed off the matchmaking

3885
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
servers and stuff and they stayed in as long as they could

3886
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
and they kind of drug it out, well

3887
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
thanks to a

3888
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
third party matchmaking online gaming

3889
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
company called

3890
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
GameRanger, the multiplayer service

3891
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
is actually going to still

3892
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
be continuing

3893
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
and they're going to be

3894
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
taking over I guess handling

3895
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
the multiplayer for that game

3896
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
so

3897
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
oh and also I guess the demo and

3898
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
the custom edition of that

3899
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
so that's pretty sweet

3900
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
on top of that

3901
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
there's also, and this is good news

3902
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
for me because I'm a fan of you know a lot of these

3903
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
the Rockstar games but

3904
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Grand Theft Auto 4

3905
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
and Red Dead

3906
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
what was it, Red Dead Redemption

3907
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
the multiplayer for that is actually

3908
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
being, Rockstar is going to

3909
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
make sure that keeps continuing

3910
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
at least for those two games

3911
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Midnight Club 3 dub edition, dub edition

3912
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
remix, Grand Theft Auto, Chinatown

3913
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Wars and

3914
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Beta Raider though are going to have their multiplayer shut

3915
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
off although I can't imagine a lot of people play

3916
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
multiplayer for Chinatown Wars, I didn't even

3917
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
realize they had multiplayer

3918
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
and of course you know Grand Theft Auto 5 is not

3919
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
effective because that was never 3 games by the first place

3920
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Max Payne 3 also

3921
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
not being affected by that

3922
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
we're seeing though that

3923
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
oh I'm sorry

3924
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Mac users in Max Payne 3 are not going to be able to

3925
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
play multiplayer anymore, PC though you're ok

3926
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Red Dead Redemption though

3927
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
no problems there

3928
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
and then the PS3 version of

3929
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 is losing its

3930
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
leaderboards as well

3931
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
so

3932
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I don't know

3933
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
I'm glad to see that some of these companies are

3934
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
stepping in to make sure their games don't go dark

3935
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
as far as multiplayer is concerned

3936
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
so that's

3937
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
pretty cool

3938
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
alrighty

3939
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
let us go into the mailbag

3940
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
we're going to open up the mailbag and read some of our emails

3941
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
participate at orangelawandtrady.com

3942
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
the place to send those emails

3943
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
and every week DarkSakura

3944
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
suits up and dives into the emailbag and

3945
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
picks some emails to read, however she's not here

3946
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
she has the night off so

3947
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
I will borrow the hazmat suit

3948
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
and dive on in and pick out some emails to read

3949
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
for y'all

3950
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
we are going to start with this email from

3951
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Dee

3952
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Dee does not want to have their full name read

3953
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
and so

3954
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
can we just make up a name then?

3955
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
sure, make up a name

3956
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
but what if the name you make up

3957
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
and you don't know because you can't see the email

3958
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
what if it happens to be the same name

3959
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
it's going to be awkward

3960
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
this person's name is DuckSauce

3961
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
DuckSauce?

3962
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
this person's name is not DuckSauce

3963
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
it's because they don't want their full name read

3964
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
so DuckSauce emailed us

3965
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
and

3966
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
DuckSauce has some insider info for us

3967
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
let's get to it

3968
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I'm not, I don't give a shit about grammar

3969
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
and B, even if Jamie had been here

3970
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
and I would have been like, look Jamie

3971
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
he speaks two languages

3972
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
and until you can speak

3973
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
two languages fluently, you're going to cut him a break

3974
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
so please don't ever

3975
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
be afraid to email us just because English isn't your

3976
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
first language. Jamie will give you a break

3977
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
because, you know, she expects if you're going to

3978
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
speak one language, speak it well

3979
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
but if you're going to speak more than one, then you get

3980
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
a little room for error, so don't worry about it

3981
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
LDuckSauce? Is that what we're

3982
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
calling him now? Yes, LDuckSauce

3983
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
LDuckSauce, ok, act-def says that would be

3984
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
El PatoSauce

3985
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
but that doesn't have a D in it

3986
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
alright

3987
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
alright, anyway

3988
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
however, I am too excited to not tell

3989
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
anyone about this, I am currently a beta

3990
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
tester for PlayStation Now

3991
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
I wanted to hear your opinions, please

3992
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
keep my name private so I don't get in trouble for

3993
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
opening my big mouth, you've got it

3994
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
LDuckSauce, alright, I finally

3995
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
received the code to get into the private

3996
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
beta of PlayStation Now

3997
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I want to know your opinions about the service

3998
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
do you think it's going to be a great, great

3999
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
service? What are the problems you see

4000
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
with this service? What do you want this service

4001
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
to be when all is said and done? Do you think

4002
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
it can be a type of future for gaming?

4003
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
That's a lot of questions, LDuckSauce

4004
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
but I will try to kind of summarize

4005
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
my thoughts on it

4006
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I think it's a very exciting and creative way

4007
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
to get the PlayStation games

4008
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
backwards compatible. I am not

4009
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
too exciting at the prospect of paying

4010
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
for games again. I really wish

4011
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
that if I had a PlayStation 3 disc

4012
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I could just enable that in my library

4013
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I realize why that's probably not going to

4014
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
be possible, even if the digital games

4015
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
carry over, I'll be mostly happy

4016
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
about that, so I'm hoping

4017
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I'm a little worried about the technology

4018
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
sometimes with streaming games

4019
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
it's not always perfect

4020
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
the delay concerns

4021
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
me quite a bit

4022
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
but I commend

4023
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
them for trying and I'm open

4024
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
to it and again I'm really

4025
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
curious to see how much they charge for some

4026
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
of these games because it's very interesting

4027
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
what LDuckSauce breaks down

4028
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
here

4029
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
BlackWolf says

4030
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
I want to hear LDuckSauce's opinion because he's

4031
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
actually used it

4032
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
and BlackWolf says it's hard to answer these

4033
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
questions without having used the service

4034
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
so let's get into actually

4035
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
you're lucky Bobby because LDuckSauce actually

4036
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
answers these questions

4037
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
my experience so far is as follows

4038
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
I'm using a Playstation 3 and a wireless

4039
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
connection, the beta only has about 20

4040
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
games and so far in the beta

4041
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
I believe it's a good selection, they have good games

4042
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
like Saints Row 3, Luminous Supernova

4043
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Puppeteer, BlazBlue, Disgaea

4044
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Catherine Knights Grid, Fuel, and Skullgirls

4045
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
as you can see they have a good selection

4046
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
or choices for anyone

4047
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
for now all the games are free

4048
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
I was going to say those are all the Playstation Plus games

4049
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
for the most part

4050
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
not Luminous, I would have grabbed that

4051
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
well some of these are, some of these are

4052
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
not, maybe those are upcoming

4053
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
free titles

4054
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
alright, when you select a game

4055
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
you need to pick how many days you want to

4056
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
rent this game, you have three options

4057
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
one day, seven, or thirty days

4058
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
I will assume that these prices will eventually

4059
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
show up after beta, the game

4060
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
themselves ran great, I do have to admit that

4061
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I never had a problem with the actual gameplay, sounds

4062
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
or frame rate, however I did have

4063
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
trouble with the video quality, there's this weird

4064
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
YouTube dream effect going on

4065
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I don't know how to explain it, it's like when you watch a

4066
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
YouTube HD video on your iPhone

4067
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
and the quality drops to 720 or lower

4068
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
for a couple seconds, this happens sometimes

4069
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
on Playstation 3 games that I was streaming

4070
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
at first it was super distracting, but eventually

4071
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
you got used to the video dip, when I plugged

4072
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
in the connection, this problem was resolved

4073
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
my second concern is that I am worried

4074
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
about online gaming with this program

4075
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I haven't tried that part yet, but I love

4076
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
fighting games and I can't truly see anyone

4077
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
playing fighting games online with some

4078
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
service like this, I'm really

4079
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
impressed by this technology, I know

4080
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
that there was something like this before

4081
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I think it was called OnLive, I feel

4082
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
that this could become like a Netflix meets

4083
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
RedBox and specifically if you mix it with

4084
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Playstation Network Plus, no need

4085
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
to ask for demos, just pay 99 cents

4086
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
and rent the game for a day, maybe

4087
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
a program like this will also discourage game

4088
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
companies to make short games, like a game

4089
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
like the most recent Metal Gear, I would have

4090
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
rented it for a day or week instead of buying a disc

4091
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
version, I know there will be problems like

4092
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
internet connections, licensing fees and other things

4093
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
that Sony can't control, I truly

4094
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
wish this is part of the future for gaming

4095
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I know I only test it for two days so far

4096
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
but I'm loving it, I know we all want to know

4097
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
what the future for gaming is, but this could be something

4098
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
that Sony can release quietly and catch on

4099
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
really good once we all give it a chance

4100
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Sorry for the long email, just wanted to hear

4101
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
your opinions and give mine, keep up

4102
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
the great podcast, love you guys

4103
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Lducksauce

4104
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
There it is, so

4105
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
thank you for the email and actually your English

4106
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
is very good, I did correct some of your tense

4107
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
as I was reading it, that's really

4108
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
the only thing I see is that sometimes you have to put

4109
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
the D at the end of the word because it's in the past

4110
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
but otherwise you did a great job

4111
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
and considering I can speak no Spanish

4112
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
really, although that won't

4113
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
stop me from trying to watch Telemundo because that

4114
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
shit's great, I'm very impressed

4115
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
and please do email us in the future

4116
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
What did you guys think about, what do you have to say about PlayStation Now?

4117
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I just have to make, you know

4118
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
as long as it works and the

4119
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
pricing is right, because I mean honestly

4120
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
with some of these older games and stuff, why am I

4121
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
going to rent it if I can buy a used

4122
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
copy of it for just about the same price

4123
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
you know, like hell fuck, I just bought

4124
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 for five bucks

4125
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I'm not going to rent it

4126
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Is this why GameStop

4127
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
might think they're in trouble though, like they're thinking the opposite

4128
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
you're thinking, that people will want to rent

4129
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
because it's so convenient? No, because that's why rental

4130
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
stores are around, I mean you can rent games if you want

4131
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
to usually, I mean depending on your area

4132
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
I guess, and those are kind of

4133
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
gone by the wayside anyways, and they already have

4134
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
they have games in Redbox so you can get

4135
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
like for example Metal Gear Solid

4136
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
or Metal Gear Solid 5, Ground Zeroes

4137
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
you probably could have rented that for like two bucks

4138
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
or whatever and

4139
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
that's available to you

4140
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
but it's just whether you want to do it or not

4141
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Shane, what are your thoughts on PlayStation Now?

4142
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Well as someone who may or may not

4143
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
have played it

4144
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
I may or may not agree

4145
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
with what he said, especially

4146
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
the parts about

4147
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
it not being laggy

4148
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
or

4149
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
responsive, like

4150
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
say for example, hypothetical

4151
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
hypothetical

4152
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
playing Luminesce

4153
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
if I were in the beta

4154
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I may have problems

4155
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
or may have had problems

4156
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
playing Luminesce because

4157
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
of the responsiveness

4158
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
of the controller or

4159
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
that stupid music

4160
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
game shooter thing where you play

4161
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
backwards and it's all based on the

4162
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
retrograde which I liked. No, no

4163
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I'm saying based on a PlayStation

4164
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Now experience that I may or may not have had

4165
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
yeah

4166
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
that was ridiculously hard

4167
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
because of that, or would have been

4168
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
if I was playing it

4169
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
but I think

4170
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
otherwise I agree with what he said

4171
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
I

4172
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
worry about that delay between

4173
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
input because it makes music

4174
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
games hell, it makes a lot of action games or anything

4175
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
especially a very demanding

4176
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
platformer that you have to time

4177
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
your jumps perfectly and shit

4178
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
NES Remix which I know isn't a PlayStation

4179
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
game but hear me out

4180
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
that would be murder on that so they really need to

4181
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
tighten that up. It's murder on any game

4182
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
like maybe in the

4183
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
past when they had Guacamelee up

4184
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
to play and if I had been

4185
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
playing it just normal jumps would

4186
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
have been awful to get to

4187
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
various parts in that game

4188
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
making me turn off the system

4189
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
alright

4190
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
well I

4191
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
really appreciate the email from

4192
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
ElDuckSauce so please

4193
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
who has a new nickname thanks

4194
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
to Shane? You never had

4195
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
one before but you do know. I can nickname everybody

4196
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
that you have for the mailbag

4197
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
so let's go with the next one

4198
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
we'll get to it, hold on because in the chat TigerCaw

4199
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
asks, Sky you tried watching

4200
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Sabado Higante, yes I have

4201
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
that shit is amazing, it's like a

4202
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
game show, variety show

4203
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
that's the type of stuff that used to

4204
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
be on the TV in the golden age here

4205
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
in America and you don't see it anymore

4206
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
but you're still doing that stuff on Sabado Higante

4207
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
which Act F corrects

4208
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
is on Univision

4209
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
not Telemundo, yes it's the other

4210
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
big Spanish network

4211
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
so there you go

4212
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
yes I do enjoy watching Sabado Higante

4213
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I have no idea what they're saying but some of the

4214
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
sketches are still hilarious and I can

4215
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
I can pick up enough words

4216
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
you know

4217
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
like if I'm watching a

4218
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
telenovela

4219
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
and one chick calls another

4220
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
a peta, like I know what they're saying

4221
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
no

4222
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
alright, moving on

4223
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
we have another email from

4224
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
this one is from

4225
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Martin from

4226
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Belgium, Martin

4227
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
from Belgium, he's emailed us before

4228
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I thought I was giving a nickname, well that's

4229
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
that's the name, what should Martin

4230
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
but there's no nickname, Martin is I think their real

4231
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
name, like you know

4232
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Martin but Belgium, what you gonna give

4233
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
a nickname or not, not now?

4234
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
you're protesting? I'm protesting, I was going

4235
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
to give it before

4236
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
we, okay we'll assume I didn't say his

4237
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
name, it's too late, I can't do that

4238
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
cause now I'm like oh his nickname

4239
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
will be Martin

4240
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
alright

4241
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Dear Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, I wanted to email

4242
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
you this week since you were kind enough to remember

4243
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
on last week's show that you have listeners in Belgium

4244
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
I got your back, I got your back

4245
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I remember, why are you laughing?

4246
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
I just took that as a dig at you

4247
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
yeah cause I usually forget

4248
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
a lot of things, I really do

4249
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
congratulations on your 550th episode

4250
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
that's an impressive number, now on to

4251
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
666

4252
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
I listened to the show on my commute to work, a welcome

4253
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
distraction, I've been playing FTL

4254
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
faster than light this week, my god is it

4255
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
addictive, again, they just released

4256
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
a free expansion pack adding new ships, weapons

4257
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
and events which made the game interesting again

4258
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
since I got burned out on it last time

4259
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
is it the kind of game that incites

4260
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
it is the kind of game that incites comments

4261
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
such as crap, it is that time already

4262
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
I just played FTL for 5 hours and it felt like

4263
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
5 minutes, it seems to make time move

4264
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
around you faster than light

4265
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
that came with a winky face, that's an apology

4266
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
for that pun, definitely recommend

4267
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
it, also wanted to share

4268
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
something gaming hardware related, I just

4269
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
got a new Retina MacBook Pro recently which

4270
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
is pretty good hardware for gaming, an Nvidia

4271
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
750M, but tends to get very hot

4272
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
due to the thin form factor, I came

4273
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
up with a cooling solution for when I'm using it at my desk

4274
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
for gaming, I prop up the MacBook on

4275
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
a giant heat sink and have a

4276
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
120mm fan blowing

4277
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
cool air through it, the heat at the

4278
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
bottom of the aluminum case is conducted through the

4279
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
heat sink and blown away, I attached a

4280
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
picture, this lowers the system temperature

4281
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
significantly while gaming

4282
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
anyway, keep up the great show so I have something to do

4283
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
on my commute to work, greetings from

4284
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Belgium, the land of beer and waffles

4285
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
just one 120mm fan?

4286
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
you forgot fries

4287
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
by the way, I went to a place

4288
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
in New York City once, it was nothing but Belgian fries

4289
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
and dips, it was so fucking good

4290
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
I went to a place that was just all fries

4291
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
this weekend, it's called

4292
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Potato Corner, and they have

4293
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
six types of fries and they're all different flavors

4294
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
where is this at? This sounds amazing

4295
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Paladio, it's in the food court

4296
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I'm gonna have to check that out, I don't know what that is

4297
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
alright, there's a PS

4298
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
by the way before I get to the picture, PS I'm on my way

4299
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
to go paintballing right now which I also recommend

4300
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
it's like a real life video game and also good exercise

4301
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
well that's something Loki used to do, the paintballing

4302
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
I did airsoft

4303
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
paintball's a little bit more honest because you can actually

4304
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
see when you hit somebody and can't say

4305
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I didn't hit, what are you talking about?

4306
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
and here's the picture

4307
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
of the heat sink and the fan

4308
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
against the laptop, that seems to be

4309
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
pretty, I bet if Loki had

4310
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
did that when he was doing Titanfall

4311
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
his laptop would not have melted

4312
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
I did not have my

4313
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
heat sink or fan

4314
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
when I was playing Titanfall because I was at work

4315
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
and I don't bring it with me because it's fucking huge

4316
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
and also requires an external

4317
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
12 volt power supply in order to run

4318
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
those fans, and I actually don't use those fans anymore

4319
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
because my new laptop's pretty cool

4320
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
I just have to

4321
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
use that tray because it still gets warm

4322
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
on the bottom, just not to the point where

4323
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
it's gonna break

4324
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
damn you aces

4325
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
if I still buy you

4326
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
alright

4327
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
now onto our last

4328
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
email tonight

4329
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
which is a follow up to an email we got

4330
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
last week, which Shane you let me know during the break

4331
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
you don't listen to OLR so you didn't hear

4332
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
of this email, you know I was asleep

4333
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
alright, well

4334
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
last week we had an email

4335
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
from Dr. Noir

4336
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
who emailed us from Lima, Peru

4337
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
and said they could not remember the name

4338
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
of a game, it was an 8 or 16

4339
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
bit game where you place

4340
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
so here's the description of the game for you Shane

4341
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
cause you asked, so here it is, Shane

4342
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
you gotta guess, you ready?

4343
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
it's an 8 or 16 bit game

4344
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
where you place mythical creatures

4345
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
I remember unicorns and dragons

4346
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
on a hex board to do battle

4347
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
against monsters on a turn based

4348
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
strategy system, the creatures

4349
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
level up after they acquire kills

4350
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
the name and platform for the game

4351
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
is what I'm after, and a source

4352
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
would be appreciated since I wanna play it

4353
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
with my kids, Shane

4354
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
can you name that game?

4355
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
no

4356
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:29,000
what is

4357
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
crappy RTS on

4358
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
the Genesis or Super Nintendo

4359
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
and he wagered

4360
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
one dollar, no I put

4361
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
everything, it was like 30 million

4362
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
alright, well

4363
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
somebody last week got it right

4364
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
Dr. Noir's emailing

4365
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
us again, hi OL Army

4366
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
greetings from Buenos Aires, Argentina

4367
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
he's moving around

4368
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
he explains why in the email

4369
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
thanks for the answer

4370
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Master of Monsters it is

4371
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I played the Genesis version

4372
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
oh I got some of that right

4373
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
yeah Genesis or

4374
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Super Nintendo, yeah but it could've been

4375
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
8 bit, so I was still

4376
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
half right, so there it is Master of

4377
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Monsters it is, and somebody in chat had

4378
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
yelled that out last week and I think Sega gave him a

4379
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
free game for getting it, so

4380
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
thank you chatters, you saved the date, that's why

4381
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I love doing this live show, and I fully

4382
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
admit, sometimes I don't know it

4383
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
when we're talking about video games, and Loki don't

4384
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
know it, and Jamie doesn't know it, and Shane sure

4385
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
don't know it, sorry I don't know all the obscure RTS

4386
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
back from the 8 bit days, but we had

4387
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
the chat room to save the day, and it was Master

4388
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
of Monsters was the game, and

4389
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
he goes on to say Sky, sorry for the

4390
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
headache, it wasn't

4391
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
really your question that was causing the headache

4392
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I had a lot going on during the show last week

4393
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
there was a lot going on, everything's

4394
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
better now, and

4395
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Dr. Noir wants to clarify, I'm Mexican

4396
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
but I travel a lot for my

4397
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
sales job, listen to you soon

4398
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
we'll say hello to everybody in Argentina if you

4399
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
haven't already left, so there it is

4400
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Dungeon Buster, taking a bow in

4401
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
a victory lap in our chat room for remembering

4402
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Master of Monsters, and

4403
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
all of our listeners as well can finally

4404
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
go, finally

4405
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
and it's funny because my buddy Jonko

4406
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
from Koopa Club actually left

4407
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
a comment on the Orange Launch Radio page

4408
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
it was like, what if like

4409
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
somebody just made something up that didn't exist

4410
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
and sent it to your email bag, like how

4411
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I was like, I kind of thought that's what

4412
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
happened, like not that I thought Dr. Noir would lie

4413
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I certainly wouldn't think he would lie, but you know

4414
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
how like memory can change details

4415
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
sometimes, like you think it was one

4416
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
thing but it was- I know, there was

4417
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
seriously, there was seriously

4418
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
one of those fucking meditroid

4419
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
energy tanks in one spot, and I wrote

4420
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
down on like, cause back in the day I used

4421
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
to have like a place I'd write down you know where stuff

4422
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
was, and it wasn't fucking there

4423
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
any other time I went back there, and I know

4424
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
was there cause I got it one time

4425
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
and it was never there again

4426
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
damn anomalies

4427
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Well Dungeon Buster did not go away

4428
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
unrewarded, he does clarify in chat

4429
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Seg gave away a copy of

4430
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Dominique Pamplemousse, which Seg was here

4431
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
on the show promoting about a month or so

4432
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
ago, which is available on Steam, check

4433
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
it out, if you like kind of artsy

4434
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
games that are kind of click adventures

4435
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
that are musicals, check

4436
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
that out, Dominique Pamplemousse, and thanks Seg

4437
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
for giving that out

4438
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Black Wolf says master of monsters for classic game

4439
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
of the week, I was trying to pressure

4440
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Jamie into doing that tonight actually

4441
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
but then she ended up not being here and I was like

4442
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
alright well, Shane doesn't always get to pick

4443
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
so I'll let him pick, and I would not have agreed

4444
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
with that, this

4445
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
crappy RTS came out

4446
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
in some stupid time

4447
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
stop it

4448
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
alright, anyhow

4449
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
moving

4450
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
on, that is

4451
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
that is that, that's it for the mailbag

4452
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
get to the FUs of the week, thank you guys very much

4453
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
for emailing us, participate

4454
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
at Orangeloungeradio.com

4455
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
is the place where you can send us emails

4456
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
if you want to try and stump

4457
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
the hosts

4458
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
or ask Shane for an answer, then he'll just

4459
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
go, well it's maybe

4460
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
black or white or kind of in between

4461
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
it might be anything actually

4462
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
no, I gave an answer, it was pretty

4463
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
like the only thing I was wrong on

4464
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
or you know, not sure if it was the Genesis

4465
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
or Super Nintendo part

4466
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
but it was stupid RTS with unicorns

4467
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
or whatever

4468
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
alright, alright

4469
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
let's move on and

4470
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
get into the FUs of the week

4471
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight

4472
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
because Jamie's not here

4473
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
I guess FU2

4474
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
or future FU2

4475
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
I'm gonna have to make

4476
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
actual levels for my game

4477
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
and I was thinking about it today

4478
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I'm like, out of all the things I'm gonna have to do for this

4479
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
that's gonna be the hardest

4480
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
so, as fun as it will be

4481
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
making stuff, that's not gonna be fun to

4482
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
actually do because you have to

4483
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
you know, find a

4484
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
nice balance between detail

4485
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
and optimization

4486
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
little voxels

4487
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
a little difficult

4488
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
alright, Shane, do you have an FU of the week?

4489
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
I sure don't

4490
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
alright

4491
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I'm gonna take one that I think you wish

4492
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
you would have thought of, my FU of the week

4493
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
goes to PG&E

4494
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
man, it was fun

4495
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
who banged on my door at 9 o'clock this morning

4496
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
that were like

4497
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
we're here to shut off the gas because you don't have an account

4498
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
through us

4499
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
I'm like, because you remember, we just moved into this house

4500
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
about 6 weeks ago at this point

4501
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
and I'm like, da fuck?

4502
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I'm like, yes we do, I called in to get it arranged

4503
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I logged into the website and gave this lady my account number

4504
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
and she was like, dumbstruck, like awestruck

4505
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
like, how could this happen?

4506
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
what is this internet that you've talked about?

4507
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I know, well she even admitted, she's like, I'm an older lady

4508
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I don't know anything about this internet

4509
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
when she realized I wasn't

4510
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
like, that I had the receipts

4511
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
I'm like, here's the receipts, lady

4512
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
here they are

4513
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
I know, she backed off a lot

4514
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
she became very apologetic, she's like

4515
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
oh, something's going on, let me take that down

4516
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
well yeah, it's like, god dammit, someone

4517
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
all of us fucked up again

4518
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
well first off, Shane was like, how do you even know that was real

4519
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
and maybe I don't, like it could have been a fake truck

4520
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
or something, but

4521
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
well she was just so crazy in her knocking

4522
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
and doorbell ringing

4523
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
they didn't ask for my social security or anything

4524
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
so I was like, alright, whatever

4525
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
but yeah, I was like, that was a little weird

4526
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I think cops knock on like

4527
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
criminals' doors nicer, because this is what she did

4528
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
okay, etiquette dictates

4529
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
that you ring the doorbell

4530
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
you wait a couple moments

4531
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
no answer, you knock politely

4532
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
you wait a couple moments

4533
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
you may repeat these steps again

4534
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
she was, knock, knock, knock

4535
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
doorbell, doorbell, doorbell, doorbell

4536
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
knock, knock, doorbell, doorbell

4537
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
so she was my wife

4538
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
this is what my wife does

4539
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
whenever she goes to her parents' house

4540
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
and they're like, yep, it's Nellie

4541
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
it's 9 AM on a Sunday

4542
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
and I have a rock and roll lifestyle

4543
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
yes, I am still asleep

4544
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
and Alan

4545
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
obviously I made Alan

4546
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
get up

4547
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I know, I'm poking Alan

4548
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
get the door

4549
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Alan gets up and gets it and is like, the lawn

4550
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
better be on fucking fire

4551
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
so yeah, that's what it was

4552
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
so

4553
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
F you to PG&E for getting me up

4554
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
early on a Sunday morning, and then I was up

4555
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
you should complain

4556
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I did what people do in the year 2014

4557
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
and I sent a passive aggressive tweet

4558
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
that's what I did

4559
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
I would have called them up and complained

4560
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
because then you would be like, listen, they woke me up

4561
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
you said that I didn't have an account

4562
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
and you were threatening to shut off my stuff

4563
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
I had to show you

4564
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
this information that's available in your system

4565
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
maybe they would have knocked off some money on your bill

4566
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
we'll see what happens, I'm gonna see if I get a response on Monday

4567
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
because then if I don't get a response

4568
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
then that's two strikes

4569
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
they knocked on my door

4570
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
and didn't acknowledge my passive aggressive tweet

4571
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
come on, check what year it is

4572
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
I needed to get somebody that knew how to use a computer

4573
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
that was my problem

4574
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
alright, computer? what?

4575
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
what is computer? there's no computer in this house

4576
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
it's too small

4577
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
how do you internet?

4578
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
alright, which room do you have

4579
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
dedicated to said computer?

4580
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
couple more news stories for you guys

4581
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
then we're gonna get to you guys at

4582
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
where does the reel-to-reel tape go?

4583
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
or our username on skype

4584
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
orange lounge radio, all one word

4585
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,000
let's get to a couple more stories, Loki

4586
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
alright, so, talking about

4587
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
like, really strange accusations

4588
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
um

4589
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
ZeniMax

4590
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
they're claiming that

4591
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
IPs were thefted

4592
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
thefted

4593
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
um, see

4594
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
to el-duckface

4595
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
verbs?

4596
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
oh, sorry, el-duck-sauce

4597
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I couldn't remember the name

4598
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I hate, I did that on purpose

4599
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
ok, that was purposefully mispronounced

4600
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
alright, fine

4601
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
because it was funny

4602
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,000
tense is hard

4603
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
it's for humor, ok

4604
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
so yes, basically they claim that

4605
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
when John Carmack left he took

4606
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
some proprietary VR

4607
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
information and now

4608
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
they're pissed off and they think that

4609
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
money should be owed

4610
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
little do they realize that

4611
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
oculus was around before he left

4612
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
for oculus

4613
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
so, I don't understand that

4614
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
part of it, but whatever

4615
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
um, basically

4616
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
seeing as ZeniMax

4617
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
um, you know

4618
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
they send a formal notice

4619
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
regarding its legal rights to oculus concerning

4620
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
its ownership of key technology used by oculus

4621
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
to develop and market the oculus rip

4622
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I just don't buy that, I mean

4623
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I don't know, I

4624
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
maybe John Carmack was working on some

4625
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
VR stuff separate to the oculus rip

4626
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
but I don't think that, it's not like he

4627
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
left, formed oculus

4628
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
rift, and then that

4629
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
all happened, you know, it was

4630
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
he came and joined them after

4631
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
they already kind of had a prototype and

4632
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
everything, so I don't really understand what

4633
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
the point is

4634
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
um, I'm guessing that they just want a piece

4635
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
of that 2 billion dollars maybe

4636
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
maybe, now that Facebook's involved, the timing

4637
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
of it is a little suspicious

4638
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
of course, you know, John Carmack has, you know

4639
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
responded saying, no work I have ever done

4640
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
has been patented

4641
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
ZeniMax owns the code that I wrote

4642
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
but they don't own VR

4643
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
ouch

4644
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
you know, Bobby told a very, you know, as

4645
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I'm nice in promoting Bobby, even though he keeps

4646
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
telling me tonight I'm wrong, and Loki's right

4647
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
but Bobby told a very interesting story tonight

4648
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
on his show, uh, Bobby Blackhole's show

4649
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
that, uh, about getting hired

4650
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
for tech companies, cause he's been job hunting lately

4651
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
and, you know, some of the things that they

4652
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
expect that they're gonna own of you if you go

4653
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
for this company, and like, if you write any code

4654
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
even if you're not on the clock, but you're with the company

4655
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
they potentially own it, so

4656
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I'll let him tell the story, you can go listen to

4657
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
his show for the full details, but uh, yeah

4658
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
you know, it's kind of interesting how legally

4659
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
that all works when you're on somebody's payroll

4660
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
like that, so that's

4661
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
what they're trying to make the case

4662
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
they're trying to say that someone possibly owns the rights to flappy vog

4663
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
they could

4664
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
if Bobby did not put a clause

4665
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
in his contract or whatever, that's like

4666
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
vog is a pre-existing thing and you can't

4667
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
touch it, basically, if he didn't do that

4668
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
uh, which I think

4669
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
if I remember, I'm probably gonna be wrong again

4670
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
but I believe if I listen to his show correctly

4671
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
one of the people he was talking to

4672
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
and getting employed at was like, we will own everything

4673
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
basically, and he said no

4674
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
because he didn't want them owning vog

4675
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
but he got another employer that was like

4676
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
you know, willing to write out, you know

4677
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
things that, they, like

4678
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
who's interested in vog, the types of companies he was

4679
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
working for shouldn't have an interest in vog, it's not

4680
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
like, not the same industry or whatever

4681
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
we're interesting, what the hell

4682
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
I mean, they should be interested

4683
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
we're just not worth it to you guys

4684
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
we've only been on the internet forever

4685
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
but you know, whatever, I guess we're just not good

4686
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
we're not an IGN or Kotaku

4687
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
we don't run, you know

4688
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Loki, you can't get a fucking NeoGaf account, okay?

4689
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
we've been doing this for 12 years

4690
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
I don't even fucking care anymore about NeoGaf

4691
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
it's just like, seriously

4692
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
it doesn't mean shit, unfortunately

4693
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
if I write another forum thread about

4694
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
what game should I buy

4695
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
it's like, seriously, that is worthy of a friend

4696
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
that person deserved an account

4697
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
you know, to, you know

4698
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
that was worth it

4699
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
fuck it, I don't give a shit anymore

4700
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
well, speaking of things

4701
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
that have been on the internet forever and forever

4702
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
yet a lot of people don't seem to care

4703
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Twin Galaxies made an announcement this week

4704
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
I thought they were gone!

4705
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
oh, hold on, let me sip my tea

4706
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
I thought they were gone though, didn't they go under or something?

4707
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
nope, they're back

4708
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
I think they have a new owner or something

4709
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
but Twin Galaxies has announced that there's a

4710
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
24-7 internet channel

4711
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
dubbed Twin Galaxies Live

4712
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
using Skype and Twitch

4713
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
to foster interaction between broadcasters and audience members

4714
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
and there's also like a schedule

4715
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
of all these things so they can see what's coming up next

4716
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
the COO of Twitch said in a press release

4717
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
that since records are constantly being set

4718
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
and broken in real time on Twitch

4719
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
having Twin Galaxies on our platform

4720
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
is a perfect fit

4721
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
we look forward to seeing great gaming content from the Twin Galaxies team

4722
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
hmm, 24-7 internet channel

4723
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
fully interactive

4724
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
featuring things like Skype and video

4725
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
never heard of it!

4726
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
never heard of it!

4727
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
the only thing I'm kind of

4728
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
worried about

4729
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
is some of those records

4730
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
especially when they're doing like these

4731
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
high score records and stuff

4732
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
require like 48 hours of playing

4733
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I'm not gonna fucking watch somebody play Donkey Kong

4734
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
for 48 hours or however long it takes

4735
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
it's several hours

4736
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
I don't really mean to shade Twin Galaxies

4737
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
because I do respect the site

4738
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
and what it is an awful lot I do

4739
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
but with all due respect

4740
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
I have to go here, Logie

4741
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
with all due respect

4742
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
to our former home, All Games

4743
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
All Games Radio, right?

4744
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I seem to remember back in the day

4745
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
during All Games Interactive

4746
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
somebody that he had on the show a lot

4747
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
was Walter Day

4748
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
from where?

4749
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Twin Galaxies

4750
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
fully interactive content

4751
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
I'm just an observation

4752
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
I'm just...

4753
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
just interesting

4754
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
to be fair

4755
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
there's a lot of people doing this

4756
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
I think that they have now

4757
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
because remember they have the awesome

4758
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
games done quick type thing

4759
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
where they had an event where they did that

4760
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I think they're actually continuing on with that

4761
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
and that's still going

4762
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
as its own channel now

4763
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
where you can watch people do speedruns and stuff

4764
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
it's more interesting than watching someone try to go for

4765
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
the world record score in

4766
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
some game

4767
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
what's to say that they're actually

4768
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
going to achieve that

4769
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
score?

4770
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
so all I'm doing is watching some person

4771
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
who may not even be

4772
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
a celebrity even in the gaming

4773
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
scene or anything

4774
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
making an attempt at a high score

4775
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
so basically I'm just watching someone play a game

4776
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
which is any channel on Twitch

4777
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
any channel

4778
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
and these people

4779
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
who's giving commentary

4780
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
we're in hour 46

4781
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
of the

4782
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
high score challenge

4783
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
some people would make fun of the

4784
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Starcraft and League of Legends type of commentary

4785
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
so whatever

4786
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
what do you talk about at that point though

4787
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
when it's gone on for several

4788
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
hours you can't talk about the game

4789
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
wow this part of the game is really interesting

4790
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
he's gonna have to

4791
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
not die in order to make sure that he

4792
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
keeps a high score

4793
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
that's why they have

4794
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
those long videos that Twin Galaxy watches

4795
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
so you don't have to watch

4796
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
the 48 hour attempt to get

4797
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
whatever it is high score

4798
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
and granted yes I know not every high score is gonna take

4799
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
48 hours but it's still several hours

4800
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
usually

4801
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
in all seriousness good luck to them

4802
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
please tell me that they're gonna go for the records for the quickest times

4803
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
finishing these games because

4804
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
then they've totally ripped off the other channel

4805
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
alright

4806
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000

02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
I don't know if you saw this but

4850
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
last week you know

4851
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
how Nintendo is releasing

4852
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
the limited edition Mario

4853
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Kart 8 green

4854
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
edition in Europe right

4855
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
now I posted it on my

4856
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
Facebook and I said that

4857
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
they want $300 or I guess

4858
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
$330 for this

4859
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
fuck you Nintendo

4860
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
wait till the price drops to $250 then

4861
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
we can talk because I personally think

4862
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
that it's overpriced for the technology

4863
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
that's behind it and if you

4864
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
saw it became a very interesting

4865
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
conversation now a couple

4866
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
days later I checked my I noticed

4867
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
I have a message waiting for me on

4868
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Facebook in my other folder I go check it out

4869
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
somebody was

4870
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
really so butthurt

4871
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
that they decided to write

4872
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
a flame essay

4873
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
to me about

4874
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
why the Wii U

4875
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
doesn't suck

4876
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
and this is how Facebook

4877
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
is ruining America to be

4878
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
quite honest I just

4879
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
sat there and I just laughed

4880
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
and he's telling me

4881
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
that I'm a moron for thinking

4882
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
that and as he's

4883
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
trying to tell me it's better he goes

4884
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
into reviewing some

4885
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
new Mario Brothers or something else

4886
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
how it's so much better and I'm just like

4887
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
if you're going

4888
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
to flame me at least be a little bit

4889
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
more precise

4890
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
flame me straight forward

4891
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
I understand everybody has their

4892
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
consoles what they like and don't like

4893
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
because when I first got my 360

4894
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
I dealt with the same thing

4895
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I bought the 360 because at the time

4896
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
it has more games

4897
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
that I will play on it

4898
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
now that I have a 360 and a PS3

4899
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
if you look at my library

4900
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
I think it's

4901
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
3 to 1 of

4902
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
360 games of PS3 games

4903
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
some of the Nintendo fans

4904
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
are extremely passionate

4905
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
and you know

4906
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
I understand

4907
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
you know what's funny Rama

4908
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
there's people that listen to this show that call me

4909
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
a Nintendo fanboy and that I'm

4910
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
blind to all this other stuff you know or whatever

4911
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
and I kind of think

4912
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
I usually think I'm pretty equally

4913
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
critical and fanboy

4914
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
you know there's things I love about

4915
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Nintendo but there's things that really bother me

4916
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
about them too

4917
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
I don't think you're being fanboy-ish at all

4918
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
maybe you are but for every single

4919
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
console that comes out

4920
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
we rejoice

4921
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
for a while and then we're like

4922
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
wait what are you doing

4923
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
we gotta call you out and just

4924
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
play it down the middle

4925
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
you know

4926
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
so I mean personally

4927
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
I just look at it from a technological

4928
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
point of view I just personally feel

4929
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Nintendo is asking for too

4930
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
much money but as we all know

4931
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Nintendo is probably the only company

4932
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
that makes a profit off of their

4933
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
consoles

4934
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
right they do now

4935
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
I don't think they used to but they do now

4936
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
well from my understanding

4937
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
from back as

4938
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
8-bit NES they were making profit

4939
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
over every single console till the 3DS

4940
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
then they had to do the price

4941
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
cut and I think they're

4942
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
now making money off of that and

4943
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
did they profit on GameCube? I thought GameCube

4944
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
was one where they didn't profit I could be wrong

4945
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I think they made like between $15

4946
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
to $20 off of every

4947
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
GameCube sold

4948
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
that's part of their strategy

4949
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
like I said the power behind it

4950
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
if Nintendo was to knock it down to $250

4951
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
I

4952
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
had no problem going to Nintendo World

4953
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
or Best Buy whatever and giving them my money

4954
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
and walking out with a system I'm just waiting

4955
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
for the price to come down and I'm not gonna

4956
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
make the same mistake I did with the N64

4957
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
buying it for one game and realizing that I'm not

4958
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
really liking this game

4959
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
so

4960
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
where are things now with you and this guy

4961
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
like did you just end up banning him

4962
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
or what? no no he sent the

4963
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
message and he blocked me after

4964
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
he sent it so I went to my personal

4965
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
blog and I

4966
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
just said my piece and walked away

4967
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I mean what did he hope to gain

4968
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
from that whole thing I mean when you come out swinging

4969
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
like that he's figured out that I'm right

4970
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
and the fact that he's like

4971
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
I'm wrong he's like

4972
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
he also bought it for his kid I'm like

4973
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
you are not setting a

4974
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
proper precedent sir you need

4975
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
to stop yeah like I don't know

4976
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
like I just don't think that's the right way to win somebody's

4977
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
opinion over going fuck you you

4978
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
fucking fuck you know like I just don't think

4979
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
that's the right way to do it like I think just kind of like

4980
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Rama are you considering this

4981
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
or something like that might be like a better

4982
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
way to do it right exactly

4983
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
so if

4984
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
only more people in the gaming industry could kind of think

4985
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
that way not I shouldn't say the industry gaming fandom

4986
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
really could think that way right

4987
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
not just gaming fandom

4988
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
ain't that the truth

4989
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000

we're running a little long tonight it's already

5051
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
915 here on the west coast

5052
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
our first part of the show was a little bit long

5053
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
I'm actually trying to

5054
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
go to the twitter right now I didn't see a whole lot of links

5055
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
or anything come through but I think I saw some

5056
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
like FYI

5057
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
heads up types of things coming over

5058
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
I see darkdetsuya sending us a tweet saying

5059
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
apparently one of our other local indie

5060
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
podcast Fistful of Potions

5061
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
was taping at a local comic shop during

5062
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
free comic book day that's pretty cool

5063
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
cool yeah I wouldn't have thought to do that

5064
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
but I know a lot of people getting out during

5065
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
free com- excuse me

5066
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
free comic book day so that's pretty awesome that they

5067
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
participated I on the

5068
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
other hand missed free comic book day

5069
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
and I missed what was the other

5070
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
free day they did not let it all go I'm missing

5071
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
all the free days it's sad

5072
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
but anyway we have another call coming in hi you're on

5073
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

5074
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Hey Zaku long time no chat how you

5075
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
doing?

5076
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:01,000
Yeah me too except without

5077
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Gran Turismo oh you got a little

5078
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
rig look at that he can explain those cars

5079
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
he explained all the car names

5080
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
that Shane butchered earlier

5081
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
are you saying your goodbyes to Gran Turismo 5

5082
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
or are you on 6 now?

5083
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
So I mean they're calling online multiplayer

5084
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
so I kind of well I'm kind of

5085
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
regretting the fact that I never partaken in it

5086
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
so this kind of makes up for it

5087
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I kind of you know

5088
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
after a while I had to

5089
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
you know give in and buy 6

5090
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
but at least I have a steering wheel for it though

5091
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
so that's probably the only

5092
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
good the only good thing about it

5093
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
yes nice shiny

5094
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Logitech G27

5095
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
yeah

5096
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
let me see

5097
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
yeah that whole

5098
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
I guess that whole stick

5099
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
with the you know

5100
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
with call of duty

5101
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
essentially like jumping the shark again

5102
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
you know releasing the

5103
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
trailer for the new version

5104
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
and I'm just like wondering

5105
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
whether or not like

5106
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Activision is repeating history in terms

5107
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
of saturating the market with one particular

5108
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
genre of video game to the point

5109
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
where it's critical mass

5110
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
and it basically

5111
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
it just crashes

5112
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
well it's only one a year right?

5113
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I mean this has been happening in sports games

5114
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
since video games existed

5115
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
so maybe not

5116
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
sports games it's kind of expected

5117
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
you know

5118
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
you know players expect

5119
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
an updated roster to reflect

5120
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
the you know the current

5121
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
state of the

5122
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Zaku you were a big time Bamani fan

5123
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
you used to put out new DDR's every year

5124
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
and I think it was very disappointing when they stopped

5125
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
true but I got over it

5126
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
and that's why I have 2DX to

5127
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
fall back on

5128
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
but even then you do have a point

5129
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
in that you know they also release

5130
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
arcade mixes every year

5131
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
for certain of theirs

5132
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
but I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that

5133
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
everything that Activision

5134
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
has pretty much you know

5135
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
taken to the extreme ran with

5136
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
has pretty much at some point

5137
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
fizzled out for them

5138
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
and so I'm just wondering whether or not

5139
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Call of Duty is the next one because

5140
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
at this point Activision isn't really

5141
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
doing anything other than

5142
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Call of Duty and Skylanders

5143
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
wait a minute though

5144
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
because Activision has Blizzard

5145
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
which has a whole other thing going on there

5146
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Activision is partnered with Bungie

5147
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Activision is going to have Destiny

5148
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
that has the potential to be huge

5149
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
they also have Skylanders

5150
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
yeah well he said Skylanders

5151
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
aside from that it's just licenses

5152
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
like you would expect

5153
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
someone to be diversified

5154
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
let's say like EA for example

5155
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
which learned the hard way to not

5156
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
really rest on

5157
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
you know on a short thing

5158
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
wait are you counting out Cabela's?

5159
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
but that's like

5160
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
that's a cash grab

5161
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
that's what

5162
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
I just mentioned

5163
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
you know what EA did

5164
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
what EA did to diversify their

5165
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
portfolios they bought a bunch of other

5166
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
companies with the cash on hand

5167
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
they have the partnership with BioWare

5168
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
they freaking own PopCap

5169
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
and have just kind of ruined it

5170
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
as we all knew they would and so on

5171
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
who's more likely to take a chance

5172
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
on something new?

5173
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
them or Activision?

5174
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
neither, what's going to end up happening

5175
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
is that indies are going to be the ones

5176
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
that take a chance on something new

5177
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
the thing is the trend in the gaming industry

5178
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
right now especially the big AAA publishers

5179
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
you publish less titles

5180
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
but better titles and that's what they're doing

5181
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
they're sticking with titles that they're going to

5182
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
have no problems with

5183
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
although Activision occasionally will take like

5184
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
a license like

5185
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Walking Dead or The Fast and the Fierce

5186
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
and take a big pile of shit on top of it

5187
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
I don't know how you fucking ruin

5188
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
a Walking Dead game

5189
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
the game of the year version

5190
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Zaku, Loki makes a great point about

5191
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
the indies are going to be the ones that really innovate

5192
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
EA and Activision are probably kicking

5193
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
themselves that they didn't think of Minecraft

5194
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
they probably tried to write

5195
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
I bet you both those companies

5196
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
have offered to write Notch a blank

5197
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
check to get Minecraft

5198
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
and you know as much as Notch's stubbornness

5199
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
kind of drives us all bonkers in the industry

5200
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
sometimes when it comes to things like Oculus Rift

5201
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
you have to hand it to him that he has

5202
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
not sold that out

5203
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
true, that is true, he basically

5204
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
I mean with the whole Facebook

5205
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
deal he pretty much flat out

5206
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
explained why he didn't want

5207
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
why he didn't want to back that

5208
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
horse anymore because it was pretty much

5209
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
funded by a mega

5210
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
corporation that started out small

5211
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
but then it became

5212
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
a lot larger than it

5213
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
it just became something huge

5214
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
and something critical in everyday lives

5215
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
and that's not what he wants to happen to Mojang

5216
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
exactly, they don't want to

5217
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
jump the shark essentially in their own

5218
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
corporate culture, they believe in terms

5219
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
of not being

5220
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
the man instead of

5221
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
as opposed to just them going against

5222
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
the man which is what they're doing and

5223
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
so far I mean you know

5224
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
Mojang's doing pretty damn well

5225
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
especially for something that was essentially

5226
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
a beta for most of its existence

5227
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
I mean that was like one of the

5228
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
best selling betas you know

5229
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
long before DayZ

5230
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
on Steam and that's not even out

5231
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
yet and people are still paying

5232
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
$30 just to try the game

5233
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
that still might have

5234
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
still rough around the edges

5235
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
alright well

5236
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
Zaku I've got to wrap things up because we're going to be

5237
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
wrapping up the show but any other thoughts real quick

5238
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
I guess

5239
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
the only one I had that I was

5240
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
trying to get to last week was the whole

5241
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Nintendo basically

5242
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
doing everything

5243
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
in their power to shoo away independent

5244
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
developers meanwhile Sony

5245
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
and Microsoft I would imagine

5246
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
have like developer outreach divisions

5247
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
just for independent developers

5248
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Sony sure does at this point

5249
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
did you see this week on their blog

5250
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
Sony was like on just some

5251
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
random ass Wednesday or Thursday it was just

5252
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
like hey guess what BAM

5253
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
announcement BAM announcement

5254
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
BAM Spelunky PlayStation 4

5255
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
BAM I mean like it was like all these indie

5256
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
announcements came out in advance of E3 this week

5257
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
on Sony I mean not to mention

5258
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
I even bought Guacamelee

5259
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
like an hour ago

5260
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
on PSN I was just

5261
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
like trying to grab whatever you know

5262
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
some of the flash sales some of the things selling this

5263
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
weekend so I mean it

5264
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
gives credence to the fact that

5265
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Sony and Microsoft

5266
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
they you know they try to diversify

5267
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
and not just AAA

5268
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
games but just something that would give

5269
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
you a reason to buy their platform even

5270
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
if it's a small one. I would say

5271
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Nintendo's got a

5272
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
has got an image problem in

5273
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
the development community right now

5274
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
both large and small both third party

5275
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
and independent and people can argue with me

5276
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
all they want on that I think we would be fighting

5277
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
over the severity of that honestly but

5278
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
I think no matter where you look at it Nintendo's got an image

5279
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
problem they've got to fix.

5280
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
And it goes it further

5281
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
reinforces the point why developers

5282
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
are running away from the Wii U it's like

5283
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
it's like a redhead stepchild that

5284
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
they don't want to talk about because it's

5285
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
dated it's just

5286
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
like a I use this expression

5287
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
from the Simpsons of an episode

5288
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
where you know they try to reinvent Malibu

5289
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
Stacy but all they end up doing is just

5290
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
repackaging her with a new hat

5291
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
trying to get the Wii U

5292
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
it's basically the Wii with just an

5293
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
HDMI port

5294
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
we'll see what happens come E3

5295
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
and what Nintendo can do to fix that image problem

5296
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
but Zaku I'm going to let you go so we wrap up the show

5297
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
take care buddy. Have a good one. Alright you too.

5298
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Alright that is going to do it for the skype line

5299
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
tonight because we're damn near 9.30

5300
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
so I've got to wrap up the show I'm very sorry to those

5301
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
that didn't get through if you wanted to get on

5302
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
tonight's show and you weren't able to get through please consider

5303
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
sending us an email participate at orangelandtrady.com

5304
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
or you can send us a tweet

5305
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
on twitter.com slash o-l-r

5306
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
I'm going to check in with Loki real quick to see if he has

5307
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
any last minute stories

5308
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
yeah real quick there's a couple things

5309
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
one there's this game

5310
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
I actually saw on Kickstarter it's

5311
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
sort of looks like Jet Set Radio

5312
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
it's called

5313
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Hover Revolt of Gamers

5314
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
and there's gameplay

5315
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
they kind of describe it like

5316
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Mirror's Edge and Jet Set Radio

5317
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
well to make it even

5318
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
more like Jet Set Radio or

5319
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Grind Radio

5320
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
they have a stretch goal of 60,000

5321
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
which is going to add the

5322
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
composer Hideki

5323
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Naganuma

5324
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
which I hope I didn't mispronounce

5325
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
that but he was the original producer

5326
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
or the original composer for

5327
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
that's right Jet Set Radio

5328
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
oh interesting

5329
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
so

5330
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
that would be pretty cool

5331
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
and then this is kind of

5332
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
neat looking

5333
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
this thing called Project Evo

5334
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
and it's apparently an

5335
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
iOS game made by this company

5336
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
Akili Interactive Labs

5337
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
and apparently playing this game

5338
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
will be able to kind of

5339
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
evaluate you to see if you might be

5340
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
susceptible

5341
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
for

5342
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
what is it? Alzheimer's

5343
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
so that's

5344
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
kind of interesting and they're also saying that they're

5345
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
attempting to use

5346
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
the same research I guess to

5347
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
diagnose ADHD, autism

5348
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
and depression

5349
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
kind of neat game that can

5350
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
basically

5351
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
evaluate your state of being

5352
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
and

5353
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
last but not least

5354
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
this game actually I saw a while ago

5355
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
Hat in Time

5356
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
it was also another Kickstarter project and

5357
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
what's kind of cool about it is it looks very much like

5358
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
Wind Waker and

5359
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
apparently now they're having the

5360
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
alpha version of the game available if you

5361
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
backed it or if you have it on pre-order

5362
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
and it looks very very very pretty

5363
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
so check that out if you like the

5364
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
Wind Waker platformer type games

5365
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
and your games look very very pretty

5366
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
alright

5367
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
well that is going to wrap up another episode of

5368
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
Orange Lounge Radio but I do have one other

5369
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
last minute story, this involves next week's

5370
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
show, this is pretty cool, Loki I don't even

5371
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
think I've had a chance to tell you about this yet

5372
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
but next week on the show we're going to have a special guest

5373
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
we are going to have a live interview

5374
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
and this is pretty cool, we're going to have

5375
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
a live interview here on the show with

5376
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Christopher Tin who is the

5377
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
composer of

5378
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
Baba Yetu the song that won a Grammy

5379
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
the first song that ever won a Grammy

5380
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
from a video game

5381
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
so Christopher Tin is going to be on next week's show

5382
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
he'll be here live to take your questions

5383
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
so

5384
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
make sure you're here next week

5385
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
live Sunday night May 11th 6 o'clock Pacific

5386
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network

5387
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
live.vognetwork.com

5388
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
Christopher Tin is promoting a new album

5389
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
and we'll talk of course about his experiences

5390
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
winning the Grammy and composing

5391
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
for SIV and I definitely want to get into some of the

5392
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
questions about how video games kind of continue

5393
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
to influence him if they do and all

5394
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
that so he will be here live and your questions

5395
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
as well in the chat room live.vognetwork.com

5396
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
alright that is going to do

5397
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
it for tonight's episode, we're going to go around and get everybody's

5398
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
final thought here first

5399
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Shane, thanks for filling in tonight

5400
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
appreciate it, I'm sure

5401
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
in the coming weeks we'll see more of you

5402
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
especially now that you're back here in Northern California

5403
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
but do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

5404
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
no

5405
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
unless you guys can give me some stuff in

5406
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
Pokemon

5407
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
what Pokemon do you need, what ones are left?

5408
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
I don't know, I have their Dex numbers written down somewhere

5409
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
I am like 7 away from being done

5410
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
wow, you made progress tonight

5411
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
you're 17 at the start of the show

5412
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
go you, I know, I'm awesome

5413
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
alright, my final thought tonight

5414
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
is they

5415
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
need to fix that freeway faster

5416
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
because I'm not looking forward to getting Alan from work

5417
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
with all that stupid freeway mess

5418
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
stupid highway 50

5419
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
what freeway mess?

5420
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
highway fix 50, that whole thing

5421
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
haven't you heard about that?

5422
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
I saw, I keep seeing the things for it

5423
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
with your commute and everything, you never really go through downtown

5424
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
I have to do this

5425
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
I fucking hate downtown

5426
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
I know, I know, I like downtown

5427
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
but I don't like driving there

5428
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
I like the shops and stuff downtown but I fucking hate driving

5429
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
I hate driving to any major city

5430
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
well, Sacramento is a pre-major city

5431
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
but it's not like San Francisco

5432
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
but I hate metropolitan areas

5433
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
I hate driving and that kind of stuff

5434
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
alright, Loki, your final thought tonight

5435
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
my final thought is hopefully I have enough

5436
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
caffeine or consciousness

5437
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
in me to get some more

5438
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
coding done this weekend

5439
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
hopefully I'm going to work a little bit more on

5440
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
asset stuff so that the next video I do

5441
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
will actually be interesting

5442
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
and I have something to show

5443
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
it was funny, the first video I recorded

5444
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
the microphone from my webcam

5445
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
was on, I'm like

5446
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
why do I hear clicking?

5447
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
oh, it's picking that up

5448
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
and the second video, of course, I talk a little bit

5449
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
but see, I talk really quietly

5450
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
because I'm up at night

5451
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
like at 11 o'clock at night

5452
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
my wife's asleep, so I can't talk

5453
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
loud because I didn't wake everybody up

5454
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
be very quiet

5455
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
alright, that does it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio

5456
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
if you listen to the whole show

5457
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
thank you very much for sticking with it tonight

5458
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
we really appreciate it, you know

5459
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
we don't ask for money for doing this show

5460
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
I mean, we wouldn't necessarily turn it down either

5461
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
but no, in all seriousness, all we ask

5462
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
tell a friend or two about the show

5463
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio

5464
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
and help grow our family, because like Loki said earlier

5465
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
we've been doing this show for 12 years

5466
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
and no one knows

5467
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
so help us break that by

5468
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
getting more people to listen to our show

5469
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
we appreciate it, grow our family

5470
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
thank you guys very much for supporting independent radio

5471
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
and that's going to do it for this week

5472
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
I should be back, Christopher Tin will be here

5473
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
it's going to be a big show, so don't miss it

5474
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
next week, we'll see you then, good night

5475
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
but you know they were all still true

5476
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
see you next week

5477
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
thanks for watching!
