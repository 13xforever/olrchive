WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Repeat after me, I will not believe everything I read on the internet

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
Nintendo hardware, Smash Brothers rosters, the time to fake is high before E3

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
But could a relationship between EA and Comcast per video games on your cable box be true?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Find out this week on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Live on this May the 4th of 2014

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
With the 551st episode of our show

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
And yes, let me get it out of the way right now

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
May the 4th be with you, blah-di-blah-di-blah

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
But, for me, as a fan of Arrested Development

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Maybe not as hardcore as some other people I know

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
I would say it's actually Happy Cinco de Cuatro

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
And yes, I know it's totally wrong Spanish

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
If you see Arrested Development, you kn-

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Ah, forget it

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Alright, anyway, my name is Rob Roberts

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
And I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
With my co-host, sadly not here tonight, DarkSakura

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
She has the night off tonight

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
But we do have here in studio, Loki

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Hi

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Doing okay

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Hi

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Good, good to hear

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
What's new with you?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Not much, just looking at pictures of Legos

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Pictures of Legos? Why, are you planning on investing a bunch of money on Legos or something?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
No, just ideas

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I see

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
Have you ever fiddled around with that program that allows you to build your own things offline

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And then order the exact right Legos to make the thing?

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
No, I'd be afraid of how expensive it is

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
I mean, I just, yeah, it's gonna be expensive

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
We actually have a local Legos shop over here

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
That they sell cut, you know, pieces and whatever

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
So I haven't really gone in there because once again I'm afraid of how expensive it is

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
It's an expensive hobby from what I understand, so

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
There you go, good luck

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
And I noticed to the show tonight you brought your very own pizza

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
But you got your pizza well done

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Yeah, I always do

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Why is that?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't know, I like it well done

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Fair enough

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Alright, well since we don't have Dark Soccer here tonight

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
We do have another friend of the show here in studio to fill in and help host tonight

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
It's always good to see him and we might be seeing him a lot more often in the coming weeks

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Say hello everybody to Shane

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Hello

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Shane Olinko here with us tonight, how you doing?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm good

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Yes

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
So you live here now?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
I do

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
You do, you're back in Northern California, welcome back

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Thank you

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
And so we might be seeing more of you on OLR in the coming weeks?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Depends on if I'm awake or not

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
How's your rock and roll lifestyle going?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
Do you sleep all day and party all night or what?

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, partying is trying to catch Pokemon all night till like 5 in the morning, yeah

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Well how was the experience in Northern California?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
You came here from Kansas, for the listeners that didn't know

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And you've been on the show on and off literally over

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Like a decade

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
All the whole years, yeah

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I think I first met you, my god, when you were like 19 years old I think

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
And it was when I was living with Loki, when we had that first, like, episode numbers less than 100

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Was it 19?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
No

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I think so

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
No it was because we did episode 69 from the apartment

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, no, Shane was only like 19

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Oh I was 19, I thought you said you were 19

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Oh god no, no I was 24 when the show started, actually technically 23

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Cause the show started like 3 days longer

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah it was probably like 19

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah, so crazy stuff

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
So you're back from Kansas, and how does Northern California compare to Kansas?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
It's better

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
In what ways?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Name one and I'll agree

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
The weather

03:55.000 --> 04:03.000
Yes, it was 100 today, where I'm from back there, and they had humidity which makes it like 743

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
And let's see, how about the arcade scene, the games

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Well there's not really one here either

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
We can go to Golfland and have some sadness

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Oh my friend has his own DDR machines

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
I hear it's not so bad anymore because it's like one of the local Bimani enthusiasts actually runs a lot of that

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
See, when

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Scandia had Pump It Up, so I was happy about that

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
They also have the new Beat Media 2DX

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Okay I don't get that because when we went there, Shane and I went there when he was visiting like a couple months ago

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
None of that

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Yeah it wasn't there a couple months ago

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Shane we gotta take a trip

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
We can go play Spada

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
That's what it is

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
Alright, I want to say hi to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
We are at The Voice of Geeks Network, and we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Right after the Bobby Blackwell show at The Voice of Geeks Network

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
www.vognetwork.com

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room says, Shane likes California better because Del Taco

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, it's actually pretty good

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Okay, true story you guys, true story

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
First off, the first part of the true story

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
Shane, as long as I've known him, has been like addicted to Taco Bell

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
Like he's eaten a lot of Taco Bell

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
A lot

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Why do you like Taco Bell of all places?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I don't know

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I really don't

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
I've had Jim Boys

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I've not had Jim Boys

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
What a convincing answer

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
But their breakfast is really good at Taco Bell now

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
So I have to vouch for that

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Again, I've known you since you were 19, and to put things into perspective you're 30 now

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
So I've known you a long time

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
And in that entire time, I've always said when you come to visit California, I'm like we should go to Del Taco

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
You like Taco Bell, you're gonna like Del Taco

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
It's a very California thing, it's even better

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And you're like, no, Del Taco sucks, Del Taco's stupid

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I'm like, oh, he must have had it once and he never liked it

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Well come to find out, I just found out this past week

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
You never had Del Taco, so you wouldn't have had it

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Nope

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
And you were like, oh, this is so good

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Yes, except for their french fries

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Which, one, you're a Mexican restaurant, you shouldn't have french fries

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
You're stupid

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Two, refer back to one

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
And three, they were way too salty

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
There might have been some french fries under that salt somewhere, but I couldn't find them

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
People are gonna think we're on their payroll

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Their french fries are terrible

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
I think they're good, but people are gonna think we're on their payroll, we're not

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
And they have a hamburger, what the crap

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
I'm not gonna eat your hamburger

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
No more free advertising

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Now the bacon double del is pretty good though

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
No more free advertising, they want more advertising, they don't have to pay for it

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Alright

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I haven't been there in like

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
There's one right by

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
There's one, not to give away where I live

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But I mean, there's a few Del Tacos in Sac

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I'm just gonna say, there's one like right near us

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
So it's like, probably less than a mile

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
So it's painfully addicting

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I haven't been there since the first studio

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Oh wow, that was a long time ago

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, so like, you know

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
Alright

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
Also, I wanted to say, cause some people are asking

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Like, where was Jason in the intro? Is Jason gone?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
No, Jason's not gone, gone

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
He's just gone for the week

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Jason's traveling right now, so he had to drive a lot today

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
And we actually do all the shows production on Sunday

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Like I do the show roll on Sunday

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Because we want to make sure we get as much news as possible

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
And sometimes still there's breaking news during the show

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
So he wasn't able to do the production schedule today

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
So that was my voice in the intro

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
And doing the passphrase this week

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
But Jason will be back

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I think next week, but he's on a road trip

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
So I just didn't want everybody to go like

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Oh my god, is Jason gone? No, he's still around

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
He's still helping with the YouTube

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Which by the way, if you haven't checked out our YouTube channel

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Jason does archive all of our episodes on YouTube

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And you might be like, well, why would I want to watch something on YouTube?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Because it's really convenient

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Like, you can do YouTube on your 3DS

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
You can do YouTube on all of the consoles

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Sometimes it's a little more convenient than the MP3 files

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And we want people to be able to listen to the show

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
As easily as possible

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So if you want to listen to Orange Dance Radio on your 3DS

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
You can do that via YouTube

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
The only catch is that it is delayed by one week

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
The reason why we do that

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
We want to draw people to our site

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
To get the viewers and the numbers and all that

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Yes, I'm fully opening and admitting it is kind of a trick

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
To actually retain our listenership

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Because we don't want to lose everything to YouTube

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
But YouTube is an option

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
For especially the archive stuff

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And Jason works very hard on that

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So we thank him for all that

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And yeah, DarkTitsUya says he just saw that

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Episode 550 went up on YouTube

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It sure did, it sure did

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
So that was Jason that did that

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
He also likes to sync

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
When we're talking about the Classic Game of the Week

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
He'll actually put the video of the Classic Game of the Week

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
He does little things like that too

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
For those that are actually watching

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So as I mentioned, remember on Twitter

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I saw this thing about that they're going to be

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Marathoning all the episodes of The Simpsons

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And 552 episodes of The Simpsons

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So we have

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Recorded, including the E3 specials

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Because they don't really number those

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
More episodes than there are of The Simpsons

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
That's scary

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Well that's because most TV shows only do

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Hey, hey, hey, don't belittle what we're doing here

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
No, no, no, no

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
We've been doing this way too freaking long

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
But I mean, most

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
TV shows only do

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
What, 22 to 26

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Episodes in a year? If that

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I mean a lot of them are only like 12

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
But you think of a show like 24 is a great example

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
24 is coming back

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
They're having a shorter run this year with 12 episodes

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But usually 24 was 24 episodes

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Right? One for each hour

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
So most shows do that, but we

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Produce something like

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
46

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
At least in a year

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
It varies depending on how many weeks

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
We have off in the year, because obviously if you do one every week

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
You get 52, but real life happens

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
We don't always have one every week, so we do about 46

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Or so a year, so it's pretty

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Pretty crazy, a lot of hardworking

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Podcasters out there crank that out

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
There's probably, I know

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Some that were on a daily basis

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Got even more than that

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
That is dedication, folks

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
That do the daily shows, that is a lot

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
So, alright

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Anyhow

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I want to get to the gaming news

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
And our kickoff topic and our gaming weeks and everything

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
But I do want to kind of address

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
This in our kickoff topic tonight, because E3

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Is right around the corner

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
We're getting to be about one

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Month from E3, a little over a month

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
From E3, no word as of

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Yet if VOG Network will be represented

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
At E3 yet, we

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Put in our request about two and a half weeks

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And still haven't heard back, so Bobby

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
And I are getting a little nervous, because we don't know

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Where to do a hotel or any of that if we do get in

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But we're hopeful

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
But regardless of that

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Situation, E3 is happening

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
In about five weeks

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And all the big gaming news

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
A lot of it's being sat on until then

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
You're going to see some of it trickle out

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
As people want to get the jump on E3

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
And people want to build the E3 hype

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
You saw Nintendo do some of that this week

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
We're going to get into that in the news

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
But speaking of Nintendo, a lot of lies

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Start to come out around this time

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
About what companies are going to show

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And one of the big ones that's been gaining a lot

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Of steam out there is

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Nintendo is going to release new hardware

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
At E3

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, in a statement to website

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Computerandvideogames.com

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Nintendo came out, and this was posted on Friday

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Nintendo came out and said, not happening

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Okay, they basically said

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Reps told this

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
CVG site on Friday

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
This reveal is not under consideration

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
So that's on record

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
They are not revealing new hardware at E3

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Now, I don't know if that necessarily means

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It's not a new console

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Or anything like that

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Because I still kind of go

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It would not be outside of the realm of all possibility

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
For them to do another DS

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Type of remake

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I'm not necessarily saying

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Like a new, like a 4DS

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Or, I mean, right

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Or a DS that has new powers

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
But I would think maybe like

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
What about like a reconfigured 2DS

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
That would not be outside the realm of all possibility

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
To me

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
But it's like them putting out something

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
To trump Wii U or whatever

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Not happening

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
That's reverse

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Fanboy wank

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, I don't even see them redesigning the Wii U

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Because you don't really need to make that

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Console smaller, I mean, it's pretty small as it is

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And maybe tweaking

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
The gamepad or something

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
But I just don't see them doing really

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And why would you want to do that anyways

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
With everything out there

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I think it would be, I mean, for Nintendo

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
To put out a new Wii U this soon

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I mean, they can tweak the Wii U

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
The Game Boy Micro Micro

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
They can tweak the Wii U they have

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I mean, I wouldn't think it's outside the realm

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Of possibility that they somehow figure a way

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
To make the technology cheaper

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Maybe they reduce the size of the gamepad

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I don't know, I mean, again

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Or increase the storage space or something

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
They reconfigure the Wii U that's out there

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
For like a Wii U

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't even know what they'd call it

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Super Wii U or Wii U 2

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I don't even know what you would call this thing

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Wii U Lite, Wii U

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I don't know, yeah, just Wii U New

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Or something, whatever they call it

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I mean, they could slightly reconfigure it

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
But they're not going to throw everything out

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Where none of the games are going to be playable anymore

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
We know Mario Kart 8, they're hedging a lot on that

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And the new Smash Brothers

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
You know, I just

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I don't know why people believe

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That this is really going to be true

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I don't know if the rumor is that they're saying

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
They're launching a system that's called the Fusion

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
That's going to play all these 3DS games

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
And stuff like that

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Well, I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That Nintendo is going to look to marry

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Their handheld console

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
And their home console

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
I don't think that's

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Like, outside the realm of what is possible

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And you see them moving closer and closer

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
To that with, what, the GBA games

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
You can play now on your

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Wii U, right?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
And you even said a long time ago

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
They're going to do DS or 3DS games on Wii U

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
And then they did, they're going to do DS games on Wii U

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Yeah, it's going to happen

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And I even think they're going to do it with the 3DS

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
Because they don't really care about 3D too much in those games

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And they have the right aspect ratios

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
With your TV and your gamepad

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
To where you could do it

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
I mean, they say they can't emulate it

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
But, come on

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
They have emulators on PC that can run 3DS stuff

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
So, I don't buy that

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Here's my other question

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Why do people feel the need to lie about this shit

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Going into E3?

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Because they want hits

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Because they want, you know, people

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
Some people get off on tricking people

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And some people just want, you know

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Page hits or something

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Well, I mean, as far as page hits goes

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I've seen some real cheap ass stunts for pages

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Like, just even this week, on Twitter

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
There was a site that, and I'm not going to name the site

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Because I'm not going to contribute to their

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Cheap grab for hits

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I didn't look to see if they ever apologized for it

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
But there was a website that a lot of World of Warcraft

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Players kind of visited a lot

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Because I think their roots were kind of in that

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Or whatever, I see a lot of people in that community

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
That I follow because of Horde House

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
This site ran an article that was like

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
The top 15

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Sexy girls wearing

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Sexy girls holding controllers

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Was the article

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And it was literally like one of those

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
You click one for each picture

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
And it's just, it's sexy girls holding controllers

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
And sometimes provocatively

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Sometimes wearing not so much clothing

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Or whatever

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It was just, it was a really gross way to try to like

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Get hits, because a lot of these pictures

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
That were put up were from like charity

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Events and so forth

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
And you know, it wasn't

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
It wasn't a super diverse

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Group of women either

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
It's just, you know

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
It kind of reinforces certain

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Stereotypes that I don't think are good

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
For gaming, so obviously

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
This is a really stupid thing that they did

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
That's the types of stuff that you see people do

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
For cheap hits

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I mean, Buzzfeed has made an industry out of this

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Right?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
And sharing stuff on Facebook

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Like, we could do more of that

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
On VOG if we wanted to, but there's just

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
There's certain lines I'm not gonna cross

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
You know what I mean?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So, that's that

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Fifth dream in chat

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com says

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Those sites seem to finally be dying

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I don't know about that

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Unfortunately, you know

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
It got a lot of people talking about it

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And people checked out the article out of curiosity

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I wouldn't be surprised at all if they didn't

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
But it just, I don't know, it really kind of

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
It irks me to know that

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You know, E3 is looking for

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Websites of a certain volume

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And that's all they're looking for is a traffic volume

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
And they use these really archaic methods

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Of measuring that traffic

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
That's what they're looking at to see who is media

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
And who's not for their site

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And knowing that somebody is going to reach

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
These folks by putting pictures

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
That they don't even own in the first place

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I mean, other debate aside

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Of whether the pictures are appropriate or not

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
They don't even own these pictures in the first place

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Of 15 sexy women with controllers

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Like, knowing that that's how you do it

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't know, this is kind of gross to me

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Like, and it's like

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
I'm not willing to go there

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Just to feel

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Special

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
In going to the show or whatever

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Like, I am proud of the work that we do here at

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
And the

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
The commitment

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
That all of us, myself, Loki, DarkSakra

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Have to it and having done it

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
For weeks and weeks and weeks and so forth

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Like, I'm not going to stoop to those kind of levels

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
To meet these archaic

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Qualification things

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, fine

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I won't get to tell you stories from E3

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
We won't get to do the interactive stuff

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You can be spoon fed the same press release crap

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
That every other site is going to be running, whatever

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
But, you know, anyway

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Sorry about that

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Anyhow

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Shane, you've been awfully quiet

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Why do you think people

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Want to lie about E3 stories?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Why do people lie about this stuff?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Because they want

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Hits for their crappy sites

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
They just hide behind that

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
It's not always crappy websites

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Yeah, it is

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And a lot of times

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
They may be just trying to

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Not even say educate guesses

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
But just try to take guesses about things

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And that way if they're right, they can say

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Hey look, we said that first

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
And that's supposed to give you some sort of credit

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Oh yeah, the next call of duty

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Is going to be on the Golden Gate Bridge, you guys

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Now I'll just pull that out of my ass

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
And take a gamble

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
See what happens, right?

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
Is that?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Anyway

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I had to, I'm sorry

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I know that's a sensitive subject, but I had to

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Alright, anyhow

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's water under the bridge now

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
You know, you thought the usual suspects

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Would be reporting on this news, but it is what it is

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Alright, anyway

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
The types of video games that we have been playing this week

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
And then we'll get into some more gaming news

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I'll start with Shane

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
Dark Soccer's not here tonight, she usually goes first

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
But Shane, you're our guest

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
I've been playing, and I'm currently playing

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
A lot of Pokemon

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
I am trying to complete my

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Pokedex

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
That I've been technically working on for years now

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I am 12

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Pokemon short of the 718

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
needed

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
And I

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Have been playing it way too much

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Way, way, way, way, way, way, way

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Too much

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Now, why do you have to collect all

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
718 Pokemon?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Because the theme song said so

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Way back in the day

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
And you gotta

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
You can't go against that

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And B, you get this item

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
That makes it so you can find

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Shinies easier

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And that is what I want to do

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
And what does shiny Pokemon do?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
They look shiny

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
They look different

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
What does shiny Pikachu look like?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Dark or yellow

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
That's it?

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
I get blue

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
And that is enough for me to want that

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
You make a big

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It's not just you, but the Pokemon fandom in general

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Makes this big stinking deal out of these shinies

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
And that's it. They look slightly different

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
That's it. Yep.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
They used to have better stats back in the day

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
When they were first introduced

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And now, no, it's just

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
That one might be slightly differently colored

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Or sometimes they look really different because of their color

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I was doing a livestream the other night

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
On Twitch of Final Fantasy 14

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
And this person was in the living room with me

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
And he was playing Pokemon

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And he caught a shiny while I was on the stream

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I was so happy

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
And he took over the stream with Pokemon talk

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
He's literally walking up to the camera

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You told me to do it!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Because I wanted to know what the big freaking deal was

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Because you're sitting over there going

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I got a shiny!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
And it was uglier

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
It's like some Pokemon look a lot better as shinies

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
But this one did not

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
It looked like somebody threw it in an oven

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And took it out

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Oh my god. What shiny did you get?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Swirlix

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
I don't even know what that is

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
It's the cotton candy Pokemon

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Sounds like laundry detergent

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
So you are a Pokemon nerd

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Of the highest caliber

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Yes, I really am

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
You're 30 and playing Pokemon

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Which is fine

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I know a lot of folks that play Pokemon

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
But why after all these years are you still addicted to it?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
It's still a fun game

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
It's a little bit like gameplay structure

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
That works every generation

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Now it looks better on the 3DS

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
So I'm not going to give it up

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's fun to collect them all

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Or frustrating

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
It's both of those F words

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Alright

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Anything else?

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I played Final Fantasy 14

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Skylanders

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I'm a little bit infamous

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
And that's it

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
What have you been doing in Final Fantasy 14?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Playing Leviathan

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Over and over

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And that's the new fight

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
They patched in about 3 weeks ago

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
No, we're almost to 3 months

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Is this the Leviathan patch really?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Holy crap

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
2.2 was Leviathan

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
2.3 is coming out in June

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
2.2 came out in April

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
End of March

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Oh my gosh

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Wow

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Time flies

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
So I've been doing that

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And getting my items from there

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I want my water donkey

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And some things to upgrade my items

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
That's it

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Alright

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
We'll come back to Skylanders in a little bit

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
But we'll go over to Loki first

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
How was your gaming week?

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I played nothing

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Nothing?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
What's up?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
I've been coding

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh that's right

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Oh I've been putting stuff up on YouTube

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Every now and then

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Because I get bored of just looking at code

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And I wanted to see some actual progress

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
So I'll take breaks from stuff

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I was working on

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
I'm using this program

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Called Cubicle

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Which does voxels

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
To do the graphics

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So I made some test stuff

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It's hard looking at a box

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
And a box firing more boxes

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Than another box

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
I wanted it to look like something

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So I was just messing around

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Learning the program a little bit

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
I made a ship

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Just a really stupid looking missile

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
But I have video of it

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Firing the missiles

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Into big ol' volley

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
So you haven't been disconnected

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
From video gaming all together

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
It's just that you are right now obsessed

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
With this making your own game

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I'm absolutely obsessed with it

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
That's what I've been spending all my time on

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
I was trying to play some Call of Duty this week

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
But unfortunately I missed

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
The people I play with

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
By a few minutes

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Baby took longer to

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Rock the sleep than

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
They normally did

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
So they didn't see me on

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So they just said oh we're gonna call it

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And I was like ahhhh I missed you

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I checked a few minutes late

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Unfortunately it didn't sync up there

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
So that's what I've been working on

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
And I actually got in touch with

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Because my music that I've been

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Picking and stuff I have no budget

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So I have to pick free music

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And that involves

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
A lot of Creative Commons songs

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
And so I've been spending

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
A lot of hours searching for Creative Commons

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Work and I actually found

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
One that's gonna work perfectly for

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
The theme song

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
For the whole game

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
But the problem was it had some anime

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Samples in there so I got in touch with the artist

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Who actually is a huge fan of Shmups

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
And like that type of thing and he actually

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Wants to score Shmups and stuff

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
So I'm like hey

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Is there any way that you can make me a version of that

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Song without the stuff in there? He's like

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Yeah hell yeah! So I'm like

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Sweet so that was the big

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Exciting news today. I was gonna say you should put a call

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
You never know we might have listeners out there who are

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
Kinda musically like they might be

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Amateur music just like your amateur

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It's hard because I actually had someone

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Hit me up on Twitter and I don't even think that they

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Like knew anything they just was doing

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Like a general search for like people

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Making games or something

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Just like some of that music just didn't work

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
It was like a lot of hip hop stuff

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And it's hard to say like what

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Exactly I'm looking for because it's basically

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
I have to listen to the song and if I can imagine

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Like okay this is gonna

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It just has the right feel to it

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Didn't you try to say like pendulum meets

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Daft Punk meets or anything? No that's not even

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
That and actually you know it's funny because I was looking

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
For you know that kind of

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Pendulum drum

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Drum and bass stuff and I actually found a lot of it

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Just recently

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
It's actually I think it's another genre

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Of drum step so it's a cross between

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Drum and bass and dubstep they have a lot of that

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
So I did find a lot of that stuff

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
It's just a lot of it

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
This creative common stuff

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Especially the electronic music and

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Even there's a ton of dubstep for

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
One and two like

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
All the dance songs sound

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Very similar like they use

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Almost the same it's not like the same

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Instrument but the way that they

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Are structured is just like

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Oh my god I'm just like listening to the same

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Fucking song for 50 times

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
It's just ridiculous but that

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Yeah it's what I've been working on is just that I've been

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
I'm trying to get to

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Well I'm at a point now where I need to start making some

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Of the assets because

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
You know try not to explain too much

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
About the game because I wanted to you know

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm still working out stuff but

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Basically it's like if you

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Crossed a shmup with

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Borderlands so you've got you know

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It's a 2D shmup but your

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Ships are customizable in every

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Way so you can customize what weapons

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Are on it the way it looks and all that stuff

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
And each thing has different features and

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Stuff so you can literally play this game like

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
You can't almost any other shmup

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
You can play it like

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
In Igaruga or you can play it like Gradius

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Or you can play it like whatever and so it's kind of catering

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
It towards you know however you want

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Now I know that sounds absolutely complicated Bobby's always

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Saying you know don't do something complicated

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
But you know what fucking simple games

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Are fucking boring to me so

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I'm going to do something complicated and you know what

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
It's actually worked out fine I've had no problems figuring out

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
How to code anything it's just it takes

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
A lot of time and just like right now

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
It's interesting to me too to hear about

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
All this little shit that goes into games that

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Sometimes people forget like like the soundtrack

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
You might want to make a game and you

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Might want to but you might not know the first thing

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
You have no budget that's hard because

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
You got it you know otherwise you're going to

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Find free music that people want to have in

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
You know they use their music and then

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
On top of that like if you want to have a big soundtrack

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
You got to pay someone to make that music

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Or you have to pay artists to do that kind of stuff

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Alright you know Bobby is talking

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
About this in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Live on this Sunday night Bobby

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Says Loki is being Peter Molyneux

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Right now you will be able to plant a tree on the

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Ship and it will grow and Dungeon

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Buster says will the ship have a dog

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
The ship is

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Not going to have a dog and no

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
I hate to be compared to Peter Molyneux

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
But no seriously

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
That's what I'm you know I have set up

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
That's what I've been building is just this customization

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Through where you can

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Well I'm trying to do all the framework and then when I'm done

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
I can basically okay create a model

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
And put stats on it and that's it that's all I have to do

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Is create models and stats

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And be done with it

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
So that's why I'm trying to do all the coding

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
First but I'm getting to the point now where I need

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I have where it creates

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
The ship from the parts and I don't have

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Parts yet I just have this like stand in

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Ship model and a bunch of blank stuff

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
And so I'm running into

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Errors because it can't find these

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Generic parts so I need to create a set of generic

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Parts first so I can do more testing on that

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And then finish what I'm coding

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
So I'm taking breaks now to

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
You know well last night like I was like

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I'm too tired to actually code on stuff I'm just gonna listen

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
To some music so I listen to

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
About 200 Creative Commons tracks

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
And so I've been picking out

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Stuff and just

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
You know like okay this works because

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Creative Commons you know what was it

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
CC by is basically

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
All you have to do is attribute

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
The artist and you can use it in a

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Commercial product you don't have to pay

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Them you don't have to do anything they just that's it

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
There's not a lot of that out there and you have to

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Also know where to look and it's hard like

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
I

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
It's a lot of searching and a lot of it's

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Just like ugh

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Maybe there's some artists out there who might

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Want to help so hit Loki up on Twitter

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Sure I mean in the mean time like I said

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I'm gonna post stuff on my YouTube page

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And I'm posting stuff on

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
You know Twitter

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And like I'm not going into really any details

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Like I know what the title of the game is but I'm not

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Gonna say and I'm not gonna go into really

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
More details about anything else cause

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I just

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I don't want it like I just feel like I'll

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Jinx it if I do that yeah so

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
I like hearing how you're

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It helps too because you

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Sometimes are a big critic of video games

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
So having to feel the pain of making one a little bit

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I think it's gonna be very good for you well there's a lot of stuff like you know

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
It's like I made a save file

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I'm like holy crap I made a save file

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
It's amazing you know it's like

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It's like stupid

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
It doesn't even do anything right now

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Other than yeah okay what's it saving

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
I don't know well it's saving nothing right now

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
It's a bunch of blank you know data but

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
You know it's made a save file

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
It's a save file it's so amazing

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Going to the chat room

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Bob Blackwolf is saying to be fair Loki

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Who did give up multiple times already

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
But he says in parenthesis I'm actually

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Really proud of Loki I just don't want to admit it because

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Then I'd be a softy

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I was working on a complete different game

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
And I'll even tell you what it was cause

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Unfortunately it was you know it got

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Lost when my computer crashed last time

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I was working on another like F-Zero

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Racer type game I was like what should my first

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Game be I don't know I'll make a game that someone else

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Wants to play okay Rob likes F-Zero okay I'm gonna

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Get an F-Zero game so

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I was gonna make an F-Zero game

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
That wasn't quite F-Zero but you know whatever

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
And funny enough actually I was looking at some stuff

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
The other day G1

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
No someone actually first off someone made a game that has

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
The title that I was originally gonna call it

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
And then there was another person that made another game that

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Looks exactly like the game I was gonna

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Make I was like ah well whatever you know

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
I started over and this was the concept that I'm

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Doing now was actually one I had

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Like about four or five different things I was throwing around

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And at first it was like okay

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
This is gonna be way too hard I'm not gonna be able to do this

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
So I gave up on it went to the F-Zero thing

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And then when I lost it all I'm like well crap

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I don't even remember how I got on to doing a 2D

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Shmoop again but um

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Somehow I got on to doing that and then

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
That's where I stuck with it and so

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
It's been fun it's just

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
It's a lot of work and a lot of like

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I have to be in the right mindset to be able to

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Code stuff cause like you know I'll stay

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Up late I'll be really tired you know

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
A lot of Red Bull so uh

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
It's just getting in the right mindset

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And I wish I had more to show

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
It's just you know right now it looks very plain

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
Alright well good luck to you

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
We'll be looking for updates in the coming weeks

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
And now we'll understand why you're not playing as many

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
Of other people's games so good luck

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Um alright let me uh

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Talk about my gaming week cause I've played a variety

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
A variety of new games this week actually

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Um I played and Shane

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Brought this up earlier so I'll get right into this

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
I played Skylanders for the first time

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I had never played these games before

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
And it was kinda like Shane with Del Taco

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
As we were talking about earlier in the show

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
I was kinda like I don't like Skylanders

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And I haven't played it I just know I don't like it

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Because uh you know they want to sell you all these figures

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It's a cash grab and da da da da da

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
So Shane set it up for me and he's like

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
I don't own too many Skylanders

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
I don't

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
And he dumps 16 of them out on the table

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
That's 16 across 3 games

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Were any of them Spyro?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
No

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
Care about Spyro

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Neither does Skylanders

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
So yeah so I played Skylanders which specifically

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I played the new one that's on Playstation 4

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
So Skylanders Swap Force right which is the third game

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
On the Playstation 4 so you and I played that

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And there's actually we caught

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
The whole thing on a livestream and I even put it up on my

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Youtube channel at Rob Roberts Plays

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
If you want to see like us playing it for the first time

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I gotta admit it was a pretty good

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Looking game like you know it's on

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Playstation 4 so the graphics were good and there's like

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
These scenes

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
Which is why I specifically got it on PS4

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
There's these scenes where you're like racing down

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
A tree branch and around that looks like

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Something out of like a Sonic game or something

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
It actually looks really good

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
And the quality of that's pretty good

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
It's geared towards kids so you get a lot of loud colors

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Cartoony vibe, big text, short

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Sentences, things like that, the game is really

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
Geared towards kids

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
The gameplay itself is very platformy

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
Like you know

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
Somebody had called it Diablo

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Asked to me but that's

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I think the earlier games are more like that

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Probably

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
It wasn't so platformy back then

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
It reminded me like a lot of like

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
A kiddie version of

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Gauntlet which is fine cause that

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Like you smash pots

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
To find gold and you use the gold

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
To upgrade your characters you know

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's pretty basic platforming stuff

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And you know as a basic platformer

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It works pretty well you know Shane and I

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
There were some neat little co-op games in it like to unlock doors

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
You go through these little puzzles

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Where you try to join the green box

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And the blue box but you want to collect

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Little bolts on the way like it's a little puzzle thing

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
And they're fun to play co-op so

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Yeah it's a fun little platformer

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
I will admit overall I liked

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Skylanders more than I thought I would

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
That being said

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
It is completely obvious

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
There's a huge cash grab

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Going on here

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Especially with the in-game advertisements

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Yeah tell us about this Shane

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Tell us about the in-game advertisements

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
So to get like the final power for each character

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
There's these soul gems and they're littered throughout the levels

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
You go and collect one and

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It'll be one for some random character

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
And like the one we saw was for Popthorn

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
Well I don't have Popthorn

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Thankfully they let you preview

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
A video of Popthorn so you can see what

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
You're missing out on

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Mommy mommy mommy

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
So that's kind of dumb but

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah and

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
There's these little gates in the levels

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And some of them will be like fire doors

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
So you have to have a fire guy to get through the door

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Or you'll have an ice leaf door

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Where you have to have one ice guy

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
And one leaf guy or cause it's swap force

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
You have an ice top and a leaf bottom

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Or whatever you have to be both elements

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
To get through that door

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Here's the thing though and this is very important

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
It's not like those rooms

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Lead to full fledged levels

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
They really don't

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
It's like one room

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
But the thing is that room's gonna have

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
What? More coins

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Maybe a hat which is their version of armor

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Basically that changes your stats

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
If you want to really collect them all

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
So to speak you're gonna have to have one

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Skylander of each element

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Now thanks to swap force

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Not only are there elements

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
But there's powers

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Oh and don't forget the giant boxes too

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Oh yeah and the giants

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
You only need one giant

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
So now you have to have a

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Fire railroad or whatever

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
You have to get a railroad guy

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
What the hell else was there?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
There's stealth, there's the tornado ones

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
And you were giving me such crap

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
For not being able to go to so many places

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I was cause I was like why can't we go through that door

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
You're like I don't have the figure

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
You don't have the right figure

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
No you were missing a lot of them

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Yeah because I do not buy all of them

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
I buy the ones I like

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
And that's not always a whole bunch

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
So if you're the type that's OCD

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
And has to complete everything

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Do yourself a favor

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Stay the fuck away from Skylanders

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
Stay the fuck away because

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
It's gonna drive your OCD bonkers

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Yeah cause they already announced what was in the new game

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
It has 60 new characters to collect

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Collect

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Like it's in Pokemon

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Yeah 60 new characters

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Each character is about 10 bucks

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
So that's $600 worth of characters

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Right there

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
And I bet the trap team

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
The bigger ones are gonna be more expensive

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And then 40 new enemies

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
To capture which means

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I'm sure that each one of those gems

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Maybe you're gonna only be able to store

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
One enemy per gem or something

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
And maybe they'll be cheap and be like $5 each

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
That's how they get you

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That all being said

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
As far as like a platforming experience

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I actually had a decent time

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I would go so far as to say

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I might buy the game for myself

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
If I can find a deal on it

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
That's what I do like

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I didn't buy Swap Force when it first came out

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I waited until it was like

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
On sale for 35 bucks

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Which is 40 off the original price

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
But I'm gonna repeat to myself over and over and over

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I don't have to open every door

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Only buy the ones you think that are cool

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
And then you can always go back

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Cause the figures work up through the series

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
So if you have an old figure

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You can always bring it into the new game

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Find an old figure

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Remember we were at that place you hate yesterday

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And they had like the triple packs

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
They had ones that were on sale for like

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
10 bucks so that was 3 characters

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
From an older game that you could use in the new one

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
For 10 bucks

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
But they don't level up power wise up to the same as the newer characters

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
That's true but who

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Like I think that falls along the same lines

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
With the people that collect all of them

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I like that little air bird I was playing as

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
I know that was one of the newer characters

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I just need him

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Yeah free ranger

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It just depends

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Having played Disney Infinity is just as bad

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
They do advertise the same thing

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
And a lot of times you have to have a full set of characters

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
In order to be able to unlock

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Like stupid things

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Oh yeah and the blind packs are fucking terrible

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
I bought a lot of those

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
But yeah it was

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
It was not worth it

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
But the blind pack thing is not so bad

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Those are really only for the toy box stuff

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And you don't really need them

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Now let me say this

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
The one thing I didn't say about Skylanders

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Is the figures themselves

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I have to admit

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I'm going to call something out when it's bad

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
But I'm going to call something out when it's good

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And I've got to admit

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Those figures like the 12 year old boy and me

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Really love the figures that light up

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
When you put them on the portal

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
They're more expensive

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Well whatever they're cool

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
When you put them on the thing

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Like the one guy with his little jewel

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
The prism

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Is that it?

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
His little arms light up and I was like

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
That's fucking cool

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
That's fucking magic man

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
I was like that's cool

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And do they change the portal

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
The only time you're going to see it light up

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Is when you're playing the game

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
The prism dude

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
The only time you see him

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
Is when he's on the portal right

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
When it lights up

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Or is there other ways to get him to light up

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Not when you're playing the game

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
No no that's the only way

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
But it's also like those light core ones

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
In the game they light up more than the regular ones

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Like you could get a regular one

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And a light core one

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And the light core one will play slightly differently

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Because it's a light core one

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Which is neat

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
So the bottom line on Skylanders for me

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Is it's not awful

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
It's not even bad

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
It's a decent platformer

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It's a fine platformer

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
But know what you're getting into with this crap

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And don't feel OCD about it

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And realize that there really isn't that much

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Behind all those doors

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And there's a great resale market too

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Yeah I mean can you tell the story about that one figure

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Yeah I have one that I

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
Picked up while I was working one time

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
And I knew that it was rare

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
It's just an ugly variant of a figure

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
It's not painted right

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
It's stoned

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
It looks like granite

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And that's a legit

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Variant that they put out in packs sometimes

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
And that thing

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Can sell up to according to what I saw

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
$750 unopened

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Which is how I have it

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Yeah that's because of those OCD people

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Like oh I've got to get every single variant

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Like your ex right?

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Yeah exactly

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
And he didn't get that one

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
There's like one that they did

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
For the holidays for Activision

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Blizzard employees too

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I mean I thought it looked pretty cool

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
And I know that one sells for a lot also

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And that was the only way you could get it was if you were an employee at that party

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And Bobby says he got one at E3

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
That apparently is an early good seller too

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
So yeah

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Alright so anyway there you go

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
That's Skylanders

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Not as horrible as some people think

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
But yes it's a cheap cash grab

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Be very careful

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Just wait for your kids

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I'm really surprised they have it

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Well there was the

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Rumble blast

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That wasn't done

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
They didn't execute that well at all

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
No

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
The figures were like

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
An inch tall

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
They were really crappy figures

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I don't know what the hell they were thinking

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
They didn't do it right

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
If they were to do it right

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I'm trying to get 718

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
In a stupid game right now

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's so futile they release a new game every year

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
And then it's just you know you have more

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Pokemon you gotta you know

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah but at least now they have that bank feature

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
In this game where I can put all these guys into

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
The Pokemon bank and when the new game comes out

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I can bring them back in so I never have to

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Find them again

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Hope that save doesn't corrupt

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Oh don't say that

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
They all go to the cloud

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
All my Pokemon are in the cloud

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
As long as the cloud doesn't burst

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Or you get hacked

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Chinese or Russian hackers take all your Pokemon

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
They took my Pokemon

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I would declare war on that over country

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Alright

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Other games I played this week

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I played a demo for a game called Child of Light

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
That's brand new

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
I did that one too I forgot about that one

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You played it? I did the demo

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
You turned it off after like 5 minutes

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
I liked it I actually liked it quite a bit

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
The thing I liked about it a lot

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Is that it did a lot of

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Different stuff I don't see in RPGs

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Very often like you know a lot of RPGs

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Kind of the same

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Same thing over and over

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
But Child of Light did some really neat stuff where

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
The right stick controls this

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Extra little monster that can float around

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
The battle, well I say monster but it's really an ally

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
But this extra little fairy or whatever

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
They can float around the battlefield and like

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Freeze monsters or

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Heal your people

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
I thought that was like a really neat mechanic

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
It was a really stupidly simple thing but

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I can't think of another RPG I've seen that in

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Which I really liked that

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Yeah that was neat but

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
The gameplay like the actual

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Combat system I thought was crap

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Well it's very basic RPG

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
You know either you like it or you don't

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
They really should have just made it a platforming game

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Everything else about the game was great I can't deny that

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It's a really gorgeous game Music is great

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Music is great and

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Everything rhymes which is interesting

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Just a little way to do it but

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Yeah and that's cool but

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
It's a decent combat system if you're gonna do that

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
See now here's what I disagree with

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Actdeft in chat says

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Child of Light reminds me of Bravely Default but better

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
And by better I mean could

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Wow

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I do not think Child of Light was better than Bravely Default at all

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Bravely Default is amazing and Child of Light

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Is a piece of crap

43:16.000 --> 43:20.000
A really pretty sounding and pretty looking piece of crap

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I did not think that rhymes

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
I didn't think it was a piece of crap at all but Bravely Default

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Bravely Default on one hand was a very familiar game

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Bravely Default had a very familiar sense about it

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And it did do some new things within that

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
With the whole street passing and some of that stuff that Bravely Default does

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Bravely Default

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Bravely Default was like

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Bravely Default was like

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Bravely Default was like going to see

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Bravely Default was like going to see

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Bravely Default was like going to see

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
A new Harry Potter movie

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
That comes out in the series

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Like you know what you're gonna get

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
You've read the book already

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
It's kind of the standard stuff

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Whereas Child of Light was different

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
It was more of an art house indie film

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
It's doing some new things

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
You don't necessarily know what to suspect

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
People respond differently to it

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Shane hated it

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Are we saying that Bravely Default would be like Labyrinth

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Whereas Child of Light is like Pan's Labyrinth

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
But did you hate Pan's Labyrinth?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I didn't really care for it

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It was very visually pretty

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Ok then yes

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
That is actually a really good example

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Labyrinth is my favorite movie of all time

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Pan's Labyrinth

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
They're the people that like

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Stupid Child of Light

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
And probably Ni No Kuni

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
So they're awful people

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Whatever

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
So yeah Child of Light I played that

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
I did not actually get the full game yet

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But I probably will to be honest

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Other than that I've been playing a lot of the same stuff I talked about last week

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Shane really enjoys watching me play NES Remix 2

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
It's over now though so I'm very sad

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
He says it's over because I beat all the

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Well I didn't beat all the stages

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
I will not fucking play Wario's Woods

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I will not

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I tried with Wario's Woods

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
What the fuck is that game seriously?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And I like puzzlers

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
But Wario's Woods has got to be one of the worst

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
ones I've ever played

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I would put that up there with Tetris on the Playstation

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
If you've ever played the Playstation port

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
PS1 port of Tetris

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
It's god awful

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
And I would put Wario's Woods up there with that

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
It's that bad

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
So I refuse to play those stages

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Shane watched me get really frustrated

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
It was so funny

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
The Kirby stages

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Were the worst to me

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Where he had to float up and not get hit

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
By the spikey things

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And it was like 20 minutes of him getting hit by the spikey things

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
And I was laughing so hard

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
It's a bummer you can't

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Live stream that gameplay

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
And the whole internet could have had a lull at that

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
But it's so frustrating

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Just remind me seriously

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
To bring my

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Capture thing

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I have a capture thing too

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
But it's delayed

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Oh my god bring it over

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
And he can play that stage

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Over and over again

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
What was another one that you sucked at?

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
There were a lot of them

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
ActDeft is screaming at me in chat

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Wario's Woods is awesome

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
It's different but it's good

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
Now I'm talking about Kirby

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I don't dislike Kirby though

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
I like Kirby

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I dislike what they did in NES Remix 2

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
But no it was fun

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I gotta say

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Spoiler alert for NES Remix 2

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
I don't think this is a big deal

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
But the very last stage

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
In the second set of remixes

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
The very last stage is

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
You save the princess as the princess

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Meaning you beat Bowser

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
In Mario Brothers 3

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
With Super Mario Brothers 2 princess

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
They showed them the trailer

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Well then it's not that big of a spoiler

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
But you know where she does the floaty

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
And you can't get hit because if you get hit she dies

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
She's a one hit kill or whatever

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
She's a woman

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
Stop it, not cool

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
But the frog Mario thing

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Was the same way

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
You get hit one hit and they die

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
But anyway with the princess you get hit once

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
And she dies

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
But what's really funny is that when you beat it

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
She goes through the door

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
And gets to the castle

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
And it's the princess meets the princess

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Sorry but you are in another castle

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Or something like that

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
It changes the words

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
So that it's an old play on that joke

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
I'm sorry but our princess is in another castle

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
But then it's like sorry but you are in another castle

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Ha ha ha just kidding

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
And then that's the end of the stage

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
You know what would have been a good remix

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Is something to do with the part in Punch-Out

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Where you're on the bike and your trainer is running after you

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
That could have been a fun stage

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
They didn't do enough with Punch-Out in that game

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
They didn't do enough with Punch-Out

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I don't think there was a single remix stage that you just punched out

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
No I think it was like

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
You know one of the last remixes

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Where it was like eight different stages

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
The lights went out

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Silly

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
That would be funny to have Punch-Out where he's just

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Punching other things in the air

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Punch the

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Well they did like Mario 2 is in there

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So why couldn't they have put

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Wart in there instead of King Hippo

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
So you'd have to punch Wart or something

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
That would have been cool

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Punching the eggs from Birdo or something

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Yeah

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Or punching ducks from Duck Hunt

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
That would be hilarious

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Go to our chat room

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
As soon as Shane cracked that joke

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Rama's like no Jamie tonight

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Where's Dark Soccer to smack him into place

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
No Jamie is off for the night

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
She wouldn't smack me

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
She would give me a look

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
And I would say I'm sorry

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Made a huff yes

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
And then I've been like let's go play Final Fantasy 14

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Alright

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
She might be listening be careful

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
No I just said my apologies

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
I know I know

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
He's not serious guys

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Anyhow

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I think that's really all I have for my gaming week

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I mean otherwise Final Fantasy 14, Diablo 3

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
All the same stuff I always play

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
So yeah

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I will give a cheap plug for my Twitch channel though

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Because ever since I got my new computer

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
I've been doing a lot more with it

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
And your PS4 you've been doing a lot more with

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
And my PS4 yeah I've been streaming on both

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Rob Roberts

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Oh that's something that you should have said

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
When we were doing Skylanders you could not see chat

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
And I wonder if that's something to do with the game

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I don't know

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Yeah they updated because the Playstation update

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Changed some things like the Share Factory is really cool

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
I gotta say

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
If you haven't checked out Share Factory

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Check it out because it makes movie making really easy

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
That was a great move on Sony's part

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
To really get people to share more of their

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Gameplay footage that's being saved

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
It's really a powerful little program

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
But they also upgraded the Twitch functionality

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Now I don't like the new layout

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Because they put chat on the side

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
So you could I guess see more of it

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Instead of more than two lines

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
You could see a little more

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
But it word wraps

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It doesn't word wrap at all really

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
And then in the bottom it's just elapsed time

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
I liked it better with the scrolling messages at the bottom

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And the elapsed time

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
But you can get rid of those borders completely

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And just have the camera

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
You couldn't do that before

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
So that's pretty cool

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
That's the one feature I would like to see

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Because in Final Fantasy XIV I could put the camera

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Over the chat box so that

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
The people in my free company

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
When I'm live streaming

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
They don't feel like they have to censor themselves

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Because what's being said is broadcast on the internet

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Or whatever so

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
Bobby Blackwolf in the chat says

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
I'm on Raw TV

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
On a new line

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
That's what it looks like when you're chatting on the

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Twitch TV now

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Quick housekeeping

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
I don't have a whole lot to add

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I will say follow us on Twitter

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Also Facebook, facebook.com slash

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
OrangeLoungeRadio and Google Plus

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I do want to mention a few things with VOG Network

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Again our show tapes live

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
The Voice of the Geeks Network

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
That's vognetwork.com

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
If you haven't checked out the new TV reviews section

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
TV reviews by Critical Myth

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I really urge you guys to check it out

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Because the crew over at that show

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Critical Myth has been really diligently every week

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Like they're pushing like 10 to 15

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
New reviews of TV shows to our site

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
It's like all this new content, it's great

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
And you can interact with it

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
And when you interact with it you might receive some

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Loot and the loot helps you

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
Get raffle tickets

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And the raffle tickets

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
We do have a raffle, the raffle's been on hiatus

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
For a few months just because you know we fund it

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Completely out of pocket so

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Sometimes we would rather

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Pay to keep the site running than pay for a new raffle

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
But we do have a raffle this month and it is

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
I believe season 1 of Arrow

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
The new series on the CW on Blu-ray

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
So if you want to win that

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
You're curious to check it out, you want to win it

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Or maybe you're a fan of Arrow and you just want to get it for free

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Because you don't want to buy it because I don't think it's a cheap Blu-ray

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Go enter the raffle

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And you can get participation points at VOG Network

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Just for listening to this program

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Somewhere in the show you're going to hear

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
If you're listening live you can check in on the site

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
As the show is broadcasting live

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
But if you're listening on the podcast at some point during the show

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You're going to hear that little doodle-a-doo

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
And then it will say to register participation

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
The pass phrase is and then you type in that phrase

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
You get your five points and that's five tickets into the raffle

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Really cool stuff

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
And that's just a little something we give our

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Fans and participators

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Just to try and increase awareness of the site

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
And all the cool things that we have there

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
So check that out once again

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
vognetwork.com

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Alright, do remember though

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
The raffle is opt-in

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
You have to go say

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Yes, I want to enter the raffle

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
You are not entered automatically

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
So you're going to want to check that out at vognetwork.com

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Slash raffle

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
You are not entered automatically

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
And I believe this particular contest is US residents only

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
I am so sorry to our overseas listeners

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
It's just that the cost of mailing

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
And all that, we can't do everything

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
But we do try once in a while to have something

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Digital or something

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
That is much more lightweight

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
That we can send overseas

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
We have done some overseas

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Unbelievable ones

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
So I just want to make sure you guys know

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
It's not that we don't like our overseas listeners

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Because we love them very much

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
But the reality is the cost to include you guys

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Is a lot more

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So check that out, vognetwork.com

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Slash raffle

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Alright, now let's get into some gaming news

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
There's plenty of it

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Despite the fact that we're only a few weeks away from E3

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
There's still lots coming

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
So Loki, start us off

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Yes, if you thought that Comcast

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
Well, EA is looking to Comcast to sign a deal

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
That would make EA published games available on Comcast

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
This doesn't make it confusing enough

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
X1 television operating system

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Yes, there's the X1 Comcast box

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
And the Xbox One

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
And both now play games

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Wow, confusing

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
I guess they're saying that

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
The X1 is an HTML5 based streaming platform

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
And I guess it has

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
Now, I thought that was only a DVR

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
But I guess they're saying it's gonna have

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
Internet cloud support

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Apps and that kind of stuff

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
But now you'll be able to stream

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Games to it

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
The lineup so far is probably gonna include

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
A new FIFA, Madden, Monopoly

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
And Plants vs. Zombies

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
So not necessarily like

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
Battlefield 4 or anything like that

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
But more of kind of a

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
Not casual, but just kind of for everybody type stuff

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
Of course, they're still figuring out revenue share

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
And release date stuff

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
But yeah, so you'll be able to

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Another platform you'll be able to stream games to

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
I just think, man, the name of that is just fucking

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
X1 and Xbox One

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
And now they both do games

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
I wonder if that will cause some legal ruffles

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
But it's Xfinity

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
I think Xfinity had the X1

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Before the Xbox One

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Wow, okay, that's gonna be interesting

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Yeah, the newer Comcast boxes

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Are pretty powerful little things

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
They're basically Apple TV type units

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
They're little computer things

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
They're really powerful

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
The old clunker we have

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Was one of the first HD units

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
So that's what it does, but that's about it

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
And I think it does DVR too

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
But we don't pay for it

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
I think these do the room to room DVRs

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
And that kind of stuff

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
So they have all that functionality

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
But I wouldn't imagine

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
Oh yeah, the new ones do everything

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
I'm surprised

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
I don't think you're gonna find a Netflix app on this thing

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Or anything like that

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
You might in the future

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
For money, yeah

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
What doesn't have Netflix nowadays?

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Well, I would think though

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
Comcast, a pay-per-view content provider

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
Would probably be less likely to want to include

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
A service that you can get same content

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
No, Comcast and Netflix are playing nice nice now

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Thanks to Net Neutrality being fucked over

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Netflix is paying Comcast money

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Which is bull, absolute bull

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
But what can we do right now

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Besides petition our lawmakers

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Which is what people are trying to do

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
And need to do a little more of

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
To push the importance of this issue

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
That we need Net Neutrality

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Or this type of wheeling and dealing

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
We're gonna be the losers in it

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
And when you guys bitch about

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
It costs too much

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Or Comcast sucks because they limit

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
And I can't do it

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
Then maybe you should have complained about it before

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
How long until we see someone streaming a game

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
To an Xbox One through an Xbox One

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Well, if we are able to stream games at all anymore

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
That aren't, you know, Comcast approved

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
Who knows

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Hey, that's why EA's getting into the ground floor of that, right?

56:28.000 --> 56:29.000
Yeah

56:29.000 --> 56:30.000
I guess

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
They know evil when they see it

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
So they're attracted to it

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
Both, of course, winners of the worst company in America

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Yeah, right

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
A few times over

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
So, you know, they're in good company

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Oh boy

56:42.000 --> 56:45.000
So, alright, you know, I'm all for more games

56:45.000 --> 56:46.000
Getting out there and everything

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
But this is just kind of one of those things where it's like

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
This is why I need Net Neutrality

56:51.000 --> 56:55.000
Because I don't want this to be the only way to play games

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
That makes sense

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
So

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Yeah, I

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
This is all still rumor status, though, right?

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
Although it's one of those things that seems very plausible

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
I don't think it's rumor status

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
I think that they're actually working on it

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
It's just, I don't think it's gonna be that big of a thing

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
It's just because they're gonna be streaming games

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
It doesn't mean a lot of people are gonna take advantage of it

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Because I think people that are gonna play like, you know, Plants vs. Zombies or something

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Aren't probably gonna do it through a cable box

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
They're probably gonna do it on a PC or tablet or whatever

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
I think it's just

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
It's more exposure to those games, I guess

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
And, you know, exposure's not terrible

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
It's just, you know, they have to weigh the cost and benefit, I guess

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
Rama says, just what we need, a multimedia cable box, pass

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Well, that's kind of already here, I think

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
But Rama also says

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
I think that was a joke

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
The X1 box was made by Motorola, which is now ARIS

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
That sounds like Yaris

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Um, Loki, here's an FAQ

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
And links you to something there about more information

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
ARIS won survivor one year

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
No, this one's spelled A-R-R-I-S

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Oh, okay

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
Alright

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
And let's see, Kaijuto says, Netflix sounds like they want to become a cable network

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
And not what people love about it

58:05.000 --> 58:11.000
I don't know, I mean, I sort of saw the Netflix originals not really wanting to be their own network

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
Just so much as, you know, I always thought it was kind of a way to kind of compete with cable

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
I think that's, it's just, you know, why do I need to get Netflix

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
You know, save contents on TV

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Well, it's because you can get this other stuff

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
You know, they want to, it's like, why do I want to subscribe to HBO

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Because there's a show I want to watch on it

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Or there's a couple shows I want to watch on it

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
It's not like a ton of

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
I want to see Game of Thrones boobies

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
You know, they have tons of movies on there

58:33.000 --> 58:36.000
But they're trying to be like, you know, an HBO or Showtime

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
And yes, the way they can do that is more boobies, more skinimax

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
So that's what they need on Netflix

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
They do have the women in prison show

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
That's not entirely skinimax, but yeah, I understand what you're saying, but

58:49.000 --> 58:53.000
Alright, well speaking of television and so forth

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
You know what, Netflix isn't the only one that wants to put their own programming out there

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
I think you guys remember, Xbox is getting into this

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
We talked at length last week about the whole, they dug up ET in the desert

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
That was all for an Xbox original

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
Xbox wants to do original television

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
Somewhere in between major game releases

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
They're talking about premium television experiences

59:16.000 --> 59:22.000
And you know, they hired some big TV executives to kind of do all this stuff

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
And yeah, they want to do these Xbox originals

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
And things out of the Xbox entertainment studios to hold you over between major game releases

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
And see, that's another thing that they're trying to do

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
Like this, you know, they want to be an HBO or something

59:36.000 --> 59:39.000
So that you would buy their system so you can watch this content

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I just don't see that happening

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
By the way, they are going to be bringing to the Xbox originals

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
The Halo television series

59:47.000 --> 59:51.000
Every Street United, which is an unscripted, so reality show

59:51.000 --> 59:54.000
Series of eight 30 minute episodes and a one hour finale

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
It's soccer, soccer players

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
Bonnaroo, which is the music and arts festival

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
They're doing something with that

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
And then Signal to Noise, Atari Game Over

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
These are a film documentary series

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
And Atari Game Over is about the whole stuff in the ground

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And then something called Humans

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Which is produced with UK broadcaster Channel 4

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And it's going to be an hour long eight episode series

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
So, hmm

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So yeah, they're going to start cranking these out

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
By the way, they say that everything is fair game for these TV shows

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Talking at a press event in San Francisco

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
The Vice President of Xbox Entertainment Studios, Jordan Levin

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Said that games like Forza Motorsport, Fable, Gears of War

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Not off the table when it comes to making TV shows

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I thought you meant when you said everything is fair game

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I was like, okay, so it's going to have Halo porn and Forza porn

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
No, if they really wanted to make money

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Isn't Forza kind of car porn already?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Well, there are a lot of exhaust pipes you can do things with

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
What?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Gas tanks

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
What?

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I'm just giving them ideas

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
You have issues

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
For free, dang it

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
You have issues

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.000
So are you guys going to be turning to your TV to watch

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Or are you turning to your Xbox to watch TV shows pretty soon?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Let me go get an Xbox

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Oh wait, no, I don't care for an Xbox

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
I think they're coming to 360 as well

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I don't have a 360

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Oh, you got rid of it?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Long time ago, I don't care about Xbox

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
We have to

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Am I going to my Xbox to watch TV shows?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Maybe if my boxie dies

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And then I'll watch Netflix on it

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
But I don't think

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
It's just like that Halo movie

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
The Ford on the Don and stuff

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
They're like, oh, Halo movie

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
But it looks like a sci-fi original movie

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I'd be curious about this

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I want to see the documentaries

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Gaming documentaries might be really interesting

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Especially this Atari one

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Even though I gave my thoughts last week

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
About what's the biggest one

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
When it leaks out to YouTube or whatever

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But you were just talking about piracy

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I could do that with the TV shows today too

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
But that's not how you're supposed to do it, Logie

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
But I have a 360

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I can get up to the TV and watch the Atari documentary

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
I'm sure they'll all be on Windows 8 too

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Because they're trying to get people to buy Windows 8

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Yeah, I know all about that

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Let's move on with some more news

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Shane, what do you have for us tonight?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Since I just said how big a fan of Microsoft I am

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Let's talk about how they are committed

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
To making more interactive programs

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
You can't accurately finger quote when you're on the radio

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Interactive programming

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
In the same vein as 1 vs 100

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Like they did on the Xbox 360

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
What's her name?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
This is ads

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Nancy Tellum, the president of entertainment and digital media

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Said that there is now infrastructure there

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I think it was just Xbox One, right?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Every time I hear her name I think of Soulja Boy

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Why?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Because it wasn't one of his songs like you tell him

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Or something like that

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Oh my god

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I don't know

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Please be seated

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Shane

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Anyway, I guess the infrastructure there for the 1 and the 360

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
It's there so they know now how to accurately make these style games

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
They're looking into not remaking 1 vs 100

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000
But a game in the similar vein that you can get a lot of people together and have fun

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I never got to play it

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I don't know how much fun it was

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
I hear it was great

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I loved it

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
That was like the best thing that ever happened on the 360

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
When they got rid of it I was so pissed

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
If they said 1 vs 100

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
And I know they're saying not that specifically

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But if they said for whatever reason 1 vs 100

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Is coming out to the Xbox One

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And it's going to be out on such and such date

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And here are the screenshots

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
I would go out and buy an Xbox One

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I love the game that much

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And that would push me over the edge

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Because there's already things on Xbox One

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I'm kind of like

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I'm kind of on the edge

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I know there's some of the stuff coming

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
But I'm not ready to put down the credit card just yet

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But if 1 vs 100 was coming out

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
You know I would

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Didn't they have a poker game that came out that flopped?

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I don't think it flopped

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
It flopped with me

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
It flopped in terms of the same sort of buzz that 1 vs 100

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I think it has its fans

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I know there are people that play it

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
There's also fans of Ni No Kuni

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
But I don't think it's necessarily as huge as 1 vs 100 was

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I love the idea of game shows

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
But I don't know what other game shows could they do

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
But then again when we first heard about 1 vs 100

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It was like what are they going to do?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's going to be a lot of miming stuff

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
So like Wheel of Fortune

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So you have to like spin the wheel

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Or Price is Right

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And you go like this

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Like you're spinning the big wheel

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Price is Right would legit be a lot of fun actually

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
That would be a good one

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Family Feud

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
That could be one

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Survey says

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Press your luck you just go like this

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
However many people said the answer

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Don't they have like a live version of You Don't Know Jack

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Yeah a long time ago they had with Paul Rubens

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It was okay

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Just go back to the old night

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
I always fucking bring this up on the show

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Whenever we talk about 1 vs 100

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
This was the highlight in PC gaming for me

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Was when Berkley Systems was around doing stuff like Acrophobia

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Acrophobia I used to play the crap out of that

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Just put Acrophobia on Xbox One

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I would be happy

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I don't think I'd play it now

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I'd play it now

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Especially if you could still have the After Dark Rooms

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Where every acronym was just like

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Fuck, Cunt, Cock

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Like it's just every dirty word acronym you could think of

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I miss the After Dark Rooms

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And they had other games too

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Like there was the one where you went up and down the tower

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I don't know that one

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Yeah there was other stuff too

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
So there's ideas out there

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Just jack all the old Berkley Systems games

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
They can do it

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Alright

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Anyway

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Let's move on

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Loki what do you have

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Let's go to another company

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Alright

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
So

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Nintendo

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Of course

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
They're not doing the stage presentation like they did a couple years ago

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
They're going to be doing a livestream press event

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Or a Nintendo Direct type thing

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
That's scheduled I guess to air on

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Was it 9 AM Pacific Time 12 PM Eastern

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
On June 10th

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
And the Nintendo Treehouse will be

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I guess conducting that

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And they're also going to have livestream unscripted game demos

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
From their E3 booth during the show as well

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And I hope to hell they're using multiple providers

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And not just Ustream

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Because that was the worst part of E3 last year

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Was Ustream's Nintendo Direct was awful

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I thought I did

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Didn't they have YouTube as well

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I think they did later

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yeah YouTube and then I think now they're using Twitch

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Twitch can handle that crap

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So they need to just use Twitch

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
YouTube I think they also do livestream YouTube at the same time

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Well here's an idea

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Let's check the press release

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Because it might say if they're going to be doing

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Twitch or whatever

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
No

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
It might be too early for those specifics

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
They did say though

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
One of the things that was kind of a little teaser video

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Is that they're going to be doing this Super Smash Brothers thing

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
At Best Buy

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Remember like last year you could test out stuff from Best Buy

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You know play different games and things

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
For the Wii U

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Well now they're going to be doing that with Smash Brothers U

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Or Smash Brothers for the Wii U

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
At certain Best Buys

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
So you can check that out as well

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And they go along with that

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
They're going to be hosting a tournament at E3 for Smash Brothers

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
So

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I wonder how much of the final roster

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Will get for Smash Brothers by E3

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Because the 3DS one comes out this summer

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Whenever that time period really is

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
So the rosters are supposed to be the same

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
So

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I would imagine the final roster

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Is out at E3

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
If the game is coming out in the summer

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Final roster at E3 with maybe one or two surprises

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Probably not hidden characters if there are any

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yeah

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
So

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I think that's

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
That's what you expect at E3 I think

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Interesting they're putting so much focus on Smash Brothers

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
It's their big game

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Mario Kart 8 is out at that point

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I'm wondering if Zelda is not coming out this year

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Because of the lack of focus so far

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Because of the fact that they pushed Smash Brothers to fall

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I'm wondering if Zelda is coming out this year

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I'm wondering if Zelda is coming out this year

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Because they're expecting Smash Brothers to fall

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I'm wondering if that was the original

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I'm wondering if they were expecting

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Smash Brothers to be released in the summer

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And have Zelda for quarter 4

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I don't think

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Zelda was ever going to be this year

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Or do you think maybe because those are

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Two separate genres that they might not really care

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
They could still release both because they did that

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
With Wind Waker and the new Mario

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I think Zelda's

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Holiday 2015 people

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I think you guys are being way too optimistic

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
About how fast they're going to crank that out

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Zelda's Holiday 2015

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I'm sure they'll put out Bayonetta 2

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I was going to say

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
That's the other big thing they've been talking about

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
That's not going to sell systems I'm sorry

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It won't

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I love the game but I would not buy a Wii U

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
For that game

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
But will you buy the game if you already have a Wii U?

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
No

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Well I bet a lot of people disagree with you and will

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I'll buy it

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And I think Nintendo needs to not just sell systems

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
They need to be able to sell games

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
And especially a game that wasn't

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Necessarily made in house by Nintendo

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I mean kinda, sorta

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Well they also have their Dicey Warriors

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Zelda game too that's supposed to be coming out

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
At some point, that'll probably be summer as well

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I don't know, we'll see

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
But yeah, so

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Invitational tournament that's going to run

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
From June 10th through 12th

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
During E3

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Alright well we mentioned there

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
That before E3 happens Mario Kart 8

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Will be happening and a big

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Nintendo Direct came out this week that

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Talked pretty much all about what we can

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Expect with the launch including a $330

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Wii U bundle that will

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Come with Mario Kart 8

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It will have the 32 gig

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Black Wii U and a red

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Wii U wheel and a Mario Wii remote plus

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
As we mentioned a little bit about

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Earlier in the show

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Here's the part that I don't think anybody was expecting

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
All copies of Mario

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Kart 8, this is how big this game is

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
To Nintendo and they want to make sure it succeeds

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
No matter what they have to do

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
And this is huge

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
All copies of Mario Kart 8

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Come with a free download code

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
For one of four Wii U

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Games, if you register the game

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
On Club Nintendo before July 31st

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Which anybody with an internet's gonna do

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
You're gonna get a code for a

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Free copy of New Super Mario Brothers U

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Wind Waker HD

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Peekman 3

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Or Wii Party U

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Here's a pro tip

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Don't pick Wii Party U

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It's not a bad game

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
But like the

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Box one comes with a little attachment

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
For your controller that makes it a lot more fun

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
To play

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Well I think a lot of Nintendo fans I know

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Already own the other three

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Even I already own New Super Mario Brothers U

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
So I'm probably gonna do Wind Waker

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Just because Peekman doesn't

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I've never really been super interested in that game

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Sorry I know some people are really into it

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Even though

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
But in Europe by the way

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
They have more choices

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't know why they got more but they did

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Because in Europe you can get Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Nintendo Land, Wonderful 101

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Sonic Lost World

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Which would have been the one I would get if I could get it here

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Mario and Sonic the Olympic Winter Games

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And Game and Wario

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
All those extra ones in Europe

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
In addition to?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
It's like ten choices in Europe

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That was Game and Wario

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
It's a really decent game

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
But it won't last you very long

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Like most WarioWare games

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Multiplayer information coming out of the Direct

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Twelve people can play at once

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Voice chat will be available

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Good job Nintendo

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
You did it!

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
You did it!

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Finally!

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
You can choose from four modes

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Worldwide, Regional, Friends, and Tournament

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Does that mean voice chat

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Is going to be in the public matches?

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
I could have sworn

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Hey Nintendo!

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Like I watched that Direct

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I thought the voice chat was really only for lobby stuff

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I don't think it was for

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
When you're actually racing

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
It doesn't matter even if it's just lobby

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Oh my gosh

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I really hope you can mute people

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Also some new items revealed

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
The Super Horn

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And the Crazy Eight

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Which will whirl eight different items that you unleash

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Awesome, it's protection against blue shells

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
You're right

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
That is pretty cool

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I think you could just make them as rare as they were in Mario Kart 64

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Also

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Last but not least

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
More characters announced

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Baby Rosalina will be a character as well

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
And

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Pink Gold Peach

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
What the fuck is a Pink Gold Peach?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I've heard of rose gold

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Pink Gold Peach

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
I can't help

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
But I can't help but think of that scene

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
From Project Runway

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Where she's like

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I'm going to use this blood orange

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And it cuts to the scene of the guy going

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
She's so pretentious, that blood orange

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Shut up, it's fucking red

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I can't help but think of that

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
When we talk about Pink Gold Peach

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Which in reality

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Pink Gold Peach is like

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Metal Mario

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
But instead of metal peach, it's Pink Gold Peach

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
It's the heavyweight peach

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
It's terrible is what it is

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
All these baby characters

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
And all this metal Mario

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Metal Mario is not a fucking character

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It's a texture swap

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
It's not a fucking new character

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Come on

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Branch out a little bit

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Yes, I understand it's called Mario Kart

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
But throw in a Zelda level

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
And have two Link or something like that

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I was a little pissed there's no Birdo

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It looks like Birdo got cut

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Or Birdo

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Fuck, there's a ton of different things

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I would have much rather had Birdo than

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Blood Orange Peach

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
They should have gone back and picked random enemies

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Mouser would have been cool

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
I do love the fact

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
They put all the Koopa kids in there

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
But it makes it hard for me to pick between

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Lemmy, Larry or Toad

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
What about a Goomba?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
What about a Goomba, why not?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
They have no arms

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
How are they supposed to drive?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
They could use their feet but then what's pushing

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
The gas pedal

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Is it two Goombas?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Nope, it's tank style

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Despite all this crap we're giving it

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I am so there and I am so playing

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Wendy O Koopa

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
On fucking Toad's Highway

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
The day this thing comes out

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Oh, and thank you

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
For mentioning Toad's Highway

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Because I would like to say

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
While Nintendo has done all this fantastic shit

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Making the game look awesome

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And they brought back Battle Mode

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
What the fuck did they do to Battle Mode?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Hey guys, you know

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
We could totally take all these really kick ass

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Battle Mode tracks that we had

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
But no, instead we're gonna take

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Just the regular tracks

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
They're all fucking loops that they slightly tweaked

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
And that's what they are

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
That you play Battle Mode on a fucking track

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Because god forbid

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
It would be so damn hard to

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Bring Block Fortress in or something

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I'm gonna take a wait and see approach

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I'm gonna take a wait and see approach

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I'm not ready to get low key

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
No, it's just

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
They don't get it, they tried the same shit with

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Like, what is it?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
It was either Double Dash or

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
The 3DS one

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
We don't talk about Double Dash

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Rama in chat says

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Calling it now, DLC for older tracks

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
With all due respect Rama

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
I think everybody is calling that

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
This is such an obvious extension

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
There are some tracks I would pay for

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Half the tracks in the game are older tracks

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
But that's not out of character

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
For a Mario Kart game

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Besides, of course, the first one

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Yeah, it's not out of character

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It is out of character though

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
To completely ignore any regular

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Battle Mode track for Battle Mode

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
That makes no sense

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
That's the DLC

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
That's stupid

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Hey, we broke this on purpose

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
So that we can fix it with paid content

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
That's dumb

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
They said they needed more third party ideas

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Make the model a fucking Battle Mode track

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Calm down

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Mario Kart 8 is gonna

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Be the bomb and you know it

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Stop it

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Like two hours tops

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
To do all four of them

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Have a seat

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I also wanted to say

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
That means 30 characters playable

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Also, you can play as your Mii

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Which is all you're ever gonna see online, probably

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
I just really hope they change the Mii voices

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Cause

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Like the voices

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Those Miis have is scary

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Maybe they'll just have you

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
They should have you record

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Only with friends

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
But

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I fully

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I still hope

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Like they did with Mario Kart Wii

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And I don't remember if they did with the 3DS version

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
But I hope they actually have your Miis in the background

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Love this idea from Tigerclaw

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And I think even Loki has to like this one

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Tigerclaw says, what if they do

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
DLC tracks based on other games

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
You remember how Sonic Lost World

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Had levels based on some classic Nintendo games

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
What if Nintendo made a deal and made

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
DLC tracks based on Sonic

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
So, what if somebody

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Got your Sonic Mega All-Stars

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Racing courses in my Mario Kart 8

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
No

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
How about a Bayonetta 2 course

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Come on

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Come on, Loki

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
What would that be? I mean, driving up the hair

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
No, you'd just basically drive into her vagina

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
That's a Bayonetta 2

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I was trying to hint at that, but you know, whatever

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
That's fine

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Just go for the direct approach

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
On a serious thought, you're driving around

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
These mountains that are just her boobs

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
On a serious note

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
What about like a Hyrule level

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You laugh at that, but actually one time I did have a concept

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
For a kart racing game, and that was gonna be

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
You know, that was gonna be my level

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Battle of Ariola Mountain

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
It's gonna be all bacon

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And fucking giant breasts

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Like, bounce on like those

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
You know, mushrooms and shit

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
What was the name of the game, Bacon and Boobs?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Oh, it was VoG Kart Racing, of course

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Did you run that by Bobby?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
No, I didn't, I don't really care

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
This was a long time ago

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Ah, the ideas

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I had for that

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Alright, now what about like

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
A Hyrule level

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Like, that would be rad

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
What did they just say a second ago?

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Yeah, it'd be awesome if they had a Zelda level and

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Finally, that was

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Either here or there

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Alright, moving on, Shane

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
We gotta keep it moving, we're like at an hour twenty

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
And we're not even halfway through the show

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Okay, well

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
There are some Mega Man games headed to Virtual Console

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Thanks to the votes of fans

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Capcom posted a poll

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Asking

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
When you want to see

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Select Mega Man games show up on the Virtual Console

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
That poll is over

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
How'd Mega Man Legends 3 do?

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It got first place

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I'm glad that Capcom's listening to

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
User feedback now

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
But you know

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Back when we wanted a new Mega Man game

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Well, fuck you guys, we know better

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
That's awesome

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Thanks, Capcom

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Sorry, Shane

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Anyway, so

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
The votes are in

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Capcom has announced the schedule

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
For release

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
On the week of May 1st

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Which has already happened

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Mega Man Xtreme will be available

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
The following week

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
5-8

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Both Mega Man 2 and Mega Man 3 will be available

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Week of the 15th

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Mega Man 4

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Week of the 22nd

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Mega Man 5

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
And then the week of the 29th

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Mega Man Xtreme 2

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Now, these are for

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
I believe the 3DS Virtual Console

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Yeah, they are

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
The Game Boy versions

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
The end

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
The games were all coming anyway

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
That vote meant nothing

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
All it was was the order that you wanted them in

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Which it looks pretty much like

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Numerical order is what we went with

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Apparently

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
There you go

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Oh my gosh

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Some people in chat

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Capcom needs to lose that IP

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I don't think they're letting go of it that easy

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Well, let's travel around the world

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
That are coming out a little sooner than Mega Man Legends 3

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Loki, US

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Yes, well this week

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
There's a few things coming out

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Starting off with Bound by Flame

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Which is actually coming out on

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
And on PS4

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Sorry, Xbox One

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You don't get that game

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It looks pretty cool though

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
The PlayStation 4 version of

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
MLB 14, the show

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Will be making it out this week as well

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Today, actually we had a couple

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
3DS games

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
There was Mario Golf

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
World Tour

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
So that came out on 3DS and

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Kirby Triple Deluxe

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Let's see

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
What else was coming out later this week here

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
We also have

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
There's so much stuff

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Smooth dates

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Hakuoki Stories of the Shinsu

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Goomy on PlayStation 3

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
If you like your visual novel games

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
For the Vita, God of War

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Collection

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
That's coming out on the Vita

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Also the amazing

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Spider-Man 2 which kind of got delayed

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
A little bit

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
That's coming out on Xbox One

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
And this is pretty sweet

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Borderlands 2

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Going to be coming out

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Later this week

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Actually, that might be next week

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
13th, is that a Friday?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
13th is a Tuesday

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I'm sorry, that's the following week

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
It was originally supposed to come out this week

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Anyways, that's it

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Alright, well moving to Japanese

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Release dates, there is nothing on the schedule

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
For this week, literally nothing

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It probably has to do with Golden Week going on right now in Japan

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
So there is nothing

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Sales, I need to take advantage of still on PlayStation

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
There are the sales stuff

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And some other little tie-ins like that

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
But as far as official releases go, nothing this week in Japan

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
How about the UK?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
The UK has a few games

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Starting with May 7th

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
You get Peggle 2 on

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Xbox 360

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Titan Attacks on PS4, Vita

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
And PS3

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
On May 8th, Age of Mythology's

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Extended Edition for PC

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And the God of War collection on Vita

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
May 9th brings Bound by Flame

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
For PS3, PC

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
PlayStation 4

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
And Xbox 360

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And then last on here, and I don't think this is right anymore

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
But Killer is Dead on PC

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Didn't that get pushed back by a couple weeks?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I believe, everywhere

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Yeah, I want to see, I just saw

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I think it was my birthday, I think

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
On the 23rd, so Killer is Dead

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
On my birthday

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Well maybe you can get Killer is Dead for free

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
No, I don't even know what that is, I don't want it

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Killer is Dead is the, I can't remember the guy's name

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
It's the guy that does the new Killer 7

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
And No More Heroes and stuff like that

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
It was there, they came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I think about a year ago

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Last August, I want to say

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Kajudo in chat says

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Japan has stopped making games

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
No, that's not what happened

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I will say this, May 15th, it's going to pick up again

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And I'll tell you what, guess what's coming out on May 15th

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
A new Idolmaster game in Japan

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
So those are huge

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah, we should be getting a new

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Not Idolmaster, but

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Hatsune Miku? Yeah, maybe this year

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Hatsune Miku is opening for Lady Gaga, did we talk about that on the show?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
That is some crazy shit

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Lady Gaga is having Hatsune Miku

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Yes, the video game character

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Well, it's more than a video game character in Japan

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
But with the holograms and shit

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Is actually opening for the art pop

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Whatever they're calling it in select cities

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I don't think on this coast, but on the east coast

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Hatsune Miku is opening for Lady Gaga

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I feel like that would be this coast

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Not the east coast

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
You would think, right?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
You would think that she could just call herself Gem

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
And she could have the hologram

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Which, look out guys

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Because Shane's filling in for Jamie tonight

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Guess who I picked for the classic game of the week

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
But I'm going to tell you what, Loki, I already know

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Is going to love this pick

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Let's get to those other

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I will tell my first pick before we go with that

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Okay, well let's get these other stories out of the way real quick

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
This was actually kind of a surprise

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I mean, I knew that they were teasing that they're going to have

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Marvel Super Heroes as part of the new

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Disney Infinity, but I just figured

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Hey, it's going to be another pack

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Or something like that, it's not necessarily

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Going to be the whole game, but guess what

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Disney Infinity 2.0, Marvel Super Heroes

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Is going to be announced

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Or it was announced

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
And it is full of Marvel Super Heroes

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
So, yeah, it's going to be pretty sweet

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Launching with the game

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
They said it's going to be Iron Man

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Thor and Black Widow, but along with that

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Hulk, Captain America

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And Hawkeye will also be

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Launching alongside it

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
And of course

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
With it, they're saying that, you know

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
You can have higher levels in your characters

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
New skill trees

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Also, the toy box mode is coming back

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And all the old characters will be supported by it

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
So you'll be able to play as the old characters

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
In toy box mode only

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And they kind of

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Showed some more

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
Well, they showed some other things

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
They have the Avengers characters in there

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
They've got Spider-Man

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
They showed off a lot of different

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
The characters from

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Guardians of the Galaxy

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Are going to be in there, so obviously

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
They'll have that toy box come out

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Maybe when the movie comes out or something

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Although that's a summer movie, I want to say

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
It's interesting to see these worlds

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Coming together, though

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
We know what Disney Infinity 3.0 is then

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Yeah, right, with the Star Wars, absolutely

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Or maybe it's 3PO

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Oh, God

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You just wrote their entire

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Advertising campaign

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Patent pending, quick

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
It's not surprising

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Infinity 3.0 is going to be Star Wars stuff

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I'll be pretty

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Exciting, too

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
There's some

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Characters that were in the

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Trailer as well

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Stitch, although that could have been

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Maybe a different playable character

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Or not necessarily

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Merida

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Maleficent

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Nick Fury

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Loki

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
It's not only Avengers

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Some of the newer

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
The chick from Brave and the

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Frozen characters

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
The Frozen characters were from

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
The last pack that came out

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Frozen characters are already out

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
But they're only in the toy box mode

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
It's kind of lame

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Is Brave out, too?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
No, no

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
They have

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
What's-her-name from Tangled

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Rapunzel

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Miss Tangled?

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yeah, from Tangled

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And then they have

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Green Goblin, MODOK

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
And they showed off

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Rocket Raccoon and Groot

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Kind of mimicking the scene that they had in the trailer

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Well, I can see where Marvel nerds are going to be really happy about this

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I don't know how I feel about the whole

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Old characters only work in toy locks mode

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Let's put it this way

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I think what the problem was before is with Disney Infinity

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
It kind of skewed too much

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Too young, maybe

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And so now that they've got all this Marvel stuff

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
They're trying to capitalize on

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Skylanders, young boys

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And honestly

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I think they've got a stronger license

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Because people that are just getting into it

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Who the fuck are the Skylanders?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
I know who the Avengers are

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I don't know who the fuck the Skylanders are

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Well, Skylanders is getting more and more

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
They've been around for a few years now

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
So I think it's getting more and more out there

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I understand that, but I'm just saying

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Marvel's been around a lot longer than

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Skylanders

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
I think that they stand a little bit better of a chance

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
But I'll be interested to see

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
It's supposed to be coming out in September

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And on this also

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
There are going to be

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Last Gen and

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So you can step up

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
To the PlayStation 4 with this cycle

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Yes

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Moving on to one other story here

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
We're about to get into the Classic Game of the Week

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
So it's appropriate that I talk about some free classic games

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
That are available

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
And they're actually coming from Blizzard

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Now you may or may not know, over at Battle.net

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
If you have an account over there, you can download

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Blackthorn for free, that's one of their old games

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
From the Super Nintendo days

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
That's been out for a while

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Well, Blizzard decided to add a little more to that

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
By putting out some of the other classic Blizzard games

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
I think this goes all the way back to when they were

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
A different named company

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
The Lost Vikings

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
There's actually some Lost Vikings

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Jokes in World of Warcraft

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
You actually see them in one of the dungeons

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So the Lost Vikings, you can actually now play that

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Free via Battle.net

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
You can go download it, it's completely legal and all that stuff

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
You play it through Battle.net, it's pretty cool

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Also available, Rock and Roll Racing

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Although they say that Rock and Roll Racing

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Might actually be just the demo

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Because there's only three songs

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Available in Rock and Roll Racing

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
There's some issues with the licensing

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
That game was awesome

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Rock and Roll Racing had all these

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Actual Rock and Roll songs

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
They fear the licensing may have screwed that up

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Because they say, the reports are

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
That if you download the game

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
It's really only the three tracks from the demo

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Put new music in there

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Yeah, you would think, or something

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
But yeah, unfortunately

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
So Rock and Roll Racing has hobbled a little bit

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
But you still can get that for free

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
And Lost Vikings

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Those, again, are available at Battle.net

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Pretty cool way to convince people to go get

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
A Battle.net account

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
To register participation

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
At vognetwork.com

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Anyways, Squash

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Alright, well speaking of

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Classic games, it's time to take

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
A journey to the past

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
As we open up the gaming vault

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And step in and find a game

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
That we think, hey, you should

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Check out this classic game this week

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Now usually Dark Sakura dives into the vault

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
And finds a game for y'all

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
But with Shane filling in tonight, we thought

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Alright, let's let our guests have the honor

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Of selecting the classic game of the week

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
What were the rules that Jamie set?

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
You said it was ten years old

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
That's what she said, she wanted to do Kingdom Hearts

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
At one point, I think

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
So it has to be ten years or older

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
So Shane, you stepped into the vault

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And what game did you find for us tonight?

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Well, first I found Power Rangers the movie The Game

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And I was like, I love that game

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I should talk about that

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
But then, I had a much more

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Better idea to pick

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
And I picked Final Fantasy XI

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
So

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
This game is amazing

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Final Fantasy XI meets this criteria

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Because it came out

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Actually on PC in America

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
In 2003

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
So we are well past that

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Final Fantasy XI is

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Square's online entry

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Their first online entry into the Final Fantasy

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
For the Final Fantasy series

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Oh my god, I'm sorry

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
This music brings back so many memories for me

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I remember when this game came out

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I was living with

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Because this show was on

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I was living with Loki

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I stayed home from work the day this came out

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I requested that day off from work to get the game

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
I remember I was the first one on the server

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
And I had to get everybody else

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
You kept deleting and re-rolling until you got it

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Yeah, we had to get the world pass

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I got world passes for everybody

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
I had to go out and kill a million sprouts

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Or whatever to go get the stupid passes

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I'm going to actually switch to

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Some gameplay noises here

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
From the theme song

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
That theme song takes me back

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So this is a standard

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
MMORPG

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
You fight things

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
You get experience

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
You level up

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
The game, which launched in Japan a little bit before we got it

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Launched with six jobs

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
And then when the game came out in America

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
We not only got the original game

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
But we also got the first expansion

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Which added

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Oh my god, so many more jobs

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Nine, ten

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Or eight, what?

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
All the advanced jobs

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Except for, I'm sorry

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
The game did launch with the advanced jobs

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Paladin, Dark Knight, Beastmaster, Ranger, Bard

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
And Summoner

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
The expansion, which was the base game for us

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Also gave us Samurai Ninja Dragoon

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
And that's it

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
The game had

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Let's see, one, two, three

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Four main expansions

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
It's still going strong

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Had an expansion last year

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
The Seekers of Adulin

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Which added two more jobs

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Bringing to a total of

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I believe twenty-four jobs

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
The President of Square-

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Oh my god, this video is of the Rama fight

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Sorry

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
I just got excited

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
These Primal fights were so hard

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Oh my god

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
We only did them as the solo ones

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
You can get a full party to do them as well

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
But we always did the babier versions

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Where it's just you and carbuncle

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
In 2012, Yoichi Wada

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Announced that Final Fantasy 11

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Had become the most profitable title

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
In the Final Fantasy series

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Probably because of all the monthly fees

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
And the cost for extra characters

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And stuff like that

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Yeah

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
This game has an amazing story

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
It spans across, you know, the four

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Expansions, the little mini scenario

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Expansions they put out as well

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I couldn't tell you anything about that story either

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
No, it's really good

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I've gone on the wiki and just read

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
The story at times

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
The game has changed

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
So much from when it launched to what it is now

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Used to be everything required a party

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Nowadays

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Everything does not require a party

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
In fact, a party is a hindrance

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Up until the very end of the game

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Which is level 99

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And you can increase your character's

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Skills and stats

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Beyond level 99 too

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Through various means

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
It's awesome

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Yeah, these guys are just duoing the fight

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
That used to take six people

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I recently went back and played this game

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Like two months ago to see

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
What all was different and it's

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Still really fun

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I got to level

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
65 or something like that

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I was fully AF'd as a dancer

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I played this game for fucking three years

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
I never got anywhere

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Did I play that last January

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Or was it this January

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I think it was last January

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I bought everything

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Up to the last

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
The very last piece of

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
DLC and the expansion for it

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
It was like

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
It must have been like $8

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I was like, dude, how can I not

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Play this for another month

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
This was also the game that introduced

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The hard drive to the PS2

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
That used

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Or that was used for so many games like

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Resident Evil Outbreak

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And Resident Evil Outbreak 2

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
I think that was probably it

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Oh, EverQuest

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Yeah, EverQuest as well

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Which is another online game

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
But yeah, this game still goes strong

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
The servers are a little bit more dead

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Than they used to be

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Because of Final Fantasy 14

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
A lot of the online Final Fantasy people moved over into that game

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Is what you would think

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
But the people I was playing with

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Were like, we went to 14, we didn't like it

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
We came back to 11

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I love 14

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I don't need to look back to 11 myself

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I do, because it has so many amazing jobs

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Blue Mage, Dancer

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Geomancer, Rune Fencer

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Puppet Master

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Alright

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Well there it is, your classic game of the week

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Final Fantasy 11

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
It's constantly on sale on Steam

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
If you ever want to just pick it up for a little bit

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
For a month

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
And Xbox 360

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I wish it would go free to play

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Free to play, free to play

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Come on, free to play

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Never

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I still get the emails, newsletters

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Like, come check out what you're missing

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Well, another good thing is that they update the game monthly now

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
So there's always a content patch of some sort every month

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Whether it be job adjustments

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Or quality of life changes

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
It's pretty nice

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Square is pouring a lot into their MMOs

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Meaning that they won't release Dragon Quest X here

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Don't get me started

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I'm about to get started

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Alright

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
A classic near and dear to my heart

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Many years of my life wasted on Final Fantasy 11

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And soon to be 14

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
And Loki as well

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
And Shane

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Actually, Shane and I probably became better friends

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Because of Final Fantasy 11

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
I mean, we knew each other through LiveJournal and stuff

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
We really talked everyday through Final Fantasy 11

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Pretty much, pretty much

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Alright, well there it is

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
A classic game of the week, Final Fantasy 11

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Let us take a break, when we come back

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
We've got the FUGL question of the week

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Rapid fire news to come

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Some shifting and so forth going on at some game companies

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
And email bag

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Participate at orangelandtrady.com

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
A follow up to last week's email

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Did we tell our listener

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
What game they were looking for

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
We're gonna find out

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
They wrote back this week

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So we will get that follow up coming up next

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
On Orange Lounge Radio after this break

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Live on this

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
May the 4th of 2014

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
With episode 551 of our show

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
And yes

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
If you're just joining us live at the Voice of Geeks Network

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
VoGnetwork.com

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Yes, we got the May the 4th jokes

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Out of the way, I'm sure your Facebook feed already

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Blew up with them earlier today

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
So there you go, done

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
As far as Star Wars and video games goes

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
We must talk about that a little bit

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
We kind of already talked

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
During the last segment about Disney

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Infinity

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
3.0 is most likely gonna be Star Wars

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Bank on it for Disney Infinity 3.0

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Otherwise, anybody played a Star Wars game

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Recently?

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
They don't make them like Super Star Wars

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Star Wars is a crappy IP anyway

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Oh be quiet, that's not true

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I don't like Star Wars

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I don't like them, the movies are crap

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
The new ones are

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Well all of them that I've seen which are 4, 5, and 6

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
You're wrong, they're not that bad

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But the old republic keeps doing stuff

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
So that's still going

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
There's a Star Wars game

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Yoda and Darth Vader were cool in Soul Calibur 4

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
By the way, if you listen to my little rant

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Last week on Soul Calibur Lost Swords

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I tried

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
I tried again this week, I booted

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I think there was even a comment on VOG

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
But I saw that they fixed it

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
There was an article on a blog site

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
That said they fixed everything

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Nope, it's getting deleted tonight

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I tried, I'd win it one more time

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I brought up the thing and it's still loading, loading, loading, loading, loading, loading

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
I want to see it before you delete it

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I got to the, well here's the thing

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
I get to the menu screen, can't move up or down

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Can't hit the button, can't do anything

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Saya said, I'm out

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I didn't even get into the full game, I said I'm done with this garbage

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
But I tried

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
I tried

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Tigerclaw says

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
You think Shane is going to hate Star Wars Episode 7?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Yes I do, he will hate Star Wars

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Most likely

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Unless the series gets a decent story

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
And not terrible acting

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Which I don't have high hopes for

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Bobby Blackwolf says

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Shanehateseverything.com

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
That's not true

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Just things that are awful

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
He loves Power Rangers, Pokemon, and

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Skylanders in the color blue

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And Taco Bell and

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Del Taco

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Alright

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Anyhow, let's get into some

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
rapid fire news because there is

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
a lot of other stuff going on in gaming

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Loki

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
So finally

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
After months of wondering

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Where's Drive Club? Isn't that supposed to be out by now?

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
They have

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Made it official that

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Drive Club will be out October 7th

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
In North America, October 8th

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
In Europe

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And of course

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
They had planned for the game to come out early

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
2014

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
But they ran into

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
A problem being able to deliver

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
On their ambitious

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Yeah ambitious promise

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And apparently

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
The whole issue with it was

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
That they wanted it to be a

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Socially connected game

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And they were having trouble with

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
The social networking part of that

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Wait, their ambitious promise

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Is that the promise of releasing a game?

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Is that the ambitious promise?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
That is ambitious as far as

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Socially connected

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
We need to make sure that all the connectivity

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That surrounds the game

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Whether it be joining clubs or sending challenges

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Or even interacting with iOS and Android

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Drive Club apps

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
That had to be slick

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
And that had to be absolutely seamless

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And that was one of the areas that we need

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
To put extra time into

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
We were able to polish the cars

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
The tracks and stuff

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Or just a fantastic byproduct

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Part of me

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Is wondering that maybe the reason why

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
They delayed it a little bit

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Was because of all these launch

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Issues that they've had with games

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Like Soul Calibur and stuff

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Where their servers were just fucked up

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
And they were worried that if they weren't able

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
To talk to each other that you may have some issues

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And stuff

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Also they were saying what we originally had

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
That was not necessarily as smooth or

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Transactions

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Or transitions

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Where the way it connected you

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Or other players weren't as intuitive as we

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Intended them to be

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
So we had to go back and re-look at those areas

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And kind of look at different ways

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
And new techniques to get people

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Socially connect

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
And we changed that with a new

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Dynamic menu system

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
So we really feel like we've solved

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
All those problems

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Also

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
You may be wondering

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Well are we still going to be getting

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Drive Club for free as part of PlayStation Plus

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Well yes that is still going to happen

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
It's actually going to be

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Taking place in one country

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
With five tracks

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And ten cars

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
So that's going to be the free portion of the game

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
And you'll be able to

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Buy stuff a la carte

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
If you want

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
On top of that

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
So

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
It's pretty neat

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Of course people are getting pissed off

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
It's 1080p and only 30 frames per second

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Not 60 so there's that whole debate

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
But who gives a shit about that

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I'm glad they're still doing the

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
PlayStation Plus free-ish mode

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Definitely

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
And then

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
I'm a little disappointed about this

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
You may remember

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Adam Sandler

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Their studio

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
For pixels

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Which was a kind of a short

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
That came out

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
A digital short that was on YouTube

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Where it was a bunch of

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
This blob of pixels flying through the air

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
And then all of a sudden

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Oh look Donkey Kong is there throwing barrels at people

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
And all sorts of pandemonium

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
The Tetris blocks are destroying buildings

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And everything kind of went all pixely

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Well

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Now there's a little bit more information regarding this

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
It's supposed to be coming

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
In 2015

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
It's of course going to have Adam Sandler

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
And all those crew

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Peter Dinklage is going to be in it as well

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And apparently the plot

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
This is really weird

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
The plot centers around I guess

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Aliens who discover video footage of classic arcade games

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
And apparently after seeing that

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
The aliens believe that Earth is

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Trying to wage war with them

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
And

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
You know apparently the aliens

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Invade Earth using the games

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
As bullets for their attack

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Of course they're going to have some people

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
That are arcade aficionados

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
That are going to take them on

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
And defeat the aliens and save the day

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
But it sounds really weird

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Originally it was like all these

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Classic arcade characters

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Are kind of waging war

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Against everybody

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
And then to this really strange plot line

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
I don't know I think it's just going to sound kind of cheesy

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
But whatever

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
That's coming out next year

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
I sounded like the last star fighter almost

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I just

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
It's just Adam Sandler

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
He's like poisoned for anything nowadays

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Back in the day you know the Adam Sandler movie

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
Hell yeah I got to watch it because it's going to be hilarious

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Nah it's just not so much

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
So I'm going to have to wait and see

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Also this week

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
They announced the brand new Call of Duty

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Game in

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
It's going to come out in November

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Called Call of Duty Advanced Warfare

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
And it takes place in the year 2059

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
And following I guess a bunch of different

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Private military contractors

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
One I know which is Atlas

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And I don't know if they're supposed to be the

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Good guys or the bad guys

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
But I know

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
That Kevin Spacey is going to be in

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
The game as well

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
He has a character that he's voicing

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
I guess

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Parents kind of based off of

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Apparently he has

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Some sort of

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I don't know if he's going to be the good guy

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Or if he's trying to take over the United States

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
But anyways

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Stuff happens

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
The Golden Gate Bridge gets destroyed

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
At one point and it's got a lot of the tech

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
That you see in some of these

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Near sci-fi movies like Elysium

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Or was that new one with

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Tom Cruise coming out

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
The exoskeleton suits

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And all sorts of

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
That kind of tech

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Like the wearable armor type things

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Oh and hoverbikes

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
That's kind of cool

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
So we're going to get our hovercars

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
In the next 30 or so years

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
But yeah that'll be coming out in November

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Great! Bunch of information on Call of Duty

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
I didn't know about

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Yeah that's completely new information

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Alright let's move on

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Talking about a game that I do know something about

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Because I've played it before

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
I just haven't played it on the Wii U

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
But it's Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
There is a patch that will be hitting the Wii U

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
In off TV mode

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Some of the in-game sounder music

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Wouldn't come through to the Wii U gamepad

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Oops! So that will be a

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Patch that will hit so if you want to check out

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Giana Sisters, Twisted Dreams

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Which is a pretty solid platformer I gotta say

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
I've been playing it on PC

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
But if I didn't have a nice PC

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
I think the Wii U would be a great place

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
To check that out

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Yeah check that out

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Especially after that patch goes in

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
This is interesting, this game came out a while ago

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
With the Mortal Kombat HD arcade collection

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
I had no idea this was a thing

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
But thanks to some forum posts

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
This week some screenshots

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Leaked of what was supposed to be

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
A full HD remake

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Of the Mortal Kombat collection

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Meaning new characters

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I'm sorry, same characters

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
But new grabs

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Like the sprites were all new

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
New actors dressed up in the costumes

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
That would be hilarious

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
And they actually have lots of screens

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
That people posed in

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Luke Kang and Katana

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Completely different people

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
And you see that they're grabbed

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
In HD

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Kind of neat huh

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
But then they actually show some pictures

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Behind the scenes of these actors on a green screen

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
In the costumes

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
They were ready to

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
They had the Mortal Kombat 3

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Katana and the 2 and all that stuff

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
I'm imagining that's

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Sonya in one of these pictures

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Which I know makes for great radio

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
New actors

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Stryker's

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Kind of chubby isn't he

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
That's alright

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
No he just looks derpy

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
And it's so sad because the newest

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Mortal Kombat game made Stryker almost

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Cool and now they're just like

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
No we're gonna take that away from him

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
So I don't know what they changed

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
They cancelled this and just

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Did it with the regular actors instead

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Maybe it was too much of a shock

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Maybe on playing it with new people

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
They were just like no this doesn't

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Like this defeats the purpose, people are gonna hate this

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
No I imagine somewhere in testing

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
This fell out that like people were gonna

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Reject it

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I kinda think though they should've done it anyway

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
With both

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Why not have the new and the old

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Let people choose what they wanna play as

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I think the new ones for the most part

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Except for maybe Stryker and Kano

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Look pretty decent

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
They should've kept it

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
It would've been weird that they would spend all that money

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
And then nope nevermind

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Psych

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Speaking of, nevermind, psych

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
We had a story last week I think on the show

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
About Silent Hill Origins and Shattered Memories

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Coming to the Playstation Vita

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Oh no that was a mistake

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
The Konami blog

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
That announced this apparently was some type of

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Either a mistranslation

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Or just plain wrong

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Because now it's two Silent Hill

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Titles headed to the Playstation Network

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Even though Konami of the UK tweeted

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
That they're coming to the Vita

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Oops

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
They made a follow up tweet

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Regretfully the games aren't available on Playstation Vita

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
We're afraid

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
If this changes however we'll let you know

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Well you can download them for the PSP

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
On Playstation Network and I'm thinking

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
That's where the error came from

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Somewhere they said oh we need to run an announcement

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
That it's coming to the Playstation Portable

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And somebody said oh that means the Vita

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Totally forgot about the PSP

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Like a lot of people did

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Well don't the PSP games play on the Vita though?

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Most do

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Most do

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
So

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
It's not entirely unsure I guess

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I guess not but yeah I think people

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Had it in their minds that it was new ports or something

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
And that is not a period of games

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
So there you go

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Oh well I don't think I mean last week when we

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Talked about it people didn't seem to be too excited

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
About the idea anyway actually it was the week that

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Flaco was here so it was two weeks ago

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
But anyway it turned out to be

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Psych just kidding

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Shane do you have some stuff for us?

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Yeah DuckTales Remastered the soundtrack if you enjoyed

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
It from the recent release

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Is now available on the

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Amazon MP3 store

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
iTunes and Spotify

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
You can get the

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
47 track

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I didn't realize there were that many songs

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
In it

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
You can get the 47 track album

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
For 949 on Amazon

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Because they have the retro stuff on there too

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
So it's the original and the retro

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
That's what fills it up

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
And it's somehow $11.99

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
On iTunes I don't know

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Why that's kind of

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Really dumb

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Also

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Gran Turismo 5

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
They're pulling the plug on its

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Online services so

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
They are holding a special event

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
To commemorate it

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
It will consist of two stages

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
With the first having a focus

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
On the Mazda

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Roadster touring car

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Of $11 I guess

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And then the other

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
One is the Top Gear

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Or sorry

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Is the Nissan GTR N24

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
I don't know how to pronounce these car names

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Scholes

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Motorsports $11

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
I don't know whatever

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Participating in the event will give players

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
It's alright Shane it's like me reading Japanese release dates

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I could do that way better than I can read

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Car things

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Not during Golden Week

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Not during Golden Week

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I could do that better too

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I wouldn't say anything also

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But better

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Just playing in these events will give players

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Five free vehicles in Gran Turismo 6

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
If they use the same PSN

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
ID as they did from

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Gran Turismo 5

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
You will also earn

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
The

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Golf Grande Punto 09

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Wasn't

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Barth the name of the burger chain

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
And you can't do that on television

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
This is a Barth

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Yes you're right

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
The Renault Sport

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
RS

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Trophy 11

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
The Nissan

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Fairlady Z

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Why don't you just say

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
A bunch of car stuff

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
You'll get cars does it really matter

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
And you get a car

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
It's just some stupid car

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
For Gran Turismo

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
You get five stupid cars

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
For Gran Turismo 6

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
There

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
In lighter news Bob Hoskins died

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
At age 71

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
That means no Mario 2

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
For anyone

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Never coming now

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
It's alright you know what

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
They can just recast him with Danny DeVito

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
It's almost the same right

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
I guess

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Bob Hoskins didn't care for the Mario Brothers movie

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Oh god I hope not

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Well nobody did well apparently John Lee

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Was almost put out a tweet about the whole thing

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
And I think he even responded to somebody

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
That said like well didn't you guys hate the Mario

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Movie and he kind of said something to the effect

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Of and I'm paraphrasing here

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
It's grown on them over the years

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Probably the fan response

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
And the fact that people care about it now

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Probably has grown on at least John Leguizamo

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
It kind of sucks I mean imagine like you're

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
John Leguizamo back and you're kind of almost like

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
A no name actor at that point

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
And they're like hey we're gonna

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Ok whatever yeah that's fine but he's a little bit more known

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Now I mean he's more known now

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
He was in Moulin Rouge

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
And he was also in Kick-Ass 2 by the way

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And they're like

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Hey we're making a movie based on Super Mario

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Brothers you want to be in it?

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
And it's like fuck yeah well he probably wasn't like that

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
He probably auditioned for it but you know hey we're making a movie

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
His agent was probably like fuck yeah

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Yeah it's like seriously

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
You know probably the same thing happened when Double Dragon

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Had a movie too and we know how that turned out so

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
It's just

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
It's just one of those things you know it's unfortunate

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
And now we'll never know if

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
You know a sequel really could have happened because they left

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
It wide open at the end

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Or Tiger Claws has no

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Sequel to who framed Roger Rabbit either

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Yeah that movie scared the crap out of them

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Well wasn't the end of like the Super Mario Brothers movie

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Wasn't that kind of like the same premise that they can basically do

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
In the end of the new

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Or the beginning of the new Tron movie you know

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Where they invade Earth or whatever

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Well but in the Mario movie it was like

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Was it Daisy that was in there?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
She just shows up at the end and she's like guys we got trouble

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Or something stupid like that

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
And they're like okay Marty it's your kids

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
She had like plunger guns or something I don't remember

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
That movie was so awful

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Rama in chat says in heaven right now

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
There's two Marios and a Luigi

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
I think Bowser, Koopa around

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Yeah because Dennis Hopper's passed away

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I didn't know that

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
You didn't know that? Yeah Dennis Hopper died a few years ago

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
It was while he was on that TV show Crash

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
That they made out of the movie

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
And then

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Yeah Captain Lou Albano

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Who played Mario on the TV show passed away

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And the guy who played Luigi Danny Wells

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Passed away

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
So yeah

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
John Leguizamo better watch out

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Not to be crass but

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Better watch out

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Maybe we can get the pest too

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
No

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
My favorite Bob Hoskins

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Role will always be Smee

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
In Hook

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
My favorite will always be Who Framed Roger Rabbit

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
There you go

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
I didn't like Who Framed Roger Rabbit actually

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
I know that's sacrilege

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Actually that's my favorite Christopher Lloyd role

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Oh yeah he was actually really good

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Not even Back to the Future

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Professor Plum in Clue

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Never

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
Alright but Christopher Lloyd's still alive

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Just for the record

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
And I gotta be honest

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
And I gotta be honest I'm absolutely surprised he's still alive

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Because he looks older than dirt right now

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Stop you guys are so

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I mean no don't get me wrong

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I hope he lives forever but

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
He looks old

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I know he can't but

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
He looks fucking old but

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
That's why if we're gonna get another Back to the Future

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Movie or something

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Hurry up on that shit

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
He's not getting any younger

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
If they don't do a reboot isn't that what they do now?

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
It's a reboot

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
What happened to reboot the movie?

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I thought that was coming at some point

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
What happened to reboot the show?

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
They really fucked that one up

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
That was cool for like the first season

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
We're gonna have all these characters in there

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
And now it's something weird

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Fifth Dream says the only ones surviving

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Are Princess and Toad that's suspicious

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I don't even remember Toad in that movie

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
I don't either but

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Alright let's move on let's get to the foogle question of the week

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
You take Facebook, you take Google

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
As in Google Plus you slam those

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Together and you get foogle

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
And so that's why we go to our fan communities every week

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
And ask a question of our

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Listeners and we read some of our favorite answers

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Here on air

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Maybe I'll read them all tonight

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I'm gonna start on Google Plus

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
With the question which is about the whole Disney

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Infinity, Skylanders

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Because I knew we'd be talking about these games that come with figures

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Tonight because of the Marvel news and the fact

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
That Shane made me play Skylanders

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I will point out

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
That when you actually played it

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
You asked me to go get it

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Like I've been saying we need to play this

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
We need to play this and then out of the blue you're like

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Okay let's play this

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
I was ready to do the live stream

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
I was like if we're gonna do this let's do it

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
And then we asked you guys

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Now that it's been a few years for Skylanders

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
And a year for Disney Infinity

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
It looks like these games are here to stay

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
How do you feel about these games

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Involving sold separately figures

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Do you really enjoy the games and collecting the figures

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Or do you think these are cheap cash grabs

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
That aren't worth your time

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
We just kind of wanted to know generally what do the listeners think of these games

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Retertainment on Google Plus says

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I haven't given these games much thought

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
But I'm not a kid and I don't have any children of my own

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Sure I could buy these video game or toy combinations

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
My sister's family has enough problems keeping themselves

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
In government subsidized housing

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Does anyone else remember Captain Power

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
I do I do

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Act Def says

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I still think these type of games are really big cash grabs right now

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
But they're good ones at least for the most part

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
A lot of people both children and adults

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Like both Skylanders and Disney Infinity

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Collect the figurines and play the games

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
The only one that got close to getting me to buy

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Figurines was Pokemon Rumble U

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
But I heard the game was crap and didn't do it

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
I'm still kind of tempted by them though

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
It was crap

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Don't do it

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Alright and going over to

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Facebook I can probably read most of these

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I might make some of them a little shorter though

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
Andy R says

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
In a way it doesn't seem all that different than DLC to me

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Only your DLC nets you a collectible

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
You can put on a shelf

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
DLC is its own love it or hate it gaming trend

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
But getting physical collectibles with it

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Is all upside I'd say

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
I've never been into Skylanders or Disney Infinity

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
But as someone who collects and plays Magic

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
People may get addicted to it

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
The only problem I have with that is that

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
DLC tends to be

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Not always but tends to be more robust

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Like when I think about Mass Effect 3

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Story DLC

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Great! Whole bunch of stuff I'm getting for my 10 or 15 bucks

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
But then I think about horse armor

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
In Oblivion

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Not great right

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
The reason why I bring that up is that

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
When you get through these doors and things

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
It's not that much

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
It's like one room that has a hat in it

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
One puzzle to do

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
It's not like a whole bunch

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
Technically for the case of Skylanders

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
You buy the starter pack

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Because that's what they're forcing you to do every single time

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
You get characters there

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
You don't need to buy anybody else

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
You can beat the entire game

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Everything else would be optional

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
That is horse armor

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
That's all it is

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Haseo Sumeruagawa responds

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
I can't I just can't

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Rene our friend from the podcast

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Killer Queens from Outer Space says

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
It's a great way to keep a game in players minds

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
By offering expansions

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
To keep replayability high

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
But it's just not my bag

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Gamer Girl says

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
On one hand I think it's good for the collector in mind

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
But on the other hand I think it's a waste of money for parents

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Whose kids lose interest rather quickly

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Blood Drunk says

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
It's a giant cash grab gimmick to get children hooked

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
To make the parents buy figurines for the game

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
In my book at least

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Critical Myth responds

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
And even though he's beat each of the three games

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Many times over

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
There's still plenty of those damn figurines sitting unused

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Their idea is neat

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
But there has to be a better way to implement it

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
To make it less of a cash grab

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Ciala responds and says

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
If Nintendo ever does this with Pokemon

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
They'll become a leading world economy

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Well again they started to do it

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
But they did it half-assed

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
They did it really half-assed

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
I'm not huge on this method myself

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
But I might collect some if they have cool figures

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
From something I enjoy

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Shay C. replied

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And agreed with the first answer I read from Andy R.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
It's essentially DLC

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
And should be held to the same standard

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
It can be fine

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
But if you're shipping a full price game where say

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Half or more of the content is gated

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Oh the boss is behind a door you need a fire grind to open

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Buy additional figures

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
That crosses the line

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
As long as the amount of gameplay provided for all combinations of purchases

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Is in line with the cost

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
I've got no real problem with it

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
And if we're going to be fair

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
This is all on this DLC by the way

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
In my book

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
I did think it was cool

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I did think it was really cool

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
That those figures save

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Data in them

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Through the little chips

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
I had never played the game on my Playstation 4 before

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
But when Shane put the little bird figure

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
It's like oh this is level 10

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And you have all these abilities on it

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
So is your Wii remote but no one gives a shit about that

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
So I thought it was a neat use of that technology

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
For what it's worth

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
But I just want to say about the DLC question

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Since Shane already answered it

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
You can beat the game with just what it comes with

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
In my opinion

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Those figures are not worth it

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Just for the DLC in the game

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
You really have to like it

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
You have to like the figure

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Like that it lights up or whatever

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
And you get a little bit of an enhancement

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
A little bit of an incentive

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
You could eat a pizza that's just cheese

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
But really you want pepperoni

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
For some people

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
That's how it's going to be

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Two more answers left

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
I hope I don't mispronounce this

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
It's either Felipe or Felipe

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Felipe A replies and says

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
When I was a kid my parents bought me a lot of cheap toys

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
From the store that I would end up playing for maybe

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Two to three hours and forget about them

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
I equate Skylanders and all other figures to those

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
They are cheap distractions that keep kids entertained

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
For a couple hours

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
I got my parents to use their money to give me a couple hours

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Of entertainment back then

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
And then I gave the game to a couple more extra

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Not for me since I'm in my twenties

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
But I'm not the addressable market for them either

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Shane might disagree with you there

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:11.000
I think once you start putting like age restrictions on stuff

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
You get kind of ridiculous

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Like you could say the same thing about any video game

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Can we talk about your Power Rangers toy?

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Yeah I don't care

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Talk about my Power Rangers

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
You want me to go get it? I'll play it over the stupid thing

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
After I'm done, yes go get your Power Rangers toy

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I brought all three

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
You didn't know I brought three

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
It's like a train

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
That's not even the series we have here

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
It's a train thing in Japan

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
And it makes choo choo noises

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
And you paid $60 for it

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
It's their Morpher in the new Japanese series

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I love it, it's amazing

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
You know what though?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Everybody has their thing

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
I do this Rocky Horror thing

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
And you always look at me going

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
You are wasting all of your time

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
Don't tell me to tell you that too though

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
So I'll remind you

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
There's all that going on

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
But then you spend $60 on a Power Rangers toy

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
And I'm fine with it

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
People spend money on whatever makes them happy

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Yes, now you can keep reading it all over our back

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Alright

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Well I only have one more answer so you better hurry

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And again I'm probably going to mispronounce this

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
So I apologize

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Amanojeko

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
I think is how I say that

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Amanojeko says the idea of Skylanders

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
is a fun concept with a variety of

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
figures to choose from so you can play

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
the way you want. The only drawback is

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
the fact that some Skylanders giant figures

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
can't be used in Swap Force and vice versa

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
For the money people put in the game

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
they should be able to use them as they

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
see fit

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Alright, I agree with that

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat room says

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
I'd be more interested in Disney Infinity because

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
of recognizable characters. I wouldn't

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
mind having a Tron action figure that also

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
works in a video game, but no, they didn't release

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
any Tron figures for Disney Infinity

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Yeah, I'm a little

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
bitter about that

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Yeah, I agree. They did have some Tron things in the

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
toy box, but yeah, no Tron figure

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
unfortunately

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Best you could do is have these little

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
citizens or whatever

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
toy things running around

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
you can dress them up like Tron, that's about it

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Whoopee

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
So answering the questions for ourselves here real quick

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Loki, all the sass

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
and anger stuff aside, how do you really

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
feel about these games?

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I mean, I tried Disney Infinity and

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
once again, it was

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
too young

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
of a demographic for me

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
You bought it and sold it on eBay, right?

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
It wasn't

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
It's cool, like the figurines

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
are pretty neat. I kind of wish that you could

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
do something with them, like that they actually were figurines

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
that you could pull off the base and

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
do stuff with

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
But as far as collecting them goes, I mean, they're not

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
bad. I mean, they're kind of cool looking

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
I just think though it is

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
pretty obvious in both games

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
of how much of a cash grab they are

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
and yeah, I know that people compare it to

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
DLC, but dude

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
there's 60 pieces of

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
DLC if you want to call it that

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
60 pieces plus

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
that are like 10 bucks each

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
You don't really have to buy

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
like as Shane said earlier, you need one of each

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
element or one of each power, you don't need all

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
You don't have to, but then why offer 60 pieces?

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Because they want you to buy all of them

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
And there will be people that will buy all of them

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
And some of the figures are kind of neat, like they light up and shit

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
remember? Anyhow

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Yeah, and those cost an extra $5

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Here's the thing, after

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
finally getting my hands on Skylanders this week

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
it's not as bad of a game as I thought it would be

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
like the game itself, I was expecting it to be a lot worse

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
and a lot more in your face of a cash grab

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
No, it's pretty sweet, but it wouldn't be

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
just the same game if you just

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
played it and you unlocked characters via

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
progression or whatever, finding

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
them, I mean, that would be

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
I don't know, like a game that they released

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
years ago, but now they're like, hey we can make

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
an extra $600 off of that

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Fuck you

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I can hear you on that

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
And you know what? There's going to be stuff

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
when the Tron figures come out eventually for Disney

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Phoenix, like

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
that's really cool, but nope

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Alright, got to move on with the show, but quickly

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Shane's back with his toys, remember it's a radio show

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
so help explain it for us a little bit

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
what you brought back. So, first of all I couldn't find one of my toys

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
but I have the original Dragonzord dagger

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
from like 1990 something here

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
and it still

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
still works

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
I haven't ever changed the batteries

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
I don't know how it works

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
But this other thing is

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
you put a train in

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
and it makes train noises, hold on

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
What do trains have to do with Power Rangers?

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
That's just the theme this time, is their train theme

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Oh yeah

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
So he's putting this little train

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
in the, it looks like a rocket

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
launcher or something that has

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Well no, these are like

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
the crossing signal things. Anyway, so like

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
you want to morph, so you hit this

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That's train noises, and you put the

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
train in

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
You push the gates down

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
And because of the way

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
the train is molded at the bottom

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
and it hits certain sensors

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
and it knows which train you put in there

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
so it knows that this is the Red Rangers train

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
so it tells me that I just wanted to

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
The look on Loki's

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
face right now is priceless

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
He spent $60 on that

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
I was over at Flaco Jones' house

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
and I showed his kid this series

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
and he would not quit watching it

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
so watch out

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
And Flaco Jones isn't going to be inviting you back

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
anytime soon

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
You know what though?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
I respect the fact that they can do that

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
straight face throughout the whole thing

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
even though it's kind of ridiculous

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
but I do want to see some really

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
I want them to kind of take that and run with it

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Maybe next year they can do

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
household appliances

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Well, toaster ranger

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Yeah, mow the lawn ranger

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
It's Japan, they do crazy things

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
like last time was dinosaurs

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
but the other half of that was samba dancing

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
and they had guns that they would spin

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
and would make music and they had to dance to it

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
This is pretty awesome

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
You know what? That's the next one we get here

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I'm excited

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Syallen Chat says, you're not alone

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
because Syallen Chat says, Shane Alinko

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I need that in my life

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Yes, I see that

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
live.vognetwork.com

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Alright, let us move on with more show

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
We've got more news to get into

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
and your emails to get to as well

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
I mean, I don't know

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
I've watched the Transformers

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
slash Thomas thing that they did

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
on YouTube, it's hilarious

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
and they have that

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
so maybe Power Rangers thing would be so bad

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Anyways, ok

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
so

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
this is kind of

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
I don't know, it's kind of disappointing if you're a fan of

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
maybe Tony Hawk and stuff

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Neversoft, a company that used to do

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
some pretty awesome games

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Tony Hawk included

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
They are now being rolled into

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Infinity Ward or what is now Infinity Ward

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
and

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
because I think Neversoft

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
actually did some Call of Duty

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
work before

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I want to say that they worked on

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
either certain versions of the game or DLC

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
or something like that

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
a portion of the game

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
well now

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
they worked with them for

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Call of Duty Ghost

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
so now they're actually going to be part of Infinity Ward

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
and Neversoft is no more

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
so

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
but it's

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
did I hear no layoffs?

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
the name is No More

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Didn't they make the Guitar Hero 3 and after

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
and all that too?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I wanted to say that they did, yeah

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
well moving on, this is involving layoffs

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
this is Future

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
is going through some restructuring and

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
redundancies or layoffs

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Future, they don't make games

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
but they make some gaming commentaries, magazines

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
things like OXM, PC Gamer, CVG

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
and Edge, so some of these magazines

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
and websites, they're going through

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
global restructuring, this means

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
layoffs and according to CEO

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
no part of the business will be unaffected

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
they also say that Future

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
will no longer, this is not from the CEO but from Media Week

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
Future will no longer be structured around

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
content types like technology

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
but instead a single content and marketing

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
team will produce all content

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
basically the whole move to digital

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
they say diluted focus and distracted

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
the talent, so interesting

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
all these brands range from

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
cars to tech, music, sports and so on

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
it sounds like they're probably going to combine

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
similar things and try to push out

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
similar content in both paper and

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
digital forms or something along those lines

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
kind of where it sounds like this is going

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
it doesn't totally surprise me

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
in this day and age we live in, it's so

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
much easier for people to make homegrown

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
media content, hi

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
how you doing?

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
so that's just the reality

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
of the industry, but still

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
no funding, and not get paid for it

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
well for us yeah, but

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
well yeah we do it for free

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
so it makes it that much harder for the people

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
and I'm not just saying we, but I mean there's tons

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
of websites and tons of even

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
homegrown mags and

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
video shows and so forth, it makes it that

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
much harder for the people that do want to get money to do it

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
but you know

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
that's the reality

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
but layoffs are never fun to talk about

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
so best of luck to those

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
folks that are affected, hope you can find

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
another job in the industry that you enjoy

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Shane

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
oh sorry I was chatting

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
oh now the chat room wants to talk

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Power Rangers, you're all in it right?

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
yeah I'll talk Power Rangers for days

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
so from software makers of

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
games like Otogi, because that's really the only one

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
I remember, but I guess

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
they also do like Dark Souls

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
or Armored Core

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
but Otogi

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
enchanted arms

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
like the first RPG on 360

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Awful, that was such a bad game

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
yeah, that was from software

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
did From Software also do

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
or did they have a part in

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
what was it, ChromeHounds?

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
I think that was mostly Sega I think

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
I could be wrong

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
but they have published recently

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
they've done a lot more than what

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Shane's leading on, but mostly Otogi

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
still, because that was a really good game

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
but they also published Killer's Dead

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
and the lollipop

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
chainsaw in Japan

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
they have been acquired by

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Kadokawa Corporation

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
which is a

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
corporation

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
that publishes manga

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
like I guess

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Gundam and Neon Genesis

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Evangelion

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Bobby says

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
From did do ChromeHounds, you're right

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
and I'm wrong

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
sorry Shane

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
no that's really it, they were acquired by a

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
manga publishing company

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
interesting, interesting combination

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
I hope they make Otogi 3

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
crossing your fingers and your toes

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
just my fingers, I don't want that

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
much

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
lowkey

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
let's see

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
so this is kind of cool

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
one of the games I want to see, I think this was

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
GameSpy, yeah it was GameSpy

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
so one of the games that was affected by GameSpy

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
was a PC version of Halo Combat Evolved

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
and you know

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
the Halo franchise

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
they were rabid fans when it comes to

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
multiplayer, you may remember Halo 2

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
multiplayer on Xbox, there's a ton of people

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
that stayed in after you know they kind of

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
closed off the matchmaking

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
servers and stuff and they stayed in as long as they could

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
and they kind of drug it out, well

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
thanks to a

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
third party matchmaking online gaming

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
company called

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
GameRanger, the multiplayer service

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
is actually going to still

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
be continuing

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
and they're going to be

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
taking over I guess handling

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
the multiplayer for that game

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
so

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
oh and also I guess the demo and

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
the custom edition of that

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
so that's pretty sweet

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
on top of that

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
there's also, and this is good news

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
for me because I'm a fan of you know a lot of these

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
the Rockstar games but

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Grand Theft Auto 4

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
and Red Dead

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
what was it, Red Dead Redemption

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
the multiplayer for that is actually

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
being, Rockstar is going to

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
make sure that keeps continuing

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
at least for those two games

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Midnight Club 3 dub edition, dub edition

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
remix, Grand Theft Auto, Chinatown

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Wars and

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Beta Raider though are going to have their multiplayer shut

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
off although I can't imagine a lot of people play

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
multiplayer for Chinatown Wars, I didn't even

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
realize they had multiplayer

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
and of course you know Grand Theft Auto 5 is not

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
effective because that was never 3 games by the first place

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Max Payne 3 also

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
not being affected by that

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
we're seeing though that

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
oh I'm sorry

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Mac users in Max Payne 3 are not going to be able to

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
play multiplayer anymore, PC though you're ok

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Red Dead Redemption though

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
no problems there

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
and then the PS3 version of

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 is losing its

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
leaderboards as well

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
so

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
I don't know

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
I'm glad to see that some of these companies are

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
stepping in to make sure their games don't go dark

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
as far as multiplayer is concerned

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
so that's

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
pretty cool

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
alrighty

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
let us go into the mailbag

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
we're going to open up the mailbag and read some of our emails

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
participate at orangelawandtrady.com

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
the place to send those emails

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
and every week DarkSakura

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
suits up and dives into the emailbag and

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
picks some emails to read, however she's not here

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
she has the night off so

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
I will borrow the hazmat suit

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
and dive on in and pick out some emails to read

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
for y'all

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
we are going to start with this email from

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Dee

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Dee does not want to have their full name read

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
and so

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
can we just make up a name then?

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
sure, make up a name

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
but what if the name you make up

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
and you don't know because you can't see the email

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
what if it happens to be the same name

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
it's going to be awkward

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
this person's name is DuckSauce

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
DuckSauce?

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
this person's name is not DuckSauce

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
it's because they don't want their full name read

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
so DuckSauce emailed us

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
and

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
DuckSauce has some insider info for us

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
let's get to it

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I'm not, I don't give a shit about grammar

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
and B, even if Jamie had been here

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
and I would have been like, look Jamie

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
he speaks two languages

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
and until you can speak

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
two languages fluently, you're going to cut him a break

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
so please don't ever

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
be afraid to email us just because English isn't your

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
first language. Jamie will give you a break

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
because, you know, she expects if you're going to

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
speak one language, speak it well

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
but if you're going to speak more than one, then you get

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
a little room for error, so don't worry about it

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
LDuckSauce? Is that what we're

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
calling him now? Yes, LDuckSauce

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
LDuckSauce, ok, act-def says that would be

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
El PatoSauce

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
but that doesn't have a D in it

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
alright

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
alright, anyway

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
however, I am too excited to not tell

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
anyone about this, I am currently a beta

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
tester for PlayStation Now

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I wanted to hear your opinions, please

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
keep my name private so I don't get in trouble for

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
opening my big mouth, you've got it

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
LDuckSauce, alright, I finally

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
received the code to get into the private

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
beta of PlayStation Now

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
I want to know your opinions about the service

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
do you think it's going to be a great, great

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
service? What are the problems you see

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
with this service? What do you want this service

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
to be when all is said and done? Do you think

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
it can be a type of future for gaming?

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
That's a lot of questions, LDuckSauce

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
but I will try to kind of summarize

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
my thoughts on it

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
I think it's a very exciting and creative way

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
to get the PlayStation games

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
backwards compatible. I am not

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
too exciting at the prospect of paying

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
for games again. I really wish

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
that if I had a PlayStation 3 disc

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
I could just enable that in my library

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
I realize why that's probably not going to

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
be possible, even if the digital games

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
carry over, I'll be mostly happy

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
about that, so I'm hoping

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I'm a little worried about the technology

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
sometimes with streaming games

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
it's not always perfect

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
the delay concerns

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
me quite a bit

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
but I commend

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
them for trying and I'm open

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
to it and again I'm really

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
curious to see how much they charge for some

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
of these games because it's very interesting

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
what LDuckSauce breaks down

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
here

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
BlackWolf says

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
I want to hear LDuckSauce's opinion because he's

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
actually used it

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
and BlackWolf says it's hard to answer these

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
questions without having used the service

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
so let's get into actually

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
you're lucky Bobby because LDuckSauce actually

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
answers these questions

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
my experience so far is as follows

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I'm using a Playstation 3 and a wireless

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
connection, the beta only has about 20

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
games and so far in the beta

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
I believe it's a good selection, they have good games

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
like Saints Row 3, Luminous Supernova

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Puppeteer, BlazBlue, Disgaea

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Catherine Knights Grid, Fuel, and Skullgirls

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
as you can see they have a good selection

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
or choices for anyone

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
for now all the games are free

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
I was going to say those are all the Playstation Plus games

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
for the most part

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
not Luminous, I would have grabbed that

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
well some of these are, some of these are

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
not, maybe those are upcoming

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
free titles

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
alright, when you select a game

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
you need to pick how many days you want to

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
rent this game, you have three options

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
one day, seven, or thirty days

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I will assume that these prices will eventually

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
show up after beta, the game

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
themselves ran great, I do have to admit that

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I never had a problem with the actual gameplay, sounds

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
or frame rate, however I did have

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
trouble with the video quality, there's this weird

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
YouTube dream effect going on

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I don't know how to explain it, it's like when you watch a

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
YouTube HD video on your iPhone

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
and the quality drops to 720 or lower

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
for a couple seconds, this happens sometimes

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
on Playstation 3 games that I was streaming

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
at first it was super distracting, but eventually

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
you got used to the video dip, when I plugged

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
in the connection, this problem was resolved

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
my second concern is that I am worried

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
about online gaming with this program

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I haven't tried that part yet, but I love

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
fighting games and I can't truly see anyone

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
playing fighting games online with some

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
service like this, I'm really

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
impressed by this technology, I know

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
that there was something like this before

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
I think it was called OnLive, I feel

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
that this could become like a Netflix meets

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
RedBox and specifically if you mix it with

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Playstation Network Plus, no need

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
to ask for demos, just pay 99 cents

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
and rent the game for a day, maybe

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
a program like this will also discourage game

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
companies to make short games, like a game

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
like the most recent Metal Gear, I would have

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
rented it for a day or week instead of buying a disc

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
version, I know there will be problems like

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
internet connections, licensing fees and other things

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
that Sony can't control, I truly

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
wish this is part of the future for gaming

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
I know I only test it for two days so far

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
but I'm loving it, I know we all want to know

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
what the future for gaming is, but this could be something

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
that Sony can release quietly and catch on

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
really good once we all give it a chance

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Sorry for the long email, just wanted to hear

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
your opinions and give mine, keep up

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
the great podcast, love you guys

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Lducksauce

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
There it is, so

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
thank you for the email and actually your English

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
is very good, I did correct some of your tense

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
as I was reading it, that's really

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
the only thing I see is that sometimes you have to put

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
the D at the end of the word because it's in the past

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
but otherwise you did a great job

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
and considering I can speak no Spanish

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
really, although that won't

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
stop me from trying to watch Telemundo because that

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
shit's great, I'm very impressed

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
and please do email us in the future

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
What did you guys think about, what do you have to say about PlayStation Now?

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
I just have to make, you know

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
as long as it works and the

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
pricing is right, because I mean honestly

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
with some of these older games and stuff, why am I

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
going to rent it if I can buy a used

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
copy of it for just about the same price

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
you know, like hell fuck, I just bought

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 for five bucks

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I'm not going to rent it

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Is this why GameStop

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
might think they're in trouble though, like they're thinking the opposite

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
you're thinking, that people will want to rent

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
because it's so convenient? No, because that's why rental

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
stores are around, I mean you can rent games if you want

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
to usually, I mean depending on your area

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
I guess, and those are kind of

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
gone by the wayside anyways, and they already have

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
they have games in Redbox so you can get

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
like for example Metal Gear Solid

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
or Metal Gear Solid 5, Ground Zeroes

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
you probably could have rented that for like two bucks

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
or whatever and

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
that's available to you

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
but it's just whether you want to do it or not

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Shane, what are your thoughts on PlayStation Now?

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Well as someone who may or may not

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
have played it

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
I may or may not agree

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
with what he said, especially

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
the parts about

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
it not being laggy

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
or

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
responsive, like

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
say for example, hypothetical

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
hypothetical

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
playing Luminesce

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
if I were in the beta

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
I may have problems

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
or may have had problems

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
playing Luminesce because

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
of the responsiveness

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
of the controller or

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
that stupid music

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
game shooter thing where you play

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
backwards and it's all based on the

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
retrograde which I liked. No, no

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
I'm saying based on a PlayStation

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Now experience that I may or may not have had

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
yeah

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
that was ridiculously hard

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
because of that, or would have been

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
if I was playing it

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
but I think

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
otherwise I agree with what he said

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
I

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
worry about that delay between

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
input because it makes music

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
games hell, it makes a lot of action games or anything

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
especially a very demanding

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
platformer that you have to time

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
your jumps perfectly and shit

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
NES Remix which I know isn't a PlayStation

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
game but hear me out

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
that would be murder on that so they really need to

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
tighten that up. It's murder on any game

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
like maybe in the

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
past when they had Guacamelee up

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
to play and if I had been

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
playing it just normal jumps would

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
have been awful to get to

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
various parts in that game

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
making me turn off the system

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
alright

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
well I

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
really appreciate the email from

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
ElDuckSauce so please

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
who has a new nickname thanks

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
to Shane? You never had

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
one before but you do know. I can nickname everybody

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
that you have for the mailbag

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
so let's go with the next one

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
we'll get to it, hold on because in the chat TigerCaw

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
asks, Sky you tried watching

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Sabado Higante, yes I have

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
that shit is amazing, it's like a

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
game show, variety show

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
that's the type of stuff that used to

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
be on the TV in the golden age here

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
in America and you don't see it anymore

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
but you're still doing that stuff on Sabado Higante

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
which Act F corrects

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
is on Univision

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
not Telemundo, yes it's the other

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
big Spanish network

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
so there you go

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
yes I do enjoy watching Sabado Higante

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
I have no idea what they're saying but some of the

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
sketches are still hilarious and I can

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
I can pick up enough words

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
you know

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
like if I'm watching a

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
telenovela

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
and one chick calls another

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
a peta, like I know what they're saying

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
no

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
alright, moving on

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
we have another email from

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
this one is from

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Martin from

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Belgium, Martin

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
from Belgium, he's emailed us before

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I thought I was giving a nickname, well that's

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
that's the name, what should Martin

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
but there's no nickname, Martin is I think their real

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
name, like you know

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Martin but Belgium, what you gonna give

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
a nickname or not, not now?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
you're protesting? I'm protesting, I was going

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
to give it before

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
we, okay we'll assume I didn't say his

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
name, it's too late, I can't do that

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
cause now I'm like oh his nickname

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
will be Martin

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
alright

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Dear Sky Dark Soccer and Loki, I wanted to email

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
you this week since you were kind enough to remember

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
on last week's show that you have listeners in Belgium

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
I got your back, I got your back

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I remember, why are you laughing?

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
I just took that as a dig at you

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
yeah cause I usually forget

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
a lot of things, I really do

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
congratulations on your 550th episode

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
that's an impressive number, now on to

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
666

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I listened to the show on my commute to work, a welcome

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
distraction, I've been playing FTL

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
faster than light this week, my god is it

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
addictive, again, they just released

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
a free expansion pack adding new ships, weapons

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
and events which made the game interesting again

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
since I got burned out on it last time

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
is it the kind of game that incites

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
it is the kind of game that incites comments

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
such as crap, it is that time already

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
I just played FTL for 5 hours and it felt like

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
5 minutes, it seems to make time move

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
around you faster than light

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
that came with a winky face, that's an apology

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
for that pun, definitely recommend

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
it, also wanted to share

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
something gaming hardware related, I just

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
got a new Retina MacBook Pro recently which

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
is pretty good hardware for gaming, an Nvidia

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
750M, but tends to get very hot

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
due to the thin form factor, I came

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
up with a cooling solution for when I'm using it at my desk

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
for gaming, I prop up the MacBook on

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
a giant heat sink and have a

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
120mm fan blowing

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
cool air through it, the heat at the

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
bottom of the aluminum case is conducted through the

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
heat sink and blown away, I attached a

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
picture, this lowers the system temperature

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
significantly while gaming

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
anyway, keep up the great show so I have something to do

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
on my commute to work, greetings from

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Belgium, the land of beer and waffles

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
just one 120mm fan?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
you forgot fries

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
by the way, I went to a place

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
in New York City once, it was nothing but Belgian fries

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
and dips, it was so fucking good

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
I went to a place that was just all fries

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
this weekend, it's called

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Potato Corner, and they have

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
six types of fries and they're all different flavors

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
where is this at? This sounds amazing

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Paladio, it's in the food court

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
I'm gonna have to check that out, I don't know what that is

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
alright, there's a PS

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
by the way before I get to the picture, PS I'm on my way

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
to go paintballing right now which I also recommend

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
it's like a real life video game and also good exercise

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
well that's something Loki used to do, the paintballing

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
I did airsoft

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
paintball's a little bit more honest because you can actually

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
see when you hit somebody and can't say

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I didn't hit, what are you talking about?

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
and here's the picture

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
of the heat sink and the fan

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
against the laptop, that seems to be

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
pretty, I bet if Loki had

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
did that when he was doing Titanfall

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
his laptop would not have melted

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
I did not have my

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
heat sink or fan

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
when I was playing Titanfall because I was at work

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
and I don't bring it with me because it's fucking huge

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
and also requires an external

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
12 volt power supply in order to run

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
those fans, and I actually don't use those fans anymore

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
because my new laptop's pretty cool

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
I just have to

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
use that tray because it still gets warm

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
on the bottom, just not to the point where

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
it's gonna break

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
damn you aces

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
if I still buy you

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
alright

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
now onto our last

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
email tonight

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
which is a follow up to an email we got

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
last week, which Shane you let me know during the break

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
you don't listen to OLR so you didn't hear

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
of this email, you know I was asleep

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
alright, well

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
last week we had an email

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
from Dr. Noir

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
who emailed us from Lima, Peru

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
and said they could not remember the name

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
of a game, it was an 8 or 16

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
bit game where you place

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
so here's the description of the game for you Shane

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
cause you asked, so here it is, Shane

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
you gotta guess, you ready?

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
it's an 8 or 16 bit game

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
where you place mythical creatures

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
I remember unicorns and dragons

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
on a hex board to do battle

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
against monsters on a turn based

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
strategy system, the creatures

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
level up after they acquire kills

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
the name and platform for the game

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
is what I'm after, and a source

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
would be appreciated since I wanna play it

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
with my kids, Shane

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
can you name that game?

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
no

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
what is

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
crappy RTS on

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
the Genesis or Super Nintendo

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
and he wagered

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
one dollar, no I put

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
everything, it was like 30 million

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
alright, well

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
somebody last week got it right

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
Dr. Noir's emailing

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
us again, hi OL Army

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
greetings from Buenos Aires, Argentina

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
he's moving around

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
he explains why in the email

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
thanks for the answer

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Master of Monsters it is

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I played the Genesis version

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
oh I got some of that right

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
yeah Genesis or

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Super Nintendo, yeah but it could've been

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
8 bit, so I was still

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
half right, so there it is Master of

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Monsters it is, and somebody in chat had

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
yelled that out last week and I think Sega gave him a

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
free game for getting it, so

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
thank you chatters, you saved the date, that's why

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
I love doing this live show, and I fully

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
admit, sometimes I don't know it

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
when we're talking about video games, and Loki don't

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
know it, and Jamie doesn't know it, and Shane sure

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
don't know it, sorry I don't know all the obscure RTS

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
back from the 8 bit days, but we had

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
the chat room to save the day, and it was Master

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
of Monsters was the game, and

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
he goes on to say Sky, sorry for the

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
headache, it wasn't

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
really your question that was causing the headache

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I had a lot going on during the show last week

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
there was a lot going on, everything's

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
better now, and

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Dr. Noir wants to clarify, I'm Mexican

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
but I travel a lot for my

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
sales job, listen to you soon

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
we'll say hello to everybody in Argentina if you

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
haven't already left, so there it is

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Dungeon Buster, taking a bow in

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
a victory lap in our chat room for remembering

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Master of Monsters, and

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
all of our listeners as well can finally

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
go, finally

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
and it's funny because my buddy Jonko

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
from Koopa Club actually left

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
a comment on the Orange Launch Radio page

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
it was like, what if like

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
somebody just made something up that didn't exist

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
and sent it to your email bag, like how

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I was like, I kind of thought that's what

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
happened, like not that I thought Dr. Noir would lie

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I certainly wouldn't think he would lie, but you know

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
how like memory can change details

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
sometimes, like you think it was one

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
thing but it was- I know, there was

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
seriously, there was seriously

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
one of those fucking meditroid

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
energy tanks in one spot, and I wrote

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
down on like, cause back in the day I used

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
to have like a place I'd write down you know where stuff

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
was, and it wasn't fucking there

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
any other time I went back there, and I know

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
was there cause I got it one time

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
and it was never there again

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
damn anomalies

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Well Dungeon Buster did not go away

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
unrewarded, he does clarify in chat

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Seg gave away a copy of

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Dominique Pamplemousse, which Seg was here

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
on the show promoting about a month or so

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
ago, which is available on Steam, check

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
it out, if you like kind of artsy

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
games that are kind of click adventures

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
that are musicals, check

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
that out, Dominique Pamplemousse, and thanks Seg

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
for giving that out

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Black Wolf says master of monsters for classic game

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
of the week, I was trying to pressure

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Jamie into doing that tonight actually

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
but then she ended up not being here and I was like

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
alright well, Shane doesn't always get to pick

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
so I'll let him pick, and I would not have agreed

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
with that, this

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
crappy RTS came out

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
in some stupid time

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
stop it

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
alright, anyhow

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
moving

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
on, that is

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
that is that, that's it for the mailbag

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
get to the FUs of the week, thank you guys very much

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
for emailing us, participate

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
at Orangeloungeradio.com

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
is the place where you can send us emails

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
if you want to try and stump

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
the hosts

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
or ask Shane for an answer, then he'll just

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
go, well it's maybe

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
black or white or kind of in between

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
it might be anything actually

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
no, I gave an answer, it was pretty

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
like the only thing I was wrong on

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
or you know, not sure if it was the Genesis

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
or Super Nintendo part

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
but it was stupid RTS with unicorns

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
or whatever

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
alright, alright

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
let's move on and

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
get into the FUs of the week

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
because Jamie's not here

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
I guess FU2

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
or future FU2

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
I'm gonna have to make

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
actual levels for my game

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
and I was thinking about it today

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I'm like, out of all the things I'm gonna have to do for this

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
that's gonna be the hardest

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
so, as fun as it will be

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
making stuff, that's not gonna be fun to

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
actually do because you have to

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
you know, find a

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
nice balance between detail

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
and optimization

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
little voxels

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
a little difficult

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
alright, Shane, do you have an FU of the week?

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
I sure don't

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
alright

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I'm gonna take one that I think you wish

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
you would have thought of, my FU of the week

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
goes to PG&E

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
man, it was fun

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
who banged on my door at 9 o'clock this morning

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
that were like

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
we're here to shut off the gas because you don't have an account

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
through us

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
I'm like, because you remember, we just moved into this house

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
about 6 weeks ago at this point

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
and I'm like, da fuck?

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I'm like, yes we do, I called in to get it arranged

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
I logged into the website and gave this lady my account number

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
and she was like, dumbstruck, like awestruck

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
like, how could this happen?

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
what is this internet that you've talked about?

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
I know, well she even admitted, she's like, I'm an older lady

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
I don't know anything about this internet

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
when she realized I wasn't

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
like, that I had the receipts

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
I'm like, here's the receipts, lady

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
here they are

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
I know, she backed off a lot

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
she became very apologetic, she's like

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
oh, something's going on, let me take that down

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
well yeah, it's like, god dammit, someone

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
all of us fucked up again

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
well first off, Shane was like, how do you even know that was real

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
and maybe I don't, like it could have been a fake truck

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
or something, but

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
well she was just so crazy in her knocking

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
and doorbell ringing

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
they didn't ask for my social security or anything

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
so I was like, alright, whatever

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
but yeah, I was like, that was a little weird

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I think cops knock on like

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
criminals' doors nicer, because this is what she did

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
okay, etiquette dictates

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
that you ring the doorbell

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
you wait a couple moments

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
no answer, you knock politely

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
you wait a couple moments

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
you may repeat these steps again

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
she was, knock, knock, knock

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
doorbell, doorbell, doorbell, doorbell

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
knock, knock, doorbell, doorbell

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
so she was my wife

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
this is what my wife does

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
whenever she goes to her parents' house

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
and they're like, yep, it's Nellie

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
it's 9 AM on a Sunday

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
and I have a rock and roll lifestyle

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
yes, I am still asleep

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
and Alan

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
obviously I made Alan

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
get up

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I know, I'm poking Alan

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
get the door

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Alan gets up and gets it and is like, the lawn

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
better be on fucking fire

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
so yeah, that's what it was

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
so

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
F you to PG&E for getting me up

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
early on a Sunday morning, and then I was up

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
you should complain

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I did what people do in the year 2014

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
and I sent a passive aggressive tweet

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
that's what I did

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
I would have called them up and complained

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
because then you would be like, listen, they woke me up

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
you said that I didn't have an account

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
and you were threatening to shut off my stuff

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
I had to show you

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
this information that's available in your system

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
maybe they would have knocked off some money on your bill

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
we'll see what happens, I'm gonna see if I get a response on Monday

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
because then if I don't get a response

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
then that's two strikes

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
they knocked on my door

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
and didn't acknowledge my passive aggressive tweet

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
come on, check what year it is

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
I needed to get somebody that knew how to use a computer

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
that was my problem

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
alright, computer? what?

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
what is computer? there's no computer in this house

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
it's too small

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
how do you internet?

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
alright, which room do you have

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
dedicated to said computer?

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
couple more news stories for you guys

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
then we're gonna get to you guys at

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
where does the reel-to-reel tape go?

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
or our username on skype

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
orange lounge radio, all one word

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.000
let's get to a couple more stories, Loki

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
alright, so, talking about

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
like, really strange accusations

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
um

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
ZeniMax

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
they're claiming that

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000
IPs were thefted

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
thefted

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
um, see

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
to el-duckface

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
verbs?

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
oh, sorry, el-duck-sauce

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I couldn't remember the name

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I hate, I did that on purpose

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
ok, that was purposefully mispronounced

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
alright, fine

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000
because it was funny

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000
tense is hard

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
it's for humor, ok

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
so yes, basically they claim that

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
when John Carmack left he took

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
some proprietary VR

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
information and now

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
they're pissed off and they think that

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
money should be owed

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
little do they realize that

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
oculus was around before he left

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
for oculus

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
so, I don't understand that

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
part of it, but whatever

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
um, basically

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
seeing as ZeniMax

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
um, you know

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
they send a formal notice

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
regarding its legal rights to oculus concerning

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
its ownership of key technology used by oculus

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
to develop and market the oculus rip

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I just don't buy that, I mean

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I don't know, I

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
maybe John Carmack was working on some

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
VR stuff separate to the oculus rip

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
but I don't think that, it's not like he

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
left, formed oculus

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
rift, and then that

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
all happened, you know, it was

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
he came and joined them after

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
they already kind of had a prototype and

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
everything, so I don't really understand what

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
the point is

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
um, I'm guessing that they just want a piece

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
of that 2 billion dollars maybe

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
maybe, now that Facebook's involved, the timing

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
of it is a little suspicious

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
of course, you know, John Carmack has, you know

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
responded saying, no work I have ever done

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
has been patented

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
ZeniMax owns the code that I wrote

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
but they don't own VR

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
ouch

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
you know, Bobby told a very, you know, as

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I'm nice in promoting Bobby, even though he keeps

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
telling me tonight I'm wrong, and Loki's right

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
but Bobby told a very interesting story tonight

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
on his show, uh, Bobby Blackhole's show

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
that, uh, about getting hired

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
for tech companies, cause he's been job hunting lately

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
and, you know, some of the things that they

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
expect that they're gonna own of you if you go

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
for this company, and like, if you write any code

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
even if you're not on the clock, but you're with the company

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
they potentially own it, so

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I'll let him tell the story, you can go listen to

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
his show for the full details, but uh, yeah

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
you know, it's kind of interesting how legally

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
that all works when you're on somebody's payroll

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
like that, so that's

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
what they're trying to make the case

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
they're trying to say that someone possibly owns the rights to flappy vog

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
they could

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
if Bobby did not put a clause

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
in his contract or whatever, that's like

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
vog is a pre-existing thing and you can't

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
touch it, basically, if he didn't do that

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
uh, which I think

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
if I remember, I'm probably gonna be wrong again

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
but I believe if I listen to his show correctly

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
one of the people he was talking to

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
and getting employed at was like, we will own everything

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
basically, and he said no

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
because he didn't want them owning vog

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
but he got another employer that was like

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
you know, willing to write out, you know

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
things that, they, like

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
who's interested in vog, the types of companies he was

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
working for shouldn't have an interest in vog, it's not

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
like, not the same industry or whatever

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
we're interesting, what the hell

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
I mean, they should be interested

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
we're just not worth it to you guys

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
we've only been on the internet forever

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
but you know, whatever, I guess we're just not good

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
we're not an IGN or Kotaku

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
we don't run, you know

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Loki, you can't get a fucking NeoGaf account, okay?

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
we've been doing this for 12 years

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
I don't even fucking care anymore about NeoGaf

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
it's just like, seriously

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
it doesn't mean shit, unfortunately

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
if I write another forum thread about

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
what game should I buy

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
it's like, seriously, that is worthy of a friend

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
that person deserved an account

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
you know, to, you know

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
that was worth it

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
fuck it, I don't give a shit anymore

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
well, speaking of things

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
that have been on the internet forever and forever

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
yet a lot of people don't seem to care

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Twin Galaxies made an announcement this week

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
I thought they were gone!

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
oh, hold on, let me sip my tea

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
I thought they were gone though, didn't they go under or something?

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
nope, they're back

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
I think they have a new owner or something

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
but Twin Galaxies has announced that there's a

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
24-7 internet channel

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
dubbed Twin Galaxies Live

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
using Skype and Twitch

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
to foster interaction between broadcasters and audience members

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
and there's also like a schedule

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
of all these things so they can see what's coming up next

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
the COO of Twitch said in a press release

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
that since records are constantly being set

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
and broken in real time on Twitch

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
having Twin Galaxies on our platform

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
is a perfect fit

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
we look forward to seeing great gaming content from the Twin Galaxies team

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
hmm, 24-7 internet channel

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
fully interactive

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
featuring things like Skype and video

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
never heard of it!

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
never heard of it!

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
the only thing I'm kind of

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
worried about

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
is some of those records

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
especially when they're doing like these

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
high score records and stuff

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
require like 48 hours of playing

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
I'm not gonna fucking watch somebody play Donkey Kong

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
for 48 hours or however long it takes

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
it's several hours

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
I don't really mean to shade Twin Galaxies

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
because I do respect the site

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
and what it is an awful lot I do

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
but with all due respect

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
I have to go here, Logie

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
with all due respect

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
to our former home, All Games

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
All Games Radio, right?

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
I seem to remember back in the day

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
during All Games Interactive

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
somebody that he had on the show a lot

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
was Walter Day

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
from where?

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
Twin Galaxies

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
fully interactive content

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
I'm just an observation

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
I'm just...

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
just interesting

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
to be fair

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
there's a lot of people doing this

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
I think that they have now

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
because remember they have the awesome

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
games done quick type thing

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
where they had an event where they did that

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
I think they're actually continuing on with that

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
and that's still going

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
as its own channel now

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
where you can watch people do speedruns and stuff

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
it's more interesting than watching someone try to go for

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
the world record score in

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
some game

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
what's to say that they're actually

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
going to achieve that

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
score?

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
so all I'm doing is watching some person

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
who may not even be

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
a celebrity even in the gaming

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
scene or anything

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
making an attempt at a high score

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
so basically I'm just watching someone play a game

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
which is any channel on Twitch

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
any channel

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
and these people

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
who's giving commentary

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
we're in hour 46

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
of the

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
high score challenge

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
some people would make fun of the

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Starcraft and League of Legends type of commentary

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
so whatever

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
what do you talk about at that point though

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
when it's gone on for several

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
hours you can't talk about the game

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
wow this part of the game is really interesting

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
he's gonna have to

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
not die in order to make sure that he

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
keeps a high score

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
that's why they have

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
those long videos that Twin Galaxy watches

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
so you don't have to watch

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
the 48 hour attempt to get

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
whatever it is high score

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
and granted yes I know not every high score is gonna take

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
48 hours but it's still several hours

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
usually

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
in all seriousness good luck to them

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
please tell me that they're gonna go for the records for the quickest times

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
finishing these games because

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
then they've totally ripped off the other channel

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
alright

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
yeah we're done moving to the Skype calls

pretty good one so stay tuned for that

the camera and playroom playroom

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
yes they should have a world record for the most

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
views consecutive

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
views of playroom you know whatever

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000

chicks who are taking their tops off I've seen

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
like up the ante I've seen 800

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000

so I hear y'all kind of playing

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
around since Jamie's not there

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
guys night out I don't know if I call it

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
playing around you know Shane's

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
just running his mouth but what else is new

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I'm not running my mouth I had my

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
microphone on mute

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
but uh

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
sure it can be it can be a bro down tonight

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
what do you want to um what do you want to chat with us about

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
alright I want to talk about something different

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
I don't know if you saw this but

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
last week you know

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
how Nintendo is releasing

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
the limited edition Mario

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Kart 8 green

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
edition in Europe right

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
now I posted it on my

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
Facebook and I said that

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
they want $300 or I guess

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
$330 for this

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
fuck you Nintendo

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
wait till the price drops to $250 then

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
we can talk because I personally think

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
that it's overpriced for the technology

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
that's behind it and if you

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
saw it became a very interesting

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
conversation now a couple

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
days later I checked my I noticed

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
I have a message waiting for me on

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Facebook in my other folder I go check it out

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
somebody was

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
really so butthurt

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
that they decided to write

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
a flame essay

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
to me about

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
why the Wii U

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
doesn't suck

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
and this is how Facebook

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
is ruining America to be

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
quite honest I just

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
sat there and I just laughed

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
and he's telling me

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
that I'm a moron for thinking

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
that and as he's

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
trying to tell me it's better he goes

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
into reviewing some

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
new Mario Brothers or something else

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
how it's so much better and I'm just like

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
if you're going

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
to flame me at least be a little bit

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
more precise

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
flame me straight forward

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
I understand everybody has their

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
consoles what they like and don't like

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
because when I first got my 360

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
I dealt with the same thing

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
I bought the 360 because at the time

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
it has more games

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
that I will play on it

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
now that I have a 360 and a PS3

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
if you look at my library

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
I think it's

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
3 to 1 of

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
360 games of PS3 games

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
some of the Nintendo fans

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
are extremely passionate

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
and you know

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
I understand

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
you know what's funny Rama

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
there's people that listen to this show that call me

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
a Nintendo fanboy and that I'm

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
blind to all this other stuff you know or whatever

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
and I kind of think

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
I usually think I'm pretty equally

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
critical and fanboy

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
you know there's things I love about

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Nintendo but there's things that really bother me

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
about them too

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
I don't think you're being fanboy-ish at all

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
maybe you are but for every single

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
console that comes out

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
we rejoice

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
for a while and then we're like

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
wait what are you doing

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
we gotta call you out and just

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
play it down the middle

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
you know

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
so I mean personally

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
I just look at it from a technological

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
point of view I just personally feel

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Nintendo is asking for too

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
much money but as we all know

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
Nintendo is probably the only company

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
that makes a profit off of their

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
consoles

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
right they do now

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I don't think they used to but they do now

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
well from my understanding

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
from back as

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
8-bit NES they were making profit

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
over every single console till the 3DS

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
then they had to do the price

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
cut and I think they're

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
now making money off of that and

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
did they profit on GameCube? I thought GameCube

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
was one where they didn't profit I could be wrong

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I think they made like between $15

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
to $20 off of every

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
GameCube sold

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
that's part of their strategy

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
like I said the power behind it

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
if Nintendo was to knock it down to $250

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
I

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
had no problem going to Nintendo World

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
or Best Buy whatever and giving them my money

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
and walking out with a system I'm just waiting

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
for the price to come down and I'm not gonna

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
make the same mistake I did with the N64

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
buying it for one game and realizing that I'm not

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
really liking this game

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
so

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
where are things now with you and this guy

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
like did you just end up banning him

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
or what? no no he sent the

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
message and he blocked me after

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
he sent it so I went to my personal

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
blog and I

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
just said my piece and walked away

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I mean what did he hope to gain

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
from that whole thing I mean when you come out swinging

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
like that he's figured out that I'm right

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
and the fact that he's like

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
I'm wrong he's like

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
he also bought it for his kid I'm like

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
you are not setting a

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
proper precedent sir you need

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
to stop yeah like I don't know

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
like I just don't think that's the right way to win somebody's

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
opinion over going fuck you you

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
fucking fuck you know like I just don't think

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
that's the right way to do it like I think just kind of like

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
Rama are you considering this

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
or something like that might be like a better

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
way to do it right exactly

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
so if

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
only more people in the gaming industry could kind of think

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
that way not I shouldn't say the industry gaming fandom

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
really could think that way right

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
not just gaming fandom

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
ain't that the truth

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000

we're running a little long tonight it's already

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
915 here on the west coast

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
our first part of the show was a little bit long

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
I'm actually trying to

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
go to the twitter right now I didn't see a whole lot of links

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
or anything come through but I think I saw some

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
like FYI

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
heads up types of things coming over

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
I see darkdetsuya sending us a tweet saying

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
apparently one of our other local indie

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
podcast Fistful of Potions

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
was taping at a local comic shop during

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
free comic book day that's pretty cool

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
cool yeah I wouldn't have thought to do that

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
but I know a lot of people getting out during

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
free com- excuse me

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
free comic book day so that's pretty awesome that they

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
participated I on the

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
other hand missed free comic book day

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
and I missed what was the other

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
free day they did not let it all go I'm missing

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
all the free days it's sad

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
but anyway we have another call coming in hi you're on

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Hey Zaku long time no chat how you

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
doing?

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Yeah me too except without

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
Gran Turismo oh you got a little

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
rig look at that he can explain those cars

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
he explained all the car names

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
that Shane butchered earlier

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
are you saying your goodbyes to Gran Turismo 5

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
or are you on 6 now?

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
So I mean they're calling online multiplayer

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
so I kind of well I'm kind of

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
regretting the fact that I never partaken in it

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
so this kind of makes up for it

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
I kind of you know

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
after a while I had to

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
you know give in and buy 6

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
but at least I have a steering wheel for it though

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
so that's probably the only

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
good the only good thing about it

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
yes nice shiny

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Logitech G27

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
yeah

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
let me see

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
yeah that whole

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
I guess that whole stick

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
with the you know

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
with call of duty

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
essentially like jumping the shark again

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
you know releasing the

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
trailer for the new version

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
and I'm just like wondering

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
whether or not like

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Activision is repeating history in terms

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
of saturating the market with one particular

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
genre of video game to the point

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
where it's critical mass

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
and it basically

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
it just crashes

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
well it's only one a year right?

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
I mean this has been happening in sports games

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
since video games existed

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
so maybe not

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
sports games it's kind of expected

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
you know

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
you know players expect

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
an updated roster to reflect

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
the you know the current

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
state of the

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Zaku you were a big time Bamani fan

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
you used to put out new DDR's every year

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
and I think it was very disappointing when they stopped

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
true but I got over it

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
and that's why I have 2DX to

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
fall back on

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
but even then you do have a point

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
in that you know they also release

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
arcade mixes every year

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
for certain of theirs

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
but I guess the point that I'm trying to make is that

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
everything that Activision

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
has pretty much you know

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
taken to the extreme ran with

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
has pretty much at some point

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
fizzled out for them

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
and so I'm just wondering whether or not

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Call of Duty is the next one because

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
at this point Activision isn't really

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
doing anything other than

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Call of Duty and Skylanders

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
wait a minute though

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
because Activision has Blizzard

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
which has a whole other thing going on there

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Activision is partnered with Bungie

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Activision is going to have Destiny

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
that has the potential to be huge

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
they also have Skylanders

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
yeah well he said Skylanders

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
aside from that it's just licenses

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
like you would expect

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
someone to be diversified

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
let's say like EA for example

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
which learned the hard way to not

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
really rest on

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
you know on a short thing

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
wait are you counting out Cabela's?

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
but that's like

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
that's a cash grab

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
that's what

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
I just mentioned

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
you know what EA did

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
what EA did to diversify their

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
portfolios they bought a bunch of other

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
companies with the cash on hand

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
they have the partnership with BioWare

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
they freaking own PopCap

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
and have just kind of ruined it

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
as we all knew they would and so on

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
who's more likely to take a chance

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
on something new?

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
them or Activision?

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
neither, what's going to end up happening

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
is that indies are going to be the ones

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
that take a chance on something new

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
the thing is the trend in the gaming industry

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
right now especially the big AAA publishers

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
you publish less titles

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
but better titles and that's what they're doing

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
they're sticking with titles that they're going to

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
have no problems with

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
although Activision occasionally will take like

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
a license like

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Walking Dead or The Fast and the Fierce

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
and take a big pile of shit on top of it

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
I don't know how you fucking ruin

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
a Walking Dead game

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
the game of the year version

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Zaku, Loki makes a great point about

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
the indies are going to be the ones that really innovate

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
EA and Activision are probably kicking

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
themselves that they didn't think of Minecraft

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
they probably tried to write

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
I bet you both those companies

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
have offered to write Notch a blank

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
check to get Minecraft

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
and you know as much as Notch's stubbornness

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
kind of drives us all bonkers in the industry

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
sometimes when it comes to things like Oculus Rift

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
you have to hand it to him that he has

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
not sold that out

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
true, that is true, he basically

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
I mean with the whole Facebook

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
deal he pretty much flat out

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
explained why he didn't want

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
why he didn't want to back that

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
horse anymore because it was pretty much

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
funded by a mega

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
corporation that started out small

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
but then it became

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
a lot larger than it

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
it just became something huge

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
and something critical in everyday lives

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
and that's not what he wants to happen to Mojang

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
exactly, they don't want to

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
jump the shark essentially in their own

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
corporate culture, they believe in terms

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
of not being

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
the man instead of

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
as opposed to just them going against

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
the man which is what they're doing and

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
so far I mean you know

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
Mojang's doing pretty damn well

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
especially for something that was essentially

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
a beta for most of its existence

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
I mean that was like one of the

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
best selling betas you know

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
long before DayZ

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
on Steam and that's not even out

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
yet and people are still paying

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
$30 just to try the game

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
that still might have

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
still rough around the edges

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
alright well

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
Zaku I've got to wrap things up because we're going to be

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
wrapping up the show but any other thoughts real quick

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
I guess

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
the only one I had that I was

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
trying to get to last week was the whole

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Nintendo basically

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
doing everything

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
in their power to shoo away independent

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
developers meanwhile Sony

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
and Microsoft I would imagine

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
have like developer outreach divisions

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
just for independent developers

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Sony sure does at this point

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
did you see this week on their blog

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
Sony was like on just some

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
random ass Wednesday or Thursday it was just

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
like hey guess what BAM

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
announcement BAM announcement

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
BAM Spelunky PlayStation 4

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
BAM I mean like it was like all these indie

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
announcements came out in advance of E3 this week

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
on Sony I mean not to mention

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
I even bought Guacamelee

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
like an hour ago

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
on PSN I was just

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
like trying to grab whatever you know

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
some of the flash sales some of the things selling this

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
weekend so I mean it

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
gives credence to the fact that

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
Sony and Microsoft

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
they you know they try to diversify

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
and not just AAA

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
games but just something that would give

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
you a reason to buy their platform even

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
if it's a small one. I would say

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Nintendo's got a

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
has got an image problem in

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
the development community right now

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
both large and small both third party

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
and independent and people can argue with me

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
all they want on that I think we would be fighting

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
over the severity of that honestly but

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
I think no matter where you look at it Nintendo's got an image

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
problem they've got to fix.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
And it goes it further

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
reinforces the point why developers

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
are running away from the Wii U it's like

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
it's like a redhead stepchild that

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
they don't want to talk about because it's

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
dated it's just

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
like a I use this expression

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
from the Simpsons of an episode

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
where you know they try to reinvent Malibu

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
Stacy but all they end up doing is just

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
repackaging her with a new hat

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
trying to get the Wii U

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
it's basically the Wii with just an

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
HDMI port

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
we'll see what happens come E3

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
and what Nintendo can do to fix that image problem

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
but Zaku I'm going to let you go so we wrap up the show

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
take care buddy. Have a good one. Alright you too.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Alright that is going to do it for the skype line

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
tonight because we're damn near 9.30

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
so I've got to wrap up the show I'm very sorry to those

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
that didn't get through if you wanted to get on

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
tonight's show and you weren't able to get through please consider

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
sending us an email participate at orangelandtrady.com

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
or you can send us a tweet

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
on twitter.com slash o-l-r

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
I'm going to check in with Loki real quick to see if he has

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
any last minute stories

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
yeah real quick there's a couple things

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
one there's this game

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
I actually saw on Kickstarter it's

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
sort of looks like Jet Set Radio

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
it's called

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
Hover Revolt of Gamers

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
and there's gameplay

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
they kind of describe it like

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Mirror's Edge and Jet Set Radio

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
well to make it even

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
more like Jet Set Radio or

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
Grind Radio

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
they have a stretch goal of 60,000

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
which is going to add the

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
composer Hideki

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Naganuma

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
which I hope I didn't mispronounce

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
that but he was the original producer

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
or the original composer for

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
that's right Jet Set Radio

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
oh interesting

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
so

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
that would be pretty cool

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
and then this is kind of

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
neat looking

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
this thing called Project Evo

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
and it's apparently an

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
iOS game made by this company

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
Akili Interactive Labs

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
and apparently playing this game

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
will be able to kind of

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
evaluate you to see if you might be

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
susceptible

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
for

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
what is it? Alzheimer's

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
so that's

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
kind of interesting and they're also saying that they're

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
attempting to use

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
the same research I guess to

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
diagnose ADHD, autism

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
and depression

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
kind of neat game that can

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
basically

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
evaluate your state of being

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
and

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
last but not least

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
this game actually I saw a while ago

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
Hat in Time

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
it was also another Kickstarter project and

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
what's kind of cool about it is it looks very much like

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
Wind Waker and

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
apparently now they're having the

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
alpha version of the game available if you

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
backed it or if you have it on pre-order

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
and it looks very very very pretty

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
so check that out if you like the

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
Wind Waker platformer type games

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
and your games look very very pretty

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
alright

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
well that is going to wrap up another episode of

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
Orange Lounge Radio but I do have one other

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
last minute story, this involves next week's

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
show, this is pretty cool, Loki I don't even

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
think I've had a chance to tell you about this yet

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
but next week on the show we're going to have a special guest

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
we are going to have a live interview

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
and this is pretty cool, we're going to have

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
a live interview here on the show with

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
Christopher Tin who is the

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
composer of

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
Baba Yetu the song that won a Grammy

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
the first song that ever won a Grammy

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
from a video game

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
so Christopher Tin is going to be on next week's show

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
he'll be here live to take your questions

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
so

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
make sure you're here next week

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
live Sunday night May 11th 6 o'clock Pacific

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice Geeks Network

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
live.vognetwork.com

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
Christopher Tin is promoting a new album

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
and we'll talk of course about his experiences

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
winning the Grammy and composing

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
for SIV and I definitely want to get into some of the

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
questions about how video games kind of continue

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
to influence him if they do and all

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
that so he will be here live and your questions

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
as well in the chat room live.vognetwork.com

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
alright that is going to do

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
it for tonight's episode, we're going to go around and get everybody's

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
final thought here first

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Shane, thanks for filling in tonight

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
appreciate it, I'm sure

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
in the coming weeks we'll see more of you

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
especially now that you're back here in Northern California

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
but do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight?

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
no

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
unless you guys can give me some stuff in

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
Pokemon

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
what Pokemon do you need, what ones are left?

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
I don't know, I have their Dex numbers written down somewhere

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
I am like 7 away from being done

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
wow, you made progress tonight

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
you're 17 at the start of the show

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
go you, I know, I'm awesome

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
alright, my final thought tonight

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
is they

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
need to fix that freeway faster

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
because I'm not looking forward to getting Alan from work

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
with all that stupid freeway mess

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
stupid highway 50

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
what freeway mess?

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
highway fix 50, that whole thing

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
haven't you heard about that?

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
I saw, I keep seeing the things for it

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
with your commute and everything, you never really go through downtown

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
I have to do this

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
I fucking hate downtown

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
I know, I know, I like downtown

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
but I don't like driving there

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
I like the shops and stuff downtown but I fucking hate driving

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
I hate driving to any major city

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
well, Sacramento is a pre-major city

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
but it's not like San Francisco

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
but I hate metropolitan areas

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
I hate driving and that kind of stuff

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
alright, Loki, your final thought tonight

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
my final thought is hopefully I have enough

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
caffeine or consciousness

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
in me to get some more

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
coding done this weekend

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
hopefully I'm going to work a little bit more on

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
asset stuff so that the next video I do

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
will actually be interesting

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
and I have something to show

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
it was funny, the first video I recorded

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
the microphone from my webcam

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
was on, I'm like

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
why do I hear clicking?

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
oh, it's picking that up

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
and the second video, of course, I talk a little bit

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
but see, I talk really quietly

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
because I'm up at night

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
like at 11 o'clock at night

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
my wife's asleep, so I can't talk

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
loud because I didn't wake everybody up

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
be very quiet

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
alright, that does it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
if you listen to the whole show

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
thank you very much for sticking with it tonight

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
we really appreciate it, you know

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
we don't ask for money for doing this show

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
I mean, we wouldn't necessarily turn it down either

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
but no, in all seriousness, all we ask

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
tell a friend or two about the show

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
help spread the word about Orange Launch Radio

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
and help grow our family, because like Loki said earlier

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
we've been doing this show for 12 years

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
and no one knows

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
so help us break that by

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
getting more people to listen to our show

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
we appreciate it, grow our family

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
thank you guys very much for supporting independent radio

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
and that's going to do it for this week

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
I should be back, Christopher Tin will be here

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
it's going to be a big show, so don't miss it

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
next week, we'll see you then, good night

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
but you know they were all still true

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
see you next week

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
thanks for watching!
