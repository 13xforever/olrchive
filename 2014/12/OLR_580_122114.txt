With myself, Rob Roberts, and our co-hosts, say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
What? What? What? What? What?
Happy Hanukkah to you, Ms. Summers
Thank you
You're welcome
How is the Festival of Lights treating you?
Flammable
Highly flammable
It's a season of miracles, yo
Which, by the way, I gotta say, it is a miracle, all this fatty food that you've brought to the OLR studios tonight
It's amazing
I have brought truffle mint M&M's, not M&M's, Hershey's Kisses
I have brought cookies that are chocolate cookies with candy cane kisses on them
Which come to us via Becky
From Becky
Thank you Becky for listening
Thank you Becky
And then Becky has given us a pie, this is Mary Jumas or December Wien
Love it
It's apple pie, and Becky's apple pies are the best apple pies in the universe
Everyone eats some now
And then she actually baked us a pie, that's love right there, that is love
Thank you Becky
Becky is the pie master
Becky's the best
Her pie knows no equal
And then later on, you are gonna get it all Jewish up in here
McLackas
McLackas
With applesauce
I'm excited
Cause it's also Foodmas
You know what, this time of year, I celebrate everything because there's great food with every holiday
What did you get for the holidays?
Food
Fat
Exactly, exactly right
Also say hello in the studio to Techmaster Loki
Hello
Hi Loki, how are you?
Doing alright
Alright, we were reminiscing a little bit before the show
This week was Stephen Colbert's last show on Comedy Central
It was a little bit sad
It was a little bit sad
I didn't watch it because I don't cable, but I did watch the YouTube of the last 10 minutes of the show
Of course
And it's like, oh man, it's
It was well done, let me put it that way
It's disappointing to see him going off the air, but he'll move on to better things
It's only for six months because he's gonna be in a slot where he'll get exposed to even more people
Taking over for David Letterman
And a lot of people I think are concerned because he hosted the Colbert Report as a persona
And he's gonna be hosting the Late Show as himself
It's like, seriously, have you seen anything else?
Yeah, he followed him for a long time, even on the Daily Show
And my favorite TV show of all time ever was one that he co-created called Strangers with Candy
Which I don't understand how that only ran for a few seasons because it was just brilliant
It was really brilliant
Yeah, I don't know why, it got cancelled in favor of Strip Mall
Which, you know, I love me some Julie Brown, but I just don't understand why Strangers with Candy
But anyway, it was the best TV show and Stephen Colbert was on it and he was hilarious
I actually, and you might be wondering, why are you talking about Stephen Colbert on your video game show?
Well, A, because he's awesome, and does he have a video game? He really should
Technically he is involved video game wise because he did have a song that was in Rock Band, remember?
Oh, that's right, that's right
Charlene, I'm Right Behind You
Yeah, but that was from the 80s, that wasn't even something he did recently
That was a long time ago when he was first starting out, that's right, I remember that
But I truly consider the man an inspiration, so I am like really happy for him
You know, some of you that listen to the show for a while know that I'm a corporate trainer by day
And so I consider his teacher character in Strangers with Candy like an inspiration
Not that I literally do a lot of that stuff in class
Where's your permission slip, Mr. Knoblet? Shut your dirty little mouth!
That's just amazing, anyway
Ah, good times
There should be a Strangers with Candy video game
That would be an amazing idea for the video game jam that's kicking off tonight
If it wasn't something copier
Or Telltale Games
Maybe that's something Telltale Games can adapt
You know what, if he really wanted to, well, obviously he's gonna be really busy with the late show
But man, if he really wanted to bring Strangers with Candy back, I think he'd probably do it now
Bobby's in our chatroom saying that Stephen Colbert made that song recently
He just made it look like the 80s, but it was a new song
I was convinced it was before from his XF57 days or something
I was convinced it was from a long time ago
That's hilarious
Alright, and in chat they mentioned that he's way into Lord of the Rings
I heard he has a cameo in the movie
He does have a cameo in the movie
And he also did like a photoshoot where he was dressed up like all the characters
It's pretty awesome, they did some really good makeup jobs on him
Amazing, amazing
Let's get into some video game news
I know, I have, I think, officially lost interest in these things because it's just been too crazy
But if they made one out of Stephen Colbert, I might be interested again
And I'm gonna talk about the Amiibos
And, you know, we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show when they were first launching
We didn't really know what they were
And Nintendo really, I mean, for all practical purposes didn't really reveal what the hell these things were gonna do until the last minute
And I don't think people still understood it until they finally played Smash Brothers and got to use the Amiibo
Or unlock stuff in Mario Kart or so forth
But this Amiibo stuff, I mean, I don't know if it's just the perspective of me as a gamer
But this stuff really feels like it's like the Beanie Babies of this year
It is nuts
It's just, I don't know, I still don't see the point to it
I mean, yeah, it's cool, don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to have collectibles and stuff like that
If you wanna put that stuff up on a shelf and have it look nice, then that's fine
Those things look pretty cool
But I just think, like, even looking at, like, the Pop figures and stuff like that
I think those look more interesting than some of the Amiibo figures
And that was always my complaint with not only just the Amiibos
But also the Skylanders and the Disney Infinity stuff
They're stuck to that base, you can't do anything for them
I think it would be awesome, like, you know, kind of like look at Legos or something like that
Where, like, the figure would come off and you'd be able to do stuff with that
Now I understand that, you know, they would be afraid of losing the base or something like that
But somehow get that RFID chip in there where you could do that
I sort of understand why these things took off though
And I think that just speaks to the volume of the classicness and pop culture infusedness
Of the characters that Nintendo has created
Which, you know, last week we were talking about the Sony hacks and the movie
That, you know, the Mario movie
And we talked about how, you know, this movie is gonna be big
No matter what, even if it's bad, it's animated
And there's gonna be tons of people that are gonna take their own kids to see a Super Mario Brothers movie
Because they grew up with Mario Brothers, right?
I mean, you did, you know, you did your kid's room in all Mario Brothers stuff
Yeah
Which was amazing, by the way
But it just speaks to the volume that these characters are
By the way, quick follow up, because I shouldn't work this in at some point
There is a quick follow up to the whole Sony hack and the movie leak stuff
And that is a little bit of a coyness out of Miyamoto about the Mario movie leak
And he said, I heard something about that this morning
What's interesting is that over the past 20 years
People come to us on a fairly regular basis about creating Mario movies
There are times that those ideas end right when they bring them to us
And other times we'll listen to presentations
It's not very unusual and it's something we've been doing for a very long time
I don't particularly have a vision that the next iteration of Mario is going to be in film
Here's the thing
I get that answer totally
But it is absolutely a non-answer answer
And I think in Miyamoto's head
The next iteration of Mario Brothers will not be in film
I would think that Miyamoto probably never wanted that first film to happen
But I also think that
It's been enough time now to where we can kind of forget about that
And I also think ultimately it's not up to Miyamoto
Like yes, I understand, he's the granddaddy of it
But at the end of the day
If a boardroom signs off on it, it's going to happen
Look at this way, okay
There's Batman and Robin
And now there's the new Christopher Nolan movies
Which, you know, one does not soil the rest
I mean, if anything, it makes them better
So I don't think just because there was
And don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the Mario Brothers movie
I know it was kind of stupid, but you know what?
A lot of the movies that came out around the same time were kind of stupid
Judge Dredd had some really stupid moments to it
You know, just something like that
I'm okay with that
Because that was just kind of the way things were
Like Double Dragon, remember how terrible that movie was?
It's just
It was loosely based on it, but it was just kind of like
That was just how it was going
Anyway, not to digress too much
I consider that a non-answer answer out of Miyamoto
And ultimately, as rough as this is to hear
I don't think it's up to him at the end of the day
And also that answer wasn't really him saying no
He just says, I think the next thing is not going to be a movie
But I don't know, it still strikes me as a non-answer answer
But anyway, rewinding a little bit
I want to talk about the amiibos
Because, you know, the reason why these things are doing so well
Is it just speaks to the strength of the characters
Behind these amiibo
And I don't think it has really anything to do with the game functionality at all
I think grown adults want to collect those little toys
Because it's okay
It's okay, unlike Beanie Babies
For whatever, it's socially acceptable
For 30-year-old men and women to be collecting those toys
Unlike Beanie Babies, which kind of got the grandma stigma
There's grown people that collect those Skylanders and the Disney infinity stuff as well
So, you know, I'm not surprised
So, anyway
So, amiibo is going crazy this holiday season
Whether you think they're useful in the games or not
People want those figurines
And it's kind of becoming a mess
And for me personally
This whole freak-out around it
Is kind of turning me off to it in a big way
But for some people it just drives them even more
But some of the big news that came out about amiibo this week
Is that Toys R Us started cancelling amiibo pre-orders and purchases
Pretty much out of the blue
A big chunk of this was the Lucario amiibo pre-orders
Which I believe, wasn't that the figure that's going to be exclusive to Toys R Us?
I don't remember
I can't keep track of which ones are exclusive where
Because it's a big mess
So, people have called Toys R Us to figure out what's going on
They've been advised that Nintendo did a product delay
And that amiibo are being cancelled as a result
Until there is a clear indication of how much stock there's going to be to get in
Well, that sounds like Nintendo
Now there's speculation that this wave 3 might be held back until beyond February
To make sure there is enough amiibo figures to meet the demand
Which is very high
I can see that
And once again, before I was kind of under the suspicion that it was an artificial shortage
But maybe not anymore
But then again, I just
I don't know how hard these things could be to manufacture
It's a piece of plastic with an RFID chip in it
I mean
I can't imagine it being that difficult
Some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
YYR says Nintendo should capitalize on the amiibo popularity
By actually delivering some new games and long ignored franchises
Next year is going to be really interesting
To see, you know, instead of having to back end amiibo into existing ideas
Which I think they had to do for a lot of games this year
Even Smash Brothers to an extent
I think they did it well in Smash Brothers
But I still think that was something that was kind of added on late in development
But next year as we start to look to games like Splatoon and Mario Maker
It's going to be very interesting to see how the amiibo work in the games from the outset
Let's see, also some comments in our chatroom
We have
Let's see
Act F saying that I had a Lucario amiibo preordered and got cancelled
Kaijuto says I'm an adult
I buy amiibos not to collect them
I buy them to train them to fight
I actually think, Kaijuto, while I certainly respect that perspective
And I don't think you're alone in that
I kind of actually think
I think more people are buying this not to use them with Smash Brothers necessarily
If what I see on Twitter and all that is any indication
Granted, that's my perception of the world
But I just get the feeling that more people are buying these
Just because they're Nintendo figurines than anything else
I don't know, what do you think, Loki?
I think definitely that they would be buying them
I don't know, I've seen better Nintendo figurines
I have some of the better Nintendo figurines in my son's room
That's kind of my thing
These are like, what, twelve bucks for a teeny tiny figure
And I've seen better action figures that cost less than that
It kind of bugs me that they're so expensive because of that
Now by the way, Loki, this is kind of funny that you said that about the card
Because I do want to throw out here
That Miyamoto has actually addressed that
In an interview that he did with ABC
He actually said
We're not making promises for certain figures
But the way amiibo is designed
Is that certain games can have amiibo specifically for that game
Other games can take advantage of past amiibo
That developers want to make their game compatible with
In the future, we have the option
If certain amiibo figures are no longer available in stores
To release an amiibo in card form with the same functionality
So they're out there
It's going to be a matter of time
That someone's just going to hack that anyways
And then you'll just buy a card
And it'll be whatever amiibo you want
I don't know
I just
I'm not getting into it
It probably doesn't help that I don't have a Wii U
But even if I had a Wii U
I don't think I'd really want to buy these things
It just seems like a big waste of money
But you know what
There's a lot of things I'd buy that are probably a waste of money to other people
That's true
Whatever you want to spend your money on
Jamie, I'm dying to check in with you and your perspective
Let me get to a couple other comments in chat first
Kaijuto, I love this comment
I was burned as a kid when I wanted Star Wars toys
And could never find them
I had no idea grown men were buying them
To keep them in a bahox
Sg100Matt says
They're Nintendo's beanie babies
People will collect the fuck out of them if there is a demand for them
Jamie, you're no stranger to video game collecting
You've done your own in the past
But surely you've got to be looking at this going
This is big
What do you think?
Dan and I already decided it was a waste of money for us
Really?
And I don't need to have any in my cubicle now
Because my neighbor purchased them and put them up on our cubicle wall
So I now have the never ending battle
Between Red Rico and Link
Now is that because you're not a Wii U owner at this time?
That you don't really have an interest in amiibo?
I probably wouldn't have an interest in it anyway
Interesting
I could have played Skylanders if I wanted to
I could have played Disney Infinity if I wanted to
I have a Rocket Raccoon
That's all I care about
Which I have to thank Codeman for
But um
I
I don't really care
I hardly play my DS anymore
I've been playing lots of Dragon Age
If there were you know
Dragon Age amiibo
Figures that I could
Model
I wouldn't even do that probably
I don't know if they had a
Garrus figure that unlocked something
in the game you'd probably be on that
So you think this
So I think I'm hearing this
I don't want to put words in your mouth
But this is what I seem to be hearing
Is that maybe you're shifting away
And you've kind of been shifting for the past couple years
Away from consoles more to PC
Pretty much
You know I um
Actually right around the time I had my hand surgery
Yeah
Was when I started making the shift
Just because it hurt to hold a controller for too long
Makes sense
And um
I was identifying my games
Right
Which was really Mass Effect and DA too for me
Um
I don't know
Those are really more my thing right now
I don't really want to
I don't know and I'm also kind of
Anti-competition these days too
Because people are making competitions out of things
They have no business being competition
Or being competitive
And
It's back into the whole you know
I just really
I kind of look at the whole thing with a little
Edge of disgust
I don't care what you spend your money on
But you could be doing better things
Now
ActDeaf actually sent along a little
Update to this story
He sent me a private message being one of these people
That actually preordered saying
Toys R Us sent an email today to everyone
That had their Amiibo preorders cancelled
They're reinstating orders
And letting others make another reservation
For Amiibos but Toys R Us said
That they messed up the orders not Nintendo
Very interesting little
Follow up because I feel like I'm hearing
A conflict between what some of
Their own customer service people were saying
And this but again that's no
Real surprise there that you know
Something was different
Way at the top than it really was
So hmm
Anyway I'm sure this is just going to
Continue over the next few weeks
This whole Amiibo fever
But me like
I'm not willing to go camp
Out at the store for two hours
To get one of these figures like
I don't need them that bad
I like them well enough I kind of want a Mega Man
One but I'm not going to fight like crazy
For one if I can't just go online
And get it then I'm done and my understanding
Is if I haven't already preordered one I ain't
Getting one I guess at this point so
Eh we'll see like I'm just
I don't have to have one that badly
I think they're cool like I do
Really want the Mega Man one but
Is my life going to be over
If I don't get one? Nah
Will I be jealous of friends that have
Them and I don't have it? Not really
Actually I think I've
Kind of hit that point so
Anyway alright
Let's travel around and look at
Our gaming weeks and the types of games that we
Have been playing this week
Dark Sakura you haven't been playing 3DS
But what have you been playing?
I should have been bringing my 3DS with me because I'm doing
A puzzle now but um
I'm playing Dragon Age
A friend of mine
Actually started playing
Final Fantasy 14
So I'll be playing that a bit more later
Um
So uh
Yeah pretty much just Dragon Age right now
Um
I am taking my sweet time
With it I've already talked to people who have beaten the game
Several times over but
I've been playing just a little bit after work
Exploring, looking around
You know making up banter
In my head
And I've really
Been finding it a fun creative
Outlet lately so
I'm content to
Take my sweet time with it
Do you do a lot of mods with Dragon Age
Or is there not a lot available yet?
It's funny that you say that there are
There's only one mod out there right now and it's
A camera mod
I haven't put it in yet
But basically BioWare
Said well Frostbite's really
Going to be difficult for other people to mod
They're not going to be able to do the same mods with this
Like they're doing for Mass Effect 3
Or for the previous Dragon Age
And basically the entire modding community
Has said oh yeah watch
And they're working on breaking it
Um the guy who did
The uh
The tools for uh Mass Effect
Warranty voider I think is what his
Name was um at least online
Um has already started
Working on uh tools to
Uh go through the code
For uh Frostbite
So I think it's only a matter of time
We've already had people who have been able to rip
The character models and have done
Their own uh models for
The characters but um
Well the good news is that
They practice on Frostbite with Dragon
Age and that way when the new Mass Effect comes out
All these tools will be ready to go
And I honestly think that the
Oppression I've been getting from the BioWare folks
That is sort of like huh let's see if they can do it
You know
Like we don't see how without
All this so let's see how
Inventive you'll be and I
Think that it's not necessarily an
Active discouragement from doing it
But of a we actually
Just don't think it's possible type of thing
So of course challenge
Accepted
Alright uh let's put her mic down
So that's it for her gaming week. Loki your gaming week
Um really I just played uh
Lego Marvel Super Heroes
Um I'm just
You know finishing up my son wanted to play
A bunch during the week so
While he was just running around the city doing stuff
I was busy knocking out all the
Races and all of the um
Little activities
That I have to do to unlock all the characters
And get 100% in the game
Which brings me to a couple things
About this one some of the controls
Are fucking terrible
Like their flight controls I seriously
Want to punch the guy in the face
They came up with their fucking flight controls in that game
Cause it's just it's
So god damn frustrating
That it doesn't work right cause basically
You tap the jump button twice
To go into like a flight mode or whatever
And then you would tap uh
What was it circle twice or whatever to
Get out of that and land
But also X and
Circle are you know
For elevation so X makes you go up
Circle makes you go down
So you can kind of get where I'm
Coming at here first off the uh
Up and down vertical movement
And there is very sluggish so you have to
Kind of hold it down but so if you're trying
To kind of fine tune it and get it
So that you're aiming at the right speed
A couple things happens either you tap
X too fast and so
That sends you into like a kind of a
Burst speed thing so you fly super fast
And you can't get out of it really fast
Either or you just
Land on the ground because you hit
Circle twice and you just fall
Out of the sky so
I seriously was like cursing this game like
I fucking hate you stupid game I don't
Want to play this thing anymore then
They had certain races where they thought it would be
A great idea to lock the
Fucking camera in a really awkward position
While you were playing that race
I seriously want to strangle people that were in charge
Of the camera and the flight controls in that game
The rest of the game is fine
A little buggy at times but
Careful what you say on the internet Loki
You want to strangle them with love and understanding
And a better understanding of physics
I just want to smack them upside the head until they realize
The error in their ways I mean come on
This is like how many
Lego games have you made so far
I mean this isn't the first one
Of flight in it and you've had
Several Batman games
Anger leads to the dark side
And so
You can't tell me that you haven't figured out that this is
And then here's the other thing too
You have a controller with several buttons
That are not being used at all
But you decide to map
The elevation and all this shit
On the two buttons
Great that's good for kids to learn stuff
But it's fucking impossible to be able to
Just maneuver accurately through the game
So that's really my only thing
But now that I'm done with that
All the races and stuff
It's kind of a big relief
Because now I don't have to do that crap anymore
I just have to go through all the levels and get all the
Clocks and everything so
I'm very close to platinuming the game
Which will be my first platinum
As much as it drives you crazy
You're determined to platinum it
At this point I've already suffered through it enough
So I need to platinum it
Alan Alchemy in our chat room
Over at live.vognetware.com says
Little Josh gets sent home from preschool
For saying bullshit controls fucking work
What the fuck after throwing his Power Ranger
Action figures into the air
No we were
The other day my wife got
Inspired by watching
It was Jimmy Kimmel or something like that on the internet
And she was asking him what
Bad words he knew and so he only knew
Like stupid and
Something like
Something like poop I don't remember what it was
Poopy head or something like that
Those are the only two words
That he could think of
Probably for the best
I have called the game stupid though
And under my breath I'm like fucking
Yeah
That's when you
Walk out casually in the backyard
Shut the sliding glass door and go
Fuck
God dammit this game is good but like
But seriously though one of the best
Characters in the game though is squirrel girl
Because she has like
The most useless powers
She has one power where you charge it up
And for no reason like squirrels run around
Like they crawl all over her and then they kind of explode
Off of her and she throws squirrels
At people as her attack she throws squirrels
It's like bungee ferret tossing but with squirrels
You know what I don't think it made our show
World tonight but I'm very excited for
The Bravely Default sequel Bravely Second
They announced a cat girl
Character like a cat girl class
And so it's that involves cats
How can this be bad?
If she throws cats at people or whatever has cats do her bidding
I'm all for it it's like a summoner
But with cats? Heck yeah
Sounds good
I just want my party to be for cat people
Sounds good to me
So that was it I also tried to play a little bit more of
I Am Bread and the game is really frustrating
So I just pretty much stopped right away
It's like it's even worse
Than like Surgeon Simulator for me
I mean same people and it's just
Like I can't figure out what I'm supposed to be doing
To get you know off the floor
Once I hit the floor it's just like oh I'm gonna land on the skateboard
And I'm gonna ride the skateboard over the counter
And I'm gonna crawl up the wall
And that just didn't happen because there's like a
Grip meter and stuff and so the more you hold
Down on the grip you eventually
Lose grip so I
I'm just so frustrated
At that game it's funny but I just
Don't wanna play it
Well that's it for your gaming week I will talk quickly
And I haven't even bought anything on Steam
I've been very good for you so far I've been
I've been good at not getting anything on the Steam sale
Yet either but I've been voting every day
To get my card and I did
What I disenchanted some of the loot
Which was a brilliant idea on Steam's
Part by the way to get people to just destroy
Things in their inventory that they would otherwise sell
I
I disenchanted a bunch of crap
In my inventory like backgrounds I would never use
And stuff like that and I bought like a pack of cards
Or something I don't know so
Yeah anyway let's see
So my gaming week I've been playing more
Final Fantasy 13 on PC
My partner Alan bought me
A brand new monitor for the holidays
So now I have two widescreen monitors
That I'm using and this new one is bright
And it looks great and it does
Super resolution so I can play
Final Fantasy 13 in these really
Obscene graphic modes and I'm so happy
The game has come a long way
Once I got past all the bullshit bugs
Like the graphical issues from the initial release
And you know the fact that it frameskips
If you don't have a controller plugged in like what the hell
Once you get past all that it's so
Beautiful on
PC and I'm
I'm on like chapter 7
So like I'm pretty committed
To this playthrough so
I'm excited I've been having a good time with that
And continuing to play some other games
That I've been playing off and on Final Fantasy 14
Return to Diablo 3
Continuing with Seasons
Alan and I had a little squabble over
Diablo 3 about two weeks ago so I kind of put it on
Ice for a little while
But I went back to the game and I found a really
I really like in Diablo 3
That you can just respec your character at any time
If you find that the build you're
Using doesn't work for you
That's fine respec
You can't even reroll the gear
Thanks to Miriam the enchanter
You can try to like I went from
Ice mage to a fire mage
And so I rerolled all the cold bonuses
And now there are things like either fire bonuses
Or crit damage and I'm doing
Way more damage and I'm way more efficient
I'm having way more fun as a fire mage
Now as opposed to the ice mage I was
Playing and that's probably in part that I was getting
A bunch of fire mage drops
So I was like okay the game's trying to tell me something
So I switched and now I'm
Flying through torment 1 rifts
Like they're easy so I have to even
Bump up the difficulty a little bit so I'm having a lot of
Fun with Diablo 3 again
New games I have played
One new game this week I did play
One brand new game this week that came out on
PlayStation 4 I think it was one of the only
New game releases this past week
I decided to plunk down the $10
For a classic game
It's very hard to screw this game up
And do something wrong with it
Tetris I bought Tetris Ultimate which was
Released on the PlayStation 4 this week
And it is Ubisoft that made this port
And um
I'm gonna tell ya there's
Some things I liked that they're trying to do with this
You know they're trying to make Tetris more
Social you know like make it more like a
Social game which I get
That's where gaming's going so like apparently
Some of my play sessions have been
Ghosted and like Fifth Dream
In chat earlier was saying oh I was
Playing against one of your ghosts earlier and I was like
Oh shit I didn't know the game was recording
Me like I sometimes what I'll do
Is if I screw up too early I'll just
Drop all the pieces you know and I'll just fill up
The screen it's it's the rage quit of Tetris right
You just eternally drop all your pieces and start over
So I'm like oh shit if Fifth
Dream is playing one of my bots that just rage
Quits that's not a lot of fun so it's good to keep in mind
There's a lot of different modes and yada
Yada yada but here's the thing
That really gets me about Tetris
Ultimate
It's buggy like
Bad buggy like
Really bad buggy like
How the fuck did they release
This in its current state buggy
And it's mostly
One major bug
But that bug is
Frame hiccups
Now let us think about the game of Tetris
Especially when you're playing
On level 11
In endless mode
Is that okay for the game to suddenly
Hang for even just three frames
While you're trying to rotate a piece
Or drop a piece at just the right moment
Absolutely not
And it was to the point where I was like
Did any QA happen
On this game at all because that would
Have been noticed if it was played
On a real Playstation 4 maybe that's something
That didn't show up on a dev PS4
I get that but was this even play tested
On a real PS4 was it cause I'm not the only
One that's noticed no I saw was
I unfortunately went to IGN
To watch like the couple you know
Now they call it let's plays but it's not really
They had some issues with the game
I guess they had to literally unconnect
It from the internet in order to like drop
Those frame skips or whatever
And it to the point where it was like
Taking a super long time to load
Stuff and like there was even frame
Skips during like the whole Ubisoft
Logo and everything
And to the point where like they're trying to
Drop the piece and it was taking several seconds
To drop that piece and stuff
And apparently they said yeah we tried this
Even on a retail
System a debug system
On several different ones and it was still
Having the same problems
So
I don't know what's up
With Ubisoft man it's bad
When you can't even get Tetris I mean Tetris is
Not that complex of a fucking game
I think the power of the Playstation 4
And from what I hear it's only the
Playstation 4 version that's doing it
I would think that the Playstation 4 can run Tetris
Just I think it can
Now 5th Dream says I was playing
It on remote play and I had no issues
But then I don't play as fast as Rob's
Ghost I'm gonna say you know I
Was made aware of the IGN video via
Twitter and it was
After I already bought the game and I was
Playing it and I was like god damn it like
Why is this game buggy and then I saw that
Tweet come in because somebody retweeted it and I was like
Oh okay it's not just me and I
Watched the video now here's the weird thing
I didn't notice it as bad
As they do and
But that seems weird to me that there would be kind of
That variance there but I didn't notice it
As bad but I definitely noticed
It and it was definitely the point where
I'm like Ubisoft
You need to fucking fix your QA processes
You need something like something
Clearly is broken
Because how many games is that
Now that have gone out the door with very
Obvious bugs in them
Fix your
Processes please
It's embarrassing
It's Tetris
For god's sake Tetris
I could play Tetris on an Apple
What was the very first it was made for
The PS like PS2
Like old school IBM basics
Right was the original Tetris I'm talking
I'm talking the guy in Russia
I know right
So the power of the Playstation 4
Cannot handle Tetris
Give me a break
A TI calculator could play Tetris
Now
I do have faith that thanks to
I mean if I just sat here and bitched about it
Nothing would happen but IGN's
Got a lot more pull than I do I'm sure because
Of them putting out that video the game will get
A patch and it'll be fine but it's like
It's yet another one of those things
Why did we have to wait for the patch
I mean you release the game
The next to last week of December anyway
Would have delay until February
Have killed you it's not like I was sitting
Here going I can't fucking wait
For Tetris yeah like
It was more one of those things where it's like oh Tetris
Came out I like Tetris I'll get it
I would have had the same reaction in February
After you fixed your shit
Oh my god it just blows my mind
Well that was the thing it was like a lot of people
When they bought it you know they're kind of
There's a few games Ubisoft has released that haven't
Been that great that kind of little buggy
You know but it's Tetris
I mean how hard can Tetris be to program
I mean it can't be that bad
YYR in chat says don't worry Ubisoft will patch
It in in a few days not to fix the game
Breaking bugs but to put a face on the faceless
L block it's funny you say that because
In battle mode like you actually get
Blocks that have mustaches on them and other
Little things that happen
Just cute little things that
Have to do with the
Battle thing it's like
Playing Tetranet basically they basically
So there are some cool things about this game
That basically you can play Tetranet and that
Type of thing but you know again
When you have frame skip in a game
That badly needs it like Tetris it's like it
Ruins the whole fucking thing it doesn't matter
If they're doing all these other cool things to the game
The game is ruined it's tainted
Jason says that Tetris on the Playstation 4
Doesn't look or act like Tetris on
TI NES or whatever
To which I say I didn't ask for them to make me
A fancier looking Tetris it's fucking
Tetris I don't need it to have like
Fucking you know
Clouds in the background
Or shiny blocks or whatever it's
Fucking Tetris it doesn't matter
And here I do
Have one other this is a minor
More minor complaint about the game but it is
An issue I have with
Tetris lately and I think
The last round of Tetris games did this too
And I don't understand this and that is
What is the obsession with
T-Spins what is the obsession
With counting T-Spins
And having achievements for T-Spins
And getting T-Spins
As a statistic I don't understand
Like
What I even had to look up like what
A T-Spin is and it's
By the way it's when you take the T-Block
And you rotate it in to fill a gap
Like it's not you're not
Dropping it to fill a gap you rotate
It over to fill a gap that like
Might be on the side or something that's what a T-Spin
Is and it's like oh I
Thought I was already doing that but yet my statistic
For T-Spin I guess sit at zero but it's
Like I don't know I don't
I don't get why that has to be
Tracked the only T-Spin I'm aware of
Is you know with Baloo and where
They're flying a plane and
I guess that was Tailspin though
So anyway
YYR in chat says yeah I think those are dumb
Too and Alan Alchemy says the T-Block
Is the most versatile block yet
It's the line blocks that I always tend to
Put in my hold queue anyway
The Nintendo DS version
Of Tetris remains the definitive version for
Me or the Game Boy if you want to go all the way back
To the Game Boy version that one too I think the
DS one is the best one out there and it still hasn't been
Trumped on all these newer consoles
Came out on 3DS as well
On 3DS but not this isn't the Nintendo version
With like the Mario
No this version that just came out from Ubisoft
No Nintendo did one on the DS
Which certainly you could play on a 3DS
But Nintendo did one on the DS that in my mind
Is still the definitive version
But maybe that has to do with the love
Of Nintendo characters thing we talked about earlier
Cause all that retro nostalgia is all
Over that game but I even think without
That it's still the definitive version I mean because
It's the Game Boy version but modernized
And in many ways I think
If you said Rob the Game Boy version
Is the definitive version I would be like
You know I respect that angle
That's a hard one to argue with
The Game Boy and the DS ones are really neck and neck
So anyway
Alan Alchemy
In chat says everyone loves it when a T block
Shows up unlike the square one
That's like hello I'm here sorry I'm so fat
Frown no the ones
It's the Z blocks to get me
The Z and the S block because
I can never visualize
Ok what's the jagged pattern
Is this the one that fits the jacket on the right
This is the ones that you use to slide in
Yeah and I've used it that way too
But do we count Z spins or S spins
No we count T spins
Anyway, Jamie just rolled her eyes
That makes for great radio
Alright
SSJ100Matt says I came back in the middle
Of this discussion and my initial thought of
T spin stats were stats of how many times
You spun the teacups at Disneyland
Oh I'd win that fucking game
Purple ones for life
It is not the teacups unless somebody barfs
Alright that's what I'm saying
That's why you go in the purple ones they go faster
At night
They go faster at night for sure
Everything goes faster at night
Alright we're going to get into some news here
In a minute here also more information
On the VOG game jam coming up
In part B we're going to kick
This off tonight and
Us and Bobby Blackwolf and hopefully some of the
Other shows at VOG too teaming together
To encourage everybody out there to
Create something dammit
You know last week we had the guys from Cooking with
Unity on the show which I know Loki found
Very very motivating and I thought those guys
Were excellent motivators you know they've worked
In the industry and my favorite
Thing out of that whole interview was when Max said
You know I just
Want you to make a game I want you to make a game
And I thought yes I want you
To make a game too what can I do to help
Alright we've got a network let's do this
Let's do this VOG game jam
So together the
OLR live audience tonight we're going to pick a theme
Through our tried and true list list
Mechanism so we're going to get to that in part
B and that will be the theme for the game jam
But you know what if you're not comfortable programming
In Unity and you don't want to learn just yet that's okay
Use RPG maker
Use Twine
Use Commodore 64
Basic make a level in
Little Big Planet if you want or create
A level in another game but just
Create something dammit that's all
We want we want people to create
And get creative
So all we're going to throw you tonight is a spark
And we want you to run with it
And create a fire and who knows
Who knows sometimes
Big big games come out of game jams
So wasn't super hexagon born
Out of a game jam I could be wrong I don't remember there's
A lot of stuff there's a lot of stuff that suddenly
You know goes from game jam to like
You know steam release and I'm not necessarily saying
That that's going to happen
But it might so
Stay tuned
So more info on that in part B
For now quick housekeeping
We will actually still be
Here throughout the holidays
The holidays fall on pretty convenient days for us
Not so much for Hoard House but for us
So we will still be here next Sunday live
And the Sunday after the holidays will not be
Interfering with OLR scheduled this year
However
I am foreseeing off in the future we will not
Be here January 18th
That's way off in the future so I'll be giving you
Reminders we're still determining if we're going
To pre-record that week or what we're going to do
We can't do an early show I'm going to be
Out of town I guess I'm
Okay to say this on the show I'm
Going to Seattle Alan and I are going to go to Seattle
Visit some friends of his that he's known
Online forever and never met so
I'm going to go to Seattle over Martin Luther King weekend
So I'm excited about that I haven't been
Up to Seattle in about five years but I love it up there
And I can't wait to do all that touristy shit
Again Space Needle, EMP
Aquarium
First Starbucks, Pikes Market I'm going to do all that shit
So maybe
If we rent a car maybe I can talk
Alan into let's just
Drive by Nintendo headquarters and see if I can see
Reggie I just drive by I got to
After all these years I got to just drive by and wave
Or something see if I can sneak
Into the cafeteria who knows
Alright
So anyway more info on that to come
When we get a little closer into January
Tigerclaw asks
In chat will next week's OLR be a
Best of show I am thinking
We will do something to cap off the end
Of the year us being
OLR and haven't been around for so long
We seem to do something different for the last
Show of the year every year I don't think we found our thing
Yet but certainly we will be looking back
On 2014 and talking about
Our favorite games of the year even
Though you know what guys we don't
Possibly have time to play everything
We can't sit here and say this is the definitive
Best game of 2014 but we can't
Tell you our favorite games so we will at least
Go over that next week and I am still going back
And forth in my head there is two that I keep
Flip flopping so we will see
Anyhow
Let's get into some news after all that
Let's get into what is going on
In the game industry this week not as busy
Of a week but there is still some stuff going on
That is worth talking about right Loki? That's right
So of course you know some of the big news
This week had to do with Minecraft
And the announcement
Of Minecraft story mode a tell
Tell game series
And apparently it's going to be
A separate game
Not necessarily an add on to Minecraft
But it's a separate game
That will be released on PC
Mac mobile devices and
Xbox and Playstation consoles they say
The game they haven't really said
Too much about it yet other than you know
They are not creating an official story
For the main character Steve
But apparently it's going to have
Some sort of story that revolves around you know
User created stuff
So I don't know
You know to be honest
They kind of already have this
It's actually a mode you can set up
Your different worlds in I think it's
I forget the actual name of it's called
Like fantasy or something like that
But basically allows you you know someone to create
A world in creative mode
And then basically to limit the amount
Of building
And breaking that you can do in it
And it has a lot of you know kind of narrative stuff
Based off of that
You can like you know set up events and things
But
Cool I guess I mean that'll be
Neat to check out
When it comes out
There's a lot of hate for this idea
Out there a lot of people are really pissed off about it
Don't buy it then
I kind of don't I don't get that though
Like I understand that okay well
A Telltale Minecraft game is not going to be
Really Minecraft in the traditional sense
But at the same time it's like
Telltale has kind of done really
Good things with a lot of the properties they
Have a story for
Minecraft is really not something that's been
Explored at all I don't I don't
Understand where the negativity is coming from other than
It's something different I don't like
It I don't know
I think problem I don't see the problem
I just think they're immediately thinking that
Oh another Minecraft game
After Microsoft bought a mode they must be selling
Out or something but
Now maybe maybe it's Minecraft
For saturation like that I could
Maybe see that because you know
Minecraft really is everywhere
But it's not just this video game
I mean you know
Go into target or anything like they've got
All this Minecraft licensed shit everywhere
Like another game is really
Really the
Least of it but you know
I gotta say as much as
I'm not always really into like poking into
People's personal business and all this gaming news
You know it's out there that Notch
Bought that mansion in Beverly Hills
You see that? It was
Him and he outbid
Beyonce and Jay-Z
Like really
Really just think about that for a minute
The monarchy
Of Beyonce and Jay-Z
Got outbid by some nerd
For this mansion
I think that's absolutely hilarious
It's kind of awesome
Probably did it for spite
You've gotta admit you gotta see Beyonce
Sitting there going, who is this nerd?
Just bought our house
You know what though
Props to him
I saw that picture of him with his
Legs up with the whole like candy
Bar or whatever in the background and I was
Just like
The only thing that picture is missing
Is a gigantic bong I think
But anyway not that I endorse that
But I'm just saying it seems to be the one
Thing that's missing
With his kind of money
He could just
It's like the fucking Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
Of bongs
He can turn the pool into a giant one
Anyway sorry Loki I don't mean to digress
He could build a fucking chocolate factory
Like out of Willy Wonka
That's what I'd do with all that money
Wouldn't you? No
I just want an Oompa Loompa
I want it now
I want a golden goose
Daddy I want the goose
That lays the golden eggs
And actually it was the squirrels
But anyway Loki
So then on top of that you know
The Minecraft film has had a little bit of a setback
Apparently the director Sean Levy
Has left the project
Basically saying you know Warner Brothers
Asked me to develop
How this might be a story
For a movie because it's a non-narrative
Game and we came up with an
Approach that felt good but when they discussed
It with Mojang they were like
That doesn't sound like what we want
So
So yes unfortunately he couldn't really
Go from there
I don't know I'm not
Too terribly disappointed by that
Maybe
We'll see something with this Telltale game
That's the direction he wants to go with it
Or something you know maybe the story that we see
Laid out here because honestly
There isn't much
Of a story there
Alan does point out in our chat room over at
Fognetwork.com Alan Alchemy says
The original Minecraft doesn't really have a story
But there is a long ass objective to find
Farm Endermen, farm ore
Go into the netherworld or hell
Go to the Enderplane, kill the Ender Dragon
Which most people don't even do they just fuck around and explore
Caves and make badass asses with roller coasters
But if they wanted to explore that story
About the Ender Dragon I'd be interested
In it
I just think they need more to it it's kind of short
I mean it's kind of like oh we just put this there
Because people wanted an end to the game
I also
I would have a concern for
The clock and I said this
Back when Microsoft bought Minecraft
I sort of feel like the clock on
Minecraft is ticking and I think the ultimate
Climax to this whole thing is going to be when
Microsoft inevitably releases
Minecraft 2 because you know they're going to
You know they're going to they release Minecraft 2
And I kind of think that will be the beginning of the end
I just you know
I realize a lot of people might brand me a hater
For thinking that or that I don't get it because there's more
To it with all the licensing and all that
But I just kind of think the bubble is going to burst eventually
And then there's going to be because there will be another big
New thing that everybody gets into
That people can create and explore their own stuff
You know what I mean?
I'd be down for a Minecraft that ran better
I mean it's just all Java
Right now so I'd be fine you know running
A little bit better but
Whatever it's all good
And then of course you know with that the
Microsoft versions of the game
Are actually getting another update
They have was it it's
The 1.64 update
Now they're saying it's going to
Add horses because horses
Have been in the PC version for a while
But you can actually get horses
You can even you know
Make a donkey you can put horse
Armor on them
All sorts of fun stuff
Tame them and they're saying
That along with it they're going to add
New enemies
Bats, witches, wither skeletons
And new fireworks
So it's kind of it's getting close to where
The Xbox version is actually meeting with
Almost what the PC version is right now
So
I have to go back to the Xbox version
At some point or
I may have to actually get one for the
PlayStation 4 in that version
Alright
The PlayStation 4 version is pretty good actually
We'll get down with that. Alright moving
On let's talk about you know and honestly
I have a hard
Time quantifying this next story
As news because I really don't think this is
News but sometimes we have
To bring to the discussion
What other people are talking about
Out there in the gaming world and that's where this
Next story falls into
Miyamoto obviously he did a big interview this week
With ABC and there was a lot that came out of this
And one other thing that he said in this interview
Quote we're focused on providing
A robust lineup of Wii U software
For next year it seems like we've managed
To do that this year and people are very happy with
What we've done on Wii U which for the most part is pretty true
For the time being our focus
Is on the Wii U hardware but Nintendo
As a whole has groups working on ideas
For new hardware systems
While we're busy working on software for the Wii U
We have production lines that are working on ideas
For what the next system might be
And so what's the headline on every fucking
Game blog right now and every fucking tweet out there
Nintendo working on
Wii U successor
Because the little
What they don't say in that
Is that everybody wants
Nintendo to move on from the Wii U
So let's hear about their follow up already
Click me, click me, click me, visit my site
I sort of think that's that
Unsaid piece there
Is that people, there's a lot of people
That want to see Nintendo move on from the Wii U
Because they already wrote it off
I gotta say though Wii U has had a killer year
And I don't see
How you can have a top 5
Games of the year and not have at least
One Wii U title on it
Maybe if you're talking about your own personal list
And you don't own a Wii U
I guess that's the way you do it
But I can't see how you do if you are considering
Every single game that came out this year
I don't see how you have a top 5
And you don't have at least one Wii U game on it
Like they've had a pretty good year in that regard
So I still give them some credit
Wii U's got a lot of life left in it
So if they don't bring out their next successor
Right away then no big deal
But here's the thing
So that by itself
Not really a big deal
You know Sony's working on Playstation 5
It's years and years away but they're thinking about it
Xbox working on Xbox 2
Or whatever they're going to do next right
260 I don't know
Whatever the hell Microsoft decides to do next
They're working on it
They're brainstorming that name right now
Brainstorm really hard
Here's the thing
Here's what else Miyamoto said
It did nothing but add fuel to the fire
Since we first created Mario
We have compared him to Mickey Mouse
I've always said Mickey Mouse evolved
With each evolution in animation
You saw Mickey Mouse each step of the way
From early on I wanted Mario to be that character
In the digital world
So that with each digital evolution
He was there to usher in the next era
I think that maybe when we release the next hardware system
You can look forward to seeing Mario
Take on a new role or in a new game
And a lot of people are taking that to say
No more Mario until the next Nintendo system
But that's not really what I'm hearing in that quote
I don't know about you guys
But I'm just hearing in that
Mario is kind of the guy with the scissors
That cuts the ribbon
That says you know
It's now open for business
Not necessarily that every Nintendo console
Has launched right out the gate with a Nintendo title
But pretty close right
Super Nintendo had one
Nintendo had one at least here in America
Nintendo 64 had one
Gamecube had Luigi's Mansion
But Super Mario Sunshine
Wasn't that far from the get go
Wii U had new Super Mario
The Wii
Is the only one I can think of
That didn't have a Mario title right out the gate
But then you had some really strong Mario titles
Between the new Super Mario Brothers
And Mario Galaxy of course
A lot of people really loved
New Paper Mario
I like New Paper Mario
But that's the other thing too
Is that Mario is so much more
All these other things now
And so I think there's some people that assume
That this means there will be no Mario game on the Wii U
But I just
I can't imagine
I cannot imagine
That Nintendo is not thinking about another game
In the Mario Galaxy series
They have to be
Those games were so good
And they were so different
And they were always critically lauded
I assume they sold well
Didn't they sell pretty good?
First one did I'm pretty sure
Because they did make the sequel
They've got to be thinking of a Mario Galaxy for Wii U
I mean
Or even a pretty easy
Sequel to Mario 3D World
You would think would be up on the agenda
I would think that would be a very
In some ways Captain Toad might kind of be that
But I digress
So I would think there's going to be Mario Galaxy games
I don't think this necessarily means that no more Mario
Can you imagine an open world Mario game
Done in the same style as that new Zelda game
Right?
I don't know
To register participation for this week's episode
Of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
Use the pass phrase
Chair
Let's see going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
Kaijudo says
Wii U is the shit
Anyone that hates on it has never really played it or owns it
The Wii U is an amazing system
Only haters are the people that want HD shooters
And Mountain Dew perks
Fuck those guys
There was no Star Fox game on the Wii
But we are getting one for the Wii U
So yeah Nintendo does skip some of their ideas sometimes
You know what else was sorely missing
From the Wii
F-Zero
Act Def says
Super Mario 3D World is still an amazing game
And I wouldn't mind a Super Mario 3D World 2
Neither would I
I really kind of hope they do
And I'm okay with that if they just try to squeeze another game out of that
I'm sure it'll be great
Nintendo does a really good job
Of producing quality sequels
YYR says
Nintendo has always been stupid about sequels though
Never more than one Smash game
Per platform per example
Wasn't it because those games take years and years and years
For them to make
And that team was busy doing the Kid Icarus game
On 3DS for a while
So that's why there was a
Big lull between Smash Brothers games
If I'm not mistaken
Which I'm surprised they still haven't ported that over
To like the Wii U
Maybe they just didn't do that well
They probably don't think it's worth the effort
I don't know, I don't know why
Because there is a lot of Kid Icarus love in Smash Brothers
I mean they made Palutena a character
Which was a little bit unexpected
But I think
The studio that's making Smash
Obviously is a little partial to their own games
There's also the fact that they have
Kirby, Meta Knight
And Dedede
That's kind of a lot of Kirby in the game
Which I'm sure Act Def is probably sitting there going
I don't see a problem
Neither do I but I'm just saying
In the big scope of things I'm surprised they have a lot
From these three franchises
I'm surprised they haven't brought in more Donkey Kong
Country stuff like King Krule or something like that
I'm really surprised
From the Kid Icarus franchise
That the eggplant wizard didn't show up as a character
I would have thought the eggplant wizard would have been an awesome character
And that's kind of one that's been missing for a while
But maybe there's only so much you can do with that
DLC
Yeah you never know, careful what you wish for right Rob?
Alright moving on
Let's get into something a little different with Dark Sakura
Well we do have
A group
Are you familiar with the Electronic Frontier Foundation?
Of course
Yes they are
A very very worthwhile group
But they actually were celebrating
National Crossword Day
Can I just say real quick
Cause this is relevant and important
EFF I definitely recognize them
They were one of the people fighting the podcast
The EFF played a big part of
Fighting that fight
So that I can podcast
And you can podcast
Without somebody trying to say
That they're owed money because
They invented feed technology
I mean I don't get with it
So anyway the EFF was a huge part of that
Well anyway
They have
The official crossword day has happened
And so they put out a digital crossword
That you can download
It's very cool
It's actually a PDF
And I'm gonna link it into our chat room
Or there's also
An interactive version on
GitHub
But it's called 2014
The year in copyright news
So it's all copyright related stuff
So related back to
2014 so
Thought I would share that with our listeners
It's a very old school game talking about
Some new school ideas
If you think about it
Crossword that's one of the oldest
Video games we have
You know before there were
Video games I used to love and they still make
These books and once in a while
About once a year I will still buy
One of these books to play
On the airplane like while I'm flying
Across country or something and that is the
Variety puzzles
And games have you seen these books?
They have all the logic
Problems and crosswords and all this
I'm sure somebody in chat has to know what I'm
Talking about that's like
Gaming without a console
For me that kind of leads into
They still do your crossword in the paper every Sunday
So yeah well every time I try
To do the crossword on a flight or something
Somebody else has already done it
Jerks in ink
In ink
I don't want to bring my own I wanted a complimentary one
Jeez Rob
Cheapo
Well thank you EFF for
Providing a different crossword with a message
With a message
Loki
Alright so there's
Apparently a new project
That Microsoft is working on called
Arcadia and it's thought to be
A game streaming
Technology
Or service by the sounds
Of it and this is
I guess coming from
Some job openings that they have
One for a cloud based operating
Systems group and one for listing
A project called Arcadia
And they're saying that I guess
It's similar to
I guess it's built off of the Azure cloud
And something that's supposed to replace
Microsoft's Rio game streaming tech
To me it sounds a lot like
Technology that you would see with like
The
Playstation streaming to
You know like the SharePlay
But like streaming to like the Vita
That type of stuff and that's what they're saying
Like the listing they said
The new operating systems group
OSG streaming team is leveraging
The cloud to bring premium unique experiences
To Microsoft's core platforms
These experiences will take advantage
Of the new geo distributed massive
Scaling service to redefine
What is possible by today's services
Or today's devices
The client team is building the user
Interface applications
Our user facing applications
Bridging the service and
Our team is small but growing
Dedicated to solving Microsoft's one
Biggest challenge in the creative fashion
So they're saying that also
Possibly
Going to be streaming to not only like
Microsoft devices but iOS and Android
That type of stuff so
Makes sense I think it would be kind of cool
If they did something like that
You know it seems to work
It's working out pretty well with
You know Playstation right now and I know that
It hasn't quite gotten to the point where
They can do it on well actually I take that
It has kind of gotten to the point where they
Can do that on Android devices because I remember
I saw that hack last week that they
Somehow got that working now where you can
Play your Playstation 4 games on your
Android tablets and stuff
So
Cool hey if I can find a way to
Game on the go you know and it works
Well over Wi-Fi I'm all down for that
Ever since Sony announced
Like Playstation now and SharePlay
I've been curious how Microsoft's going
Honestly I would like
And this is cool you know that you can do it
On a mobile device but I would like to be able to do that
On my laptop I would think that
There would be a way they're going to stream it to PCs
Because you know
Microsoft does have that Windows tie-in
Can you imagine if you could stream your Xbox One console to a PC
That would be really neat
That would be fun
Because I would just take my laptop with me
And Sony I'd love to do the same thing
All my systems I'll just have them plugged in
And I'll just play them on my laptop
If I'm down with that
Doesn't mean you'll be able to use a keyboard and mouse with everything
I don't want to but you know
I'm fine with using just the controllers
But that would be really neat
If you have the Xbox One in the living room
And you could just stream stuff to your PC desktop
And you could play the game
Using an Xbox One controller plugged into your PC or something
That would be pretty cool
Anyhow maybe one game that you are
Streaming and still playing is
Destiny I see a lot of people actually
Streaming this on Twitch
Well you should get on that
Get on it because a lot of people
I knew that were playing it kind of stopped
And if you want me to play I'll still sign in and play with you
It's one of those things like
Especially once you get into the game jam stuff
It's like I haven't really been
You get to it eventually
The only reason I've been playing games at all
Is because I'm playing while my son is still awake
It's not when I have free time or anything
I can work on my own stuff
So I haven't really been playing when he's going to sleep
But we'll see
Anyhow Destiny had a little
Minor patch this week
And the patch has to do with the expansion
The Dark Below
Which I'm not going to buy until they slash the price
Which I know it's inevitable they'll slash the price
Of this because I kind of don't think
Everybody bought it
I mean I don't know maybe some sales numbers will come out and prove me wrong
But I know a lot of people that have either sold the game back
Or like I'm not buying this
Because there's not enough there
So very curious to see how that's going to affect things
But anyway a patch did come out
We tweaked some of the gear drop rates
With Crota's End
Which is the Dark Below's raid
And more players will get equipment with their efforts
So now raid gear in Crota's End
Starts at level 30
And this will help you on an upgrade path to level 32
There's also a specific helmet item
And it will also spawn on normal mode now
And hard mode players have an additional chance
Of getting it as a drop
There's also some issues regarding reputation gains
Hive shield functionality
Pocket infinity charging
So I'm going to be playing a lot of Destiny 2
In a Destiny update that went live this week
So you know
Despite the fact that I might feel a little more meh
On Destiny now than when it first launched
At least props to Bungie for staying on top of it
And doing regular updates with the game
But I still am not a big fan of the fact
That the raid content
Kind of
Or the new expansion content
Kind of gates some old things
Like you know the raid of the week
Is only in the expansion
So if you don't pay the $10 you can't do the same stuff
That you were necessarily doing before
A little silly to me
And I hope they consider
Some fixes with that
If they haven't already to be honest
I haven't put the game in and played in a while
Maybe I will this week or if Loki ever tells me
Hey get on and play Destiny help me
Dark Sakura
Well we keep hearing about 38 Studios
The group in
Rhode Island that didn't quite make it
And pissed off the entire state
I thought I really thought all that news
Was done with I thought we were past that now
I guess not huh?
Well it turned out that
38 Studios board
Member fined for
Well it was getting fined for unregistered
Lobbying in Rhode Island
That
Actually
It was there's a hearing
Out there that says that
Thomas
Lobbyed state officials
And different politicians
About the
Company and
But he wasn't a registered lobbyist with the secretary
Of state but that
Lobbying is what led to the loan
That funded the company
So dude's gonna get
Fined $2000 if he doesn't
Fill in the proper reports
So nope
We haven't heard the last of them
File your report or else
Or how about lobbying is
Stupid
Alright
Let's move on
We're gonna travel around the world and check out
Some release dates and check out some things coming
To a store near you although I think
This segment might be a little empty
This week I don't know Loki is there anything
In the US? It is that time of year there is
Nothing coming out
Yeah unfortunately there
Is nothing coming out this week I mean
Tuesday in the states is what Christmas Eve
Eve as my sister calls it
So yeah there's not really
I mean they don't normally put anything out around
This time and even it's pretty dead
Up until March
The only thing I can say is if you have
You know your games with gold
Or if you've got
PlayStation Plus don't forget to download the free
Games I know right now starting
On the 16th they had SSX on
Xbox so I
Reminded myself today to go download that
Even if I may not play it or not I still have
Like money I gotta spend on there and I just
I honestly haven't been touching my Xbox in a long time
So I just have to
Figure out what I'm gonna
Buy for it I'm hoping
I hope I'll get an Xbox One at some point and I can
Just buy a digital game on that or something
But yeah
Just unfortunately not a lot coming out until January
Alright well
Japan being a different culture has a
Different pattern with their releases and so we are
Seeing some releases in Japan this week
In fact on the 25th of December we have
On the PlayStation 4 Laura Croft and the
Temple of Osiris comes out on the PlayStation 4
And Shadow of Mordor
Middle Earth comes out on the Japanese
Version on the PlayStation 4
This week on the 25th
Shadow of Mordor also making its way to the Xbox One
In Japan this week
Looking at the last gen consoles
PlayStation 3 hey guess what
Shadow of Mordor also on the PlayStation 3
This week and on the Wii U
Nothing this week
Wii U is not getting anything until Captain
Toad Treasure Tracker next
Year I didn't realize that game was not
Out in Japan oh never mind cause that's the Europe date
Not the Japan date oops
So gosh Japan doesn't get
A Wii U game until
Lego Marvel Super Heroes
On January 22nd
Which they should totally download or buy
Which is also well it's gonna go up against
On the same day Kirby Super Rainbow
Which is the Kirby Touch
Wii U game is on the 22nd
In Japan let's quickly
Check the Vita and the 3DS
There is one game on the Vita this week
Mahuka Koku no
Retosei Out of Order
Comes out this week that's from
Bandai Namco and lastly
On the 3DS this week
Atelier Deco
La Doll Collection
Looks like another title in the
I would say in the Atelier series but I don't think
That is what this is at all this is just a doll
Dress up game coming out
On
It's those dolls what
Jamie what do they call these dolls with the
Giant eyes that look like that one Lady Gaga
Video oh the Puleps
Yeah or the Blythe
Or the Puleps I think the Puleps
Yeah that looks like a Pulep
So it looks like that kind of little dress up
Game there dress up and decoration
On the 3DS I'm sure all of you
Are pre-ordering it right now
How about Europe Dark Sakura?
Not a damn thing
Um it like gave me
Some games but didn't say when
So I'm just gonna throw off a few of them
Sure Cosmic Star Heroine
Uh Duelist
Habitat
The Girl and the Robot
Some other stuff
Those are probably games that were
Announced for this year but never dated
So I'm thinking that's probably what it is
We'll see I'm gonna put file that under
Bullshit so yeah
Nothing no games for you guys in the UK
Sorry you don't get to play anything
Catch up on your backlog shit
Get a Spectrum
Just a couple more stories for you guys
Speaking of the Spectrum just a couple more stories
Than the classic game of the week
Loki
So um
You know I think we talked about this a while back
You know how the whole
Debate regarding
You know 1080p and upscale
1080p and the whole you know
Oh this game's not really 1080p
It's like 900p or whatever
Yes I do remember this debate
There was this lawsuit or
It was a class action lawsuit against
Killzone Shadowfall
And they were saying that you know
It was false advertising because it wasn't a native
You know 1080p
And so
Apparently the
Federal judge has ruled
I guess that a lot of the
Complaints have been dismissed
So there is
Only still one left I guess
And I'm trying to see here I believe it
Was that they were saying
Um
Let's see here
Something I think that still has to do with
The native or the razor sharp
1080p native resolution
Is false advertising
And they were claiming that it was blurry
To the point of distraction which honestly
Looking at the screenshots and
Videos of seeing a Killzone it looked pretty
Good I just don't understand why people
Would be complaining about that game there's
Plenty other games that look like crap
Um
But yeah basically
All but one argument
Basically that shouldn't agree that
The negligent misrepresentation
Claim cannot stand in its current
State as Ledor did
Not present a non economic
Loss such as personal injury or property
Damage yes he caused property
Damage because of the
The lack of pixels burned
My house down
Um yes
And so you know because of that you know
They granted them 30 days to file an
Amendment complaint in which case they say
Um they can sufficiently
Alleged that he or other punitive class
Members suffered such non economic
Damages I just
I the whole thing just seemed to be
Kind of a grab for money in the first place
I just don't see this
I'd be surprised if that last
Bit doesn't get dismissed
Or if it does go to court that
They still don't win I mean cause
I think they're just
Kind of stretching at this point trying to
I don't know if it ever
Says it's native 1080p anywhere
On like any of the advertising
Hey Murica
Ah
Anyhow uh alright
I got a story about a series
That I know a lot of you like I like this series
An awful lot it's pretty much all I use my 3DS
For now that Smash Brothers is on Wii U
And that game is Theatrhythm
And guess what Theatrhythm Dragon
Quest is going to be a thing
It was shown at Jump Festa 2015
Which was a big Square Enix festival
That's going on right now
We have some other stories about what came out of Jump Festa
A little later on in the show
But yeah Theatrhythm Dragon Quest is going to be a thing
Who knows if it will actually come out here
In America that's the big
Question right now but Dragon Quest
Theatrhythm will come out in Japan on March
26th of next year
Again no Western release yet confirmed
For the game if they're going to do it
I would imagine they'd announce it at E3
For a holiday release kind of like what they did with Curtain Call
I don't know if this would be the type of thing
That might be download only
Because I mean unfortunately over here
Dragon Quest is a little more niche
Especially when you consider
That there's probably going to be songs from Dragon Quest 10
In it which wasn't even released here
So I don't know but anyway there still
Will be field and event music stages
That are in the game
There will also be apparently a top down
Rock band type setup
That will take the four lane battle
Layout that was found
In the previous Theatrhythm games and
Turn it into something a little different there
So again March 26th
2015 is the big day
For that in Japan I'm sure some people will
Be importing that
Also good news for Japanese owners of
Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call
Some more DLC
Was confirmed for Final Fantasy
Curtain Call now there was some
Stuff that you would expect in this game such as the
Ultima Battle music from Final Fantasy 14
Which is really good by the way
Hard to miss as well will be
Coming out but those songs are going to be
Free for two weeks when they come out in Japan
So that's pretty cool but also get this
The opening titles and
Passionate rhythm from
Romancing Saga and Romancing
Saga 2
Saga Frontier will be getting a song in the game
The Meridian dance
From Secret of Mana is going
To be in Theatrhythm Curtain Call
And Chrono Trigger
Is getting a song
In Theatrhythm Final Fantasy
Which many people
Were saying Chrono Trigger should just get its own
Damn Theatrhythm game
But it's been so long
I don't know if that will happen
No announcement yet if those
Songs will make their way over
To the US I sure hope
So I think a lot of
People would really dig some
Of these songs in America
But we shall see
What do we have to do for like DLC
For Mario Kart 8 that's
Chocobo Racing
What do we have to do for that?
Or hell just make
A racing game. Shit it can't be
That expensive they have the fucking Sanrio
Games that come out that aren't that great
Chocobo Racing is coming to Final Fantasy 14
With the Chocobo breeding
Yeah but it's not Chocobo Kart Racing
I understand that
You're actually going to get to control your Chocobo though
It's probably
It's not going to be as robust as something that Mario Kart 8
There should really be like a whole
Derby Owners Club type game
Like Final Fantasy where you're just sitting there
Like guiding on them
I know I'm sounding fanboy
And you know what sometimes I just can't help it
You made Polteri cry
With Final Fantasy 14
The fact that they're bringing Triple Triad into the game
And Chrono
Yes they're bringing Chrono Trigger into Final Fantasy 14
No they're not
It's not canon if it comes in there
But can they get like the Golden Saucer up in there
That's what it is it's coming in the next patch
It's called the Manderville Gold Saucer
Is coming in the 2.5 patch
Before the expansion
There's more
Fucking Hilda whatever
The fuck is it
They haven't said if it's part of the Hildebrand quest or not
I hate him
I love him you're a hater
I am a hater because he's stupid
I like his dad though
I don't know if it was Allen or Shane that suggested this
I think it was Allen that said this
That it could be that his
No it was Shane because I think we were talking about Skype
It could be his dad that owns
The Gold Saucer
Or his mom
His mom has not been seen in the story
Hildebrand's mom
She could be the one that runs the Gold Saucer
She probably got smart and left him
So what was the new
The new jobs that they added for 14?
They announced
This didn't make our show roll but yes they announced
3 new jobs for Final Fantasy 14 that will be in the expansion
Dark Knight which is a new
Tank class it was not a tank in 11
But it will be a tank class now
They announced Astrologist which is the new healer class
Machinist
And Machinist
Is going to be the DPS class
I want to play an Aurra
Aurra is the new race
It's new to Final Fantasy
They look like Draenei but just not blue
They're pretty
They build mechs and stuff
That would be pretty bad
Do you remember
Edgar in Final Fantasy 6
Why did they tell me this?
That sounds so awesome
They're going to actually use little
Drones too
Looks awesome
It's kind of like the Engineer class
Come to the dark side
Do the thing
Sorry Nellie
That means
I'm not going to remake Mulan
But I'm probably going to do a second character
Edgar is like seriously my favorite character
From like pretty much all the entire series
They have the most bad ass weapons
This is why Final Fantasy 14
Is doing so awesome
And why the game continues to be awesome
The reason why
Is they know that
And they're acknowledging that Loki
They know that people love Edgar and that's why they're making
Machinist a class in the game
Just for the same reason they made a fucking Magitek armor
Something that you can actually get in the game
And ride around on
It's that same type of stuff
I wouldn't doubt
At some point they'll put the fucking Opera House from Final Fantasy 6
Somehow in the game
They have Ultros
With the old school battle music
In the game so
That's why the game is doing so well
I'm on that quest line right now
They know what people like
That fight is kind of a bitch
It's harder than the Shiva fight
You can teach me the mechanics before I try it
You get turned into an imp
And you have to imp punch
The other guy
Before he does his thing
Can you imp punch him in his
Imp junk?
SSJ100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
Nelly can't hear you Rob
She's pouring sand in your car's gas tank
Probably
Alright you know what
Let's travel back to a time when games were a lot simpler
You know they weren't
Just self referential
Although this game might have been a little bit
It's the classic game of the week
Where Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault
And find a game and she thinks
You know what
Since there's no games coming out in the US or Europe this week
You go fucking play this game
You do the thing
You get Loki subbed
To Final Fantasy 14
And then you play this
Dark Soccer what is
If you make your character by the way
No that will never happen
I will just name my
I'll name him
Just after what I had in my other class
Alright
Here it is your classic game of the week Dark Soccer
I love love love this game and I'm so excited
It's finally a fucking
Classic game of the week
I picked a game that came out the year I graduated high school
Oh my god
Why do you insist
Is that your new thing you're going to come out here and go
I picked this game because it's now officially
Nine years old and so are you
No Rob this is more than
Ten years old
This is 20 years old
Remember I skipped my 20th high school reunion
To play this game
Oh and the oven is preheated so we got
I better do this quick because Latkes
Oh yeah
Point blank also known as
Gun Bullet
I love that game
Or it's also been nicknamed
Gun Buddy
It came out by Namco
In the arcade Playstation
It's got a version on the DS
But it first came out in 1994
For the arcade and it is the first
Light gun game
That Namco has ever done
Basically
It's a fucking light gun game
But you have different types of
Quests that you have
And they're different puzzles
Like the one on the video
That I'm linking here is actually one of the harder ones
Where it's a cut out shoot
That you go down a hall
And you have to shoot all the bad guys
And none of the civilians
You got ones where you shoot
Different targets of a color
You get
Different
Shoot all the balls
Yes
You shoot the balls
And it's like Buster Brothers
The way that the balls work
You shoot them and they get smaller
That would be so easy to make
It's funny
This game is so fucking good
I can't
You have to also protect Dr. Don and Dr. Dan
You have other challenges
Some things that have in common
With police trainer
Different difficulty levels you have
Practice, beginner, advanced, and very hard
Because some people like it very hard
Determine how many stages
That you have to finish
To complete the game
As well as their difficulty
And then you get four missions
In each of those types of groups
So you can do different ones
In different orders
So you lose your lives by failing to complete your quota
Within your time limit
Or shooting a bomb
Or letting Dr. Don or Dr. Dan die
When you have to protect them
Incorrectly answering questions
By shooting the wrong answers
Shooting a cardboard civilian
Shooting a cardboard geisha
Failing to complete a quota
For multiple life things
Letting meteors destroy the earth
Because that's always a day ruiner
Running out of bullets
Shooting incorrect differences
Letting aliens steal your shot
And more
So the things that you're
Gauged on is accuracy, intelligence, memory
Simulation, visual acuity
And speed
So as far as the games that have come out
In this series
We have Point Blank, the first one in 1994
Or Gun Bullet
As it's called
Point Blank 2, which came out as
Gun Body
Ghoul Panic
Or Baekhyun
Which was a haunted house theme
In 3D graphics instead of the
Yes, the cat bug level
Yes, the cat bug level
Point Blank 3
Or Gun Ballina
And Point Blank DS
Which was a
Uno no Tatsujin Gun Bullet Trainer
But yeah, it actually
Like I said, it was an arcade release
But then it came out on the Playstation
Which I've got versions of this that I cannot play
Because we can't use light guns on modern TVs
And the Playstation had
The arcade mode included
But it also had like an RPG mode
And then it was recreated in Point Blank 2
And then
So basically the very last iteration that came out
Was in 2006
With
Sorry, Point Blank DS
Or as I said, Uno no Tatsujin
Gun Bullet Trainer
There you go
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week
I really love this game, Point Blank
Available
In the arcades
So you know, on main cabinets everywhere
Or the more ethical way of
On the Playstation, even though
You're gonna have to get an old TV to play it on
It reminds me, where the hell are my gun guns?
I wish they'd bring this back
Here's what you can do with the Morpheus
That's what I want with the Morpheus
The Move Controllers
They had the gun controllers for that
They had Time Crisis
They had the Toy Story game on Wii
Which is a very similar type of thing
Well they also have it on the Playstation 3
Yeah, that's right
Yeah, I'm down with that
Come on Namco, it's been a
It's been a long time
Hell, just bring it to
Well, I don't know if they could do it on Virtual Console
But that'd be awesome on Virtual Console
Point Blank is the reason the CRT should never truly die
YYR wants to point out
Shameless plug
My game, Sharpshooter, on Xbox Live Indie games
Is basically Point Blank using the analog stick
Instead of a gun
Also crappy graphics, but the gameplay is there
Hey, you know what?
YYR kind of planted the seed that led to this whole game jam idea
That we're going to get into tonight
So I have no problem plugging his stuff
YYR
YYR is doing the Lord's work
In my opinion, between
Bungie ferret tossing and pixel shits
So you know what? Plug away
Plug away
Let's take a break
We're going to take a quick break, guys
But when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio
Including the
List tonight, guys
The OLR
Bobby Blackwolf and other shows on the network
Are going to be teaming up to prevent
To prevent, to present
Not prevent
If we pick the wrong theme, it might prevent it
But we are going to present
The VOG
game jam
And that is kicking off tonight
And I know some of you have your Unity windows up
Ready to go
You just need to know the theme
So we are going to pick that theme when we come back
After a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
Live on this Sunday evening
December the 21st of 2014
Episode number 580 of our show
Already in progress
And a very happy
Whatever it is you celebrate this December
It's Hanukkah
Right now
It's Hanukkah
It is Hanukkah right now
But this week also sees
You know, Christmas
Which is kind of a big deal to some people
Which is kind of a big deal to some people
Kwanzaa, what else
Is Festivus this week?
When is Festivus? I don't know
Ramadan, I don't know
Ramadan is in the middle of the year
What is the other holiday I am thinking of
This time of year
Solstice for some people
Saturnalia, which is today I believe
What is the other big one this winter
That is the Solstice, Yule
Hanukkah going on
Kwanzaa going on
Boxing Day
That's the day after Christmas
It's like Black Friday in Canada
But instead of trying to kill each other
They all push each other and apologize
Sorry, sorry
Sorry
Try to get that crockpot
Anyway
Let's move on
And try to get into
Some more gaming news
And we are going to start off with some rapid
Fire news, Loki
Which is kind of cool
Even though we don't technically have our first
Female character in a Grand Theft Auto
Game, unless you can count
Grand Theft Auto online
Now, Payday 2 is getting its first
Female gang member
In some new DLC
Her pseudonym is Clover
And I guess she is joining
Joining in on the
Heist scene
Also they are going to have a unique weapon
Called the Shillelagh weapon
The Shillelagh, so is she Irish?
She is Irish
And there is also a new mission
I guess called the Diamond Heist
They will try to swipe
I guess you would try to swipe the
World's most famous diamond from a
Heavily guarded museum
So the Diamond Heist
DLC, that would be $7
And then
I guess $5 for the character pack
So
That's pretty cool
Definitely looks like
She would fit right in with Grand Theft Auto
Or Payday 2
I have to check out Payday 2
I got Payday 1
I got it free when they had it on there for a little bit
I miss chocolate Paydays, those were delicious
And then of course
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto
Grand Theft Auto 5, they kind of do stuff
For the holidays every now and then
I haven't played my game
Recently yet, but I know they are
Going to have snow
In Los Santos, so you can check that out
But they also have Festive Surprise
Update
Which is going to add
A lot of Christmas and holiday themed
Things, including
They've got brand new weapons
Also Christmas sweaters
Had scarves, they had a mask that looks like
A gingerbread man that's kind of creepy
A penguin mask
They are also going to have some
New Year's stuff
Including a fireworks launcher
Rocket ammo again, just like
Last year
Hot Rod, Christmas Rat Loader
Slam Van
Oh, proxy mines and a
Homey Missile Launcher were added to the game as well
And of course, all that is free
So go check it out
And to go with that
They've been
Heists have been promised for Grand Theft Auto Online
Forever now
It was supposed to have been out around the time
That Grand Theft Auto Online launched
And this week they had a new trailer
For heists that are going to be coming early
2015
And it looks pretty awesome
Definitely going to
They even kind of poke fun at it a little bit
In there talking about
Kind of a little bit of a delay
But it's showing off different types of missions
It can go on
Breaking people out of jail
And all sorts of
Bank heists and that kind of stuff
Looks pretty cool, should be coming to
Platforms early next year
Hopefully sooner than later
Alright
Let's see here
Last but not least
More DLC for LittleBigPlanet 3
I guess it would be for everything
Because
I think those characters are interchangeable
But they're going to have
Frozen characters
Making their way to
LittleBigPlanet
Oh, hooray
They're going to be able to have
Elsa, Anna, Sven, Kristoff, and
Marshmallow in the medicine man skins
Which can be purchased for
$1.99 a piece or in the whole
Costume pack which would include
The exclusive Olaf skin
For $5.99
And they're going to be releasing
A winter creator kit for free to go along with that
Look, I love Disney
And I'm sure this is fine
I have not seen Frozen
I don't know how the fuck I never saw it
I so rarely get out to movies anymore
I just never saw Frozen
But the more and more overexposed Frozen gets
The less and less I want to see the damn movie
Because I'm just like, stop
There's like an entire
Archive of Disney everything
And it's still everything Frozen
Like half of Disneyland is Frozentown
Right now
Why can't it be all like, you know, I don't know
Wreck-It Ralph or Big Hero 6
Yes, exactly
Exactly
Alright, anyhow
There is more news coming out of the Jump
Festival over in Japan
Including a new trailer for Final Fantasy
XV that showed up
I'm very excited about this game
Even though, I got to admit, seeing the English
Voice acting in the game, I'm a little bit worried
Because it wasn't exactly
The best, but well
It was better than Destiny's
So we'll see
So this game will be coming out
I'm assuming they're trying to make it for holiday
Next year, especially with the demo coming out
So we'll see if it makes it
But other notable things in the trailer
They showed a Titan summon
In the trailer and it looked amazing
He was gigantic
And it looked like he was about to step on one of the guys
That was pretty cool
And they revealed that they're going to have Sid
In the game, of course, but this time Sid is a woman
Named Sydney
And Sydney is an engineer
And she has a bit of an accent
And she introduces herself as Sydney
And they call her Sid for short
Why not?
Anyhow, they
Also have announced
Not Square, but Nintendo has announced
That Duck Hunt will be coming out to the Wii U
Virtual Console
We talked about that a while ago
I think that news just came out this week
That it's officially coming out to the Virtual Console
It's dated now
Oh, they have the date now?
Christmas Day
When they were talking about Smash
They mentioned Duck Hunt
But I don't think they had a date yet
Well now it has a date
So it's December 25th is the day that it's coming out
I have no idea how that is going to work
With the light gun
I'm assuming it's using the Wiimote as the controller
Maybe tapping the gamepad would be kind of cool too
But I doubt it
Neat
Don't forget, there's also the whole
Many people remember the Duck Hunt part
But it's also the clay pigeon shooter thing
They have in there too
The original game that the whole thing was based on
But anyway
Also coming out on the 25th
Of this month
The same day
Shantae and the Pirate's Curse
Is finally coming to the Wii U
And I know some people have been awaiting this game
It's been out on the 3DS for a little bit
But of course the Wii U version will have
HD character portraits
Off TV play
Classic Controller Pro
And Wii U Pro Controller support
And he's a very talented individual
So I'm sure a lot of people will be checking out Shantae
And hopefully enough people buy this game
So that the Nintendo
E-Shop can say, Shantae, you stay
Alright
And one more little quick announcement here about
Killer Instinct
Of course the free to play fighting game on the Xbox
Riptor
Is making its way to Killer Instinct this week
And December
17th was the day that Riptor hit the game
I guess that was
A little bit earlier or whatever
Anyhow, the new design is similar to the old design
For Riptor
There you go, some extra little
New high definition features on
Riptor
A game which I will certainly check out whenever
I finally get around to getting an Xbox One
I thought I would buy it this holiday
But
Sadly didn't get one in time
For the big holiday
Alright, Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?
Rescued the latkes
Alright
They look well done over there
They are done, they have to cool off a little bit
D-U-N
Well, first of all for the holidays there are
Some freebies going on
And some happiness to be had
So first of all
The
There's a game called
Enter the Gungeon
And Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike
They are both free on Steam right now
And
Especially in the Fork Parker game
You get features like
Snow Helicopter, Dope Beat
Ethics
Reverse Monetization, Hot Tubs
Falling
And Ropes
So there you go
Next up, Capcom though
Is going to be delisting
Marvel vs. Capcom
Origins very soon
So get it while you can
It's going to be taken off the Playstation Network
On December 23rd
And Xbox Live Arcade on December 31st
Get it while you can
Right now it's $15
And then
Last but not least, Halfbrick
Studios is giving away
Every game in its
IOS catalog for free right now
That's including Fruit Ninja
Jetpack Joyride
Out of Water, Monster Dash, Age of Zombies
Season 2
Band Stars, Colossatron, Massive World
Brizzle Fever, Yes Chef
And Top Farm
Freebies, get em
I like free things
I do too
Alright
Bummer about those games
Getting delisted but I guess it makes sense
With all the licensing and so forth
Well one thing we don't plan on delisting from this show
Anytime soon is the chance for you guys
To have your say in a segment we call
The Fugal Question of the Week
You take the words
Facebook and Google Plus
And slam them together and you get
Fugal
And we're going to ask our community a question
As we do every week
And this week has to do with
The video game jam
That we are starting tonight
The video game jam kicking off tonight
We want all of our awesome listeners
To create something, dammit
And so we're asking you
What should the theme be?
So I don't think Loki has finished his list yet
And I don't think Dark Soccer has finished her list yet
Finished, started, you know, same thing
Alright
Bobby hasn't finished his list yet
I don't know
Or maybe he has
So we want you guys to have your say
On what should be on the list
So here it is, some of the answers from Facebook
We have some answers here on Facebook
Such as Hitstun
Who says three colors
Should be the theme
And Hitstun wants to remind us that
Food and rotation
Are also things that were submitted
On the comments to last week's episode
I believe boobs was also submitted
Twice as the theme
So you got three colors
Food and rotation
You know why I like three colors?
Because it reminds me of the old school computer monitors
Although I think technically that was CMYK
I think were the colors that it could do
Black is technically not a color
Alright
Let's see, Milton H says
Theater
Theater should be the theme
Alright we'll see, we'll see
Fifth Dream suggesting unicorns
I think I brought that one up earlier in the show
Unicorns, that would be a lot of fun
And Raginator
In typical Raginator suggestion
Says either explosive projectile diarrhea
Or ginger pubes
Oh Raginator
And we only have one answer
One lone answer over on Google Plus
And it's actdeft suggesting
And I like this one
How about hats?
Well how about hats?
Alright
There it is, some of the suggestions from you guys
We will see what makes the list here
In just a little bit
But we have a few more stories for you guys
Before we get to that list list
Alright so
Let's talk a little bit about
Let's see here
Steam
So the Steam Controller
Still not out yet
But it's been going
Undergoing several revisions
And the newest revision of the Steam Controller
Actually kind of is unveiled
Based off of
An image that was in the Steam Client Beta
And it shows now
Where the
You know how they kind of have those
Crazy circle
Touch pad things that were
The analog sticks
I remember last time that they added
Actually an analog stick to the controller
Now there's a d-pad where one of those
Circle pads is
Or I guess it's still part of the circle pad
But there's like some sort of d-pad
Cross mark on it
So I don't know
It's more and more becoming like an
Xbox 360 controller
As time progresses
It's just slowly
Evolving into like an Xbox
Controller or like a
New pro controller or something
But uh
I don't know
It'll be interesting to see
What that looks like when it's actually released
Hell it'll be interesting to see what these
Scene boxes look like when they're actually released
Yeah won't it have been a year
Since they were announced
When we finally get around to the CES
Has it only been a year?
I think CES was when they announced it
Whoa why is our outro playing
Sorry about that it's not over yet
Be quiet Jason
My fault sorry
Um so yeah I'm not sure
Um
I'm surprised it's only been a year
But it's taking
Taking a long time I guess
I don't know
Definitely less excited about
Them kind of taking over as like a console
Though the buzz
Is kind of dropped off
Completely
I think I don't know
Alright one more story for you guys
And this has to do with
World of Warcraft
Which I've been playing a little bit thanks to the new
Expansion and some updates were
Finally posted this week I was curious when they were
Going to finally talk about what their first
Major patch will have for
Warlords of Draenor and they finally talked a little bit about that
But
You know it doesn't really matter what else the note said
Because
A lot of people very interested
In one of these points that was
On the blue post that was made about this
About potentially adding
A subscription currency
And they're comparing this
To the Plex currency in EVE Online
And what would happen is that you could buy
And sell game time tokens
For in game gold
Saying quote our current thought on this is that
It would give players a way to use their surplus
Gold to cover some of their
Subscription cost while giving players
Who might have less play time
An option for acquiring gold
From other players through a legit
And secure system
So this is going to cause a lot of people to perk up
When the world's biggest MMO
Which a lot of people have been saying should go
Free to play already
When they're talking about possibly
Funding subscriptions through
In game gold
Now granted it's not going to be like you just pay the gold
For the subscription there still has to be that exchange
Of currency but this will
In some ways combat
The third party market that's out there
For gold buying
And they tried to do this before with a pet
They sold a pet on the marketplace
But it was something that would be tradable
And you could actually sell it on the market boards
And what was interesting is that the market kind of
Bottomed out on those pets really fast
And so people bought them and
They wouldn't sell for a lot of gold in game
So it would be very interesting to see what happens
Because when you're talking about subscription fees
I mean that is literally the life blood of a game
Much different than the pet so it's going to be very interesting
To see how that plays out
But would you be interested
In playing Final Fantasy XI if you could pay for your subscription
In Gil?
It's hard enough to earn Gil in the game
I don't know if I'd want to
I ain't sure, why not
But I don't know if I'd want to do that
Just drop the subscription down to like
Five dollars a month or something
Something ridiculously cheap
I don't know, even twelve bucks is not a lot
But it's been that for a long time
Why would they drop it down that low
When people are still paying what's out there today
Why would I pay twelve dollars for that
When I can, isn't it like twelve
Or fourteen dollars for fourteen
I don't know what the subscription fee is
I honestly can't remember either
It's something around that but like why would I pay
Twelve when I can pay
You can also do like the multi month thing
And all that other stuff so
Yeah
I don't know
Alright well it is time ladies and gentlemen
Get ready because the
VOG Jam
Kicks off right now
With a segment that we
Call Listless
And I will explain it to you guys here momentarily
But we have to get an old buddy of ours here
On the line to play Listless with us
Tonight so I'm going to hope that he is standing
By ready to
Share the themes and ideas with us
Hello Bobby are you there
I'm here what's up
Hey I should have said Atlanta
Are you there? Did you always say Sacramento
Or are you guys there?
How are you doing my friend?
I'm doing good
Are you excited about the game jam?
I'm very excited
Me too, what is exciting you about this in particular?
That I actually will have a reason to open up Unity again
Have you opened up Unity
Since Flappy Vog?
Nope
And why not?
Time
And inspiration
You're going to have to make time for the
And Bobby Blackwolf and do we know if any
Other shows on the network have joined in on this?
I don't know
But is the video game jam
But the nice thing is about those words video game
You got V, O, and G in the word
Haha wink wink nudge nudge right?
We created something dammit
That's right we want everybody to create something
Alright so let's go over the rules
Here's the way it's going to work
Let me stop the Listless music
Because we're not ready to get quite into Listless yet
But let's go over the rules of the competition
Well it's not really a competition
Everybody joins in, it's a participation event
But here's the way it works
It is open for your submissions
Around this central theme
And you can make a game in Unity
You can make a game in RPG maker
You can make a level in LittleBigPlanet
You can do a pen and paper game
If you want to scan it as a PDF
Whatever works
We want you to create something dammit
And the only question we're going to ask
Is did you try
Did you try
And that's a very subjective question
And Jamie will be the ultimate judge
Of the can you try or did you try department
Because we don't want somebody just sending in
Like a piece of paper that says
You know frame one frame two
You know what I mean
You gotta try a little bit with this
But we realize everybody has different skill sets
So we want you guys to try
And the theme should tie into
Whatever it is that you put together
Lightly or heavily
It's up to you
You're going to submit your completed
Game jams to the following
Address jam
As in grape or jelly
Jam at vognetwork.com
You can send those emails jam
At vognetwork.com
And with a link to your finished product
Now Bobby vognetwork.com
Can actually host
Some of the finished products right Bobby?
Right so what I'm offering
Is because I've already got kind of a
Thing in our backend system that we run
That I created for VOG
Is so if your game
Can be run in a browser
Which is either Unity Web Player
Which uses its own plugin
Or if it's Flash
Or if it's HTML5
Something that can be run in a browser
And you don't have space for it yourself
I'm willing to host it
On vognetwork.com for you
It'll actually appear in our drop down
Because we have that arcade menu item
In our top drop down it'll actually appear in there
People can go in there and play it
And essentially what I'll do
Is I've created a forum
A sub-forum on our very
Not used forums
At vognetwork.com
Right up near the top about the video game jam
And I'll put technical specifications in there
As to what you need to send
We're also willing to host your file
For you
So that way you don't have to worry about
Too much about like a Mega account
Or a Dropbox account
We'll host the file on our servers as well
If you just want to distribute the zip file
And have people install it that way
My only
Rule on this
And this is not censorship
This is because I don't want to have an awkward
Conversation with our web host
That hosts VOG
No supreme gore and no supreme
Sex and nudity
You could still do that
We're just not gonna host it
If you really want to make a porn game
Go for it and I will totally play your porn game
However you just have to host it on your own server
So I just want to make that clear
We gotta keep all the super porn
And the super gore off of our own server
But if that's what you want to submit
You know what, more power to you
Just create something dammit
Alright
This is gonna be so much fun I can't wait
So there is a forum and people can actually collaborate on that forum
Like I know Dark Tetsuya in our secret forum
He actually put together
A brilliant list of all these possible ways you could make a game
And Dark Tetsuya if you're listening
Go to that new forum right now
And like copy paste your post cause it's great
So
Kaijuto says no sex I'm out
Hold on we didn't say no sex
We just said we're not
You need to go hook up at someone else's place
That's what we're saying
You can still submit it
I'm just not hosting it on my website
That's right you gotta have your hook up
Somewhere else
Preem sex and nudity
What if we leave off the sour cream and diced tomatoes
Oh stop oh you
Fifth Dream says can it be
Can it just be HTML
Sure create something dammit
Is it a game?
Oh there you go
Oh deadline
You have until
Drum roll please
You have until January 11
Three weeks from tonight
To submit your finished product
Tonight that we will start the evaluation process
It's probably gonna go on throughout the week
And when I say evaluate just mean
We're gonna play your game and we will
We're gonna give it a fair review and a mention here
On the show but we will be a lot
Nicer if you're worried that we're gonna
Make fun of your game or talk negative about your game
No that's not what we're here about
We are here to promote and encourage people
To create so we promise we will
Only say positive things about your game
And keep the whole thing positive
We wanna encourage people to create things
And we'll live stream some of that
And some of the prizes
For participating you're gonna get some
Special VOG network loot
Which comes with points that you can only get if you
Participate in this
OLR will also be donating
Five mystery prize packs
Five tangible mystery prize packs
To random participants
And that is it
There is not gonna be any judging as far as first
Second or third place because we just wanna say
Create something dammit but we may still
Give out some special acknowledgements
As need be
So I think I covered everything right Bobby?
Yeah basically
That's pretty much it
I would say what like 5 PM Pacific
Like when our show starts
Sunday night that's when submissions should be closed
Yeah 5 Pacific 8 Eastern so we can read them
All out on Bobby's show
Just like their chatters
And you can be in teams that's perfectly
Fine you can even collaborate on the forums
And stuff YYR brought up a good point
Maybe you know people should do status updates each week
Just so we can kinda keep tabs on it
Absolutely Because I could be mean
And just submit flappy vog
If it fits the theme
If it fits the theme
And the theme I might suggest in a moment here is anything
But flappy vog
And preferably no copyrighted
Works Oh yeah yeah try to stay away
From the copyrighted stuff
We ban them from the theme submissions
Now a lot of people asking about
What qualifies as supreme gore
Or sex and
Tiger class says if the game has colorful language
Is that allowed? Yes because our shows
Have colorful language that's fine
And as far as supreme gore and sex
If your game is called like
Decapitation corpse fucker
Then you know it's probably not
Gonna be okay for the game jam
To be hosted on our site
We did have decap attack on
I know I know look just use
We're talking about hosting you can make whatever you want
If it's like that it can't be hosted
On the site and I will be the
Supreme dictator on what gets hosted
Or not I will be like steam
And if I say that I'm not
Gonna host it then I'm not gonna host it
And but you can still put it somewhere else
But again I want to really
Encourage you guys to think outside
Those don't get hung up on the
Sex and gore good god people
There's so much more out there
It's just Raginator and if you yeah if you want
To do sex and gore go for it just
On your own server that's all just
Get your own dropbox account or whatever so there it is
YYR in chat says
Decapitation corpse fucker theme noted
Alright
Well let's talk about how list list works
Cause it's been it's been quite some time
Since we played list list here on the show
So I know not everybody may have heard this so this is the way it's gonna work
You guys listening live
Get to vote on this as this unfolds
So here's how it's gonna work
We have compiled all of our answers
As well as some of the answers we've seen you guys post
Into a list of three
Items a piece
So each of us will put an item up on the list
That's gonna leave us with a list of twelve
Then comes the very hard part we go around
The room and we each remove one
Item from the list hey it's tough
But it's a scientific process it has to be done
No host can have their list
Decimated so if
If somebody gets
Two answers eliminated from their list the third
Answer gets immunity
So through that process we'll be left with a list of
Eight that you guys will vote on
Over at live.vognetwork.com
So right now you're gonna see that pop up on the board
If you happen to be listening to the show
You're gonna see that pop up on the screen
What should the video game jam theme be
And you can watch the list creation
As it unfolds
We are gonna let our guest go first tonight
With his first answer
Bobby what is your number three
Position even though it doesn't really matter for this
But we still say three two one what is your number three
Answer for what should the video game jam
Theme be
Okay well first thing I wanna say is that you have to be
Logged into vognetwork.com to see
The list list pop up
Oh yes very important thank you
So if you're not logged in if you're just anonymous
And haven't created an account you're not gonna see it come up
Thank you
My number three answer
Obviously because of who I am
Drums or drumming
I see so a little bit of percussion freaks there
Drums or drumming
Just because you have a personal
You have a personal interest
In this right
Alright but just keep in mind guys
Tycho drum masters already been done
Alright drums or drumming
Let's put that on the list
Alright up next tonight
Loki, Loki what is your
Number three answer
Not entirely original
But I used a random generator
So for some of these
But some of them are pretty good
So the first one I had was
Buggy game
To win you have to work around the bugs
Or die trying
That was one of my alternates
A buggy game
Interesting
Can I think of like
What was that game
Rom check fail
Or something like that
No but I think especially in light
Of the year we've had and what I just complained
About at the beginning of the show with Tetris
And everything I think it's kind of funny
That now the intention would be to make
A buggy game I like that that's cute
Alright a buggy game let's add it to the list
Alright I'm up next with my
Number three answer
My number three answer tonight
You know gosh I've been kind of going back and forth
A little bit with the ideas
And originally
I was going to put one called
Revive the arcade on the list
But the more I was thinking about it
I was kind of like ah I don't know if that
I think that might be too specific
I'm not sure if everybody would get that so I'm going to
And chatters this way
You guys can't say you didn't have your say of this
I really like the idea
Of three colors so I'm going to go ahead and add that
To the list because I think that's going to encourage
Some retro stuff but not necessarily
Because there's a lot you could do with three colors
Concept so I like that idea so much
I'm going to put it on my list in the number three spot
Alright DarkSakura ladies
Last what is your
Number three answer
Typography
Typography okay
The font fan in you
Wants typography so
Mavis Beacon teaches typography
I don't want it to be like
A word game
I just want typography
To be a theme
A theme in the game
Alright I like that let's add it on the list
Alright there it is the number three answer so far
A buggy game three colors and typography
Alright let's add four more
To the list as we get the number two answers
Bobby Blackwolf
Alright so my second theme
Know when to quit
Know when to quit
Interesting again another very
Kind of vague answer because
I don't know why but my mind instantly
Went to well I don't know if I should even say this
Because I don't want to steer the game so you know what
I'm not even going to say what my mind instantly went to
I think it's the same place everybody else's would go
That's the beauty of it
That is the beauty of it you guys
See my other answers are very like silly
But you guys have these like really in
Depth thought provoking things where's the dick and
Fart jokes tonight Rage Nator is going to stop listening
You guys alright know when to quit
Let's put it up on the list I could have said twat but that's banned
That's right that just leads to
Super porn alright
Loki let's get
Your number two answer
My number two answer is everything you know is wrong
Now that song is stuck in my head
Interesting everything you know is
Wrong oh gosh
So kind of like take you put like a classic game
In there but have it play completely different
Oh I love that idea
Well that's one don't don't don't uh don't tilt
What happens I'm just saying give me an example
I like that idea
Oh that's a good one everything you know is wrong
I like that alright
It is on the list
Next up my answer my number two
Answer I've decided now I thought about
What games do I really want to see
What do I want to see people make
And the game I would like to see the
VOG faithful create
Is I want to see them make a game called
Or involving
Jamie joins the circus
What?
Jamie joins the circus
What?
No
But circuses are fun
It could be a freak show
I'm afraid of clowns
Oh that's a good tidbit to know
So maybe Jamie joins the circus
To eliminate the clowns who knows
They just need to die
Alright there it is Jamie joins the circus
My number two answer and now it is on the board
Alright DarkSakura
What is your number two answer
MS Paint
MS Paint
Okay oh boy
I fear what might happen if uh
MS Paint
I will also throw Corell Dral in there
As long as it's the 16
Color lack of tablet
Poor drawing
Alright
It's MS Paint
MS Paint or Corell Draw I like that one
Alright it is on the list this is gonna be hard for the
Elimination round tonight this is gonna be so hard
Alright uh here we go
Number one answers from everybody
Here it is
The last one to put on the list Bobby Blackwolf
I'm torn between two
Cause I wrote down a bunch
But I'm gonna go ahead and say
Programmer Art
Programmer Art
That's almost like MS Paint
But it's a little bit better than MS Paint
Almost
But is it?
It's just different I guess
Alright
Programmer Art
Alright the number one answer from Loki
What is it
See I had two thoughts on this
And one thought though is if I did that
That that might win
And I don't want that to win actually
But I just would like to
I'll keep that as an honorable mention I guess
But um I'll just stick with also one of the ones
That came up on the random generator
Unwanted Powers
Unwanted Powers
Would that be about the Sony Network TV show coming soon?
It could be
It could be alright
We're gonna add that to the list
Unwanted Powers there it is
Alright my number one answer
You know what you guys enjoyed the Jamie Joins the Circus
Answer so much
I thought we would do another one
Involving some VoG personalities
And so my number one answer tonight
Bobby and the Banhammer
Is my number one answer
What no reaction from Bobby?
That's Flappy VoG right?
It could be
No submitting Flappy VoG though
Alright there it is on the list
Bobby and the Banhammer
Alright here we go
Dark Sacra
Last chance for people to have their items on the list
Dark Sacra what is your number one answer?
Ink
Ink
Alright you've got a very designed mindset tonight
Ink is your final answer
I do because I like to challenge people to think outside of
I want to
Ink
Specifically black ink
Excuse me
So do you want to know my
Answer that I've
Forgone
What was that?
Oh my god
How did we not get President Cat on the list?
Because it would win
I don't want it to win
You don't want it to be that easy
Bonus points for throwing in President Cat
Bonus points for any
You know what though? You could do
President Cat for any of these other things
Yeah I was going to say even though this isn't graded
Bonus points to
Any OLR, Bobby or
VoG references that you work into these games
I mean like think of something vague
Like three colors of typography
You could totally do like a President Cat game out of that
Alright
You want to know some of my honorable mentions that I threw out?
So I also
And I actually used the same random theme generator
Just because I just clicked it like a thousand times
And picked out my favorites
Losing to win
Delayed reaction
Please enter your name
And recurring dream
And then actually the buggy game
Was the other one
Oh funny
Alright so here it is and be thinking about
What is going to be eliminated because it's going to
Happen it's got to happen it's part of the process
Y'all the elimination round here is the list as it stands
Right now
Drums or drumming? Know when to quit
Program or art?
A buggy game
Strong, unwanted powers
Three colors
Jamie joins the circus
Bobby and the ban hammer
Typography, MS Paint or Corel Draw
And black ink
Alright
Here it is the part none of us want to do
But we have to it's science people
It's science
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
Bobby Black Wolf
You know when I'm looking at these
I'm trying to get something that's
Not so straight
Like a game jam a good game jam theme shouldn't
Be something that's so straight forward
Or so linear
You know like where it really constrains
People so I am going to eliminate Jamie
Going to the circus
Thank you but now I have to think of another one
Oh come on you could have done like
Just a regular circus theme
Or something and just put Jamie as a character
In it that would have been easy
Easy come on they did
Circus on the Atari 2600 boo
Alright whatever
It is stricken from the list
And you're a jerk alright
Loki you're next
Which of these is not worthy of the list?
Only because I'm not creative enough right now
To understand how I'd even incorporate
This in there I'm sorry Jamie
I'm gonna have to take off typography
Oh typography
And there's some concepts are beyond people
Hey I'm fine with that
You know I gotta admit
I kinda wanted to do like a text adventure
Typography is a tricky one Jamie
It's a tricky one
I will tell you though I did have an idea
Of making a game
Where the landscape is made out of text
Okay
Actual words
Well you could do it in three colors
Or one of these other ones we'll see
That's okay I'm probably gonna stick with my first idea
Alright cool
For now though we've got to eliminate
A couple more from the list oh shit it's my turn
And I have to ask myself which of these
Is not worthy of the list
Um I am going to
Eliminate I'm gonna take a
I'm gonna do a revenge strike on Bobby
And I'm gonna take off one of his answers
Cause again this is one of those ones
Like most of these I instantly had an idea
In my mind but I couldn't think
Of one for programmer art
I'm sorry I have to eliminate that from the list Bobby
I'm okay with that
But we're gonna call that a revenge vote
Alright what do we have left
What do we have left Dark Soccer wants to know what's left
Loki has a fully intact list
But Loki's list is a buggy game
Everything you know is wrong and unwanted powers
And we also have drums or drumming
No when to quit
Three colors, Bobby and the band hammer
MS Paint or Corel Draw
And black ink
I actually
Am gonna go with everything you know is wrong
Just because that Weird Al song is stuck in my head
And I would make
I would make a Weird Al game
And I would be so distracted so
Alright well this
You know what
The list worked out alright
This is the nice politically correct
Positivity list because each
Person had one answer removed
That's the way we like to see it happen
So there it is
It is now up to you guys
How many people can say they've had their answer removed because of Weird Al?
Same
Well for me about that is that there's actually a game
That's done by some local Georgia developers
Who once it comes out I'm gonna have them on my show
It's called Default Dan
And the entire premise of the game
Is that it looks like Mario except
The enemies are good and the coins
Kill you
It's basically it's everything you know is wrong
It's basically that and that's all I would be able to think of
If I was working on that theme
Alright so fair enough fair enough
And to be fair also with the programmer art
I kind of thought it was really similar to the MS Paint answer
And it hit some points out in chat too
That makes me think about another idea that I did have to suggest
What's that? Power down
If you want to see a perfect example of programmer art
Check out this week's Cooking with Unity
This on Monday
They made a snowman
Out of primitives in Unity
That is programmer art right there
Alright well it is in your hands now folks
It is answerable
You may submit your answers now
Place your votes now
You can vote for your number 1 is your first click
And your number 2 is your second click answer
Your votes are weighted
Number 1 gets more points than number 2
So vote now at live.vognetwork.com
And a little later in the show we're going to tabulate it up
And reveal the big theme
For the first VoG game jam
I'm excited I think
I think some people's heads are turning already about some of these
In fact I think some people are going to be pissed if one of these doesn't win
I'm just
I'm excited I can't wait
But again if the theme you like doesn't win
I still think you get bonus points
For incorporating two or more of these
Into your jam or any other long running joke
So get creative people
Get creative
Alright Bobby before I let you go anything else you want to add to this?
No good luck
And I look forward to playing everybody's game
Alright me too I look forward to it
Bobby I wish you were here to eat latkes with us
I wish I was there too
I'll throw one at you
Yes I'm throwing you some applesauce right now
Thanks guys
Bye my friend take care
Alright part 2 of this list was to come up
Shortly in the show
Place your votes now
Please vote or die
Meanwhile we've got some more segments to get back to
Including the mail bag
So Dark Sakura is going to dive into the mail bag
She's going to find some emails that she believes are worthy of reading
So do my favorite Eddie Izzard quote
It's a little sticky
Alright
We have a email
A email one singular email
One
Alright
Or as I learned recently
The way to say it in Hebrew is echad
Alright
Fair enough
Hi OLR I wanted to give kudos to the nice
Bunch of guest talks you've had in recent shows
They were very fun and informative
If I may I would like to suggest
Someone to interview on the show
YouTube personality
Ryan Letourneau
Aka Northern Lion
He's Canadian that's all you need to know
Sign him on and an email
Anyway Ryan is best known for his long running
Play series of The Binding of Isaac
Though he has played through some other
Notably difficult games such as Europa
Universalis 4
Spelunky FTL
And XCOM Enemy Unknown
On top of that he hosts
Live streams with friends a few times a week
And also offers quick impressions on games
That have just released or are still in the works
Typically more with indies than AAA games
I think it would be interesting to know
What it's like for Ryan to play video games
To entertain others for a living
When did it seem
Viable to attempt this
And how risky was it to try
What sort of difficulties has he faced nowadays
Why don't you just interview him dude
Interview him for us
And send us the recording
Has he faced any criticism
Over his livelihood were there any unwelcome surprises
Or cool perks to have come up since he began
What would he recommend to others
Who want to start their own channel
Yeah I bet he'd answer these questions if he emailed him
But in all seriousness
I appreciate the referral
At first I was like well there's a lot of people that do let's play videos
What makes
Kind of what I didn't get from this
Email was what makes this guy
Unique
Why do you want this particular individual on the show
Because I don't know the guy
He sounds like you really like him
I'm just curious like what it is
That really makes this guy unique
But then I did hear in the email
It appears he makes a living off doing this
So that is unique not everybody can do that
So this guy's doing something right
Well there's more to the email
These are just some things I'm curious about
And I'm sure OLR can come up with
Other interesting questions given the opportunity
Even if Ryan doesn't get on the show
I want to give my thanks for having my suggestion
Read on air
Or can I just bribe you all three
You like bribes involving tacos right
That'll work but latkes are kind of winning me over tonight
From the nasty canasta
We need to bust into that pie
We need to have a new segment just called pie
We do need to bust into that pie
Let's make it happen
We are done with late emails
It's going to be a celebratory pie
For when we have our
VOG game jam theme determined
Which by the way now is the time where I say
Last call for listless votes
Get your butt logged into the site
And vote
Last call for those votes
Alright
Let's get to the FUs of the week
It's after the mailbag segment
You have to give your FU
DarkSakura your FUs of the week
Um
FU to the lingering bits of the plague
That I had last week
That make my lungs hurt
Getting out of my wonderful codeine syrup
And um
FU to not having a
Tron pinball table
Those are pretty rad
I played one a couple days ago
Nice
I saw on Facebook
I saw them just for you Rob
I was wondering where the hell you were that had a table
It was a private party right
Why wasn't I invited
It's a private party
I'm awesome
And then we went to the pinball party
I know like 20 people that work at little cat
Why wasn't I invited
I should have been somebody's date
Next year you'll be my plus 2
Awesome
Loki your FU of the week
Um
Just to go back to what I was saying before
FU to telltale games for
I'm sorry not telltale
Travelers tales
Fuck them
For their really shitty flight controls
And lego marvel super heroes
I swear to god
That game would have been awesome
But that right there kind of really pisses
Me off
Thankfully the races
Because it's a game meant for kids
Are really fucking easy
Uh the driving races
But uh yeah fuck those flight controls
They're fucking terrible
Alright my FU of the week
First one goes to the fact that I wasn't invited to the low cap party
No
The second FU of the week is the fact that
Of um
Of all the trainers in our company
All of them
I'm the only one that has to work next week
And I have a class
Monday Tuesday
No not Wednesday
Monday Tuesday next week
I have to teach and then I have to teach the next week too
Every day that isn't technically a holiday
With the new year involved
But you know what at least I like my job
But still it always sucks when you have to work
So that's awesome
Dar soccer is complaining that she has to work on Christmas
But you're Jewish
Alright
Alright anyway they can't hear you
You're not on mic
She's too busy slicing up this amazing pie
That I can't wait to dig into
So let's do a couple more stories
Then we're going to reveal the listless winner
And then we're going to get into your calls
So let's do it
Uh Loki
So Humble Bundle everybody is pretty much familiar with that website
The process behind it
You buy a game for whatever price you want
And part of that money goes to charities
And part of it goes to devs
And Humble Tip and all that fun stuff
Well they've raised a lot of money since launching that site
Back in May 2010
Over 50 million dollars
For charity since that first sale
And they've even
Raised was it 100 million dollars
Towards developers
So that's pretty awesome
And um
They're saying the very first Humble Bundle
Raised $400,000 for charity
$200,000 each for
EFF and Child's Play
And um
Just
That's just amazing
All this money going to these awesome charities
And um
Hell even
They're not the only site out there now
Now they have all these other bundles that go to
Different charities
I'm kind of curious to see how much money
You know sites are kind of injecting
To these great causes
So uh awesome
Although I gotta say though
I'm starting to run out of gains
To purchase on their site because
A lot of them seem to be repeating
And I have a lot of leftover Steam keys
I don't need anymore copies of Fez
Please no more copies of Fez
Alright
And one more story I have for you guys
And this is
This is tough to report on
But in the same way it shows the
Good side of the gaming community
And the last official news story
I wanted to have because you know it's
Been kind of a rough year in some ways in the gaming
World and there's been a lot of
Very heated
Intense and sometimes
Downright personal debate that's been going
On out there so I like
It when gamers can band together for something
That's good
And um
Unfortunately the situation is awful
The situation is not so good
And uh it has to do with Final Fantasy
14 but I just want to say
Because I know you're all going to go fanboy
But hold on I'd be reporting on this even if it wasn't
Final Fantasy 14 this is just kind of the first
Big case that we've seen in Final Fantasy
14 and this has to do with a
Reddit post that was posted on the Final Fantasy
Subreddit last night where
A free company leader
Put a new permanent rank on a friend
That they were informed was going to be
Passing away literally within
Hours and there was a little
Screenshot that was posted over to Imgur
That noted that
Codex Valda
And I hope I said that name right Codex Valda
Would be the immortal siren in this
Particular free company
And that alone
Is pretty cool but what really happened next
Was really amazing and
You know the player
Behind the character
Only 29 years old
And passed away the other night
Codex unfortunately he did pass away due to
Complications from renal failure which is another
Word for kidney failure
And it was one of those things where they knew
He needed a new kidney and it was
Kind of a surprise that this happened
I mean because
Yeah they had like a donor lined up
You know this was just one of those
And I think they even said one in a
Million situations where unfortunately
It was that one in a million
So Codex did unfortunately
Pass away but the side of this
Is good I mean that part's obviously not good
And very tragic but the side of this
That's really great is that
This really just created this
Spontaneous outpouring of
Support in the game and it started with
One or two people just kneeling
With their characters in front of the house
And staying logged in and kneeling
And then that slowly grew on the Gilgamesh
Server too I think they said it was up to 80 people
At one point and more and then it was spilling
Onto other servers in the same
Housing district people kneeling and being respectful
And I saw some people
Took out their fairies as scholars
And actually spelled out the guy's name
Codex with their fairies as a bit
Of a tribute and I just thought
You know I was like this is
The type of stuff why
I love games and why
I love MMOs was that the community
You know put all their shit aside
About you know so and so doesn't heal
Fast enough in a dungeon or whatever put all
That stuff aside to take a moment out
To recognize one of
Their own community that was gone way too
Soon and I just you know and this this story
Has been gaining a lot of steam on like you know
Kotaku did a story on it and so it's
Spreading to other places as well and I just
Thought this is a great example
Of the community recognizing
One of their own and I do hope the final fantasy
14 developers I know they're busy with the
Japanese fan fest right now I hope the
14 developers kind of notice this and maybe
Will consider doing an NPC
Tribute and I realize you can't
Do a tribute for each and every person
That played final fantasy 14
That happens to pass away
Just like they can't do that in wow or whatever
But for particularly invested people
And for particularly people
That seems very tied into the community
Where the community sort of you know
Spontaneously comes together for something
Like this I really hope that the 14 developers
Do some type of official
Recognition of support for codex
And you know
I'm so sorry for codex's friends
And families that this happened but
Just know that there are literally
Hundreds and thousands
And thousands now of
People who are remembering this
Particular player because you know
What we all love this game as
Well anyway
Let's see fifth dream in chat says there was a
Get together tonight on mcgarthomer I put off some
Fireworks I'm very sad I missed it
I had to do this show though but I'm glad
I could at least mention it on the show
Act F says the gaming community
Can be amazing when it tries to
And dungeon buster says indeed
And I think that is a fantastic note
To end on but I do want to point
Out as joan under matt also says the guy's real
Name was ty I have a friend who
Played games with him for several years
So a moment of
Silence please for codex
Alright let's
Open up our skype line over at
1877 game olr or
username on skype orange lounge radio
And we will take your calls on
Anything you would like to talk about
That we've talked about tonight or tabulate
The winner yet I was just going to say or perhaps
You want to call us to tell us about what you're
Going to do for
The game jam
Theme that's right guys it is time
To reveal the official
Winner
Of tonight's game jam
So here it is the
Theme for the game jam I'm just waiting
For it to pop in right now the votes
Are being tabulated right now
And we're going to reveal the winner
And we're actually going to I'm going to go ahead and reveal
What got really close and
Didn't quite make it I'm going to reveal that
As well so I'm just waiting
For those answers to pop in
Which they should any minute
Oh this is embarrassing do I have to reload
Maybe I do
This all is automated
Behind the scenes
No I don't want you to resend data that you already
Hold on I'm going to try this one more time
I think I remember something about you have to be on the page
For a minute before it pops in
I might need to
Actually make it live
Set it on fire
Uh oh
Did you break it? No I didn't break it
Hold on I'm going to try making it live again
Just not answer but we'll see if that fixes it
It's been so long since I've done this
That I forget how to make it show me the
I just I know what the winner was
New theme everything's broken
Hey a buggy game wins
I do know which one was on top
But I was hoping to name the other two as well
Bobby says I broke it
Re-check answerable I think
Alright we're going to make this answerable again
Hold on
Let's see what happens
This is going to be so funny you guys
There it is fine
It's going to be so funny
Number three answer
The number three theme
Just missed it, missed it by that much
MS Paint or Corel Draw
Very close
Number two answer
Bobby and the Ban Hammer
Missed it by that much
And the number one
The winner this
Year or maybe we'll do this every six months
Who knows
This first
VOG game jam's theme will be
And how appropriate
A buggy game
Is the winner
A buggy game is going to be the theme
There it is
A buggy game
The theme for the first ever
VOG game jam
How appropriate when I broke
The whole fucking website trying to see the answer
So there it is
Alright
Thank you everybody for voting and participating
Wait to see what you guys
Come up with and again
Just especially after the rant
I went on earlier this evening
And everything else that's been going on in the gaming industry
I think this is a perfect fit, I really do
A buggy game
Yeah, new earth defense force game
Oh is that, that's what you
Really wanted
That was your way of getting copyright in there without it
Alright
Nice
You can't copyright killing chain insects
Alright
I would never do that, maybe
Alright, anyhow
Let's see, and some folks talking
About what they were going to do for Bobby and the
Banhammer, Act F says
A card game similar to Cards Against Humanity
But trying to get a card
Or comment to get you banned
Oh man, we should
I should have let people submit for the top
Three, that would have been awesome to see, but we'll see
Alright, a buggy game
There it is
Chat says, all the bugs
And Hitstun says, I hope you guys like
Exploitable game mechanics
Yeah, that's going to be hard programming that in
But, we'll see
I don't know, when I hear
A buggy game, I think of
Like, actual bugs
Like, why can't a buggy game be like
Why can't it be Frog Fractions?
Is this Frog Fractions 2?
This was all a ruse for Frog Fractions 2
Oops
Alright, I'm kidding, I'm kidding
So there we go
VXJ6V says, number 2 can be done in the spring
Well, you know what? It depends on
How the participation level is
This time, so again, when you're finished
With your theme of
A buggy game
You're going to submit that to Jam
At OrangeLoungeRadio.com
The deadline is January 11th
Not that I'm going to stop you from
Submitting after that date
And I don't think Bobby would be opposed to
Putting things on the site that come in after the date
However, if you want to earn one of the participation
Prizes, if you want to earn one of the loot
And you want to earn that official recognition
You've got to be done by January
11th. Get to work
A buggy game
Alright, once again, the Skype line is open
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype
OrangeLoungeRadio
Last minute stories, Loki?
Oh, I haven't even been looking
You're too excited about the buggy game
I've seen some good examples
Of some really funny buggy ideas
Like another game jam didn't do this
Did they?
I don't think so, but no
I still like to think, even if another game jam
Did it, we would still be the first
That says, you can create
Anything, you're not limited to
Unity, you can do anything
You want. Yeah, usually game jams
Will be like, you program it
You can use Unity, you can use whatever
But it has to be a program
You can't just make a card game
Or a board game, or whatever
No, I've seen some good examples
Of just, usually in the
Unity subreddit
Where they'll be showing
There's this one guy who actually does
A lot of development on there
He posts updates and stuff
Of things he's working on
And the last couple of ones that he put up there
Is some bugs that he had in the game
That he coded something slightly wrong
And it was a hilarious result
Kind of gives me ideas
Alright, well our phone lines
Are not really lighting up
So, here's me stretching
Trying to fill time
Let me go to the Twitter
I'm trying to eat this pie, you guys are making me
Fill time, I'm not able to eat this pie
This upsets me
Anyway, I'm going to go to Twitter
Yeah, tweet the thing
Let's see, Eric RPG
Sent a tweet with a link
Let me pull up this link and see what this is all about
Again, if you want to call us on Skype
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
Or our telephone number
1-877-GAME-OLR
Let's see
We got sent a story by Eric RPG
To a story on
Siliconera, which says
Queen Victoria blasts through Martian mines
In Rock Boshers DX
On PS4 and PS Vita
So this is a game
That has, I guess, cross-buy
And cross-save support
A 10-stick puzzle shooter set on Mars
Starring Queen Victoria
That is pretty fucking random
But I like that, I like games that are really random
It stylizes
If you were playing it on a ZX Spectrum
I like stylistic games
That's really cool
Alright, now our phones are lighting up, it was just a little delayed
Let's get to it
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey guys, it's Jason
Hey Jason, wow, are you at the office?
I was going to say, that's a huge background back there
Oh my gosh, I didn't realize you were back in San Francisco
When are you coming to visit?
That's a good question
I've actually been super busy
Obviously, I haven't been talking about it with you at all
I understand, I understand
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
There was a topic that you guys were talking about earlier
And Go figured that as soon as I
Clicked, I hit
A hit call, the particular topic
Completely slipped my mind
The actual game
Oh, Tetris
Tetris, Tetris on the PS4
Like, I've been in these
Kind of conversations before, and I always
Am completely motivated to chime in
Because, like, I just
I'm not a
Full time developer, I never have been
And so, it's like, I don't
Always have the way of really explaining these things
But, being
Who I am, being the person
Knowing what I know
And being in these kinds of situations, like, I have to
Defend developers
Because
Delaying the game to get it right
Like, development
Ah
You never know what you need
Until you don't have it
You never know what you need until you've lost it
There's an old thing in IT
Where if everything works great, you don't even know
You have assisted men, it's when things go wrong
But you're, you know, breathing down their neck
Because things have to get taken care of
All of those kinds of things
Extend to development as well
Like, what was
This is maybe a bad example for Tetris
But what would have happened
What happens when any game is delayed
People don't defend developers
They jump down the throats of
Especially in the case of Tetris
This game isn't difficult
No
The design and theory and everything behind Tetris isn't difficult
But that doesn't mean that
Implementations
First game of its kind on its generation
New tools
New libraries, new engines
Yes, Tetris is a simple shaped game
But there is so much more detail
That goes into it
Which is literally what the act of development is
And it just
I just don't like deriding developers
I know I've done it myself
I just don't like deriding developers
Period
I understand that to a point, Jason
And I think sometimes when we have issues with games
A lot of times it's not even necessarily
The people working on the front lines
Who are the quote unquote problem
And I think in a case where
A game gets released buggy
Specifically like Assassin's Creed
And that whole debacle
I really think that is just pressure
Where the developers needed more time
To make it happen
And they were denied from up above
Absolutely
That is a really significantly good example
Because that was just
Blatant and absurd
The issue is, Jason
It's the same company
And now it's Tetris
And so that's showing me a pattern
And that's kind of worrisome
And I do understand that when games get delayed
Everybody gets really pissed off
But at the same time, you know, in Miyamoto
Or somebody had said this a long time ago
If a game gets delayed, if it's good
People will never remember that it was delayed
And I think to some extent
That really is true
And I know at least we here at OLR
At least I like to think so
Whatever the delay is
But after seeing so much crap like this happen
Like when The Witcher 3 got delayed a few weeks ago
It was what, like the second delay
You know what, I don't want Witcher 3 coming out
And being broken
If they have to delay it two more months to get it right
Then cool, do it
I was gonna say exactly the same thing
That Bonds did
Half-Life 2 was delayed significantly
At least two or three times
And along the way there was also the legendary
E3 hack that leaked significant
Half-Life 2 content to everybody
And you can guarantee this is why
They don't even announce Half-Life 3
They'll announce it when it
No, seriously, they're gonna announce it when it's done
And ready to go
That's why when we joke around that Gabe needs to come out
At E3 and go
Half-Life 3 is on Steam right now and drop the mic
That's no joke
That's how it's gonna fucking go down
Absolutely
Yeah, I just, it's kind of
The way that it was being presented
The way that people have learned
To talk about these kinds of incidents
That just, they're just great on me
Because, you know, blame
Blame the developers, blame the testers
They're the go-to
Because they are the face of the game
Shy of like the CEO of the company
Or something like that
But nowhere in that discussion at the start of the show
Did anything like businessy
Get discussed
It was the fault of the developers
Period when it was being discussed
And that's the kind of stuff
That's the part of it that really disappoints me
Is that that is the go-to
Vocabulary for everybody to talk about
When there's a good chance that
A ton of developers or testers
Had brought up saying
These things are problems
But for business, political
Possibly technical people
Downplaying things
Oh, three frames gone isn't bad?
Well, that person has never heard of speed running before
And knows the technical obsession
With the level that people go to
If I gave the impression that I was solely placing
Blame on the developers for the Tetris debacle
Then I apologize
But I think what I kind of meant to say
Is that the development on this game clearly wasn't finished
Whose fault is that?
Probably management's
And more so that I
It's not even really the developers that I blame
It's a lack
Of QA
And I think that's an okay thing to say
There's a complete lack of QA
Or this would have been caught
It's not something that happens on level 5
On Tuesdays
When you're maybe connected on a shoddy Comcast connection
When this happens
No, it happens to everybody
If you just play a normal game
And that's where I'm like
The funny thing is I can actually kind of see
I can envision that some of those same arguments
Happen business-wise
It's Tetris, we know this franchise
We've done it before
Why are these problems problems?
Because the tools don't remain
The same between generations
And even years
Two games of an iteration
In the same generation things can change entirely
I actually don't get so bothered by the whole
But it's Tetris, it should be easy to do
Type of argument
It's Tetris, but it's Tetris on the PS4
And there's certain expectations
Of what PS4 games should have in them
Especially with this whole
Social era we live in
And game sharing and all this stuff
There's
Hiccups are killing me
There's certain expectations
Where I don't think it's as simple as
You just put the Game Boy version of Tetris on the PS4
I think there is a certain
Greater expectation than that
I'm actually not going to be
One of those people that says, oh it's just Tetris
But I am going to say, oh it's just a
QA department
Well that's halfway there
So I guess I can give you at least that much
Alright, fair enough. Hey, you thinking about
participating in the game jam?
I
Because it doesn't have to just be
Like a classically programmed game
That opens the door for me, like I said
I've never been a full time programmer
There were a couple of concepts that did kind of cross my eye
And my number one vote
Matched the winner, so
There are definitely ideas
But with traveling back home
And all that kind of stuff, we'll see
I certainly would like to, but we'll see
I understand, well you know the golden rule is
Even if it's not the totally fleshed out game you wanted to build in Unity
Create something, dammit
Alright, Jason, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in some more calls
But take care buddy, we miss you
You too, thank you
By the way you guys, Jason has an epic fucking beard growing on his face now
I saw that beard when it was a little bit
But getting to see that on Skype via the video, that is epic
That is an epic beard he's got there
Alright
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype
Orange Lounge Radio
I'm going to leave it open for a couple minutes to see if something can get through here
I did see at least one other caller trying to get through
So I want to give them another chance to try to get through
And we will see what happens
Oh, I do see another call coming through
Let's get to it
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Let's do Zaku there
Zaku, you are really loud, get a little ways away from the mic
And tell us what's on your mind
Oh, nothing much, just celebrating
The end of my birthday
And the start of the 30s for me
Well, happy freaking birthday
My god, you're 30 years old
Yep, 30, the big 3-0
How old were you when you first started listening to this show?
Oh, I'd say about 19
Oh my god
I can't, I can't, I quit
We're done
The last OLR everybody
Have fun with that game jam
We won't be here when it's done
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding
Happy birthday, Zaku
Yep
You know what, 30s aren't as bad as everybody says it is
30s is actually kind of awesome
Everything's better
And less stupid
Everything's better
It's like Logan's run where after a certain age
The light in the palm of your hand
Blinks and you have to take that ride
Into that other magical place
Obviously
Where they kill you off at that certain point
But I digress
I guess the point is
To the young folks
I'm pretty much a dinosaur
You know, senior citizen at that point
Oh, whatever, you know what, the thing they don't realize
Is that sex is better in your 30s
TMI, I don't care
Speak for yourself
Oh wow
TMI, I don't care
I don't care
Alright, well I don't think you called in
Just to talk about your birthday
What else is on your mind, my friend?
Just catching up on the gaming
That I'm trying to do right now
Apparently
Recently
Dovetail, the folks who
You know, the folks who brought us Train Simulator
They recently released
Microsoft Flight Simulator on Steam
And apparently
As much as I, you know
The fact that I managed to jump on it a few months before
That thing was announced
It's like, whether or not
There's any life left
In that whole flight sim market
And I mean, after the
You know, the past few months
After getting hooked on it
And spending dozens of dollars on
Third party add-ons for it
Mainly like commercial airliners
I mean, is it
Is, you know, the point is
Whether or not there's still room
For something like that
Given the fact that it's almost like
Ten years removed from where
From the height of the game
Um, I think
Especially with flight sims
There's gonna kind of always be an audience
For that, you know, and they did
They just released that game on Steam
Like, just came out, but you know
If you look at Steam and the simulator
Like, okay, let me tell you
Let me tell you a little story
There's another simulator game that I see all the time
On Steam, and I'm always sitting there going
People actually play this game
And it's Farming Simulator
Is the name of the game, okay, Farming Simulator
Okay, right, and it's up there all the time
Okay, so when I'm at E3
And we're doing the whole thing where it's like
We're gonna live, you know, cover E3
Ask us questions on Twitter, da da da da da
I get a question from, like, Germany
Out of the blue, from some person
Because I posted a random picture
Of me in front of something funny
At the Farming Simulator booth, and the guy was like
You have to tell me everything about Farming Simulator
What's the game like, is it playable?
What's in the game? You gotta tell me everything about Farming Simulator
You'd be surprised, there's a lot of people that are interested in that game
Fuck, Farming Simulator, really?
It's on, like, console, Maximum Games
Is the one that's been distributing that
And I seriously talked to the guy that's the head of the company
When I was working at my old job
And he would tell me stories about
How well that game's selling
It's, like, their best-selling game
So there are people that eat that up
And look at all those other simulators that they have on Steam
There's, like, a ton of them
But, yeah, I mean, they have
DCS World, which has, like, the
Fighter jet simulator
Which is essentially, like, a chore
Not to belittle
The fact that certain flight sim
Add-ons, like, you try starting
Up a triple seven from
Dark, from cold to dark
All the way up to the point where it's taxing
I think it's, like, I need
Clip notes for that
Zaku, I think there still absolutely is an audience for Flight Simulator
I mean, you express interest in it
And you're just 30 years old
You're still young, there's still room for
Tons of Flight Simulator games
Even though maybe the audience is a little different
Is what it is
Because I remember a day when I was younger
When I was 19 years old or what have you
I remember when Flight Simulator games
Were oftentimes kind of the benchmark
For new hardware
Like, when new things would come out on PCs
It always seemed to be, like, a Flight Simulator game
Was one of the first things to come out
To really show off the graphics
And the capabilities of the systems
And I think that's changed Zaku
I think Flight Simulator games
Have turned more into people that are
Enthused about
Amateur flight or what have you
Or as the enthusiasts of the genre
Right, and the thing is
You're talking about
FSX, which is almost a decade old
That still runs on DirectX 9
Meanwhile, you have
X-Plane, the latest version
X-Plane 10, which
Apparently, it's a little slightly better
In terms of graphics, but
The only thing that's close to
You know, to actually matching
You know, a modern
The only thing close to a modern day
Flight Simulator right now is PrepR3D
And that's a professional
Version of FSX that
Lockheed Martin puts out for real pilots
But I guess
With Dovetail now at the helm
Whatever future Flight Simulator
Game they're going to make is obviously
Not going to be called Flight Simulator
But it's going to be, in essence, a spiritual
Successor of that franchise
And hopefully it will bring the graphics into
This decade of
You know, modern computing where you could
Just take advantage
Completely advantage of a modern PC
Instead of just doing everything in a single
Core, you take
You exploit multi-core
And high-end video processing
To essentially
And more importantly, 64-bit
So that you can actually
You know, you can run a game like FSX
Which is very intensive for
A ten-year-old game which is not optimized
And you could essentially run it
Like, you know, you could take advantage of new hardware
That's available today
Right
Yeah, and hopefully
As I said, it was on sale
For five bucks a couple of days ago
When it first came out
I'm kind of skeptical on getting
Re-buying it again on Steam because apparently
You can't activate your existing keys on it
You have to buy the game again
Nice
I'm not too sure, other than the fact
That you can now play online
Multiplayer again
It's a wait-and-see approach in terms of
How it will actually
Perform with the existing
Third-party add-ons that I have on it
Well, you know, I do
I do want to see the game in motion
I hope some people are livestreaming it
Because I do want to see, I haven't really looked at a
Flight simulator game in a while and I bet
I bet they're still very
Pretty to look at and so forth
Yeah, if you tweak the
I mean, with FSX right now
You could definitely tweak a lot of the files
There are many ways to make it look good on
On modern PCs for
For almost a ten-year-old game
Even like DirectX 10, which wasn't
Officially supported, it was a preview
Back then, there are plugins that allow you to fix
The DirectX 10 issues
That were rampant in FSX
And essentially looks a lot better than
Than running it on, you know,
DX9
I guess there has been folks
Streaming on Twitch for
FSX, but until I get a new
Video card that allows me to stream through
Nvidia, I'm probably gonna
Yeah, it'll be a while before I
Do any livestreaming of that
Fair enough, alright my friend, I gotta let you go
But thank you for the FYI, Flight Simulators
They're out there, check them out
Alright, take care my friend
Have a good one, you too, bye
And congrats on hitting 30
Even though you've been listening to this show since you were 19
Which means I'm
Also that old
Alright, Rob
What? Deal with it
No, actually, you know, and like
I told Zaku, actually my 30s have been
Pretty fucking awesome, and considering the fact
That I had, uh
You know, I was really, really sick when I was 29
It actually made me very thankful to turn 30
So, you know, alright
1877 game OLR, username on
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, now the phones are
Lighting up, they were slow earlier, but now it's
They just fill right up
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
Uh, this is YYR
Hi Aaron, how are you?
Hey YYR, how you doing?
Well, I'm
Trying to formulate an idea
For this new game jam
Thing that we've all laid out
Tonight
So far the best idea I have
Going off Jason's
Phone call a little bit ago
Was, uh, come up with
A plan to develop
A game in five weeks
Yeah
And don't test it
And then release it
I mean, it works for Ubisoft, right?
That's right, so the game
It's gonna be meta, it's gonna be a game about
Making a game
Uh, oh, well
Well now we have another thing entirely
No, he's saying basically
To develop a game, don't test it
Okay, I thought that was his idea
Okay, in the game you're gonna make a game
Okay, nevermind, I was going too meta with it
Okay, I get it
Wow, you're really thinking about this
I am, I am, well you know what, there's a part of me
Not that I want to give away everything I'm doing
But I'm actually thinking of going with the very literal
Interpretation of the word and doing a game about
Bugs
Not giving Loki
Not giving Loki his Earth Defense Force game
But I don't see why you can't do a game about bugs
Well, I mean, I'll admit
You know, as soon as the theme was chosen
I turned to my fiance
Sitting on the couch next to me and I said
Alright, let's do something with spiders
But, uh, I don't know if I'm
Actually gonna go with spiders
I just, I would
Love to do something that was both figurative
And literal
I also don't want to go beyond my
Means, you know, one
Person, three weeks
And a keyboard
I mean, basically though
Three weeks does sound like a lot
I'll warn anybody, I mean
First of all, I want to super encourage
Everyone, as many people as
Possible to get in on this
But I also want to warn people that
Game development really is
A time sink, it will take
Longer than you would expect to do
Well, pretty much anything
So don't wait for
Two and a half weeks and then say
Alright, yeah, let's throw something to get now
The way I figure it's always three times longer
So just plan something for a week
And it'll take you three weeks
Also, one big reason
We're starting it now is that we know a lot of people
Have time off for the holidays
Now granted, a lot of you spend time with family
But there's also a lot of you that have a lot of free time right now
So we really want to start it before the holidays
And then run it really all the way through
The holiday period, so
Yeah, this is probably the best time of year to do it
I think, I mean, any time's a great time
To develop a game, but this is probably
As good as we could do as far as
Time for everyone
Absolutely, as many of you guys
Listening as possible, whether you're
Listening live on the podcast, anything
Go ahead and make something, because
You're going to enjoy it
I think you will
And some folks in chat saying
Let's see, they're talking about the meaning of the word bugs
And Darth Tetsuya says, so you can do a game about
Bugs, that I think I can work with
However you interpret the rules
You can do anything you want
Around that theme of buggy game
How do you interpret that?
Because, I don't know, maybe you want to do a game about
Amish people and have it be about a horse and buggy
You could do it!
You know, SSJ100 Matt did bring
That up earlier in chat
Amish Racer 2000
Why not? Come on
You could do a game with horses and buggies
Look, I just gave somebody a concept right there
Alright, now I've got to think of something new
Perfect
Alright, well YYRA, I'm so excited
I think we're done here
I'm so excited to see what you come up with
Alright
I'm sorry, you've broken up a little bit, what happened?
I just wanted to say I am so excited to see what you come up with
Oh, yeah, well I'm excited too
Because I'll tell you, at this point my slate is blank
I really have no idea
I'm with you
You have just as much of an idea as I do
Alright
Well, I've got to think too
I will come up with something
Me too, I think I know how I'm going to do it
I just need to know what story I'm going to tell, so we'll see
Alright
I've got some serious thought into this over the next day or two
Alright, good luck my friend, take care
I'm very excited, and I'm looking forward to
what everyone else puts out as well
So, yeah, pick up your keyboards
or game controllers or whatever you're using
and get cracking, this is going to be great
Do it, create something dammit
Yup
Alright, take care my friend
Enjoy your weekend, your holidays
and everything else
You too
Take care, bye
I know I'm going to enjoy the rest of those latkes
that are sitting over there waiting for me to eat
I'm so excited
Alright, oh man, you filled me so, like even Alan
messaged me earlier, do I even need to make dinner tonight
or have you pretty much filled up on crap
and I'm like, I filled up on crap
but it was really good crap
I'm taking some of the cookies with me
unless Becky has some when I get to our house
Alright, well
I do want to thank everybody
who called in tonight, if you did not call in
and you were trying to get in
and you didn't get through, I'm very sorry
but you will just need to
send us an email, participate at
orangelaunchedredo.com or you can send us a tweet
or what have you, but really this week guys
it's time to get working
on your games, create something dammit
in the first VOG game jam
your forum is apparently already up Loki
so for people to discuss
Yeah, I posted even there's some
tools that I found on one of these
game jam tip sites, so I
just copied and pasted that
Awesome, awesome, I'm really gonna
try to spend time to do this
I'm the type that will procrastinate
Come up with an idea quick
because that could take a while
It could, it could, alright well
that is about gonna do it, Loki checking in
with you for any last minute stories
Alright, well then
that brings us to the end of the show
Thank you guys so much for listening
Thank you for supporting independent radio
All we ask
you know, tell a friend or two about the show
you know, we don't have this big budget
we're not IGN
we can't put a big video out there that everybody sees
of our buggy Tetris experience, we can only
tell you about it, so please
tell a friend or five about the show and help spread the word
about independent broadcasting, and most of all
support independent broadcasting
there's so many hard working people
out there creating amazing
content, I was gonna mention this real quick
as soon as I
as I'm in my outro, a buggy podcast
No, sorry
It's kinda cool, there's a British company
apparently Liberty Games that made
a pinball table that's an
internet meme pinball table
it has a bunch of internet memes in there
Oh, that's awesome, it looks pretty sweet
like Grumpy Cat, it's a real, yeah
Grumpy Cat, Fry, you know
all that stuff, yeah
I wanna play that, that sounds awesome
Ah, that could've been the theme, internet memes
Ah, yeah, that would've been
Oh well, next time, the sequel
the sequel, you guys have to make this
first game jam, so awesome that we do another one
Alright, it's time to go around and get everybody's
final thought, again, a big
happy holidays to all you guys out there listening
out there in podcast land
and thanks for spending some time
with us during the week, and
please consider leaving a nice review for the show
a five star review on iTunes or a five star
review on Stitcher Radio or wherever you found this
show goes an awful long way, thank you
so much, Dar Soccer
your final thought tonight
Uhhhh
No, no
Alright, Loki, your final thought tonight
I gotta get working on my game, I guess
Alright, get cracking, get cracking
and my final thought tonight is
create something, dammit
I can't wait to see what you all put together
Have a wonderful week everybody, happy gaming
