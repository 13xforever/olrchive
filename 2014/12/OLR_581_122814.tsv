7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	28000	This week brings 2014 to a close as we discuss the holiday events and look back with our annual year of gaming retrospective. We'd also like to hear what games you've played most this year, new, old, or revisited. We'll take your comments and calls to help us close out 2014 right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	48000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on December the 28th of 2014 with the 581st episode of our show. That's right, we're here.
48000	63000	I know a lot of folks are taking off for the holidays and to be fair they earned it, but the way the days fell this year we were able to bring you a show this week. So why not? We're here tonight. Myself, Rob Robertson, here in studio with me. As always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
63000	71000	Hi. How are you? Full. Full? Yes, we did a little bit of our belated Christmas tradition this year. Our Gay Jumis.
72000	89000	So for the past couple years, DarkSakura, myself, and Alan on Christmas will go have Chinese food. Or Pho. We'll have some in Asian. Whatever's open, people. Whatever's open, we will go have it. But DarkSakura ended up, even though our Christmas plans got canceled. Can you believe that?
89000	101000	Like, I know as a kid your parents always threatened to cancel Christmas if you're naughty, but Alan and I actually had a canceled Christmas this year. No Christmas for you. No Christmas. I don't feel too bad, guys. We made the most of it. I worked.
101000	112000	Yeah, I know. You don't want to talk about Christmas being canceled. But you're Jewish, so, I mean, what's the big deal, right? Jews like Christmas. Why not?
112000	123000	No, um, LoCat was open because of people getting their shiny new toys. Sure, of course. And there are a lot of hardworking people on Christmas. And they fed us. And it was slow. So it was awesome.
123000	138000	We took Shane, who is having his first Christmas not with his family. So we took him to the movies. Really, it was taking me to the movies because finally I got to see Mockingjay. Finally. I want to go. I'll go again. It was so good.
138000	150000	I still need to watch the other movies, but I've read the books. I was not expecting Mockingjay to be that good because it's the worst book. But the movie was really good. So, yay! Yes, there's that.
150000	162000	So, um, but you're not, now, even though you're Jewish and we talk about celebrating Christmas together, you're not one of those Jewish folks that gets super offended like that guy on that plane did in the news.
162000	166000	That's not you.
166000	177000	I just don't like to, I will, I had a few people antsy with me and say, well, I'd say, well, happy holidays and say, well, Merry Christmas. I'll be like to you too.
177000	193000	But honestly, I, I spoke with a good number of perfectly nice Jewish people and I wish them a happy post Hanukkah and nobody was fussy. It was really nice.
193000	210000	My mom didn't preach at me this year. Um, but I would like to just say that I want my family members to stop having strokes, heart attacks, jaundice, or other inflammations of their internal organs that send them to the hospital because no.
210000	217000	You poor thing. I mean, families should be together during the holidays to fight as good families do. That's what happens.
217000	218000	Not in the hospital.
219000	230000	All right. Anyhow. Well, um, I, I, we're looking at the turning of a new page, uh, coming up here in the new week, a happy new year in advance to everybody out there. Everybody celebrates new years, right?
230000	242000	Well, I guess, no, in some cultures, your new years might come a little later, but with all due respect, I hope everybody has a happy new year this next week and looks forward to the page turn that's coming.
242000	253000	And tonight here on OLR, we're going to look back on, uh, 2014 and next week we'll do a little more looking ahead 2015. Uh, but we couldn't do it without the one and only also joining us as studio tech master.
253000	263000	Loki. Hello. How are you doing? Loki. I'm pretty good. Yeah. How was your holiday? You guys do celebrate Christmas even though your wife is Jewish, right? So you kind of do, you could do both. You do everything this holiday, right?
263000	273000	Pretty much. Yeah. Nice. That's the way to do it. How was it? Um, it was okay. We just, you know, I had to put together a trampoline then Christmas Eve.
273000	283000	What was up with that? I saw these pictures on Facebook. This, this like, it looks like a prison. It looks like a prison for children that you send them to and they're naughty, but that's not what it was. Right?
283000	289000	It's just a safe trampoline. It's a happy prison. It's a fun prison. It's a bouncy prison. Exactly.
290000	300000	But so, so that's what they do now. They put trample, they put cages on trampolines to make sure the kids don't bounce out. Yeah. So you don't, you know, die or something. Oh my gosh. See, when I was younger, we had a trampoline.
300000	315000	My mom bought a little trampoline because I don't know, back in that day it was supposed to be good for fitness or something like that. I guess maybe it still is, but, uh, we had a little trampoline and the way I learned not to jump off the trampoline is that the first time I did it, I hurt myself.
315000	328000	That taught me to never do it again. It doesn't work that way these days, huh? Um, no, I mean, and they don't even have like springs anymore. It's all, um, like nylon cords that they have and stuff.
328000	344000	So, but it's just a pain in the ass because their instructions aren't entirely clear. And so, you know, they don't stress like the importance of, okay, hey, you know, make sure that this doesn't shift slightly while you're putting it together because you'll end up with what happened the first time around where,
344000	354000	I got it all put together and look, hey, look, the door shifted slightly to where now it's right in front of a pole. I'm like, thanks. I had to take it all apart and do it again.
354000	368000	Is that how, like when I build the new shelf from Ikea, I realized that one of the wood pieces I put on backwards and now you have the unsightly side facing outwards is like, son of a, so I guess it's similar type of thing, right?
368000	387000	But I'm sure, uh, I'm sure the kids loved it traveling. Yeah. Josh loves it. So he's been playing that. And then, um, you know, other than that, um, I only went over to my mom's house and they did, you know, kind of Christmas there and stuff and got more toys and pretty much it.
388000	398000	All right. Well, uh, how are you guys doing in our chat room? Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network www.vog network.com vognetwork.com.
398000	407000	Uh, six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern is when we are alive on Sunday nights immediately following the Bobby Blackwell show and a quick programming note for you guys.
408000	420000	Uh, Bobby was, uh, had a prerecorded show tonight because, uh, as you guys know, if you've listened to the show, he does this whole, um, he does this whole thing with the NFL and, and drumming for his local team, uh, the Falcons.
420000	433000	So they actually had a game tonight, uh, that kind of came out of the blue. So he had a, well, they can flex game. I don't even know how this all works because I follow football so terribly, but I guess they can change the schedule of games at the last minutes to accommodate probably what's on TV and all that stuff.
433000	445000	So, uh, they did that. So he ended up having to pre tape a show tonight, so he wasn't live and he was a little worried that, uh, they, he wasn't going to be live next week, but the good news is the Falcons lost.
445000	456000	So he will be live next week. Um, but I suppose the bad news for some people would also be the Falcons lost. And maybe that, maybe that's actually bad news for Bobby because that might be like he wouldn't get paid for a game that doesn't happen.
456000	469000	So I guess, I guess that's too bad. So, uh, sorry to hear about the Falcons, but hey, if you are a Carolina Panthers fan, then you're having a great day. So, um, happy day to you of, of the football sports ball variety.
469000	472000	I'm glad you sported harder.
472000	480000	I'm glad you all sported very well. And if you're Bobby, I'm glad you were out there banging the drum all day. That's, that's what a lot of us aspire to do there.
481000	491000	Uh, let's see over at our chat room, over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claus says, since this is the last OLR of 2014, I'm sure you guys have a lot to look forward to in 2015.
491000	498000	You know, we will be doing predictions and all of that next week because we anticipate this is going to be a slow week for news as well coming up.
498000	508000	So we will do all of our predictions and also we're going to look back at what did we predict in 2014 that hilariously didn't come true.
508000	513000	And we're going to take a look back next week because technically there are still three days for something to happen.
513000	524000	So, you know, a lot can happen in three days. So, uh, we'll be taking a look back next week, but we will look back on 2014 a little bit this week with as far as, uh, what were our favorite games of the year and what were your favorite games of the year.
524000	526000	We'll be getting to that a little bit later.
527000	536000	Raginator schooling me a little bit in our chat room saying, not all New Year's celebrations coincide at the same time because not all cultures and religions use the same calendar.
536000	545000	That is true. That is true. So my bad if I misspoke there a little bit, but I would think most people are celebrating the change of the calendar that's coming up.
545000	552000	If nothing else, it's the one that impacts your work week. So there's something in there and paydays and all that stuff.
552000	560000	Uh, Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room also, uh, saying I had to work Christmas Day. Didn't get a single damn tech call all day.
560000	566000	Oh my gosh. Can you imagine like you, you have to work Christmas, you don't get a single customer all day long.
566000	570000	That would be, that would be great and that would be bad all at the same time.
570000	578000	And, uh, Tigerclaw summarizing the Black Wolf news there saying that's good news for the listeners, but bad news for Black Wolf. Yeah, pretty much, pretty much.
578000	587000	So, uh, I'm sure he did his very best and the reason why the Falcons lost had nothing to do with the drummers. I'm sure the drummers did just fine.
587000	594000	Alright, anyway, um, I guess, honestly, I don't have all, we're going to have a weird show tonight.
594000	598000	I mean, I fully admit that upfront because it was a very slow news week.
598000	604000	Um, no matter what it is you celebrate this time of year, the fact of the matter is most offices are closed on Thursday,
604000	608000	except, you know, those that expect customer relations and so forth.
608000	613000	But certainly the video game developers were pretty much, for the most part, all closed on Thursday.
613000	620000	Most of them Wednesday as well. So it kind of just makes, makes us that everybody was gone the majority of the week.
620000	624000	So we only have a very few things to report on this week. So I don't even have really a kickoff topic for you guys.
624000	633000	Um, but we will later on, uh, in part B, we are going to get into our top three games of 2014.
633000	641000	And the key word there is our top three games of 2014 because this time of year everybody likes to bitch and whine
641000	647000	and moan and complain about, I can't believe so and so picked XYZ as their top game of the year.
647000	653000	And I think especially this year, um, there's a lot, it's very diverse this year.
653000	660000	There's not really a clear front runner for a lot of people what's going to sweep the board for most people's games of the year.
660000	663000	Sure. Would you, Loki, would you kind of say you're noticing that to be the case too?
663000	667000	There really doesn't seem to be a front runner this year like there has been in years past.
667000	670000	I don't know. That might be for some people.
670000	671000	Yeah.
671000	673000	You know, there's, there's been some good releases this year.
673000	678000	Sure, of course. But I think there's been enough strong ones where, uh, like everybody's picking something different, you know?
678000	679000	Yeah.
679000	686000	I mean, you could say Dragon Age Inquisition is somewhat of an early front runner based on this, based on the video game awards.
686000	690000	I mean, it did win that, but that's, again, one award show out of how many.
690000	695000	So tonight we're going to be doing our top three games and, uh, they are not incorrect.
695000	698000	Our lists are correct. You know why? Because they're our lists.
698000	706000	And then we're going to open up our Skype line a little early tonight to invite you to call in to share your lists and, most importantly, why.
706000	710000	So I'll be giving more information on that when we get into part B a little later.
710000	720000	For now on the, uh, for now though, let's get into our gaming weeks and what types of games have you been playing this week with, with, uh, the time off work or the adjusted schedules as a circumstance may be.
720000	723000	What have you been playing with your week? Dark Sakura?
723000	726000	I've been staring at Bald Elves.
726000	727000	Bald Elves?
727000	728000	Bald Elves.
728000	729000	What game is that?
729000	730000	Dragon Age.
730000	732000	Oh, right. Of course. Of course.
732000	736000	Because I take solace in every party in more ways than one.
736000	738000	Are you romancing solace of all people?
738000	739000	Yes, I am.
739000	740000	Why?
740000	742000	Not the one I would have picked.
742000	747000	He makes the most sense. He's actually probably my favorite of the characters in the game.
747000	752000	Sarah is pissing me off, so I've decided not to romance her in my second playthrough.
752000	754000	My headcanon is forever solace.
754000	758000	That's all right. I wouldn't romance Garrus in Mass Effect either and that's, you know.
758000	760000	Well, they're two different kinds of characters.
760000	761000	They are.
761000	768000	I'd say that the Dragon Age character that probably would correspond most to Garrus would probably be Cullen.
768000	770000	They're a lot more alike.
770000	775000	I actually would romance Cullen, but he's not an option for a male character, so I can't.
775000	781000	But, um, I've actually been having, I've decided what it is about solace that I like.
781000	787000	Well, why other people don't like him and why I do is because he reminds me of other aspies.
789000	790000	Oh, interesting.
790000	792000	Very single-minded focus.
793000	800000	Little bit of being too blunt in public and a little bit too of a know-it-all, you know what I mean?
801000	805000	Not necessarily a know-it-all, but being very knowledgeable, trying to be helpful about it,
805000	809000	but to the point that it comes off as being a know-it-all and that's a very aspie trait.
809000	817000	So, and it's just really kind of hit a resonating familiarity with me.
817000	822000	Was that intentional about, because I really don't know, was that like an intentional parallel on Bioware's part?
822000	828000	Because I know Bioware has tried very hard to kind of diversify their games.
828000	832000	I mean, is that another sign of diversification in a Bioware title?
832000	841000	I don't know, honestly. I mean, I would have to ask, you know, the writers, but it's just the impression that I get.
841000	847000	And I've noticed that everything that people complain about him about are the same things that they complain about male aspies I know.
848000	849000	Interesting.
849000	860000	So it's just, it was sort of like the parallels came together and I was like, well, that's probably why I like the character so much because I find him more relatable.
861000	869000	But I mean, you know, just all the things that people don't like him for are the same complaints that people have about, you know, the people with Asperger's.
869000	870000	Right, right.
870000	877000	So I have, I don't, and I wasn't even thinking about it when I first decided to go to him. I was like, ooh, hot balled elf.
877000	889000	Sure. What an interesting, neat little thing to pull out of a game though. I mean, who would have thought a video game shows us that type of, you know, diversity within characters. That's so cool.
890000	899000	And, um, I've been getting back a little bit more into fractal again because I super love fractal, uh, played some transistor and I played it on a Mac.
900000	902000	Um, that's okay. Nobody's perfect.
902000	903000	You know what?
903000	904000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
904000	912000	Don't, don't listen to him, baby. You're so pretty. You're pretty and shiny and you and faster than all those other things as I pet my Mac.
912000	918000	Um, and, uh, I played a little smash on my, uh, 3DS.
918000	921000	Nice. Who's your go-to character in smash? Do you have one?
921000	922000	Villager.
922000	926000	Villager. You know, mine is surprisingly.
926000	927000	Wii Fit Trainer.
927000	936000	I love Wii Fit Trainer. I do, and I am totally the guy that will stand in the back and do the, you know, uh, what does he say? Stand the sun, or what does he say the sun?
936000	937000	Sun salutation?
937000	946000	Sun of the suns. Damn it. I can't even remember what he says. But he fires that bolt like over and over and over again. I stand in the corner and do that the whole match. And then I do little hula hooping thing.
946000	948000	And then everyone looks at you and goes, gee bitch.
948000	952000	I know, pretty much. Cause that's me and Ness. PK fire, PK fire, PK fire.
952000	962000	Uh, but, but I am really surprised. This is the character that I find that I play a lot and I'm, I, I'm not good at smash. I'm fucking terrible at smash actually.
962000	981000	But the one I'm actually okay with? Pac-Man. Of all characters. Like I really enjoy playing Pac-Man and I think I'm getting pretty decent with him. Like I'm really learning about how to like use the hydrant effectively and, and kind of, you know, using the spins of the different Namco symbols to, you know, kind of store a key at all times.
981000	991000	And most importantly, I'm really learning about how to control him because my biggest problem in smash is that I suicide off the edge way more times than I would care to admit.
991000	995000	And that's why I like Wii Fit Trainer cause I can hula hoop out of a crappy situation if I'm stupid.
995000	997000	Kirby was my go to for the longest time.
997000	1000000	Oh yeah. Cause he can, you know, kind of float around, right?
1000000	1007000	Yeah. Kirby was like my long time that, and it was kind of funny just, uh, consuming other people and pooping them out.
1008000	1023000	Um, but, uh, I did a little bit of that and I've been, um, what was the other thing that I was doing? Cause I was playing something else and I got new games thanks to Loki and thanks to you.
1023000	1028000	Yeah. We all kind of did, we all ended up trading steam games pretty much for the holidays this year.
1028000	1033000	I have gauntlet and I am bread and go to sleep. I think it was called?
1033000	1034000	Among the sleep.
1034000	1038000	Among the sleep. Yeah. Where you play as a toddler is a survival horror game featuring a toddler.
1038000	1041000	And I was like, okay, the concept is just really cool.
1041000	1045000	Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've heard of that. I haven't. Oh, I want to play that. That looks, that sounds awesome.
1045000	1050000	Yeah. It's been on my list for a few weeks. So now I've got it.
1050000	1062000	Um, let's see. Uh, actually, thanks. I, I, I got my final fantasy on in a bit. I must be a final fantasy fan boy or something because dark soccer gets me final fantasy three and final fantasy eight along with La Mulana.
1062000	1067000	But you know, the final fantasy games there. Right. And then Loki gets me final fantasy 13 too.
1067000	1073000	So I, I, I now have a copy of every final fantasy game that's out on steam and yes, I will.
1073000	1076000	I got you La Mulana cause it was $2.
1076000	1077000	I will.
1077000	1078000	You're worth $2.
1078000	1082000	I am worth $2. Thank you. Not much more, but I am worth $2.
1082000	1091000	But, uh, and, and, uh, final fantasy eight, even that I will play, even though you all know that I think it's one of the absolute worst games in the series.
1091000	1099000	In fact, I think, and I am not a popular man for this. I will probably get hate mail because of this, but I say, I don't give a fuck.
1099000	1109000	You can, you can send the hate mail all you want, but that draws on the one that reads it, that draw junction thing was the worst thing ever and single handedly ruined the game.
1109000	1121000	Uh, but final fantasy eight, which had no case story otherwise, uh, was my least favorite, but I understand one of my favorite scenes, but the PC version allows you to cheese it and just draw 99 spells every time I hear.
1121000	1126000	So that might make the game a lot more tolerable. So we'll see. I like cheesing the games. I'm gonna, I know, I know.
1126000	1131000	I loved the ballroom scene in that game. That was so pretty. And it had a good ending.
1131000	1140000	The story, the story was really good. And so I understand why the haters come at me. I totally get it because the story is really good. I will give the game that.
1140000	1150000	But I, I, I, I believe the battle system's broken. Not everybody agrees with me in that. That's fine. Uh, I just didn't like the game for those reasons.
1150000	1151000	So the game itself.
1151000	1153000	I enjoyed the story, but the game wasn't all that great.
1153000	1157000	Yeah. I'm surprised I haven't brought 12 out to like PC.
1157000	1164000	Me too. That's the one, like, and there's a lot of people like sitting on pins and needles. I think it's not just me that are like, okay, okay. Square.
1164000	1172000	So you're, you're doing a remake of 10 and okay. Uh, you, you did 13 on PC. Okay. And you've done four or five, six on the phone.
1172000	1178000	Now you did seven on PlayStation four TV. Where's 12 show 12.
1178000	1183000	They do like the DS one as well. Remember there was a DS 12.
1183000	1193000	Yeah. The side story, the revenue wings. Yeah, there was technically that's a, that's like a side story. Like I guess you could say like a 10, two or, but not even, it's even more like spinoff than that.
1193000	1197000	It's not totally, it's, it's different. That's all I can really say.
1197000	1206000	But what's interesting, and a lot of people don't realize this, I didn't even realize this, a lot of the team that worked on 12 are the people that are working on 14.
1206000	1215000	And I only learned that when I went to final fantasy fan fest. And for the longest time, I was convinced that 14 was set in Ivalice.
1215000	1222000	And that was going to be a big reveal, even though everybody was like, no, Rob, you're stupid. And eventually, finally they, they kind of said, no, it's not going to be an Ivalice game.
1223000	1237000	And they, they did a fun little, uh, uh, thing talking about the new race. That's going to be a fantasy 14 and they were teasing that it might be the Viera, but then they said no, because they couldn't, they couldn't make male Viera work.
1237000	1244000	Just like they couldn't make the female lizard people, the bongra, I think they were called. They couldn't make the female versus them works. They didn't do either one of those.
1244000	1248000	Uh, so that's why they're getting this new race that our raw or whatever it's called.
1248000	1258000	Why couldn't they just do a race that was like, or like just do one, like remember in 11 where they had, you know, uh, the Mithra were only, uh, female and the Galco were only male.
1258000	1260000	Why couldn't they do that?
1260000	1267000	I would have been okay with that totally because I totally think the Viera should be in 14, but I also understand the team's desire to want to do something different.
1267000	1280000	So, and the our, I look really cool, so I'm okay with it. I'm, I'm, I'm okay with what they're doing. The new classes look hot, not to turn this into a 14 cast, but it's a game I play a lot. Sorry, not sorry.
1280000	1289000	The dark knight looks great, even if they made it a tank. Uh, the astrologer looks awesome. It's a healer that's going to use cards and that looks really cool.
1289000	1298000	Uh, and it's kind of a throwback to the tactics games because, uh, the astrologers was a class in that as were the machinists, the DPS class are going to be the new DPS class in the game.
1298000	1310000	So you notice a lot of the tactics into 12 now into 14 influence. So it is kind of surprising they don't do, you know, they don't go back or revisit 12, but I guess maybe it's because a lot of the team works on 14.
1310000	1324000	But I was going to say, they mentioned at fan fest, uh, that the enemy system in 14 runs on the gambit system from 12. So that's why enemies will do things at certain percentages and stuff is because they all run off the gambit system from final fantasy 12.
1324000	1335000	So I, uh, I think that's a pretty neat. So anyway, sorry, dark Sakura, as always, I derailed your gaming week into a final fantasy wankathon, but, uh, did you have anything else you want to share?
1335000	1343000	I was done. I started reading fanfics. Okay. You're not kidding though. I think, I don't think you are kidding over there.
1343000	1351000	No, I'm actually looking at the other stories that have up for the day. Oh, fair enough. Prepping a little bit. All right. Well, while you prep, let's go over to Loki and Loki. How was your gaming week?
1351000	1362000	Um, I didn't play a whole ton and I was actually trying to work on my fog jam entry, which I ended up scrapping on, uh, Thursday, I think.
1362000	1380000	Basically my original concept was a little bit too elaborate and it had like some spider robot things in there and I was trying to animate the legs procedurally so that like if it was next to a wall or something like it would put the legs up on the wall and be able to like climb up the wall realistically.
1380000	1390000	And I was like, why the hell am I spending four days on this? I'm going to, this is just dumb. I'm going to scrap that. If basically gave myself a deadline, I'm like, I don't want to waste a ton of time on this.
1390000	1403000	So if I can't figure this out by, you know, this day, then I'm just going to say the hell with it. I'm going to do something else with that. And actually ended up scrapping the whole, whole game idea because, um, I came up with something better.
1403000	1418000	So, um, try to work on that now. And then, um, what else did I do? Oh, I did play a little bit of, uh, Lego Marvel superheroes because my son wanted to play that. I just checked the other day. I have like 50 hours in that game. It's ridiculous.
1418000	1436000	But, um, I'm noticing it is quite a buggy game itself. It's just like, um, you know, characters getting stuck in places. We actually know something funny that they had like a node for the, um, yeah, the Lego characters just kind of walking around the city place in the wrong spot.
1436000	1445000	And so like right under this tree, they just kind of jump up into the air, like really high and then come back down. And it just doesn't make any sense, but it's kind of funny.
1445000	1458000	Um, so I think I'm, I looked at it, I think I'm like 75% down at the game now. I'm just, I can't convince my son to go into the actual levels with me so I can just finish the rest of it. So I had to play it on my own in order to do that.
1459000	1467000	But, um, so I was just doing that and, uh, I have pretty much all the characters unlocked already. I just have a few more missions to do.
1467000	1479000	Um, I bought stuff. I was trying to buy Battlefield 4 because it was on sale so I got that for 14 bucks on PlayStation 4 and at the same time I figured I'd just buy Peggle 2, aside from that.
1479000	1492000	And, um, I don't know if I bought anything on Steam or not. I know I got Steam games and, uh, I was gonna buy that, was it, that one, um, there's a game on Steam right now, it's like 9 cents.
1492000	1498000	So, go pick it up, cause it's 9 cents. I mean, 91% off, so you gotta check it out.
1499000	1510000	Um, but that's it. It's just mostly working on, you know, my game. Hopefully I'll have something to show for it and fortunately, like I said, I had that kind of restarted, but, um, I like the new concept better than the old one.
1510000	1512000	Well, I already told you guys what it was, so.
1512000	1525000	Well, thank you for reminding me to remind the listeners about the video game jam that we're doing, or the VOG jam, uh, that kicked off last week and if you missed last week's show, the theme was decided to be a buggy game.
1525000	1534000	And you can interpret that many different ways and we're not here to tell you what is the right or wrong answer. You just take that theme, a buggy game, and create something, dammit.
1534000	1540000	Um, create a game if you are so inclined. There's tons of game makers out there. Loki's very much into Unity right now.
1540000	1549000	Uh, we had the Cooking with Unity guys on a couple weeks ago, uh, to kind of help motivate, uh, motivate all of us, really, and that was a great, uh, it was a great conversation.
1549000	1553000	I think it really did motivate Loki, uh, especially, and it motivated me a little bit, too, actually.
1553000	1562000	Um, so, uh, you can make something, uh, a complete new game. There's lots of other, like, RPG maker and other, like, games that facilitate game creation are out there.
1562000	1571000	Make a level in LittleBigPlanet. Make, uh, just create something, um, out of that theme, a buggy game, and, uh, I'm working on something, too.
1571000	1577000	Uh, from the programming aspect, I haven't even scratched the surface, but I have, I know what I want to do.
1577000	1585000	Um, and I did go down the route of, and I'm trying to keep mine a little bit secretive, because if I can pull off what I want to pull off, I think it's really gonna surprise some people.
1585000	1588000	So, I'm really, I told Loki what it is, and, uh, I-
1588000	1590000	It should be very doable. It's only that difficult.
1590000	1598000	I do, too. I'm keeping it, I, I kind of thought in the back of my head about why YR, when he made Pixel Shits, and he was just like, you know what? Simple.
1598000	1605000	Simple, simple, simple. And I hear Bobby in the back of my head, don't overdo it on your first game. Don't be like Loki, you know, trying to do everything in your first game.
1605000	1613000	So, I have a stupid, simple idea. It's honestly probably been done somewhere before, but it hasn't been done by me, so I'm gonna do it.
1613000	1619000	So, uh, that's, that's where I'm at with the VoG Jam. I'm just hoping I can do it in two weeks, because it's a lot to learn in two weeks.
1619000	1622000	I'll be able to do it. It's, it won't be that hard.
1622000	1624000	Alright, I'm hoping. Fingers crossed.
1624000	1632000	Okay, so anyway, all that's- but, don't expect me to talk a lot about it, just because I'm me, and I'm choosing to keep mine a little bit more of a secret.
1632000	1640000	But, other people are sharing what they're doing on the forums. In fact, Darkdead Studio posted an update today, and I was like, oh shit, he's way further along than I am.
1640000	1643000	He's got, like, pictures of spaceships, and enemies and all that shit.
1643000	1648000	And I do want to talk about what I, what I want to do, but the problem, I mean, I guess we can, because, yeah, sure.
1648000	1649000	Yeah, go for it.
1649000	1661000	So, my original concept was actually, is completely different than what I'm doing now, because it was going to be like this, kind of like Tower of Guns, roguelike type game, where it's a first person shooter action thing.
1661000	1667000	I'm like, okay, well that's, sounds really cool, but it's too fucking hard for me to do, so I scrapped that.
1667000	1670000	So the new idea came to me from a couple things.
1670000	1683000	One, I was watching some videos with my son about, from the Reddit thread Shitty Robots, and so it's just robots that are just fucked up, and just, they don't do what they're supposed to do, and it's hilarious.
1683000	1692000	And so they had this thing, was it HeboCon or something like that, where these people, they basically picked, like, 30 people or whatever, make robots, and these people don't know what the fuck they're doing.
1692000	1697000	And that's the whole point, is it's supposed to be really shitty robots battling each other.
1697000	1717000	And that didn't really give me the idea for the game, so it's not going to be about robots or anything, but my son, like, watching these robots made out of, like, McDonald's fry boxes or whatever, and it had this, like, stick thing, and it was kind of crawling along the ground and stuff, and it looked so silly because it was just stupid.
1717000	1723000	So, from that, for some reason I went, I'm going to make a racing game, but I want to make a really terrible racing game.
1723000	1729000	So, what's the most terrible racing game out there? Big Rigs Over the Road Racing.
1729000	1737000	It's the absolute worst racing game, period, because everything is broken in it. Everything is broken in it. There's no physics, everything's all fucked up.
1737000	1746000	So my idea was, I'm going to make a racing game, and every level, something different is fucked up, and it keeps getting more and more fucked up in different ways.
1746000	1754000	But the best part about it is, each time, basically there's an update to the game. It's like, okay, update, downloading the patch and stuff.
1754000	1766000	Every few levels there'll be a screenshot of, like, a fake Twitter social media type thing of them apologizing, you know, that the game is buggy or something like that, but in hilarious ways.
1767000	1778000	Some of the ideas I had was, let's see here, one of the first levels, you'll have square wheels for some reason. Another one.
1778000	1783000	We didn't know how to render the wheels. We apologize for the wheel rendering, Buck.
1783000	1791000	There's one that you can't turn left. It's just stuck right. You can only turn right.
1791000	1792000	I love it.
1792000	1800000	One that's like, literally, like a marble maze thing. Your car actually doesn't move, but you can tilt the level, you know, and stuff like that.
1800000	1809000	Okay, I got one. I got one. I got one. One, we're just partway through the race. Your car just fucking falls onto another racetrack that you already did earlier in the game.
1811000	1814000	Like, without explanation, it just fucking falls to the level.
1814000	1825000	It's gonna be like weird glitchy shit that's just not gonna make any sense, but that's the whole point of it, is it's supposed to be, you know, each time they patch the game, they kind of break something else in the process.
1825000	1834000	Okay, all I'll say about my game, now I gotta say something about my game. All I will say is, the reason why I'm not talking about it is so that I can switch it at the last minute.
1834000	1835000	No, that's fine.
1835000	1843000	It's a game you've all played or you've all heard of, only I'm reversing it. That's all I'm gonna say.
1843000	1857000	Okay, so, my gaming week. A lot of the same old standbys. Final Fantasy XIV, of course, been playing ample amounts of that, and XIII on PC, because I still love the PC remake of that.
1857000	1866000	And I unlocked Fang, finally, as a playable character in XIII, because you don't get her until like seven chapters into the story.
1866000	1869000	That made me excited, because she's my favorite character in XIII.
1869000	1878000	But I have played a few new games. Thanks to Loki, he gifted me a copy of the game L.O.V.E., or Love, but I think it's actually L.O.V.E., some type of acronym.
1878000	1880000	But this is on Steam.
1880000	1881000	Yeah, it looks awesome.
1881000	1888000	It's called Love, and it's one of those like, retro-esque, very simple, like, do nothing but jump type of games.
1888000	1898000	Like, when Alan saw me playing it over my shoulder, he's like, oh, is that VVVVV? It kind of has like that type of look to it, but it's got the really cool chiptunes in the background.
1898000	1904000	And here's the catch on this game, is that you can set your respawn point anywhere you want.
1904000	1913000	So you have to kind of remember every time you clear one little area to set your respawn point, or you're going to end up having to go back a long ways.
1913000	1920000	And I imagine what happens later on in the game is there comes like choices and probably pathing, and they just haven't probably got that far later in the game.
1920000	1926000	But I imagine there comes a point where you might not want to set your respawn point every five seconds.
1926000	1928000	That could actually be a bad thing.
1928000	1941000	But I have seen parts of the game where if you set your respawn point way up here, and you fall down earlier into the level, is it faster to just suicide and respawn than it is to run all the way back to where you were at?
1941000	1946000	And in the normal mode of the game, you're limited to 100 lives, so you have to kind of make that choice.
1946000	1951000	So maybe in that regard, it's a little closer to 1,001 spikes, which I think a lot of you guys checked out this year.
1951000	1959000	So yeah, that game's neat. I like Lego. I'm sorry, I'm reading the chat room as well, or you guys are talking about Lego Batman and Lego Marvel.
1959000	1963000	But I'm liking Love so far. That game's cool.
1963000	1970000	The other game I've played quite a bit of this week, and I am actually really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.
1970000	1980000	I don't usually go online and read reviews and read what other people think quite often, because I find that a lot of the professional critics are a little bit jaded.
1980000	1988000	And sometimes I don't always agree with them. And this would have been a great example of that, because from what I understand, this game is not being very ravely reviewed.
1988000	1996000	But I think this game is great, and I'm having an amazing time with Gauntlet 2014. That's right, the new Gauntlet remake that just came out.
1996000	2002000	It was on Steam sale, down to about 10 bucks from 20 the other day, so I was like, what the hell, I'll finally get a copy.
2002000	2010000	And what I knew of the new Gauntlet is that it was going to be like the old Gauntlet, but they say it's a little more like Diablo.
2010000	2019000	Believe me, I've been playing a lot of Diablo lately. A lot. Especially this week, because they're doing the double XP this weekend.
2019000	2026000	So Alan and I have been playing a lot on our seasonal characters. He just hit Paragon 100, so we've been playing a lot of Diablo 3.
2026000	2036000	I actually don't think Gauntlet is that much Diablo as a lot of people think it is. I think it's just because Diablo is a very modern-day dungeon crawler, so it's very easy to make that comparison.
2036000	2047000	But Gauntlet plays like Gauntlet. That's right, it plays a lot like the old game, but in this new, you know, using a lot of the new tricks you see in games.
2048000	2059000	Each character has different move sets, and what's kind of neat is that the elf turns into a twin-stick shooter, because the right stick will just shoot arrows wherever you want on the screen.
2059000	2067000	The wizard turns into a character from Magica, where hitting the buttons in certain combinations will cast different types of spells, which is really neat.
2067000	2075000	And then the wizard is a little more traditionally what you'd expect in Gauntlet, or did I say the wizard? The warrior is a little more what you'd expect in traditional Gauntlet, with the sword and everything.
2075000	2080000	And then the Valkyrie is similar, but with the more defensive-type maneuvers, where she can shield bash people and stuff.
2080000	2089000	And they, you know, they tried to flesh out the little characters more and give them depth, but it's a fun little dungeon crawler, and it's very hard.
2089000	2102000	Which, you know, the original Gauntlet was not an easy game either. So I like that you play through the levels, and depending on how many pots you smash, how many enemies you kill, or even how many times you died in a level,
2102000	2110000	you'll get buffs that will help you for the next time. So it's like you're perpetually unlocking these achievements that, like, let's say you smash pots.
2110000	2116000	Well, the more pots you smash, the higher percentage that the pots you smash later on will have gold in them.
2116000	2123000	So, like, you build these achievements that then impact your game, and it kind of gives you that incentive to play those levels over and over again.
2123000	2130000	So I was really digging Gauntlet more than I thought I would. I kind of thought it would be one of those games where I play a couple times, and I'm like, eh, whatever, and then move on.
2130000	2137000	But I'm talking, like, it's one of my favorite games, like, that I've played recently. Good.
2137000	2145000	So I ended up getting a four-pack, and I gave a copy to Dark Soccer and Loki, so I'm hoping they'll get a chance to check it out at some point too.
2145000	2158000	I have yet to play the game online, and I can only imagine that when you bring everybody's talents into it, where, you know, everybody's diverse, like with the elf having to kind of stand back and do his arrows or what have you, and the warrior can kind of get up in there and soak in the Valkyrie.
2158000	2164000	I imagine that really changes the dynamic of how you clear levels. So I'm excited to check that out.
2164000	2172000	So yeah, Gauntlet is pretty cool. I enjoyed that quite a bit. So I'm very happy about how that one turned out.
2172000	2179000	So there you go. That's pretty much all the new stuff I've been playing this week between Love and Gauntlet, but I have even more games in the coming weeks to catch up on.
2179000	2187000	I just bought Shovel Knight today on PC, which I already played on Wii U, and I already, you know, love that game. It really is one of the year's best.
2187000	2199000	But I just decided, you know what, I'm going to get it on PC, because I saw they've been doing updates on PC, and it's just like, all right, this game's so good, and for $10, what the hell? What the hell? I'll get it on PC as well.
2200000	2206000	All right, let's get into some news for tonight, but before we get to the news, some quick housekeeping.
2206000	2221000	We will be here next week, and next week we'll be doing our prediction show, but we will not be here the week of Martin Luther King weekend, which is, not on my calendar in front of me, but it is January 18th, I believe is the day.
2221000	2232000	January 18th, we will not be here that week. We might tape something in advance. We will not be here live January 18th. I will be in Seattle with Alan. We're going on a late holiday trip.
2232000	2240000	Since I had to work over the holidays, I took some time off a little later, so we're going to go to Seattle. It'll be fun. Can't wait.
2240000	2244000	All right, let's go around and do some gaming news tonight. Loki, we'll start with you.
2244000	2263000	Okay, so as many people are probably aware, the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network were kind of down during the holidays, and it wasn't because tons of people were opening their new systems on Christmas morning and trying to do their updates, but rather that there was actually a DDS attack happening on both of those services.
2263000	2281000	I guess it happened starting late December 24th, and I believe both services are back online now. I know PlayStation Network just came up completely, I think, today, but that kind of sucked.
2281000	2298000	And of course, both services were quite aware of what was going on, and if I remember correctly, I'm trying to remember who was actually behind it. I think it was the Lizard something? I don't remember the name of the group, if you will.
2298000	2302000	Well, and why give them attention? Who cares what their name is?
2302000	2305000	I did think it was funny, though, seeing posts like that.
2305000	2309000	I'm going to call them Jizzmasters. That's it. The Jizzmasters did it.
2310000	2325000	Lizard Squad. That's what it was, okay. But I did find it funny that Anonymous, I guess, was kind of fighting back against their botnets or whatever, and kind of taking down their botnets at the same time, so it was interesting.
2325000	2332000	But yeah, thankfully, the only thing that really affected for me is I couldn't buy the games I wanted to at the time I wanted to.
2332000	2339000	So everybody's shouting the name in chat because you couldn't remember it at first, but I need a tangent for a minute because this is what really bothers me about the whole thing.
2339000	2352000	Why are the Jizzmasters doing this over the holiday season? Why are they doing this? Because, I mean, and they might say, oh, it's for the lolz or whatever. Isn't that the whole common trait? Why do hackers do what they do for the lolz?
2352000	2362000	That, to me, says for attention. They want attention. That's the only reason they do this. Otherwise, why would you claim responsibility in the first place?
2362000	2378000	If you don't want attention, then you don't claim responsibility. And usually, it's to bring attention to some sort of cause. Maybe some sort of extremist cause, like maybe what's happening with the whole Sony Pictures hacks and all that stuff.
2379000	2387000	Maybe. I don't know. Usually, there's some type of cause. But in the absence of that, if it's quote-unquote for the lolz, then that just tells me it's attention.
2387000	2397000	They're doing it to get attention. They want everybody to see that they wield the power and they will happily shut down whatever networks they want as they so please, yada, yada, yada.
2397000	2408000	So every time you tweet their name and every time I see it trending on Twitter that the jizzmasters, you know, are in the top ten on Twitter and so forth, I just shudder because they are getting what they want.
2408000	2423000	And that's why they will continue to do all this crap until eventually, and this is the way it will always go down, eventually, one of them will turn on another to get more attention and then they all turn on each other and stab each other in the back and the whole thing topples down.
2423000	2431000	Look at what happened to, there was a group about a year ago, it was very, they weren't shutting down PlayStation and all that stuff, but they were doing all these extreme hackings and so forth.
2431000	2435000	And what happened? One guy turned on all the others, right? Isn't that what happened?
2435000	2436000	LulzSec, I think.
2436000	2443000	That's what it was. And there was one guy that turned, like the FBI caught one guy and got him to rat out all the others. Isn't that the deal? Something like that?
2443000	2444000	Something like that.
2444000	2451000	That's what will happen here inevitably too. And so, you know, a lot of guys, what's taking so long? Why isn't this getting shut down?
2451000	2460000	Well, probably, you know, our government can be kind of slow sometimes. I don't know if you all noticed, but if you ever try to see like how a law gets passed and so forth, it takes a very long time.
2460000	2470000	So for all you know, they're already infiltrated and we're just waiting for everybody to get caught. I mean, that's, you know, we'll see what happens. But anyway.
2471000	2482000	I just had to get on tangent. I just stop saying their name, stop, stop contributing to them trending on Twitter because they're using your tiers as lubricant.
2482000	2489000	I mean, that's what goes on in these people's minds. Really. I mean, really. So pretty much. Please think. Anyway.
2489000	2504000	So yeah. So the servers are dead. So no PlayStation or Xbox for people on Christmas Day. So if you're that 9, 10-year-old kid, mommy, mommy, daddy, daddy, all I want for Christmas is an Xbox One.
2504000	2513000	And then you get one, you can't even play it online. That's like way to be a buzzkill. Now, of course, there are two sides of it.
2514000	2525000	And that could be as well as if Microsoft and Sony know that they are going to be the target of attacks, then why are they better prepared for shit like this?
2525000	2534000	Especially Sony right now. I mean, I'm not even talking about the Sony pictures hack, which is still kind of a thing.
2534000	2550000	But even after the shit that they went through three years ago, let us not forget, when, you know, actual account information was stolen, credit card information was taken and so forth, you would think that Sony would be a little better prepared for this type of stuff.
2550000	2561000	Now, I don't profess to know all the technical workings about dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. But I mean, can't Sony arm themselves a little better against an attack like this? Loki?
2561000	2572000	I would think that they would be able to, but I don't know. I don't really know. Once again, I'm not sure how that stuff works. So, don't know.
2573000	2586000	Let's see. Dungeon Buster in chat says, FBI is already investigating one of them, but he's in Finland. They can refuse extradition. And then don't get worked up over this. It's nothing. Pay it zero attention. I did.
2586000	2600000	Well, I say don't say their name. That's, anyway, whatever. Let's see. And then Tiger Claw says, I think somebody from the Jizzmasters got interviewed and they said the reason they did it was to prove a point that Xbox Live and PlayStation Network have crappy security.
2601000	2613000	There's other ways to prove that point than shutting the networks down on Christmas Day, I would think. I mean, there's other ways to do it. And aren't the people that are trying to, I mean, God, it's like a fucking soap opera.
2613000	2624000	Like, aren't the people that are trying to attack the Jizzmasters in turn, like the good guys, quote, unquote, aren't they trying to help Sony and Microsoft kind of better their security? Aren't they, like, sending that type of information over?
2624000	2625000	I don't know.
2625000	2626000	That's what I thought I was hearing.
2626000	2628000	Maybe. Who knows?
2628000	2632000	Such a bit. These are the, these are the sands to the hourglass, like the days of our hacking lives.
2632000	2646000	It's just like, once again, you know, even with Anonymous and stuff, there's no organization to it. So you could have people that could be part of Anonymous or say that they're part of Anonymous and then they're in their own little group and it doesn't matter.
2646000	2650000	If an organization like that had a head, it'd be easier to take down.
2650000	2654000	Well, yeah. And if you said you were part of Anonymous and you're not really Anonymous, are you?
2654000	2662000	I mean, isn't that the trick? Isn't that, isn't that the thing? I thought that's how it works.
2662000	2663000	Well, you're still Anonymous.
2663000	2669000	But you're not, because you just said, you said I'm with them. But, but okay. Well, I thought the thing was you're supposed to, it's in the name. You stay Anonymous, right?
2669000	2672000	Well, you don't know who they are, so they're technically Anonymous.
2672000	2678000	I'm confused. Am I just too old? Is that what this is? Have I, have I hit that point where I'm too old for this?
2678000	2680000	Don't worry, Rob. We'll get you your cane next year.
2680000	2688000	I guess so. I don't understand. All right. Let's see. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2688000	2698000	Ragenator says, Sony did better arm themselves, Sky, but their hamster that served as chief security officer recently died from overuse of exercise wheels.
2698000	2704000	Kaijuto in chat says they do it more for the laughs, not attention. If they wanted attention, they'd show themselves.
2704000	2712000	Well, they are showing themselves. You know their name. Everybody's tweeting it. I, I, I don't see where they're not showing themselves. They are.
2712000	2724000	This is just their, their chosen identity that they're, they're putting out there or whatever. So, I don't know. Anyway, I just, I'm disappointed that we pay for Xbox Live.
2724000	2737000	We now pay for PlayStation Plus and I get that, I get that there's great deals on games and all this stuff, but part of their reasoning for charging for PlayStation Plus was because we need to better our security.
2737000	2747000	We can't afford to do all the free, you know, stuff anymore. It's not, you know, they, they throw all these lines at us about what, about why they're going to charge for PlayStation Plus because they want more money, right?
2747000	2760000	And this happens. And it's down for three days during one of the busiest periods of the year. And boy oh boy, you should have seen some of the Twitter spats I was having over this thing this week.
2760000	2768000	Which, you know, I understand I respect everybody's opinion and the places they're coming from, but it was getting a little heated on Twitter. And, you know, I get it.
2768000	2783000	Some people and the way they complain about things like this is like, I want my money and I want it now. You know, some people throw a real tissy fit about it. And, you know, I, I understand that there's, I have very thin patience for things like that too.
2783000	2792000	But at the same time, if people are going to be upset that what they pay for isn't working for three days, I would think that they are entitled to some type of compensation.
2792000	2796000	I'd like to quote something my husband's fond of saying. How does it feel to want?
2796000	2804000	Well, but okay. But then why are we paying for it? Maybe my PlayStation Plus is up for renewal. Maybe I won't renew it this time.
2804000	2806000	Okay, then don't. Speak with your money.
2806000	2812000	I might not. I'm going to wait and see what they do in response to this whole thing to see if I'm going to renew it or not.
2812000	2826000	But even like the most shittiest customer service experience that I can think of, Comcast, even them, you know, if you complain in your services like, stay out for a couple days or something, they'll usually credit your bill those couple of days.
2827000	2835000	And I'm not, I'm not saying that Sony has to come out and provide all these free games again and have it be like fucking Christmas all over again and all this stuff. That's not what I'm saying.
2835000	2846000	All I would like Sony to do in this situation is acknowledge our network was vulnerable to this and this is what we're doing to make it better.
2846000	2850000	And since we were down for three days, we're going to credit everybody with three days.
2850000	2862000	That's all I want. And that's all I think any, any person wants in this situation when things get heated is that you want the corporation or just not Joe Blow who represents corporation gets paid to take all the verbal.
2862000	2873000	Credit the people that have PlayStation Plus like a couple bucks or something, you know, because that I understand that you can't, there's no really no way to extend your, you know, membership out a couple days because I think it renews.
2874000	2884000	I'm not even sure that really does it for me because yeah, if you work out the math, it ends up being like less than a dollar, but I want Sony to say it was vulnerable.
2884000	2895000	We got attacked and this is how we're going to make it better. And I know a lot of you guys, a lot of you cynics are out there saying they're never going to admit that. Well then why are we continuing to support it?
2895000	2905000	Everybody gets a free PlayStation Go or a PlayStation portable. Was it a PSP Go, PSP Go. They've got tons of those. I'm sure.
2905000	2917000	I don't know. It's, it's not so much about the, because I also understand where it's kind of bullshit that somebody else, an outside influence takes down their network. And so now Sony has to pay up for that.
2917000	2924000	But at the same time, why has Sony been down for three days? Like this says a lot about their security.
2924000	2926000	How quickly was Microsoft able to get up?
2926000	2939000	They got up and within 24 hours, I'm pretty sure. But any, but, and then here, here sits Nintendo who knew that, you know, your Wii U is the only thing that was going to be online this holiday. Who knew?
2939000	2951000	Well, and then once again, it think, you know, the reason why is resources, you know, it's like, okay, well we can take down two, you know, come, you know, if we take down Nintendo, I don't think a lot of people are going to give a crap.
2951000	2963000	But well, but at the same time, I think it's easy to say that. I think it's easy to say they didn't target Nintendo because they just don't fucking care. And that's, and maybe that's the truth, but at the same time, consider this.
2963000	2971000	If they did target Nintendo and they couldn't do it, would they admit it? I don't think so.
2971000	2976000	I think I remember reading that they said they're fans of Nintendo, which is why they didn't do that.
2976000	2991000	And I'm saying they're criminals and that could just be a convenient excuse for you couldn't do it. You couldn't do it. So you're, you made a convenient excuse that you're fans of Nintendo. I'm just, consider it. Why not?
2991000	3009000	Why not? Because this is a company that just now figured out how to do DLC, you know, what like a decade after everybody else. I'm sorry. I don't believe for a second that they have some sort of security system that's, you know, out matching any other game network security system.
3009000	3018000	Could that be the reason why it's taken so long is because they wanted to do it right. I'm just, I don't think so. I don't think so at all.
3018000	3034000	All right. We'll see if they, if, if these, if jizz masters or whoever comes next decides to take out Nintendo, then whatever, I guess I'll be proven wrong. But for what it's worth right now, saying that they couldn't, they didn't want to do it. It could be a convenient excuse.
3034000	3049000	So that's all. Anyway, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw says there Nintendo security is really tight because nobody ever hacks them. Nintendo does have a bunch of credit cards on file. You would think, you would think.
3049000	3061000	Let's see. Bonds006 says Nintendo laughed all the way to the bank on not getting a DDoS attack. DGRamaS says Nintendo has a network? Question mark. So there you go.
3061000	3073000	And then Fifth Dream says no one is breaking into anything. And that I understand the whole concept about hackers versus DDoS flood and all this stuff.
3074000	3089000	Whatever label you want to put on it, it's being a dick. So they're being a dick. That's, that's what it is at the end of the day. They're being a dick by shutting down PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas day. That's just being a dick.
3089000	3107000	Anyway, sadly, that was one of the biggest news stories that came out of the week, but there were some other things that happened during the week, including this, which interesting timing on this. Speaking of Nintendo, Nintendo is upping their lobbying presence.
3107000	3119000	So you know what it means to be like lobbying means you have money. That's when you lob money at people and hope it sticks. That's when you lob money at people and you get their votes in return. That's essentially what it is.
3119000	3129000	And Nintendo is increasing their lobbying presence. And what they did, they hired, and I will probably mispronounce this name, called Cho-Groves Consulting.
3129000	3147000	And what they're going to be doing is lobbying the federal government on issues related to intellectual property, intellectual trade, and anti-piracy measures. Now this is according to recent lobbying disclosures, as there are rules and things. You have to make certain disclosures as a public company like that.
3147000	3165000	So we can get into specific names and all that, but I don't see the point into that. But that's overall what's happening. Nintendo has hired this firm to lobby Washington on issues such as IP, international trade, and anti-piracy measures.
3165000	3179000	Because, you know, Nintendo does get hit with a lot of these piracy things all the time, right? These DS and 3DS loaders that allow you to download carts from online and install them on the flash cart and so forth, right? The R5, is that what it was called?
3179000	3180000	R4.
3180000	3196000	They got it banned in a lot of places, and you can't sell it anymore, but Nintendo does fall victim to that quite a lot. And I imagine when it comes to intellectual property, you could probably get all sorts of bootleg t-shirts with bootleg Mario and bootleg Zelda on them everywhere.
3196000	3204000	I know, I mean, look at their games. There's games on other systems like the CDI, I mean, clearly those couldn't have been possible.
3204000	3207000	Clearly, Nintendo would have never allowed that.
3207000	3208000	Seriously.
3208000	3219000	But, I mean, in all honesty, we also have, you know, when anybody can make a game for iOS, you know, how easy would it be to put a copy of Super Mario Brothers on there?
3219000	3223000	Or somehow backload, you know, an emulator or something.
3223000	3225000	I wonder if that'll come up later in the show.
3225000	3226000	I wonder.
3226000	3228000	Or something like that, you know? Exactly.
3228000	3239000	So Nintendo, what do you think they hope to accomplish with the lobbying that they're doing? What kind of law are they looking to get passed with this?
3239000	3243000	Is it something about clamping down on intellectual property in relation to games and so forth or what?
3243000	3247000	I don't like it any, I don't know. I hate lobbyists.
3247000	3255000	Do you think that they're looking to hold a company like Apple or Google responsible when a clone gets through onto their stores?
3255000	3260000	Just throwing it out there. I don't know. I'm not saying I want it or I'm just, could that be what they're lobbying for?
3260000	3267000	Maybe. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I still don't like lobbyists.
3267000	3268000	Yeah?
3268000	3278000	Yeah, because usually, especially when you have companies like this, I understand they're just trying to, you know, get the passage of certain types of laws for them.
3278000	3285000	And I'm sorry you have a lot of it ends up being anti-consumer because they kind of overstep their bounds.
3285000	3293000	Look at like, you know, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Yeah, that did a number on everything. Thanks. Yeah.
3293000	3299000	Well, when I hear about these companies are interested in lobbying, I worry about things like, remember SOPA?
3299000	3305000	A couple of years ago, that whole thing that they were trying to pass where they could, they could just shut down your website without even taking you to court or whatever.
3305000	3310000	And all us indie folks are banding together going, hold on, hold on. No, this is some bullshit right here. Hold on.
3310000	3322000	And, you know, it was one of those rare cases where the people of America spoke up and shut the lobbyists down because enough people, you know, rose up against it.
3322000	3330000	Which I'm, you know, at the same time though, I'm all for if Nintendo wants to try and prevent piracy and so forth, they have a right to do that.
3330000	3344000	You know, you, as much as it might make some people upset to hear, you have to understand it is wrong for you to download Pokemon Ruby Sapphire remakes on 3DS and play them for free.
3344000	3347000	Like that, that is wrong to do that. No, I understand that.
3347000	3355000	My problem I have with it is when they start saying, oh, we're protecting our, you know, our IP by not allowing you to make a YouTube video or something like that.
3356000	3360000	Yeah. Yeah. It's like, how far does that hand go? How far does it go? I get that.
3360000	3371000	Or like, oh yeah, you, um, you know, you made this like fan, you know, art type thing. Oh, I'm sorry. That's, you know, violating our, you know, IP or something.
3371000	3372000	Right.
3372000	3373000	That's where I have the problem.
3373000	3381000	Yeah. That I, I get that is that, you know, how, how far does that do those protections shorter reach? And you're right. And I've bitched about this on the show.
3381000	3392000	I don't know how many times a lot of the stuff on YouTube goes too far and it's all, none of it, none of YouTube's rules are in the interest of the people that make the content for YouTube.
3392000	3402000	That's the thing that blows my mind how they are so damn successful when the people that actually create the content for YouTube, YouTube never defends.
3402000	3414000	YouTube never sticks up for them. YouTube doesn't care about them. They always bend over to copyright holders first, even if the copyright holders don't have a legitimate claim.
3414000	3416000	Yeah.
3416000	3417000	It's crazy to me.
3417000	3431000	And there's people abusing the system even, you know, like there's some indie guys out there and, um, not even indies, but like Warner, you know, they were doing that where, oh, you, you're not part of our, uh, you know, our embargo reviews or whatever like that.
3431000	3446000	Or, you know, you had to agree to this in order to be able to put the video out at a certain date, but you didn't get, somehow you received a copy of the game and now you're not allowed to put this video out there because you didn't sign this agreement or something that it's messed up.
3446000	3457000	Uh, Tigerclaw with an interesting perspective in our chat room over at a live.vognetwork.com saying, maybe the lobbying is also to help protect them against these companies trying to sue them for patent infringing.
3457000	3466000	Well, now that's fine. That's once again, that's going up against, you know, these trademark laws and stuff like that or, you know, copyright laws.
3466000	3467000	We'll all support Nintendo on that one.
3468000	3479000	There needs to be copyright law reform anyways, and I'm fine with that, but I just don't think that, you know, I don't think that's the case in this time. I think it's something else.
3479000	3486000	Let's see, uh, Kaijuto in chat says Nintendo wants to freeze the pirates in Carbonite. Well, they probably would if they could.
3486000	3491000	Uh, and bonds006 says Google, owner of YouTube, is making money for the video hits. That is their business.
3491000	3501000	Well, imagine if people stopped making videos for them to get the hits on. I'm just saying, like, and I've, I've even created stuff on YouTube and I've, I've made stuff and so forth.
3501000	3514000	And I get very frustrated with some of their little like claims where they claim that I'm using copyrighted stuff, but I'm literally looking at the website where they have released all those rights to people that want to do Let's Play videos and so forth.
3514000	3517000	But you can't fucking send that information to YouTube because there's not a human being there.
3518000	3525000	So why am I still on YouTube? Because there is, like, literally no other site. There's literally no other site that takes, like, ga-, that'll take gaming content.
3525000	3531000	Because it's such a slippery slope, admittedly. But, ugh, so irritating.
3531000	3541000	Uh, DarkSakura, you re-, you get into some of this political stuff sometimes and so forth. I'm dying to know your thoughts. What do you think about Nintendo, uh, getting a lobbying firm to represent them?
3541000	3554000	I'm not really surprised. I mean, especially now, if you also look at the fact that Nintendo has been getting into more and more online content, they could very well be throwing in their lot with, um, some of the issues regarding net neutrality as well.
3554000	3557000	So that was another thing that I was sort of thinking of.
3557000	3558000	Oh, good point.
3558000	3568000	Um, I-, I-, as I've said for other issues in the past, I don't want to speculate until I have something more firm.
3568000	3575000	But I think that, yeah, I really don't know what to think, to be honest.
3575000	3585000	That's a really good point, though, about the net neutrality. I didn't even think of that, but you're right. Now that Nintendo, like, actually has more online playable games, as they've had a few this year, that's something of particular interest to them.
3585000	3601000	And they've always taken a very, I would say, solid approach to protecting their IPs, to protecting their interests, and I could see where it would be beneficial for them to throw their lot in with the political game.
3601000	3609000	So, I still-, I think it's all speculation at this point. We have no idea. I'd rather wait for something more concrete.
3609000	3619000	You know, some people have called Nintendo the Disney of video games, which is-, it's really not a bad comparison in many ways. I mean, it's a quick and rushed and sloppy comparison in some ways.
3619000	3629000	But in other ways, I mean, you have these extremely identifiable characters. You got Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, you got Mario, Link, and, you know, all these characters in Smash Brothers on Nintendo's side.
3629000	3638000	It's not to say that Sony and Microsoft don't have their own, but there's also other animation studio-, like, you know, there's Warner Brothers, there's other animation studios outside of Disney, too.
3638000	3639000	Don Bluth.
3639000	3647000	Yeah, there's all this other stuff, right? So, but Nintendo, in some ways, is the Disney of the video gaming world.
3647000	3660000	And we all know that Disney-, look at what Disney does. Like, if you look at, like, Disney's lobbyist, Disney got copyright law changed to prevent Mickey Mouse from going public domain.
3660000	3670000	Mickey Mouse was supposed to go public domain, like, in the last decade or something, but Disney lobbied to get copyright laws changed so that Mickey Mouse wouldn't go public domain.
3670000	3680000	That was-, that was to keep-, keep that protection, basically. And so, it, like, doubled the length of time or something like that, that something will stay copyright before it goes into public domain.
3680000	3691000	So, I mean, if you're curious about the types of stuff Nintendo might be doing, Disney might be a company to look to for inspiration of what they're doing. Who knows? Just throwing a thought out there.
3691000	3694000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura.
3694000	3700000	Well, we do have some news out of the fuckery that came through with Assassin's Creed Unity.
3700000	3705000	Well, there is a patch out now that improves the performance of the game.
3706000	3714000	This third patch is supposed to fix framerate issues and make the game play more fluidly.
3714000	3726000	That's with this fourth patch. Basically, it's 6.5 gigabytes and it refurbishes, as they've said, some of the areas, especially here it says in Paris.
3727000	3737000	It's supposed to be more beneficial for PS4, but there are some updates on Xbox One that people should see.
3737000	3746000	So, they're trying to make the games fit each other, each edition of it, look more alike in terms of quality.
3746000	3757000	Really, the other thing too is that they're supposed to help the NPCs run more smoothly instead of just being sort of useless there.
3757000	3765000	Not really that it's helping anything like framerate or anything like that, but they said overall it's supposed to just improve the playing of the game.
3766000	3775000	It does look like, though, from some of the scenes that there are more NPCs included now without too much of a framerate drop.
3775000	3778000	So, maybe that's something.
3778000	3787000	Yeah. You know, Extrovert over in Hoard House, I've been noticing his tweets, he's been playing this more and more and it really sounds like a lot of the issues that were going on have been addressed.
3788000	3797000	So, kind of a bummer that it had such a botched launch, like the game might be great now, but, you know, are there going to be as many people that stuck with it to discover it? We'll see.
3797000	3805000	We'll see. Of course, if they were to end up slashing the price of the game by 20 bucks, I suppose that's going to open it up to a whole new audience that will check it out at that point.
3805000	3806000	I still won't buy it.
3806000	3808000	Well, you never know. I think there'd be a lot of people that would.
3808000	3810000	I pretty much know I won't buy it.
3810000	3813000	Yeah. I know I wouldn't buy it because I'm not a fan of Assassin's Creed.
3813000	3814000	Yeah.
3814000	3815000	I tried.
3815000	3824000	The only ones of those I'd ever had an interest in was the second one, which I did buy, but that was also when I was having this minor obsession with learning everything about the Medici family.
3824000	3827000	And I loved their whole drama.
3827000	3832000	So, playing a game where I get to go around killing historical figures was pretty cool.
3832000	3837000	I never got super super into the Assassin's Creed series, but I understand why they're popular.
3837000	3845000	And I did play three, I think it was, which I'm even told is not one of the stronger games, but I actually was pretty impressed with the storytelling in it.
3845000	3849000	So, for as little as I did play, I was like, oh, this is kind of rad.
3849000	3852000	So, I get why people are super into that series.
3852000	3857000	I do think they're putting them out a bit too frequently, and I think that's starting to shoot them in the foot.
3857000	3863000	And they might really want to consider scaling it back to one every other year, as much as some of the fans may not want to hear that.
3863000	3868000	But I think that could be a good, healthy thing for the series. In the long run, you'd probably get better games out of it.
3868000	3870000	But we'll see what happens. We'll see.
3870000	3872000	Moving on. Loki.
3872000	3875000	So, Destiny's done pretty well for itself.
3875000	3884000	Right now, they have, I guess, just about 13 million players playing the game.
3884000	3896000	And they said, with that, over almost 23 million characters created, and over 872 million hours.
3896000	3899000	That's a lot of hours.
3899000	3903000	That's a lot of people grinding for nothing.
3903000	3907000	Yeah, and I still haven't played yet. Still sitting, collecting dust on my phone.
3907000	3908000	Why not?
3908000	3912000	Why not? Just don't have time, and also got a limited amount of time.
3912000	3915000	Got to dedicate all that free time right now to VOGJAM.
3915000	3919000	Once it's done, maybe I'll take a break and do that.
3919000	3922000	But then I gotta go back to my other game, too.
3922000	3926000	Maybe by that time, they'll have the balance patch out or something that helps out.
3926000	3930000	I really don't like their whole concept for endgame in that game.
3930000	3936000	Gear with light on it is the way you level up? What?
3936000	3941000	And then the expansion does nothing to bridge the gap at all for people that want to catch up?
3941000	3944000	I don't get it.
3944000	3951000	But I know some people that are super into it still, and love it, and think it's one of the best games of the year.
3951000	3954000	They play Watch Dogs, too.
3954000	3956000	It's also sitting there.
3956000	3961000	I played a little bit of that. That game's pretty good. It's interesting.
3961000	3963000	Let's talk about Amiibo.
3963000	3967000	Amiibo's been doing crazy well for Nintendo. Lots of them selling.
3967000	3973000	We talked a little bit last week about how Toys R Us was having some issues around the whole Amiibo.
3973000	3976000	There is a little update to that whole thing.
3976000	3980000	Toys R Us actually canceled a bunch of the Lucario Amiibo.
3980000	3986000	Some orders got reinstated, and some other people were able to get a different way of ordering.
3986000	3989000	Like if you use PayPal or a gift card or whatever.
3989000	3993000	There might be a redemption code that these folks received this week.
3993000	3995000	Maybe some of you out there were in this.
3995000	4005000	Where if you had pre-ordered a Wave 3 Amiibo, what happened is that there's a coupon that will bring the price down to $10.99.
4005000	4010000	So I guess what happens is that they have the Amiibo in stock at $999.
4010000	4016000	But these people that pre-ordered and then couldn't get it, they can go get it now for $10.99.
4016000	4021000	That's even cheaper than I believe with the manufacturer. Aren't they usually $12.99?
4021000	4022000	Yeah.
4023000	4028000	And then that way other people aren't going to buy them for, you know, they're not going to scoop them all up for $999.
4028000	4033000	But if they do, they're crazy. You get to get them even cheaper from scalpers on eBay than that.
4033000	4035000	So, there you go.
4035000	4042000	Toys R Us trying to resolve that crazy Amiibo situation which, man, those Amiibos, it's nuts.
4042000	4045000	But then again, Dark Soccer, you said you saw some on Christmas Eve.
4045000	4046000	Yeah.
4046000	4053000	And my assumption was that you were probably seeing the common ones that Nintendo has said they're going to put tons of out there like Mario and Link and all that stuff.
4053000	4057000	Yeah. I got a Link one for Secret Santa for somebody.
4057000	4064000	Yeah. The ones that people are going crazy over are like the limited ones that are coming out in these little waves like Wii Fit Trainer and now what?
4064000	4070000	Little Mac and Pit, I think, were in this latest bunch and it's, yeah, people going crazy for it.
4070000	4073000	But I, dude, I got friends on Twitter that have like every single Amiibo.
4073000	4080000	And like, so they were trading tips, like somebody was saying, oh, a spice rack is a really good way to display your Amiibo.
4080000	4083000	And I was kind of looking at it going, that actually does look really cool.
4083000	4085000	I got a hint that that's a good tip.
4085000	4088000	But some people are collecting it like totally just for the figures.
4088000	4096000	Like doesn't even, like some people, like again, again, Nintendo is the Disney of the gaming world in many ways, in many ways.
4096000	4103000	And there's another great example that people just want to have the little figurines.
4103000	4109000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, rock.
4109000	4115000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to what I'm sure will be a very dry release day schedule?
4115000	4120000	Well, actually kind of dry news, but it's sort of interesting.
4120000	4130000	There's a UK games industry publication, MCV, and another one called Develop, that are doing a 2015 salary survey for people in the video games industry.
4130000	4136000	This is including publishers, retailers, developers, services, anywhere in the world.
4136000	4143000	And basically they're wanting to collect what people's salaries are for their positions worldwide.
4143000	4145000	I guess to do a big survey on it.
4145000	4160000	If any of our listeners are in the industry, you can go to MCVUK.com and participate in the survey.
4160000	4164000	So I will also be sharing a link with that in the chat room.
4164000	4173000	Nice. Interesting. Did you do any research, just kind of digging in to see what kind of money people are making?
4173000	4180000	I would honestly put it more in the category of making sure that people are being paid fairly around the world.
4180000	4184000	You know, seeing if people are actually being paid what their degrees are worth for one thing.
4184000	4193000	It's actually a pretty good way also of seeing exactly what the industry is doing with the money it's bringing in.
4193000	4197000	So maybe it's trying to hold them to some ethics.
4197000	4199000	Nice. I like that.
4199000	4206000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what is coming out to a video game store near you.
4206000	4211000	I imagine it's going to be pretty dry this week, but let's check anyway. Loki?
4211000	4214000	Yeah, in fact, I'll just take a look at that.
4214000	4220000	Because usually in January there's some things, you know, very little.
4220000	4225000	But the next thing I show coming out is not until the 20th, and that would be Saints Row Gat Out of Hell.
4225000	4228000	But yeah, unfortunately, nothing this week.
4228000	4233000	Alright, well, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.
4233000	4238000	You know what? It's looking very, very thin over there as well, and I think it's going to be for a little bit.
4238000	4244000	On the PlayStation 4, I don't see anything until late January, and that's really the same story on the Xbox One.
4244000	4248000	The Wii U. The Wii U does... Oh, no, that's Europe.
4248000	4253000	I was going to say they get Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, but that's actually Europe, gets that very early January.
4253000	4256000	Sorry, Jamie, didn't mean to spoil that.
4256000	4262000	And yeah, honestly, I'm even looking at the Vita, the 3DS, nothing.
4262000	4266000	Japanese release dates aren't really going to pick up again until mid or late January.
4266000	4273000	There's a lot coming in late January, but I think we have really exited the season of game releases for a good month.
4273000	4275000	But Dark Sakura, let's check in with Europe anyway.
4275000	4278000	Jack shit.
4278000	4280000	I thought that might be the case.
4280000	4282000	Yep, Jack shit put up by EA.
4282000	4292000	So, one thing we don't usually get here is a list of digital releases, so I'm not sure, but probably this week, nothing.
4292000	4296000	I would imagine you'll see a lot of sales, though, so keep an eye out for that.
4296000	4301000	All right, let's do a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
4301000	4312000	All right, so I guess this is good news for Nintendo, because the federal court has dismissed the patent case against them for their Wiimote.
4312000	4318000	I'm trying to remember which patent this one was, because there's been several for the Wiimote.
4318000	4331000	This one, I guess, is Ultimate Pointer, and I guess they had a patent for easily deployable interactive direct pointing system and presentation control system and calibration method, therefore...
4331000	4334000	Wow, that's really fancily worded.
4334000	4342000	And this was back from, I guess, 2011 is when this case was filed originally.
4343000	4355000	And, of course, you know, they're very pleased with the decision, and, you know, the fact that they haven't, you know, infringed on any patents and stuff.
4355000	4365000	Of course, you know, I want to say, yeah, this isn't necessarily completely in their favor, because you may remember, you know, not too long ago,
4365000	4374000	Philips won the dispute against Nintendo for the Wiimote thing. See, this is what kind of confuses me about that.
4374000	4379000	It's like, how can you have multiple companies claiming that you're infringing on their patents for things?
4379000	4384000	I mean, it's like, which one of you actually made this? I mean, they can't all be here.
4384000	4394000	Well, because there's more than one thing that comes into play, and I want to say, with the Philips one, and again, I don't get paid to follow this stuff, so I have a hard time.
4394000	4403000	But I believe it was specifically with a remote control type device that controlled games. That was Philips' whole thing.
4403000	4411000	And then somebody else might claim to have the patent on the, I don't know, just humor me here, infrared sensor bars or whatever, right?
4411000	4422000	Other components that make up the Wii. I think somebody took issue with the whole Wii channel interface was an issue for somebody that sued Nintendo.
4422000	4427000	So, it's all those little bits and pieces, everybody wants, you know, their piece of it.
4427000	4428000	Lame.
4428000	4437000	I know. Law is complicated. That's what I should have got into, and I'd be rich with all these.
4437000	4444000	Why you gotta be, you know, why you gotta be picking on Nintendo? I mean, seriously, they're having enough trouble as it is with, you know, getting the Wii U launched.
4444000	4450000	You know, but their online was up during the holidays, so there's that trade-off, I guess.
4450000	4454000	Alright, bonds006 in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
4454000	4460000	The patent suit against Nintendo is still going on. I would think Nintendo settled this case or settled out of court.
4460000	4464000	Nintendo, though, also strikes me as the type of company that doesn't want to settle for shit.
4464000	4475000	Because that would admit proving, or that would admit some type of guilt, even though there's a type of settlement you can do that is, you're doing a settlement without any admission of wrongdoing.
4475000	4481000	But I think even that Nintendo does not want to do unless, like, their back is against the wall or something, you know what I mean?
4481000	4493000	Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo, there's just a lot of news coming out of them on this very slow week, including the new anime app Crunchyroll, which is now available on the Wii U.
4493000	4495000	That's not new.
4495000	4496000	I know nothing about-
4496000	4497000	Crunchyroll's been out forever.
4497000	4500000	I know Crunchyroll's been out forever, but not on the Wii U. That's the news.
4500000	4502000	It's now out on the Wii U, woo!
4502000	4504000	I don't know Crunchyroll. Tell me about this service, though.
4504000	4506000	It's how I watch Sailor Moon.
4506000	4512000	Seriously, I'm watching the new Sailor Moon series. I paid for Crunchyroll just so I could watch it.
4512000	4521000	Well, now you can get it on the Wii U, and if you want to use it, you have to have a premium Crunchyroll membership. That is going to cost you about $12 a month.
4521000	4527000	But if you want to get into watching lots and lots and lots of anime, this is a great way to do that.
4527000	4530000	Is it implied by that picture that the Animal Crossing movie is on there?
4531000	4536000	That's my assumption, but whoever ran this article could have just tried to tie it to video caving.
4536000	4537000	Anime Nintendo.
4537000	4540000	Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, Anime Nintendo. Who knows? I do not know.
4540000	4543000	And the Animal Crossing movie is super adorable.
4543000	4553000	I would ask Rama, or Giovanni, one of the folks over at Anime Jam Session, which I can throw a programming note out there.
4553000	4556000	They are on holiday break. They won't be back until mid-January.
4556000	4562000	But they are bringing us a new episode this week from DerpyCon, which I guess they taped a while ago, so they're going to play it this week.
4562000	4569000	But that would be the guy to ask. I would assume he would know if this is available or not, because I sure don't.
4569000	4572000	I did the program guide for DerpyCon.
4572000	4575000	DJ Rama S says it's better on Hulu.
4577000	4581000	So there you go, from the guy who knows his shit himself.
4581000	4590000	Alright, let's travel back to a classic time in games. Let's travel back to a time when you didn't watch fuckin' anime on your video game console.
4590000	4594000	You had a friend who lived in Japan send you tapes.
4594000	4595000	Off of TV.
4595000	4596000	Off of TV.
4596000	4599000	So you also got introduced to Japanese game shows that way too.
4599000	4601000	That's right, which really is the best.
4601000	4602000	There really is.
4602000	4608000	And I wish they had a whole television network in the US that was all Japanese game shows.
4608000	4612000	That was the first time I'd ever seen a dog shit live on TV.
4614000	4616000	I'd love it. I'd love it. I'd love it.
4616000	4622000	No, no, no, no. It was, it was, they were doing, like, cow soccer and dog soccer and baby soccer.
4622000	4625000	And the dog, like, they were trying to lure it with treats and everything.
4625000	4628000	And finally it looks from one side to the other, stops and shits.
4628000	4630000	And then they replayed it.
4630000	4633000	That's awesome. That's like Puppy Bowl.
4633000	4634000	Puppy Bowl.
4636000	4641000	Anyway, before my co-host took the conversation literally to dog shit discussion,
4641000	4645000	we were gonna get into the classic game of the week.
4649000	4653000	Dark Soccer's gonna step into the gaming vault and over the poo on the ground
4653000	4658000	and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should really think about checking out this game this week.
4658000	4662000	Because, uh, there's nothing else to play this week unless you, you know, your catchphrase.
4662000	4666000	I gotta say, though, that, that's the only thing that was probably missing from,
4666000	4670000	was that that dog football game that they had on the Wii is dogs, you know, randomly shitting on the field.
4670000	4671000	Push X to shit?
4671000	4676000	And you know what, you know what, what would have been fun is that if they leave the shit there,
4676000	4679000	then it can cause, like, dog, other accidents, like, they could slip in the shit or something.
4679000	4683000	You guys think about this way too much. I'm getting uncomfortable.
4683000	4686000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4686000	4691000	Balloon Fight. I picked it because Dan said so.
4691000	4697000	I was literally sitting there going, Dan, I need a game. You should do Balloon Fight.
4697000	4698000	This is a good game, though.
4698000	4699000	Okay.
4699000	4703000	Well, I don't know, I used the term good loosely, but it's influenced a lot.
4703000	4707000	Well, and he's the one who told me to put the other video up, so that's why I linked it to you.
4707000	4711000	Because it actually has the, the full music. So it'd be a good idea.
4712000	4716000	Anyway, Balloon Fight came out in 1985. It was developed by Nintendo.
4716000	4721000	It's a joust ripoff, but that's okay, because apparently Nintendo can rip off whoever they want to,
4721000	4723000	but other people can't rip off of them.
4723000	4730000	It actually first was out in 1984 as Versus Balloon Fight, which was an arcade one.
4730000	4738000	It was the Nintendo Versus system, which I'm sure we all remembered how this pissed us off because of their time limits and whatnot.
4739000	4745000	The official console version of it in the US came out in 1986.
4745000	4751000	And it is very much like joust. You sort of float around and run into your enemies and knock them down.
4751000	4763000	It has had ports. The actual NES version was ported to the NEC PC-8801 October 1985, and then the Sharp X1 in November 1985.
4763000	4769000	We have a Game Boy Advance version called Balloon Fight E for the E-Reader. Who remembers that? I had that one.
4769000	4770000	I do. I had that one.
4770000	4774000	I thought that was rad that you had, like, you had a video game on a frickin' card.
4774000	4776000	Yep. That was awesome. Well, five cards, but still.
4776000	4784000	And I had, uh, that came out in 2002, and then the Famicom miniseries came out in 2004.
4784000	4796000	So, basically, like I had said before, joust, you know, like, um, you play as a balloon fighter who has balloons attached to his helmet, which totally wouldn't work in the real world. Don't try this at home, kids.
4796000	4800000	And you keep pressing the A button or holding down the B button to flap his arms and rise into the air.
4800000	4806000	If your balloon is popped, or if one of the balloons is popped, then you lose some flotation, making it a lot harder to rise.
4806000	4809000	And if you lose both of your balloons, then, you know, you're dead.
4809000	4812000	You fall to the ground and crash your head open.
4812000	4813000	And you die, die, die.
4814000	4822000	I'm kidding. Um, if you fall into the water, you can get eaten by a large piranha, too, which is awesome. Or you can get hit by lightning.
4822000	4831000	So you have the one player and then you have the two player game, um, where you just have to clear the enemy, and then you have Balloon Trip, which is the second video. Rob.
4831000	4837000	Uh, yes, which I actually, I think some of the music just played there in the background, but let me, let me bring up video number two.
4837000	4839000	This is the Balloon Trip music, which is the full theme.
4839000	4840000	Okay.
4840000	4844000	Um, Balloon Trip is where you're supposed to avoid obstacles on a side-scrolling stage.
4844000	4852000	Um, the original arcade version did not have Balloon Trip, but the, um, but I mean, it's, it's different every time you do it.
4852000	4858000	Um, so basically you just have to clean off the stages and you burst balloons for other people, and you have your bonus stages.
4858000	4864000	You have, now I mentioned all of the other versions as well. It was also on Animal Crossing on GameCube.
4864000	4875000	Um, there was a Game & Watch version as well, uh, and it was based off of the Balloon Trip mode, and then, um, you play as Balloon Man.
4875000	4887000	Uh, there were also, there was a sequel called Balloon Kid that came out in 1990, um, 1991 in Europe, um, on the Game Boy, that, uh, turned into a platforming version.
4887000	4896000	And it, uh, did not come out in Japan, but there was a version that was Hello Kitty World that came out, um, that had all that on there.
4896000	4901000	There was a port on the Sharp, uh, Zaris, the PDAs.
4901000	4910000	And I don't know if you were going to mention it or not, but lest we forget the Tingle version, that they had a Balloon Trip as well.
4910000	4917000	Yes, there was, uh, you had, uh, hold on, because I was just actually getting to one of that.
4917000	4922000	You can actually get the Balloon Fighter Helmet as a power-up for the Wii U, uh, Super Smash Brothers.
4922000	4927000	Um, and then in WarioWare, you had a Balloon Fight version as well.
4927000	4931000	Uh, there was Yoshi Touch and Go that had Yoshi's Balloon Trip.
4932000	4940000	Um, we had the Tingle one as well, which was called Tingle's Balloon Fight for Nintendo DS.
4940000	4947000	Um, it came out on Virtual Console a few times. It's been on the Wii U Virtual Console.
4947000	4953000	So yeah, there's a lot of Balloon Fight. I'm looking at just an entire page of Balloon Fight right the fuck now.
4954000	4963000	Never-ending Balloon Fight information. Well, and, uh, in Smash Brothers, the villager uses some of that Balloon Fight stuff.
4963000	4966000	Well, that's why I said there's a power-up. It's the Balloon Fight Helmet.
4966000	4971000	Yeah, yeah. Is it actually in Smash Brothers, or is that the balloon for, like, the packages that come in?
4971000	4975000	No, no, no, they have the Balloon Fight Helmet in the two new ones.
4976000	4997000	Yeah. So, it has been out on Arcade, Famicom, PC-88, uh, Sharp X1, uh, Game & Watch, Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, the Sharp Xaris, the GBA eReader, uh, other versions on GBA DS, Wii Virtual Console, 3DS Virtual Console, and Wii U Virtual Console.
4997000	5005000	So, Nintendo, I know we love, we know you love Balloon Fight, but really, that's a lot of fucking Balloon Fight.
5005000	5012000	And, and, surprisingly, they never really revisited the game for as much as they, you know, are kinda, you know, on this game.
5012000	5014000	Balloon Fight for Oculus.
5014000	5016000	Balloon Fight 2.
5016000	5018000	Now it's personal.
5018000	5020000	Bigger, fluffier balloons.
5020000	5022000	Silicon.
5022000	5024000	Mylar balloons.
5025000	5027000	Alright. Anyhow.
5027000	5030000	Yeah, that would be like a power-up, you get the Mylar balloons that, like, never fucking die.
5030000	5032000	Exactly. Pop this, motherfucker.
5032000	5033000	Yeah.
5033000	5036000	You could, if it hits the power line, and in which case, you know.
5036000	5038000	Electrocutes everyone.
5038000	5039000	That's right.
5039000	5040000	Breaks the power line.
5040000	5042000	That's right. Shuts down power in the entire city all night.
5042000	5043000	Alright.
5043000	5045000	And then everyone tries to hunt you down with your balloons.
5045000	5046000	There it is.
5046000	5047000	And kill you.
5047000	5050000	Classic Game of the Week Balloon Fight on the NES.
5051000	5054000	You know what? We have a lot of imagination.
5054000	5056000	We do. We have some very active imaginations.
5056000	5062000	Which we hope people will turn to reality in our video game jam that's going on right now.
5062000	5065000	I'm gonna hire someone. I'm gonna outsource my game to Russia.
5065000	5067000	So I can be, like, a real developer.
5070000	5072000	That's pretty good. I like that.
5072000	5074000	Alright, we're gonna take a break, guys. We are gonna take a quick break.
5074000	5078000	When we come back, we're gonna do rapid-fire news, and then we're gonna get into it.
5078000	5081000	All your gaming podcasts are gonna be doing this this week.
5081000	5083000	Our top games of 2014.
5083000	5087000	The top three games of the year from us here in the OLR Studios.
5087000	5089000	And from you guys out there on the internet, on Skype.
5089000	5091000	Username OrangeLoungeRadio.
5091000	5094000	Via phone, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5094000	5100000	We are gonna be hearing your top three games of the year when we come back with a break with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.
5100000	5109000	Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.
5109000	5112000	Live on this Sunday, December the 28th, 2014.
5112000	5117000	Episode 581 of our show, currently in progress.
5117000	5122000	We are about to get to our top three games of the year and your top three games of the year.
5122000	5125000	Gonna be able to call us on Skype here shortly.
5125000	5128000	Username OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word on Skype.
5128000	5132000	Or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5132000	5137000	But first, we have some rapid-fire news to get to before we get to the big games of the year list.
5137000	5138000	So, Loki, let's get to it.
5138000	5145000	Alright. Wasn't a whole lot this week, but let's start off with a cool cameo that's gonna be happening with a couple indie games.
5145000	5150000	You may remember there's, well actually, both of these were Kickstarters at one time.
5150000	5157000	But Road Redemption, which is in Early Access, and it's kind of like a spiritual successor to Road Rash.
5157000	5161000	Well, they're gonna get a cameo from Shovel Knight in that as well.
5161000	5167000	And you can actually use Shovel Knight as a character in the game and hit people on motorcycles with the shovel.
5167000	5169000	So that's pretty awesome.
5169000	5176000	So, check that out. I guess, I think that's a free download that they're gonna be including in there.
5177000	5185000	If you're playing on pre-ordering the Resident Evil HD collection, or I should say the remake that they're doing in HD,
5185000	5189000	on the PlayStation Network, you can actually get that as a cross-buy title.
5189000	5195000	So if you don't have a PlayStation 4 yet, or maybe you own a PlayStation 3 and a PlayStation 4,
5195000	5199000	if you buy it digitally, you will get it unlocked on both systems.
5199000	5200000	So that's pretty awesome.
5200000	5206000	It is only available, though, to pre-order, so you have to purchase the game before it comes out.
5206000	5212000	And it looks like that will be coming out on January 20th, 2015.
5214000	5219000	And then, let's see, last but not least, because of the whole hacking incident,
5219000	5228000	Rockstar Games is extending their Grand Theft Auto Christmas event that they have going on for Grand Theft Auto Online,
5228000	5233000	which includes some different outfits and stuff you can buy.
5233000	5237000	Hopefully that means the snow, because I missed the snow again for the second time in the year.
5237000	5241000	They always do snow around the holidays in the game, which is kind of cool.
5241000	5247000	So, yeah. And I guess that'll be now available through January 5th.
5248000	5255000	That's good that they are extending that. I hope some other games extend their holiday stuff, too, to kind of make up for that.
5255000	5258000	Destiny, I think, was doing their event that they had going on.
5258000	5261000	They're extending that out, but I didn't remember how long that was, too.
5261000	5268000	Dragon Age multiplayer, I know if you log on, you can get a Mary Chest or something like that right now,
5268000	5271000	and they extended that as well, so you can get that later.
5271000	5272000	That's kind of nice.
5272000	5277000	I finally, finally full-cleared a map on Dragon Age multiplayer.
5277000	5282000	That was hard. This is no joke, the Dragon Age multiplayer, but I finally did that this week.
5282000	5284000	I have yet to play it.
5284000	5289000	It's interesting. You should check it out. It's very different than the Mass Effect multiplayer, but sadly, I'm on PlayStation 4.
5289000	5293000	I've had to play with nothing but strangers, but I just turned the voice communication off, and it's fine.
5293000	5298000	Again, the nice thing is it's co-op, so for them to sit there and just say, like,
5298000	5301000	You suck! It's not going to help anybody.
5301000	5303000	Usually, co-op people are a little bit more civil.
5303000	5304000	Exactly.
5304000	5307000	Unless you're really holding things up somehow.
5307000	5309000	In which case, again, they're only going to end up hurting themselves.
5309000	5313000	They start berating you, then you just quit, and then they have to play with one less person,
5313000	5316000	which really is a hard thing to have in Dragon Age.
5316000	5322000	Completely off-topic. I don't know if it's actually today, but has Stan Lee turned 92?
5322000	5326000	I have no idea if today is his birthday, but that sounds about the right age.
5326000	5328000	It's fucking intense.
5328000	5331000	He's an antique. He's a national treasure.
5331000	5333000	He's not allowed to die.
5333000	5334000	Never.
5334000	5335000	Excelsior, then.
5335000	5336000	Excelsior, exactly.
5336000	5339000	Him and Betty White should, like, collaborate.
5339000	5341000	I'm not sure on what, but it would be awesome.
5341000	5344000	They should stop, collaborate, and listen.
5347000	5348000	Oh, you. Alright.
5348000	5350000	That's it for Rapid Fire News.
5350000	5352000	That's it. That's all we got.
5352000	5356000	I know usually Dark Soccer and I have something, but it was kind of a slow news week, guys.
5356000	5357000	It's the holidays.
5357000	5360000	So, we're ready to get into, and instead of the frugal question of the week,
5360000	5362000	we're going to invite you guys to participate tonight.
5362000	5366000	By the way, TigerConChat says, you're right, 92 years old today.
5366000	5369000	Gives a little link there if you want to see that in our chat room.
5369000	5370000	Alright.
5370000	5373000	We're going to invite all you guys to participate with this segment tonight.
5373000	5376000	It is the Resequate. You must do this.
5376000	5378000	We've been doing this show for what?
5378000	5380000	We're going into our 13th year next year.
5380000	5381000	92 years.
5381000	5383000	Stan Lee was bored.
5383000	5388000	You guys, when we started this show, Stan Lee was only 80.
5388000	5391000	Dude, I got to say, he looks great for 92.
5391000	5392000	He does.
5392000	5393000	He doesn't.
5393000	5394000	And he still goes to all these cons and everything.
5394000	5395000	I don't know what's funny, actually.
5395000	5400000	He, uh, the guy, um, uh, crap, why did I forget his name?
5400000	5404000	Um, Joe Simon, who created Captain America.
5404000	5408000	Stan Lee was like an intern when he was drawing comics.
5408000	5409000	Wow.
5409000	5411000	So, he's actually mentioned in his book.
5411000	5414000	And they're saying in chat, TigerCon and Jason are saying it was actually yesterday.
5414000	5416000	His birthday was yesterday.
5416000	5417000	Close enough.
5417000	5420000	You know what, when you're 92, your birthday can go for an entire week.
5420000	5422000	I think that's acceptable, actually.
5422000	5423000	So, there you have it.
5423000	5424000	Anyway.
5424000	5425000	Alright.
5425000	5426000	Are we going to talk about Stan Lee for the rest of the show?
5426000	5427000	Or are we going to do our top three games?
5427000	5428000	You know what?
5428000	5429000	Don't answer that.
5429000	5430000	Don't answer that question.
5430000	5434000	I was going to say, ironically, if you do still are going to play my, uh, fortune cookie
5434000	5437000	message of the week, it's so appropriate and I didn't even realize it.
5437000	5438000	Alright.
5438000	5439000	Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the show for that.
5439000	5440000	Alright.
5440000	5444000	For now, though, it is time to get into our top three games of 2014.
5444000	5446000	Do we have a bumper or something for that?
5446000	5448000	I feel like we need, I feel like we need like a...
5448000	5449000	Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
5450000	5454000	We need like a CNN or whatever style, like, graphic.
5454000	5456000	This is all I was able to get on our budget.
5464000	5465000	There you go.
5465000	5468000	Our top games of 2014 and yours.
5468000	5471000	We're going to open up the Skype line in a little bit.
5471000	5476000	But first, it's time to go around the studio and see what were your top three picks for
5476000	5477000	the year.
5477000	5480000	And, um, again, I always give this disclaimer.
5480000	5481000	There is no right or wrong answer.
5481000	5486000	You know, sometimes games from 2013 might sneak their way onto this list and that's
5486000	5491000	okay, uh, because of Steam sales and other sales and bargain bins in retail.
5491000	5496000	You know, there's only so much a human being can play in a year worth of video games, especially
5496000	5499000	when you're not paid to do it for a living, as none of us are and I don't think any of
5499000	5500000	you are.
5500000	5503000	Um, so, uh, there's no right or wrong answer.
5503000	5509000	This is just your three favorite games of the year and, uh, let's get to it.
5509000	5511000	I'll start with you, Loki, because I'm dying to know.
5511000	5513000	I can probably guess hers.
5513000	5514000	Yours I have no idea.
5514000	5515000	So, I'm going to start with you.
5515000	5520000	Loki, what is your number three game of the year?
5520000	5523000	I guess my number three game of the year, I mean, I, God, I don't even know how many
5523000	5524000	games I've played this year.
5524000	5527000	It's very small because I've been working on games.
5528000	5535000	Um, so, I guess if I had to pick something, probably, well, Lego Marvel Super Heroes,
5535000	5536000	I guess.
5536000	5537000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
5537000	5540000	And it's, I don't know, it's a decent game.
5540000	5543000	It's kind of my introduction to the whole Lego games because I haven't really played
5543000	5545000	any of those before and I like it.
5545000	5548000	I like the open world-ness of it, which is kind of fun.
5548000	5554000	Um, and this, the details, you know, like the humor of the game and stuff is pretty
5554000	5555000	nice.
5555000	5558000	It's a little buggy, you know, and I get frustrated sometimes.
5558000	5561000	Well, they were just participating in the game jam, Loki.
5561000	5567000	Well, yeah, some of the level design is kind of like, ehhh, like, I don't know, but it's
5567000	5568000	fun.
5568000	5570000	It's nice to see all the, you know, the Marvel cameos in there and stuff.
5570000	5572000	So, I think it's pretty awesome.
5572000	5573000	Alright.
5573000	5574000	Stan Lee's in it the whole time.
5574000	5576000	So, you did work Stan Lee into this segment.
5576000	5577000	Damn you, Loki, damn you.
5577000	5578000	Alright.
5578000	5579000	Uh, there it is.
5579000	5582000	Loki's pick for number three game of the year.
5582000	5584000	Dark Sakura.
5584000	5585000	I'm dying to know.
5585000	5587000	I think I know, but I don't know.
5587000	5588000	My number three?
5588000	5589000	So, tell me, yeah, your number three.
5589000	5591000	I'm gonna go Five Nights at Freddy's.
5591000	5592000	Five Nights at Freddy's.
5592000	5594000	I'm not any good at it.
5594000	5598000	I've died way too many times, but for just something that snuck up out of fucking nowhere,
5598000	5600000	it's pretty intense.
5600000	5601000	It is kind of-
5601000	5602000	And it's fucking scary.
5602000	5606000	It's all of my childhood nightmares in one game.
5606000	5609000	Like, the only thing that would make it worse is clowns.
5609000	5612000	Which, oh, don't give him ideas for Five Nights at Freddy's.
5612000	5613000	Three.
5613000	5615000	And we've got the sequel in the first year because the first-
5615000	5616000	Ah, fuck!
5616000	5621000	Well, they already have, like, the timeline in place, and there's, like, prequels and
5621000	5622000	stuff.
5622000	5625000	I forget how the games fall in line, but there's a whole, like, lore video and stuff.
5625000	5626000	Yeah.
5626000	5631000	It is kind of the indie darling of the year in many ways, and a lot of people are talking
5631000	5632000	about it at the same time.
5632000	5634000	And it's made furry cosplay cool again.
5634000	5636000	No, it was always cool, but still.
5636000	5637000	Yeah.
5637000	5641000	And sells like crazy on iTunes right now, I'm noticing.
5641000	5646000	I looked at, like, the top three paid apps in games right now is Minecraft.
5646000	5648000	It will be number one for all eternity.
5648000	5649000	It will be Minecraft.
5649000	5652000	And then number two and three are Five Nights at Freddy's 1 and 2.
5652000	5653000	See, here's the thing.
5653000	5657000	Remember, was it that, um, remember how Miyamoto was supposed to be working on it?
5657000	5660000	Was it the Project Watch or whatever?
5660000	5663000	Andy Guy beat you to it, and it's already, you know, fantastic.
5663000	5667000	Whatever you're going to do with it, I'm sorry, but it's not going to be as good.
5667000	5671000	Looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, VX Jason XV says,
5671000	5674000	I can't bring myself to play Five Nights at Freddy's.
5674000	5676000	I want to, but oh my God.
5676000	5678000	That's kind of the same boat I'm in.
5678000	5683000	And trust me, guys, ActDeaf was kind enough to buy me a copy of the game going,
5683000	5685000	you should livestream this, Rob.
5685000	5686000	You should livestream this.
5686000	5689000	And then Shane, every night, every night.
5689000	5692000	So, tonight's the night you're going to livestream Five Nights at Freddy's.
5692000	5694000	No, no, Shane, I'm playing Diablo 3.
5694000	5696000	Tonight's the night you're going to livestream, why not?
5696000	5698000	It's just like, oh my God, every night.
5698000	5701000	At some point, I will do the livestream of Five Nights at Freddy's, but not tonight.
5701000	5705000	I think number two has the puppet, which is sort of like a clown.
5705000	5711000	Number two also has the mask that you can use to try to fool them,
5711000	5714000	except some of them can always see through the mask.
5714000	5716000	The second one's on my wish list.
5716000	5719000	I haven't even finished, well, I've died in the first one.
5719000	5721000	I guess that counts as finishing the game.
5721000	5724000	Wasn't that a trope from the original Halloween movie,
5724000	5727000	where like the beginning of the movie, you were seeing it through Michael's mask,
5727000	5729000	and that's the whole, I forget, anyway.
5729000	5732000	No, you can actually put on one of the masks of one of the animatronics,
5732000	5734000	so that they think you're one of them.
5734000	5735000	Oh, interesting.
5735000	5739000	All right, let's see, my number three game of the year.
5739000	5740000	You know what's funny?
5740000	5744000	I also, this is hard, by the way, because I've been switching back,
5744000	5748000	like two, three, and four have all been flipping around places,
5748000	5751000	but I think I finally have what I want to do.
5751000	5754000	And my number three happens to be a scary game as well,
5754000	5758000	but I went a different place, and I think some people are going to be surprised,
5758000	5762000	and some people are going to say, you can't put that on a game of the year list.
5762000	5765000	You cannot put that game on a best game of the year list.
5765000	5767000	If it's what I think it is, it was my number two.
5767000	5771000	And I'm going to tell you, I can do whatever the fuck I want, it's my list,
5771000	5776000	and my number three game of the year is PT, is my number three.
5776000	5777000	I have to pick a new number two now.
5777000	5779000	No you don't, you can pick whatever you want.
5779000	5780000	You can pick whatever you want.
5780000	5783000	Here's the thing, and a lot of you guys are going, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Rob.
5783000	5786000	PT is a demo for Silent Hill.
5786000	5788000	It's a concept, it's not a myth.
5788000	5790000	Yeah, and that's the thing, is that at the very end, it tells you,
5790000	5794000	this might not reflect the actual game.
5794000	5797000	But let us also consider a few things about PT.
5797000	5802000	One, it was free. That's the best fucking price for a game all year. It was free.
5802000	5806000	Two, it was a legitimate surprise that came out of nowhere,
5806000	5809000	and that continued to surprise right up until the very end.
5809000	5815000	In fact, I think people still don't know how to beat this game, for sure, definitive every time.
5815000	5820000	And what I also love about this game, think about it,
5820000	5824000	people did not know that it was a Silent Hill concept thing, right?
5824000	5830000	And then suddenly it's being streamed on Twitch, as a lot of people do these days,
5830000	5836000	and a small mid-level streamer overseas was actually the first one to find
5836000	5841000	and discover that PT was in fact a trailer for Silent Hill.
5841000	5844000	And it's on her little stream where she's celebrating like,
5844000	5847000	oh my gosh, oh my gosh, and she's like screaming along to all this.
5847000	5851000	It was a really great element of surprise that we didn't really see at all.
5851000	5856000	Like, in the age of the internet, how many surprises actually stay under wraps anymore?
5856000	5859000	Very, very, very few. So, that's it.
5859000	5863000	My number three game of the year is PT.
5863000	5865000	I noticed, just walking into studio...
5865000	5867000	I'm changing mine.
5867000	5868000	You don't have to change.
5868000	5869000	I am.
5869000	5873000	Alright. You're going to get real mad at me in a minute.
5873000	5877000	But anyway, walking into studio here, I see that Shane has joined us.
5877000	5878000	Hello.
5878000	5879000	How are you doing?
5879000	5880000	Fine, tired.
5880000	5881000	Tired?
5881000	5882000	Yes.
5882000	5883000	You're wearing an Assassin's Creed shirt today, it looks like.
5883000	5884000	Yeah, I'm wearing two hoodies.
5884000	5885000	Does that mean that...
5885000	5887000	It has a hood here, and then it has a hood here.
5887000	5890000	Wait, you have two... Why are you wearing two hoodies? Is that cool?
5890000	5892000	Because that's just how it worked out.
5892000	5894000	So, does that mean your game of the year is Assassin's Creed Unity?
5894000	5895000	Never.
5895000	5897000	Never? Alright.
5897000	5899000	Well, I thought you might want to play along with us.
5899000	5901000	Do you have a number... We're on number three.
5901000	5903000	Do you have a number three game of the year?
5903000	5908000	My number three has already been said, but my number three is Five Nights at Freddy's.
5908000	5910000	Because it's amazing.
5910000	5914000	And for the reasons you guys already talked about, for the most part, I love the lore.
5914000	5917000	So, I'm actually going to combine one and two because they came out this year.
5917000	5919000	So, the Five Nights at Freddy's series.
5919000	5923000	The lore is amazing. It's frightening as all get out.
5923000	5929000	I played over at Blocko Jones' place with him and his wife, and there was lots of screaming going on.
5929000	5932000	It was so good. I loved it. It was really fun.
5932000	5935000	I'm anxious to see a third game.
5935000	5941000	And even today on my lunch, I was reading just stuff about Five Nights at Freddy's because it's really engrossing.
5941000	5945000	Alright. I'm gonna... I swear I will check this game out at some point.
5945000	5946000	Tonight.
5946000	5947000	Not tonight!
5947000	5948000	It would make a great movie, I think.
5948000	5950000	Yeah. Maybe that's where it's headed. Who knows?
5950000	5953000	Alright. Let's get to the number two choices.
5953000	5955000	So, it's time for the number two picks.
5955000	5956000	Number two picks of the year.
5956000	5959000	So, Shane, this time I'm starting with you because you're the guest walking in here.
5959000	5961000	So, what's your number two game of the year?
5961000	5963000	My number two has also already been said.
5963000	5964000	P.T.
5964000	5967000	I don't care if you say it's a demo. It is a demo.
5967000	5973000	It's better than, apparently, all but one game that came out this year for me.
5973000	5977000	So, P.T. was scary. It was intense.
5977000	5983000	I love the mystery around it. Even the next little teaser trailer they had was really interesting.
5983000	5987000	I'm still sad that so far there's no Akira Yamaoka.
5987000	5996000	But I like the direction they're taking and I have not been excited about a Silent Hill game like this since four.
5996000	5997000	Alright.
5997000	5998000	Which was like ten years ago.
5998000	5999000	That's right.
5999000	6001000	As you guys did on one of the shows.
6001000	6005000	Alright. Well, then let's go around and get everybody else's number two game.
6005000	6008000	So, Loki, what is your number two game?
6008000	6011000	My number two game is technically a remake.
6011000	6013000	But that would be Grand Theft Auto 5, the next-gen version.
6013000	6015000	Because it was just so...
6015000	6021000	They took a great game already that was just kind of phenomenal and just took it even further.
6021000	6024000	They literally turned it to eleven.
6024000	6026000	Seriously, it's going to be awesome.
6026000	6031000	And I love the fact that they're going to have DLC coming out hopefully sooner than later because it's been forever.
6032000	6034000	But it just looks amazing on next-gen.
6034000	6036000	Or current-gen, I guess.
6036000	6038000	So that would be my number two.
6038000	6040000	Even though I've only played it for a few hours.
6040000	6042000	But it's still fantastic.
6042000	6046000	I would have called Shenanigans if that game did not show up on your list somewhere.
6046000	6048000	So, there it is.
6048000	6050000	I considered not having it on there.
6050000	6052000	Really? Shenanigans.
6052000	6055000	Alright. Dark Sakura, your number two pick.
6055000	6057000	My heart still says P.T.
6057000	6059000	Then go with P.T.
6059000	6062000	Because I kind of have a sort of a middle one that also goes with it.
6062000	6064000	Goat Simulator.
6065000	6067000	Your number two game is Goat Simulator.
6067000	6068000	It's Goat Simulator.
6068000	6069000	Awesome.
6069000	6072000	I love P.T. and it stands in its own little category in my heart.
6072000	6074000	But I will go with Goat Simulator because...
6074000	6076000	Goat.
6079000	6081000	Is it just because you love goats or is it just because...
6081000	6083000	Goats are adorable. You shut up.
6083000	6087000	No, I mean, I liked Goat Simulator a lot too because it was just...
6088000	6092000	It was kind of like the video game you just want.
6092000	6094000	You just wanted this in a game.
6096000	6101000	Meaning that, you know, you just do whatever the hell you want and you get points for acting like an asshole.
6101000	6103000	That's what Goat Simulator is.
6103000	6104000	What?
6106000	6108000	Speaking of acting like an asshole.
6108000	6109000	Alright.
6109000	6111000	Well, I'm about to act like an asshole too.
6111000	6114000	Jamie's going to be very upset when she hears my number two.
6114000	6116000	You're going to pick my number one.
6116000	6118000	I know I'm going to. I'm totally going to.
6118000	6119000	Because you're a bitch.
6119000	6122000	I have to. You can't have me change this.
6122000	6124000	This really is my number two game of the year.
6124000	6129000	It's a great game with a lot of depth.
6129000	6136000	And honestly, even in its single player mode alone, it would be a contender for top game of the year.
6136000	6145000	But then that there's this whole second game that's tacked onto it that although might not be as enriched as some that have come before it.
6145000	6150000	I still think this game is definitely deserving a lot of the accolades it's going to get.
6150000	6153000	Including one from probably Dark Soccer here in about two minutes.
6153000	6155000	But my number two game of the year is Dragon Age Inquisition.
6160000	6164000	And for a lot of the reasons we've discussed, but I'll allow others to elaborate here in a moment.
6165000	6167000	Loki, your number two game of the year.
6168000	6169000	I already did my number two game.
6169000	6170000	I'm sorry, what?
6170000	6171000	Derp.
6171000	6172000	Shane.
6172000	6173000	We're going to get to number ones now, right?
6173000	6174000	Yes.
6174000	6175000	Number ones.
6175000	6176000	This is it.
6176000	6177000	Number one game.
6177000	6178000	Do the thing.
6178000	6179000	The best.
6179000	6180000	Do the thing.
6180000	6181000	Shane, what is your number one game of the year?
6181000	6185000	Well, I'll let Jamie talk about this.
6185000	6187000	Because my number one is Dragon Age.
6187000	6188000	Hands down.
6188000	6194000	So, instead I'll take this time to discuss my top three least favorite games of the year.
6194000	6195000	Or biggest disappointments.
6195000	6196000	Oh, wait.
6196000	6197000	I want to come back to this later.
6197000	6198000	No, I want to come back to this later.
6198000	6200000	Then let me just say, I have not beaten Dragon Age yet.
6200000	6201000	I haven't touched multiplayer.
6201000	6206000	I made somewhere around 16 different characters because I'm never satisfied with the way my character looks.
6206000	6207000	Yes.
6207000	6208000	What?
6208000	6209000	Yes.
6209000	6210000	Yeah.
6210000	6214000	I have, between those characters, spent well over 100 hours in the game.
6214000	6215000	And I haven't beaten it yet.
6215000	6217000	And I've done over 100 hours.
6217000	6223000	So, this is by far my number one favorite game of the year.
6223000	6224000	Nothing comes...
6224000	6225000	Well, P.T. came close.
6225000	6226000	Came close.
6226000	6227000	Very, very close.
6227000	6229000	But Dragon Age won.
6229000	6230000	Alright.
6230000	6233000	Well, Loki, don't mind me if I go out of order for a minute here.
6233000	6234000	But now seems like a good time to...
6234000	6235000	Oh, my God.
6235000	6236000	Something just occurred to me.
6236000	6238000	If you would have switched to P.T., we would have had the same list.
6238000	6239000	That would have been...
6239000	6240000	Yeah.
6240000	6241000	Unless, unless, unless.
6241000	6245000	Now, wouldn't it be cool if one of the mounts in Dragon Age Inquisition was a goat?
6245000	6247000	It's getting dangerously close to sheep.
6247000	6249000	And I can't do that.
6249000	6250000	Alright.
6250000	6253000	I'm going to skip around in a different order because I just have this funny feeling that
6253000	6255000	Dark Soccer should probably tell us her number one at this time.
6255000	6259000	So, Dark Soccer, what is your number one game of the year?
6259000	6260000	Transistor.
6260000	6261000	I'm kidding.
6261000	6262000	You thought about that one.
6262000	6263000	You were thinking about that one.
6263000	6264000	I did.
6264000	6265000	Transistor was really good.
6265000	6268000	Plus, I'm playing it on my Mac, so it makes me happy.
6268000	6270000	No, it's Dragon Age Inquisition.
6270000	6271000	I'm at my current playthrough.
6271000	6273000	I'm at 68 hours.
6273000	6276000	I am putting off the inevitable because I'm doing the soulless romance.
6276000	6281000	And everyone who has been paying attention knows that my heart is going to be ripped
6281000	6285000	out of my chest, stepped upon, shat upon, and kicked across a cow field so it will end
6285000	6286000	in more shit.
6286000	6287000	Because soulless.
6288000	6289000	Oh, it's in the name.
6289000	6290000	Soulless.
6292000	6294000	I will need soulless after that.
6294000	6295000	Haha.
6295000	6298000	Anyway, I've really been enjoying the game.
6298000	6302000	I've been exploring everything, and I've also tried to break the game.
6302000	6306000	I've decided that I'm not modding it until I beat it, and I'm probably not going to beat
6306000	6308000	it for at least another 40 hours.
6308000	6311000	Because I'm going to do everything so that the last thing I do is have my heart stepped
6311000	6312000	on before I beat it.
6312000	6316000	But in 40 hours, how long is that in actual days you're going to play it?
6316000	6320000	Because I'm giving myself until March to beat it, because I don't think it will be
6320000	6321000	before March.
6321000	6326000	I remade it after, I remade my Inquisitor a few times after, until I found the one I
6326000	6330000	liked, after playing it for four days.
6330000	6333000	And then since then I've been playing, but I've been playing only a few nights after
6333000	6335000	work, except when I had the flu.
6335000	6336000	And I played drunk.
6336000	6338000	That was funny because I kept getting motion sick.
6338000	6339000	Oh, I could see that in that game.
6339000	6343000	I've decided that if I could live anywhere in that world, I would move into the Emerald
6343000	6348000	Graves, have a tent there, and just poke people in the eye until they left me alone.
6348000	6353000	Even on my 70 hour playthrough that I just ditched recently, I don't think I ever made
6353000	6354000	it there.
6354000	6355000	Because I'm so bad.
6355000	6358000	I'm in the hissing wastes now, and I just keep thinking, why do they call it that?
6358000	6361000	There's just people going, sssssssss.
6361000	6362000	Probably.
6362000	6363000	Yeah.
6363000	6364000	It's the Templars.
6364000	6365000	Alright.
6365000	6366000	Always, always kill the Templars.
6366000	6368000	Always side with the mages.
6368000	6369000	Yes.
6369000	6370000	Alright.
6370000	6371000	Always romance soulless if you're a female elf.
6371000	6374000	Now that we've gotten all the Dragon Age out of our list, because I have this funny
6374000	6376000	feeling Loki probably didn't name it as number one.
6376000	6377000	I get to ride around on a giant elk.
6377000	6378000	But who knows?
6378000	6380000	I haven't played it, so it's a good bet.
6380000	6382000	Well, we're about to find out.
6382000	6385000	Loki, what is your number one game of 2014?
6385000	6390000	My number one game of 2014 is probably the one I talked about the most, which would have
6390000	6392000	been Goat Simulator.
6392000	6394000	Wow.
6394000	6396000	I'm really surprised at how many common trends we're seeing.
6396000	6397000	Alright.
6397000	6399000	Well, I didn't play that much this year, so I mean, it's...
6399000	6400000	Sure.
6400000	6401000	It's hilarious.
6401000	6406000	It's because, I mean, they have, you know, they've been doing updates for it, and they've
6406000	6411000	added so much content to the game, and now they have, was it the online MMO simulator,
6411000	6413000	whatever, with the microwave class.
6413000	6416000	It's, you know, a microwave with feet walking around.
6416000	6419000	So, I mean, it's awesome.
6419000	6421000	And it's such a silly, broken game.
6421000	6422000	And I love that.
6422000	6425000	Can't wait to play it on console, because my computer doesn't run it very well.
6425000	6426000	Awesome.
6426000	6427000	Well, there it is.
6427000	6428000	Number one game of the year.
6428000	6429000	Alright.
6429000	6434000	Mine, I guess, is going to be somewhat of a unique pick, because nobody had it on their
6434000	6435000	list anywhere.
6435000	6444000	In fact, this entire console was sorely underrepresented on our list here for how well, I think, the
6444000	6445000	Wii U did this year.
6445000	6452000	And Nintendo, as a developer and a publisher, have done very well this year.
6452000	6457000	They're all they've got on their own console, and they're giving people reasons to buy a
6457000	6458000	Wii U this year.
6458000	6463000	And they've obviously had a lot of strong titles, and some of you may be surprised at
6463000	6468000	which one of the Wii U titles I'm going to pick to sort of represent as my game of the
6468000	6469000	year.
6469000	6475000	But I really think in looking back as to what game came out that really made people go,
6475000	6478000	oh, shit, I should really think about getting a Wii U.
6478000	6485000	What game is just so much fun, which is what a video game should be, so much fun that practically
6485000	6488000	anybody can pick up a controller and jump right into this game.
6488000	6495000	What game pushed things forward for Nintendo when it came to being more social, finally
6495000	6500000	getting the online play right, and giving people the online play they wanted out of
6500000	6507000	Nintendo, and actually doing the social sharing in a new way that didn't just, let's add
6507000	6511000	Twitch TV streaming as well, because fuck, everybody else is doing it, let's do it too.
6511000	6518000	It did its own thing, and it did it so well that it spawned a meme that lasted almost
6518000	6520000	the entire rest of the year.
6520000	6524000	You've probably figured out by now I'm talking about Mario Kart 8, I believe to be the best
6524000	6526000	game of 2014.
6526000	6528000	Why are you laughing over there, Jamie?
6528000	6531000	Just because I'm thinking of the convention Luigi.
6531000	6535000	See, and Mario Kart 8 gave us all that, and I-
6535000	6538000	Convention Luigi replaced the ball pit.
6538000	6543000	I do recognize that for other people, it might be Smash Brothers Wii U, or it might
6543000	6547000	be Bayonetta 2 for you, and I totally get that and I respect it, and if I had a top
6547000	6552000	ten, those two would probably both be on it somewhere, but I think more than anything,
6552000	6560000	I think Mario Kart 8 really spoke volumes for fun in a year where unfortunately sometimes
6560000	6566000	a running theme was broken games that had to be patched and fixed after the fact, whereas
6566000	6571000	Mario Kart 8 instead delivered a solid game from the get-go where patches only stood to
6571000	6577000	enhance that, whether it be through comprehensive value-added DLC, not like nickel and dime
6577000	6583000	DLC but really robust DLC that was really good, to even patching in the amiibo support
6583000	6589000	which granted was a little silly and didn't necessarily add too much to the game, but
6589000	6594000	it added something that they really didn't have to add at all, but they did that because
6594000	6598000	they wanted to enrich those amiibos even more and let them do things in more games than
6598000	6602000	just Smash Brothers, so I just think Mario Kart 8 has been tremendously well supported
6602000	6609000	and how many people will go back to a game that came out six months ago and treat it
6609000	6612000	like it was new again, like that's what Mario Kart 8 went through when the DLC came out,
6612000	6616000	so for all those reasons, I think Mario Kart 8 was the strongest game that came out in
6616000	6622000	2014. Alright, we are going to be opening up the phone lines here shortly for your calls
6623000	6628000	at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, please note this is only to
6628000	6632000	discuss your top three games of the year. If you have other topics to talk about, we'll
6632000	6637000	open up the lines later for that. Just looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,
6637000	6643000	Dark Tetsuya says, To this day, I still play Mario Kart 8 with my parents. VX JasonXV says,
6643000	6650000	More people in my office play Mario Kart 8 than anything else. While we open up the line
6650000	6654000	and we get to some calls here shortly to discuss your top three games of the year,
6654000	6659000	Shane, I want to check in with you because you wanted to be the downer. No, I didn't
6659000	6664000	want to be the downer. I'm just going to stop you right there and talk over you. You're
6664000	6670000	very good at that. I am. So, I thought it would be more interesting to have your biggest
6670000	6675000	gaming disappointments of the year, because everybody finds the ones they like, but rarely
6675000	6681000	do you get a list of ones you just hate. So, I came up with three that I hate. And we'll
6681000	6685000	get to that right after this call, because we got a call coming in. So, we're going to
6685000	6688000	get into the three dislikes in a moment, but we have a call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange
6688000	6692000	Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, guys, it's Jason. Hey, Jason, how you doing? I'm pretty
6692000	6696000	good, and yourselves? Good to see you, my friend. As always. There was a lot of chatter
6696000	6702000	in the last show posting about your epic beard. Still making for great radio there. I love
6702000	6707000	it. No, I know, but you know what? You look like one of the people I work with. A bunch
6707000	6712000	of the guys I work with, actually. They can just imagine. Use your imaginations for what
6712000	6720000	Jason's deep, dulcet tones. He's missing plaid and an axe. Alternatively, go to bognetwork.com
6720000	6724000	and look at episode 580, and I have two links in there that you can go look at directly.
6724000	6730000	There you go. Fantastic. Jason, what are your top three games of 2014 and why? Number three
6730000	6737000	is Destiny, because it is the first effective first-person shooter MMO that I've played,
6737000	6745000	and as far as I've heard, that somebody actually finally got it right. It's not a pure MMO
6745000	6751000	in the widest extent, but it is a reliable first-person shooter. There's a group of coworkers
6751000	6756000	of mine that play right over here to my left that I'm actually looking at right now. One
6756000	6760000	of them brought his Xbox One into the office so that the three of them can sit down and
6760000	6765000	play, and they've done raids more days than I can think of for more hours than I care
6765000	6775000	to think about. I have leveled my character up to 20, and I think even 22 or 23, possibly,
6775000	6781000	but I'm not really an endgame person, so it's not so much that I enjoy the game for the
6781000	6788000	MMO merit, but I enjoy the mechanics that go into it, and I have a very, very big appreciation
6788000	6793000	for what Bungie managed to pull off. I think that's going to be a very polarizing title,
6793000	6797000	I think. I know a lot of people that loved it, I know a lot of people that didn't love
6797000	6805000	it, so that's a very interesting selection. Yeah, it's refreshing. It is truly unique
6805000	6812000	to the vast amounts of MMOs that are coming out, but it focused first-person shooter first,
6812000	6817000	RPG, MMO second, and in my opinion, they did it right, and with my soft spot for FPSs,
6817000	6821000	I thought they did a spectacular job of it. And you can do whatever you want with your
6821000	6825000	list. What about your number two? Number two is Titanfall, because I have continued to
6825000	6830000	play that game over the year. They have continued to add new modes to it that I need to make
6830000	6835000	time and branch out and actually play, but everything I just said about Destiny, but
6835000	6841000	even more, applied to the extent that Titanfall did it. That game, Titanfall is super fast,
6841000	6846000	it is super frantic. I actually just wrapped up a couple of rounds not terribly long ago,
6846000	6855000	and it's just fun. It's the best combination of agility, shooting, and just literally madness.
6855000	6861000	I went to it, I was playing Geometry Wars and Grand Theft Auto V and a couple of other
6861000	6865000	games, and I hadn't played Titanfall for a couple of weeks. I played the game, and it
6865000	6870000	was seriously three times faster than anything else I played, and I had to adjust to it again,
6870000	6873000	but it felt really good. You know, I think that's one of those games a lot of people
6873000	6878000	kind of forgot came out this year, because it came out so early in the year. Didn't it
6878000	6883000	come out late March 2013, though? No, I think Titanfall was like a March title. Wasn't it
6883000	6889000	bumped from the end of 2013? It was, it was the end of March for, or it was in March for
6889000	6896000	the Xbox One version. It was PC, or Xbox One and PC and Xbox 360 was in April. Huh, there
6896000	6903000	it is. I... Yeah, I think it had been bumped back from what it was originally supposed
6903000	6908000	to be in 2013. I'm trying to compare it to like when I got home after my trip, and, because
6908000	6914000	I played it here in the office before I went home, and then I played it, and I left San Francisco
6914000	6919000	in February. So it had to have been before March this year, but... Maybe it was... No,
6919000	6925000	because they had the beta out in February, because that's what toasted my laptop in February,
6925000	6928000	and I had to buy a new laptop. Maybe that's what it was, Jason, the beta. Okay. Yeah,
6928000	6932000	yeah, yeah, that's right. That did go on for a while, didn't it? Yep. Alright, so how about
6932000	6937000	your number one? Time is terrible. How about your number one? Number one is Grand Theft
6937000	6943000	Auto 5. I don't know how I missed Grand Theft Auto 4. It just never showed up on my radar.
6943000	6947000	I missed it outright. I barely touched San Andreas. I've actually never beaten a Grand
6947000	6952000	Theft Auto, and I really hope to break that trend. Grand Theft Auto 5 has been super engaging
6952000	6958000	to me. Like, scary engaging, and it's like, it's definitely like gotten into my mind.
6958000	6965000	The visual aspect of it is definitely in the uncanny valley. For anybody that hasn't heard
6965000	6972000	that term before, realism of things has gotten so good over time that it's just become obviously
6972000	6978000	bad, even though we're almost close to perfect. Like, there is just something rigid and strict
6978000	6984000	about recreating people's bodies that isn't footage that's obviously fake. Grand Theft
6984000	6990000	Auto 5 is right in the uncanny valley as far as the look of humans, but the acting and
6990000	6998000	the voice acting, the dialogue, the storyline, and as exaggerated as Grand Theft Auto 5 is,
6998000	7005000	it is consistently exaggerated in a way that just feels really, really good. I've really
7005000	7009000	enjoyed playing it, and like I said, I definitely need to beat that story for once.
7009000	7014000	Out of curiosity, are you playing Grand Theft Auto 5 in first person mode?
7014000	7016000	Most of the time.
7016000	7020000	You know what's interesting about that, Jason? You just named three first person shooters
7020000	7023000	as your game of the year. Did you ever think that would happen?
7023000	7030000	First person shooters and platformers have kind of been my go-to, and considering, it's
7030000	7035000	representative of this year. It's been very shooter heavy for me as I've slowly kind of gotten
7035000	7043000	myself back into a regular swing. Everything else was fun, but didn't really dominate my time.
7043000	7048000	Ultimately, especially looking back on my youth as well, it doesn't surprise me personally, no.
7048000	7054000	Alright. Well, it's a good list, Jason. I think there's a lot of people that would agree with you
7054000	7055000	on those picks.
7055000	7056000	Honorable mention?
7056000	7057000	Quickly.
7057000	7058000	Cook, Serve, Delicious.
7058000	7059000	Why?
7059000	7065000	It reminded me of a Japanese cooking game on a demo disc from many, many years ago, literally
7065000	7074000	from middle school or so. Very, very cheap, both in flash, the style of the game, and price.
7074000	7078000	It's just super fun. It's a really, really good game. I suggest everybody check it out.
7078000	7081000	I love that when I get reminded of games in the past. I love that.
7081000	7083000	It just hit me in all the right places.
7083000	7086000	Alright. Well, Jason, thank you so much for sharing your list. You have a good one.
7086000	7087000	Happy New Year, okay?
7087000	7088000	Happy New Year, guys.
7088000	7089000	Alright, later.
7089000	7090000	Bye.
7090000	7095000	Alright, back to you, Shane. I know you're dying to start in on your list here, so give us your number three.
7095000	7099000	Well, I'm going to give you all of them because I've got to go do something else while you break that computer.
7099000	7101000	Okay, this thing has been falling apart all night. Okay, yes.
7101000	7107000	Number three, Destiny. It's a really fun, terribly made game.
7107000	7110000	He just put it on his top three. You're putting it on your bottom three.
7110000	7112000	Yeah, it's my third least favorite game of the year.
7112000	7113000	Wow.
7113000	7116000	It feels like a fourth of a game. It's not that good.
7116000	7117000	Okay.
7117000	7124000	Number two, Legend of Korra. It takes a really amazing show and it's made by Platinum Games, which is a really amazing developer,
7124000	7127000	and somehow it turns out to be garbage like every other licensed game.
7127000	7134000	And then, surprisingly, my number one least favorite game of the year, Pokemon, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire.
7134000	7135000	What?
7135000	7139000	It's boring the crap out of me. I just have tried so hard to play it.
7139000	7141000	Who are you and what did you do with Shane?
7141000	7148000	I put 200 hours into X and Y. I've put maybe eight hours into Sapphire. I'm not liking it at all.
7148000	7150000	I really think it's not a good game.
7150000	7153000	What went wrong? Is this just a cheap cash-in game or what?
7153000	7157000	I feel like it is. They gave us a couple new mega evolutions. They changed the story a little bit.
7157000	7162000	They added some stuff, yet I'm still bored to tears. I cannot bring myself to play it.
7162000	7165000	Like, I pick it up and I start to play it and it's boring.
7165000	7166000	Wow.
7166000	7168000	So, that's it. I'm leaving. Bye.
7168000	7173000	Alright. Bye, Shane. Thanks for sharing your top three most disappointing games of the year.
7173000	7175000	My gosh, I'm surprised to hear that.
7175000	7178000	Well, let's go to the phones. We'll take another call. Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
7180000	7181000	Hey, this is Bobby.
7181000	7183000	Bobby, what's up, my friend?
7183000	7185000	I just got home. I was listening in the car.
7185000	7188000	Welcome home. Glad you were listening in the car.
7188000	7194000	I don't know whether I'm supposed to say congratulations, you get a show next week, or I'm sorry to hear you don't get paid.
7194000	7196000	It's congratulations, you get a show next week.
7196000	7197000	Alright.
7197000	7199000	I do not want to have to watch that again next week.
7199000	7205000	Oh, what you went through tonight. Alright. Well, welcome to our show, Bobby.
7205000	7209000	I miss talking on Sunday night, so I gotta usurp your time.
7209000	7218000	Any time. Any time. Well, you know we are talking about our games of the year, and I'm surprised you don't want to save this for your own show, but by all means, please indulge us.
7218000	7220000	Your top three games of the year.
7220000	7225000	Okay, so one of the games of the year is one that you've repeated, but the other two you haven't.
7225000	7226000	Alright.
7226000	7237000	So my third game of the year, it's because when I look at game, like for me personally, game of the year, it's something that brings something new and different to the table, or is something that I have had the most fun with.
7237000	7238000	Yep.
7238000	7241000	And number three is something that brings something new and different to the table.
7241000	7242000	Mm-hmm.
7242000	7243000	And that's fibbage.
7243000	7251000	Interesting choice. You know, Shane and I were talking last night about like our games of the year list, and we were actually talking about Jackbox Party Pack, kind of as a whole.
7251000	7260000	And that, for me, that is like a bubbling under title, where it would probably make my top ten, but just miss my top three. But I get you. I get you.
7260000	7271000	Yeah, and I mean I specifically like fibbage. I probably, you know, I probably get the whole Jackbox Party Pack in general, especially with Drawful if I ever got to play it with more than one other person.
7271000	7272000	Right.
7272000	7282000	But, you know, just something like, you know, that type of gameplay, even though I had some issues with how they did some of the stuff in Jackbox Party Pack, like the controllers in You Don't Know Jack.
7282000	7283000	Mm-hmm.
7283000	7290000	That, you know, that, just that brought something new to the table that I hadn't seen before, and I really like where that's going.
7290000	7297000	And I'm with you. You know, the Jackbox Party Pack is great. I don't want to knock it. But a lot of you, like Drawful, we have kind of seen that before a little bit.
7297000	7302000	Like it's done a different way, but that was a game we'd seen before. Fibbage was something really, really different, I think.
7302000	7303000	Yeah.
7303000	7307000	And so it was kind of like the first one that hit big, and then Jackbox kind of like trailed after that in a way.
7307000	7310000	Right. And Drawful is fibbage with drawings.
7310000	7313000	Yeah. Yeah, it's true. It's true.
7313000	7314000	All right.
7315000	7323000	My number two, and, you know, I know Fifth Dream's in chat. He's like all Oculus list incoming. I really did almost put Time Rifters on the list.
7323000	7330000	It probably would have been number four, but really, honestly, my number two is, this is the one that you guys have already said, Mario Kart 8.
7330000	7334000	Ah. There we go. Somebody finally also put a Wii U game on their list. Thank you.
7334000	7347000	Yeah, and it's not Smash Brothers or anything, but Mario Kart 8, just because that was fun, and, you know, it just works, and it worked over the holiday season, no matter what any, you know, reptiles thought or tried.
7347000	7354000	You know, and just, you know, Mario Kart 8 is just something that I can play with my girlfriend, and, you know, we have a lot of fun with it.
7354000	7360000	And not many games have that couch multiplayer experience down, and the online experience down.
7360000	7367000	And, I mean, I like the YouTube thing, even though, you know, some people, you know, would criticize it for its bit rate or whatever crap.
7367000	7377000	But, you know, just the fact that they did that, the Mario Kart TV, that's kind of neat, and, you know, yes, I know Dark Tetsuya plays it, because that's all I see on Miiverse are all his YouTube postings.
7377000	7385000	But that's why it's such a good game of the year, is that it's still going after all these months, and I know there's a lot of people out there that are going to be like,
7385000	7392000	why aren't you talking about Smash Brothers, or why aren't you talking about Bayonetta? And I'm kind of like, there's something about the accessibility level,
7392000	7399000	and the avalanche that Mario Kart 8 started, that those other two games can't really speak to in the same way.
7399000	7405000	And I'm not knocking those games. Again, when we talk about bubbling under, both of those other games would make my top ten.
7405000	7411000	But there's something about Mario Kart 8 that really makes it my number one. I think that YouTube thing in particular, I love.
7411000	7420000	You know, and sometimes Nintendo does this wrong, and sometimes they do it right, but instead of copying what the other guys do, they march to the beat of their own drum,
7420000	7427000	and that's Miiverse, and this YouTube thing was, I think, born of that as well, and I think those highlight reels are actually pretty darn amazing.
7427000	7432000	And, you know, my brother, he's not that much of a gamer, but he did just get a PS4 and a Wii U.
7432000	7437000	He's a little bit of a gamer, but he's not like, he wouldn't be somebody who listens to our shows or anything.
7437000	7438000	Right.
7438000	7440000	But I got a Mario Kart 8 for Christmas.
7440000	7441000	Nice.
7441000	7446000	You know, so that was like the game. He's like, is this really good? I'm like, yes, it's really good. You will enjoy it.
7446000	7454000	So, you know, that says a lot that, you know, I feel comfortable suggesting it to my, you know, non-hardcore gamer friends.
7454000	7458000	Well, I'm gonna check in next Dragon Con and see what he thought.
7458000	7459000	Yeah.
7459000	7462000	All right. Well, how about your number one, Bobby Blackwell?
7462000	7465000	My number one game is the game nobody here has played.
7465000	7466000	I know.
7466000	7469000	And I think it's a shame. It is a crying shame.
7469000	7478000	And the retweets that I got on the VOG Twitter when I posted about this from the developer mean that they also believe this.
7478000	7479000	The Talos Principle.
7479000	7480000	Mm-hmm.
7480000	7487000	This is, it's a first-person puzzler game. It's, you know, you could say it's like Portal, but A, there's no portals, and B, there's not really that much humor in it.
7487000	7496000	I almost bought it today, actually. I saw that, and I was like, eh, maybe. It was on, was it that Steam feeds or whatever that they give you, like, some suggestions or something?
7496000	7504000	Yeah. And you know what? You know what I say earlier? We can't play everything. We don't have time for everything, but Bobby is explicitly saying, make time for this.
7504000	7509000	Yes, and I mean, it's a great puzzler, and it's got a really interesting story underneath.
7509000	7510000	Mm-hmm.
7511000	7520000	And it's not a funny story, but it is a very interesting story, and I mean, it helped me get through the puzzles, because some of those puzzles are damn hard, just to be able to get to the next part of the story.
7520000	7521000	Mm-hmm.
7521000	7527000	Which is, in games, a lot of times as I get older, I'm like, I don't care why I'm fighting. Just get me to the next fight.
7527000	7528000	Right.
7528000	7535000	And this is a game that, you know, is like, I hate the fact that I have to do these puzzles, because I want to know what happens next in the story.
7535000	7536000	Mm-hmm.
7536000	7537000	And these puzzles are damn hard.
7537000	7538000	Mm-hmm.
7538000	7543000	And not as, you know, Portal was a four-hour game. This is, it took me 23 hours the first time to go through it.
7543000	7547000	This sounds amazing. I love puzzle games, and I'm back.
7547000	7551000	Have you, where'd you come from? Have you heard about this game, The Talos Principle?
7551000	7552000	No, but...
7552000	7554000	It's by the serious Sam people.
7554000	7555000	Mm-hmm.
7555000	7557000	That means nothing to me.
7557000	7567000	But it sounds like something I would like to check out, for sure, because I love puzzle games, and making it first person adds a different sort of depth to it that I think would be fun.
7567000	7571000	And Bobby's saying enough, too many people aren't checking this out. That's the problem.
7571000	7578000	It got, I gave it an A-plus review on VoG, and the only two bad things were, the puzzles are hard, but get over it.
7578000	7582000	Oh, I love that. I love really ridiculous puzzles.
7582000	7585000	And the second one was, you haven't played it yet.
7585000	7588000	It's true.
7588000	7591000	Wow. Well, that's a good list, Bobby.
7591000	7592000	I like that.
7592000	7593000	So there you go.
7593000	7601000	There you go. Do you want to, now Shane came out with this disappointing list. Do you have any games you want to throw out there that maybe disappointed you a little bit?
7601000	7605000	Because I know I have at least one, maybe two.
7605000	7611000	The security of Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
7611000	7613000	Fair enough. Fair enough.
7613000	7620000	You know, when we were talking last night about disappointing things, I was going to say, can one of my games start with a hashtag?
7620000	7622000	But then I was like, maybe I don't want to go there.
7622000	7630000	I was going to say, there's one I was going to, I haven't played yet, and that's why it's kind of disappointing, was Drive Club, because apparently it was a mess.
7630000	7631000	Yeah.
7631000	7633000	Yeah? That's a good point. That's a good point.
7633000	7635000	Well, actually, and for me, The Crew.
7635000	7637000	Oh. Yeah.
7637000	7648000	Because The Crew, it's, you know, I mean, I loved a lot of the concepts in it, because The Crew does their online multiplayer a lot like Destiny, which a lot of people don't like, you know, the faux MMO type of thing.
7649000	7654000	But The Crew is just, it's too difficult if you're playing alone.
7654000	7660000	If you're playing with people, at least if one person is good, you can get through if you're in a crew with other people.
7660000	7664000	But as a single player game, if you're not top notch, you're not going to get far in that.
7664000	7670000	And that was kind of disappointing to me, because I liked everything about The Crew, except for the difficulty level.
7670000	7677000	It was just a little bit too much. And there were other people that had the same complaint as I did, so it's not the whole Bobby Black Wolf mode joke, you know, meme that we do.
7677000	7678000	Right.
7678000	7687000	It actually is, it's a legitimately difficult game, which is great for a lot of people, but it does cut out people like me, so it's more of a personal disappointment, maybe not a game disappointment.
7687000	7688000	Sure.
7688000	7689000	As much.
7689000	7690000	That's fair. Totally fair.
7690000	7697000	Bobby, so great to hear from you. Everybody should check out the Bobby Black Wolf show. You want to tell people quickly about that interview you had tonight, which will be on the podcast feed?
7698000	7708000	Yeah, so I interviewed, this was the All Oculus Rift show, because I had an interview scheduled for tonight, and then the sports ball stuff got moved, and I wish it didn't.
7708000	7718000	And I wish I wasn't there, but that's a whole other story. But it was with Aaron Lemke, he's with Unello Design, and he did a virtual reality experience, a relaxation experience.
7718000	7726000	So it's not exactly a game, but it is basically, you're floating down a river. And he's done a bunch of these virtual reality experiences, so we talk about that.
7726000	7735000	We talk about the future of the quote-unquote experience genre, which is not something you see in normal games, because you don't get that type of thing from a monitor.
7735000	7743000	So we talk about the experience genre, we talk about his games, what's next for him, and reminisce about some old stuff going on.
7743000	7751000	So we talked for about, I think it was about a 30-minute show, and that was about it, and it aired earlier tonight, and it'll be on the podcast feed later this week.
7751000	7756000	And it was a really cool interview, and kind of eye-opening to see his perspective on things.
7756000	7765000	You know, we're going to get into predictions a little more next week, but just to give you guys kind of a sneak peek of something I really think is going to be true for 2015,
7765000	7773000	just because Bobby is kind of the VR expert of the network, and going into 2015, one of the things I would probably say,
7773000	7782000	I don't know if I would be so bold to say this is a prediction, but I kind of really feel like next year is really the year we're going to see if VR is the next big thing.
7782000	7787000	Would you agree with that, or you think, no, Rob, we kind of know the answer to that?
7788000	7793000	See, the thing is, I don't know if it's going to be 2015 or 2016 when we'll see it.
7793000	7799000	I am not as convinced that a consumer-ready product is going to be available in 2015.
7799000	7806000	Because, to be honest, the Oculus consumer-ready version of the Oculus Rift was supposed to be out this holiday season, initially.
7806000	7811000	And they bumped it back, and we have no clue. They say 2015? I don't think so.
7811000	7819000	Because I see how bad the DevKit 2 runs on my system, and the DevKit 1 ran great on my system.
7819000	7827000	So I see kind of where they're going with the Gear VR, and see some of the more consumer-focused things that they're doing.
7827000	7832000	But I still think it's got a long way to go, and I don't think it's going to be in 2015.
7832000	7838000	I hope I'm wrong. I absolutely hope I'm wrong, and I hope that it comes in great in 2015 and everybody loves it.
7839000	7844000	But I would not be surprised if the consumer VR comes out in 2016.
7844000	7850000	Well then, I'm also thinking about Morpheus, a very likely thing that's going to happen in holiday 2015.
7850000	7856000	But again, it would be fair to say, but we don't know for sure. That also could be something that gets bumped to 2016, you're right.
7856000	7863000	But if both those devices are out for holiday 2015, I'm so curious to see how the market responds. So curious.
7864000	7870000	And the good thing that makes me happy is that I did read that Oculus has actually talked to Sony and had meetings with Sony.
7870000	7878000	Not because they're working together, but because Oculus actually does not want Sony to quote-unquote poison the well.
7878000	7883000	They want to make sure that Sony delivers a good experience, and so they're sharing information with them.
7883000	7892000	Specifically because they know, because of the PS4, that the Morpheus will most likely be a lot of people's first introduction to virtual reality.
7892000	7894000	And they don't want them to screw it up.
7894000	7902000	You know what? One of the highlights of the year in gaming for me personally was just not only getting to play that Morpheus at E3,
7902000	7907000	but getting to really just kind of hang with the developers for a bit. How rockstar was that? That was awesome.
7907000	7913000	But getting to actually meet them and talk to them, they definitely know what they're doing.
7913000	7919000	And I think that does not surprise me at all to hear that they are collaborating for the greater good.
7919000	7921000	It doesn't surprise me at all to hear that.
7921000	7928000	Right, and it's not that Oculus is providing them tech, but they're saying, hey, this is how we solved a motion sickness problem.
7928000	7933000	You may want to look into this, because they don't want people to put on the Morpheus and get sick and say,
7933000	7935000	VR sucks, because that hurts everybody.
7935000	7944000	And Oculus is so worried about somebody poisoning the well that they're actually working with Sony and working with Samsung and stuff
7944000	7951000	to make sure that the first VR experience that most people have is going to be a good one, even if it's not an Oculus product.
7951000	7957000	And I'm really happy to see that, and everybody thought that wouldn't happen once Facebook bought them, but look at them now.
7957000	7963000	How many times has the word Facebook been used in a conversation about Oculus since that initial news?
7963000	7968000	Like, it's very rare, so it does seem like Oculus is getting to kind of grow and do their own things. That's great.
7968000	7973000	But anyway, Bobby, love having you on the show. I do want to let you go so we can get some more people online, though.
7973000	7976000	This was the segment for just the top threes.
7976000	7977000	I know, right?
7977000	7983000	Everybody call in with more of your top threes, and I hope next year one of our video game jams will be your top three.
7983000	7987000	Alright, we'll hope so. See you guys.
7987000	7988000	See ya. Take care, Bobby.
7988000	7990000	I have a 1.5, actually.
7990000	7991000	What's that?
7991000	7992000	Pixel shits!
7992000	7994000	I seriously considered-
7994000	7995000	It is pixel shits.
7995000	8001000	I seriously considered pixel shits for the top three, but I couldn't justify it. It would seem biased.
8001000	8005000	Anyway, we're going to get to another call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?
8005000	8007000	Hi, this is Raginator.
8007000	8009000	Hey, Raginator, buddy. How you doing?
8009000	8011000	Good, how are you?
8011000	8017000	Good. Talking about the top three games of the year. Your three favorite games of 2014 and why, sir?
8017000	8026000	Alright, well, I'm going to have to punch my muscle a little bit because I got very few games that actually came out this year, but here goes.
8026000	8034000	In no particular order, I'm going to have to say Pinball FX2.
8034000	8040000	Technically, that game didn't come out this year, but they released DLC for it this year.
8040000	8045000	Yeah, a lot of tables come out this year, so a lot of people discover it this year. That's fine.
8045000	8051000	Yeah, I particularly like the Venom table, the South Park table, so on and so forth.
8051000	8054000	Yeah, those are really great.
8054000	8061000	My second game would be Geometry Wars 3 Dimensions.
8061000	8067000	That's a great game. Probably in my top ten as well.
8067000	8084000	Yeah, ever since I got rid of my Xbox 360, I've been kind of missing Geometry Wars 2, which is a game that never came to Steam, but Geometry Wars 3 certainly makes up for that.
8084000	8089000	Yeah, it's all the same modes, and then some.
8089000	8103000	Let's see, I'm trying to find my third game here. Oh yeah, like you guys, I'm dominating Geometry. No, not too.
8103000	8107000	You liked it so much, you're putting it on your list twice. I'm just kidding.
8107000	8115000	Goat Simulator, it's just one of those games that's so weird, it's actually amazing.
8115000	8123000	This is very interesting that Goat Simulator of all the games from this year is doing very well on the OLR Top 3s all around.
8123000	8129000	But at the same time I'm also not surprised to hear that. It's just such a quirky, fun, different experience.
8129000	8134000	I think that is definitely a common theme you're hearing about a lot of these choices that we're picking.
8134000	8142000	Fun. These games are fun. Mario Kart 8 is fun. Goat Simulator is fun. Dragon Age is heartbreaking.
8142000	8150000	But that's fun for some people. So there it is. Scaring the shit out of your friends in Five Nights at Freddy's is fun.
8150000	8152000	Which is what you're doing tonight after the show.
8152000	8154000	No, I have to work tomorrow.
8154000	8157000	It doesn't matter, so you can cry yourself to sleep.
8158000	8166000	Alright, so anyway, Spaznator, thank you very much for sharing your list. I know you probably are getting a real kick out of the Steam sales going on right now, right?
8166000	8175000	Well, I'm trying to. I'm basically broke, so I can't really buy anything per se.
8176000	8189000	The only reason I even got some of the games I do is because I've been selling some of the trading cards for Nickel here, Dynair, and you know, sending out games that way.
8189000	8201000	In fact, I've got pretty much everyone gear cracked for Christmas. I've given everyone something a little bit more substantial, but it's the best I could do.
8201000	8211000	Games that game, and sometimes the really cheap ones actually are a lot of fun. About a year ago this time, Super Hexagon was what, like 29 cents, and that game was amazing.
8211000	8219000	So I will say this though, if you are able to squeeze out like $2, I think it's like $1.50, that love game I talked about earlier is pretty rad and is worth a look.
8219000	8220000	101.
8220000	8226000	You know, $1.01. If you can squeeze out a dollar and a penny, that might be a game to check out.
8226000	8230000	Anyway, my friend, I gotta let you go to try and squeeze some more calls in, but thanks so much for calling and sharing.
8230000	8231000	Sure.
8231000	8232000	Take care.
8232000	8233000	Have a good one.
8233000	8234000	You too, buddy. Bye-bye.
8234000	8240000	Alright, we have some more calls coming. People want to share their lists, and I don't blame them whatsoever, so we have another call on the line. Let's get to it.
8240000	8241000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8241000	8243000	Hey, what's up? This is Kaijuto.
8243000	8246000	Hey, Kaijuto. I love your avatar. You got a Heathcliff now, right?
8246000	8251000	Yeah, that's one of my, not one of my, but probably my favorite cartoon of all time.
8251000	8253000	Can you still sing the theme song?
8253000	8259000	I can sing it, but I still don't know what the hell the words are. There's some parts to it where I'm like, what the hell are they singing?
8259000	8264000	What if Heathcliff, no one should terrorize his neighborhood? Alright, anyway.
8264000	8271000	Yeah, there's a part where they show Hector Wordsworth in Mongo, and there's something about Speedy something.
8271000	8282000	I never knew what the hell they said to this day, and I kind of don't want to know because it'll probably ruin my childhood because I have just fond memories just remembering being a kid trying to figure out what the hell they're saying in that song.
8282000	8286000	So I don't know. I can easily Google the lyrics, but I actually don't want to.
8286000	8292000	We all have that rap from our childhood. It's just better off. We don't understand. For me, it's Paula Abdul's Cold Hearted.
8292000	8300000	Just today, I learned part of the lyrics to M.I.A.'s Paper Planes. I'm like, I thought that was something else, and I'm like, oh, that's what they're saying. Okay.
8300000	8310000	Or the rap in Erasure's version of Take a Chance on Me. Like, literally, what the hell is she saying? Anyway, we could talk about these raps all day, but we want to talk about your top three games of 2014.
8310000	8313000	So, Kaijuto, you're number three, and why?
8313000	8320000	My number three is going to be Fantasy Life for the Nintendo 3DS.
8320000	8321000	Interesting.
8321000	8333000	I don't know if any of you ever played it, but it's a great game. It kind of flew under the radar, and I'm just having a ton of fun with it. I don't see myself ever stop playing this game for a while.
8334000	8345000	I have heard a lot of good things about it. I've not checked it out personally myself. I always think people are talking about Tomodachi Life, but I realize they're very different games.
8345000	8353000	Because, actually, I've got to say, Tomodachi Life would probably be on my list of three disappointments. If I had done a list of three disappointments, that particular game would have shown up there.
8353000	8359000	But, anyway, I don't want to digress, because they are very different games, and I've heard a lot of great things about Fantasy Life.
8359000	8368000	Basically, it's like an MMO in your pocket. It runs like any of your standard MMOs, but it just has a lot of charm to it.
8368000	8378000	I love the job system in it, because you can change jobs whenever you want. You can explore with your friends locally or online.
8378000	8383000	I think there's even voice chat. I'm not 100% sure, but I think it might have voice chat in it as well.
8383000	8391000	The story is great. This is probably one of the first games I've ever played that's all text-based, where I actually sat there and read everything.
8391000	8399000	Usually, I'll just start pressing B or A just to skip everything, because it's always the same story. The guy loses his memory, he has to regain it, and he meets all these characters.
8399000	8409000	It's always that. It still has that stuff. You don't know who you are, but it's actually pretty funny. A lot of dialogue in it. There's a little butterfly that follows you. She's really funny.
8409000	8415000	Well, my shopping list is growing thanks to tonight's show, but we'll move right along and get your number two game of the year and why.
8415000	8425000	My number two is actually two games, but I believe that they're kind of like companions, so I'm just going to say Smash Brothers for the 3DS and Smash Brothers for the Nintendo Wii.
8425000	8430000	Fair enough. I would agree with that notion, so why these games?
8431000	8441000	Just for the simple fact that they did something to Smash Brothers that I didn't think they could actually do, and that was just make it fun all over again.
8441000	8452000	It feels like I'm playing it back on the GameCube again. I played the other Smash Brothers before that, and they just felt like a continuation, but this one actually feels like a fresh new game.
8452000	8460000	I don't know how they actually did that, because it's actually the same game that's been around since 1999 or 2000, but it just feels new and fresh.
8460000	8469000	It's not so much the 8-player Smash. I don't really play that, but it's just something about it that makes it feel new and fresh. Maybe it's because it's on the Wii U.
8469000	8476000	It just feels different. It doesn't feel like past Smash Brothers games, not even the Wii Smash Brothers games.
8476000	8480000	I hear you. Your number one game of the year and why?
8480000	8483000	Pokemon Ruby and Alpha Shalfike.
8483000	8487000	Wow! Even though Shane said it was a huge disappointment. Interesting.
8487000	8489000	Super huge disappointment.
8489000	8492000	Let's hear Kai's end of it. Why your number one?
8492000	8500000	I actually called Black Wolf and told him that I wasn't having fun with it, but after you play it for a while, after you get involved and you start to mess around with the...
8500000	8510000	I don't know what the hell it is. I don't know if it's a damn Pokedex or whatever, but it's stuff that you collect that allows you to sneak around and catch Pokemon and you can see invisible Pokemon.
8510000	8517000	There's a lot of different gadgets. I'm just going to say the gadgets that they give you in this one, it helps you a lot more in the Pokemon games.
8517000	8526000	If you're into breeding and training like I am, this is the game you're going to want to breed and train Pokemon on, because they make it so easy.
8526000	8532000	I know that X and Y had the super training, and it's basically the same super training from X and Y.
8532000	8544000	But with the other enhancements, like I said, actually going out there and being able to find the particular Pokemon that you want and also knowing what their stats are going to be like before you catch them, I think that's huge for Pokemon.
8544000	8554000	Because a lot of Pokemon, basically it was almost like if you were going into the store and you were buying those random decks of booster packs for Yu-Gi-Oh! or Magic the Gathering, you never really knew what you were going to get.
8554000	8559000	But this one, you actually get a preview of what you're going to get. The more you put into the game, the more you're going to get out of the game.
8559000	8566000	So if you're not really dedicated in putting your effort into the game, you're not going to really get much out of it. You've got to really put an effort into it.
8566000	8577000	Plus, the number one thing, which I'm not the biggest Pokemon fan, so it didn't get me excited right away, but now that I know what it's about, I'm actually pretty excited about it.
8577000	8585000	You can catch pretty much almost every single legendary that's been in the game, all in that one game. Almost all of them.
8585000	8592000	I think that's what Shane will be able to tell me, but I think there's a few that you're not going to be able to get which were promotional or something.
8592000	8601000	But pretty much a lot of the Pokemon that were on the covers of all the other previous Pokemon games, you can catch them in this game, along with X and Y.
8601000	8604000	It sounds like you're just not giving it a good enough shot. Eight hours is not enough.
8604000	8606000	Actually, I'm in 13 hours. I just turned it on the scene.
8606000	8608000	You turned it on. Well, he did turn it on.
8608000	8614000	I'm trying to make it not my number one, and for the reasons you said, I understand why people like it.
8614000	8622000	And there's some cool, like those aspects are pretty cool, but overall, I still think it's just a cash grab that I just disappointed.
8622000	8626000	Do you think part of it is just because you played the story already? Like this? I've never played the original.
8626000	8633000	But this was like how many years ago did it come out? It came out like back when, a long time ago.
8633000	8640000	Back when a long time ago. And I just, this story, after playing X and Y, I thought that story was pretty good.
8640000	8647000	This one is just really dull, and there's technically really no new Pokemon. And that's why I play them.
8647000	8651000	All right, you know what though, Kaiju, your list is your list, and nobody can tell you it's wrong.
8651000	8655000	So I appreciate you calling and sharing with us, and happy gaming.
8655000	8656000	Yep, same to you.
8656000	8657000	All right, happy new year. We'll see you next time.
8657000	8658000	Happy new year.
8658000	8659000	Later.
8659000	8665000	All right, I do not see the phones lighting. Actually, I think I saw one more person trying to get through, so I will see if that person comes back through.
8665000	8667000	What's that? Yeah, that's what I thought.
8667000	8674000	So we'll try to leave it open here. 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8674000	8678000	And then when we wrap this up, we will take it over to the rest of the stories.
8678000	8683000	And then we'll see what time we have for Skype calls at the end. We might actually be getting our fill here.
8683000	8686000	We do have another call coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8686000	8688000	Hey, hey, guess who?
8688000	8692000	Hey, it's Rama, and I see it, but I don't just see Rama.
8692000	8693000	That's right.
8693000	8694000	Nope.
8694000	8696000	It's also Giovedea.
8696000	8697000	Yep.
8697000	8698000	And her pussy.
8698000	8703000	I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.
8703000	8706000	Her cat, people. It's her pussy cat.
8706000	8707000	She's petting live on air.
8707000	8710000	She's petting live on air, but it's okay because it's a cat.
8710000	8712000	I'm petting my pussy live on air.
8712000	8713000	God.
8713000	8716000	Is it purring?
8716000	8719000	Yes, he purrs like a race car.
8719000	8727000	All right. All right, kids. Well, you know what the topic is tonight. It's the top three games of 2014.
8727000	8730000	So you guys, what are your top three and why?
8730000	8732000	You want to go first?
8732000	8734000	By all means, you go first.
8734000	8735000	All right.
8735000	8745000	Well, you know, Rob, I'm a casual gamer, so I got to play as I travel or I got to sit down in front of the console and just play for a few minutes and then pick up the game later.
8745000	8750000	So number three would be the Lego movie, The Game.
8750000	8757000	Nice. You're actually not the first one I've heard put it in like a top ten. A lot of people seem to really dig this game.
8757000	8760000	Why? What's your why behind that?
8760000	8768000	Besides the fact that the game, the movie was fun, the game is very simple. You sit there, you build things and you go through it.
8768000	8771000	It's very simple. Just pick up and play at any given time.
8771000	8777000	Plus, as you know, with almost every single Lego game, the replay value is just out of this world.
8777000	8780000	Mm hmm. That's true. Very true.
8780000	8782000	Do you have a day? How about you? You're number three.
8782000	8787000	My number three is a phone game, actually. Doctor Who Legacy.
8787000	8791000	Okay. You know what? We're not getting a lot of iOS and Android games.
8791000	8792000	That's pretty fun.
8792000	8796000	Here in the top three. So what's your why on Doctor Who Legacy?
8796000	8804000	My why is probably the fact that you can capture characters and get characters from the series.
8804000	8806000	And I'm a huge Doctor Who nerd.
8806000	8807000	Mm hmm.
8807000	8814000	But some of the skins for the characters that you can get, especially the ones that they did for their 25 Days of Christmas.
8814000	8815000	Mm hmm.
8815000	8826000	They went and did some 8-bit skins, different, like they've gone past into the classic Who and did skins from the classic Who.
8826000	8833000	So I really enjoyed that aspect of it. Plus it's, you know, a little bit of a puzzle. So I like it.
8833000	8837000	Hey, I don't know if you guys can hear it, but we're hearing like a high pitched ringing or something.
8837000	8840000	And I'm not I don't hear it because we're on speakers here in studio.
8840000	8844000	So it doesn't bother me as much. But I guess those are listening on headphones can really hear it.
8844000	8845000	And it's like, really?
8845000	8846000	I could hear it.
8846000	8849000	Yeah. Interesting. I don't know.
8849000	8854000	Well, it might be because I'm rebuilding Mako Chun's computer and it's right next to us.
8854000	8855000	That might be the case.
8855000	8856000	That could be part of it.
8856000	8858000	I apologize. I'm sorry.
8858000	8862000	It also so so we'll have to hurry through this. So you're number two, Rama.
8862000	8868000	Number two, I'll enjoy my music games. So number two will be Final Fantasy Theater Rhythm Curtain Call.
8868000	8870000	Good pick. Why?
8870000	8876000	It's just fun. It's very simple to play. You know, just tap and follow, tap and follow.
8876000	8883000	Plus, I like some of the newer music and the fact that the new DLC is going to more Square Enix titles.
8883000	8887000	A freaking Chrono Trigger song came out this week. I didn't think we were going to get that in America.
8887000	8889000	Merry Christmas from Square.
8889000	8890000	Yes.
8890000	8893000	Seriously. Jovidaya, you're number two and why?
8893000	8898000	My number two, I only just got it this year. So Deadpool, because it's Deadpool.
8898000	8904000	Deadpool. Oh, my God. I love the part when he's in the elevator rocking out.
8904000	8909000	And changing out the little box covering his bits.
8909000	8914000	That was that was possibly my favorite reasoning I've heard for why a game is on somebody's top three.
8914000	8916000	Deadpool, because it's Deadpool.
8916000	8917000	Yeah.
8917000	8920000	Like, come at me. Come out. How are you going to respond to that? How are you going to respond? You can't. You can't.
8920000	8921000	Deadpool.
8921000	8924000	All right. Last but not least, number one, Sarama.
8924000	8931000	Number one. Well, as most people know, besides music games and RPGs, my one thing is puzzle games.
8931000	8938000	You put a puzzle game in front of me, I will just keep playing it until I can't play it no more or until my battery dies on my phone.
8938000	8942000	So my number one pick would have to be Diamond Digger Saga.
8942000	8949000	I don't even know this game. Diamond Digger Saga. Why this of all the puzzle games out there?
8949000	8953000	Because it's the way the way it plays.
8953000	8959000	You're pretty much clearing up bricks, waters coming down to collect the different items to gain points.
8959000	8964000	And then some of the levels, you're just clearing out diamonds and rubies for a massive amount of points.
8964000	8968000	It's just fun. It's fun, dammit. It's fun.
8968000	8972000	And I tell you this, I enjoy this more than I do the Candy Crush one because I got tired of that one.
8972000	8976000	I hit level 385 and I said, the hell with this. I'm done.
8976000	8981000	I still can't believe you of all people are my Candy Crush addicted friends. I just, oh my God, I can't. I can't with you.
8981000	8985000	You shouldn't support them though because of how they stole from...
8985000	8986000	Well, he did. He quit.
8986000	8987000	Good.
8987000	8993000	All right. All right. Last but not least, your number one.
8993000	8994000	Do you have a idea?
8994000	8997000	My number one is South Park Stick of Truth.
8997000	9003000	Oh, that's a good pick. And again, one of those ones that came out earlier in the year. And, you know, there's been a lot of...
9003000	9004000	I forgot that was this year.
9004000	9013000	Yeah, right. There's been a lot of Ubisoft booze in the past few months between the Assassin's Creed mess up and the new Tetris.
9013000	9016000	And, you know, there's been a lot of stuff where people are getting irritated with them.
9016000	9021000	But earlier in the year, they were really knocking it out of the park between a Child of Light and the South Park game.
9021000	9024000	But what's the why for you on that?
9025000	9033000	I got the original South Park game for Nintendo 64 and played the hell out of that game.
9033000	9034000	Yeah.
9034000	9038000	So I was looking for a South Park game that was going to remind me of that.
9038000	9049000	And while this isn't exactly that, it does bring in a lot of those elements that made that game so crazy.
9049000	9054000	There's a reason why Trey Parker won an acting award for that game. Let's just leave it at that.
9054000	9055000	Yup.
9055000	9061000	Amazing. Well, you guys, I have to let you go so we can get rid of that little buzzing we're hearing.
9061000	9064000	But thank you guys so much for calling in and sharing. I love the group call.
9064000	9065000	Enjoy.
9065000	9070000	Best of luck with Anime Jam Session in 2015. We'll miss you guys until you're back.
9070000	9071000	Thanks.
9071000	9072000	Heart.
9072000	9073000	Take care, hearts.
9073000	9075000	From all of us here at O.L.R. Happy New Year.
9075000	9076000	Happy.
9076000	9079000	All right. So good to hear from them. I love that. A combo call.
9079000	9084000	All right. That's a good one to end our Skype segment for now on.
9084000	9094000	But we'll open it up briefly a little later just in case you guys want to comment on any of the other news.
9094000	9095000	But we're only going to open it for a little bit.
9095000	9100000	But if somebody didn't get through that wants to give their top three, we can fit that in as well a little later.
9100000	9103000	We actually have just some other quick, quick news to get through here.
9103000	9107000	And we got to get, you know, the FUs of the week and check in with Jamie if anybody ever e-mailed us.
9107000	9109000	Let's get to all that right now.
9109000	9111000	Loki, some more news for us.
9111000	9117000	So PlayStation Now is hitting yet some more devices starting the first half of 2015.
9117000	9124000	So if you don't happen to own a PlayStation 3 or Vita or a Vita TV or PlayStation TV, however you're going to call it.
9124000	9126000	It's also going to be coming to smart TVs.
9127000	9131000	Starting out with the Samsung smart TVs.
9131000	9136000	And they're going to even have the functionality of, you know, all the functionality of PlayStation Now.
9136000	9141000	Including, you know, trophies, cloud saves and online multiplayer.
9141000	9146000	And apparently they're not sure when exactly it's going to launch.
9146000	9149000	I'm assuming that you're going to probably need some sort.
9149000	9155000	Maybe, oh, it looks like, yeah, it supports the DualShock 4 out of the box.
9155000	9159000	So you would have to buy a DualShock 4, but then you'd be able to play with that.
9159000	9162000	That's pretty cool, actually, that they're going to have that.
9162000	9167000	I'm still waiting for when they actually have streaming PlayStation 4 games on there.
9167000	9170000	And also when it becomes more affordable.
9170000	9174000	And if they had some sort of monthly thing where I could get whatever I want.
9174000	9177000	Still, the fact that they're building that into TVs.
9177000	9181000	I mean, I don't think these are the types of TVs that a lot of people are going to buy.
9181000	9185000	These are more the high-end TVs, but that's still pretty impressive.
9185000	9189000	Well, the fact that it's on a smart TV, though, most of these smart TVs run off of Android.
9189000	9193000	And I know that I've already seen some stuff leaked out there.
9193000	9202000	I don't think there's an official app for it, but I've seen people using, you know, even like the streaming to Android devices.
9202000	9207000	Not necessarily PlayStation Now, but like with Share, not SharePlay, whatever they call that.
9207000	9211000	I don't remember now, on the Vita, where you can stream remote play.
9211000	9212000	Yeah, remote play.
9212000	9214000	So, that's pretty cool.
9214000	9215000	Yeah, very cool.
9215000	9223000	All right, well, speaking of PlayStation, some folks may be interested in a sexy red PlayStation 4.
9223000	9226000	Sadly, not something that's coming here in the U.S.
9226000	9228000	Didn't they do like a red PS3 in Canada?
9228000	9231000	I seem to remember that one year, because it looked really awesome.
9231000	9234000	And this one looks awesome, too, but it's only in Japan.
9234000	9238000	Still, some of you might be importing it or trying to get a hold of that controller.
9238000	9239000	I don't know.
9239000	9244000	But Japan is getting a red PlayStation 4 released on March 19, 2015.
9244000	9248000	It is to go along with Final Fantasy Type 0.
9248000	9257000	In fact, that little faceplate type thing or the thing on the side that you can pop off, that actually has a Final Fantasy Type 0 little logo on it as well.
9257000	9262000	If you want to get one, though, it's going to cost you about $392 plus tax.
9262000	9266000	That's converted from 46,980 yen.
9266000	9268000	Also, a red DualShock with that.
9268000	9270000	15 days of PlayStation Plus.
9270000	9276000	And, of course, a code for Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, allowing you to download that online.
9276000	9282000	And the Final Fantasy 15 episode, Dusque, or whatever, however that's pronounced.
9282000	9284000	Duska? Dusque?
9284000	9286000	The Final Fantasy 15 demo.
9286000	9290000	There's also a unique PlayStation 4 theme that apparently comes with that.
9290000	9295000	I would like to know why we still don't have the Final Fantasy 14 PlayStation 4 theme here that Japan got.
9295000	9297000	Japan gets all the cool stuff.
9297000	9298000	You guys.
9298000	9299000	Anyway.
9299000	9302000	Nothing about that PlayStation 4 coming out over here.
9302000	9307000	Although people do sure seem to love their limited PlayStation 4s over here, too.
9307000	9310000	If that PS1 PS4 is any indication.
9310000	9312000	That thing sold out within seconds.
9312000	9313000	That's pretty crazy.
9313000	9315000	So there might be a demand for this as well.
9315000	9318000	You know, crazy little side story.
9318000	9321000	When I went to the movie, I mentioned I went to the movies on Christmas Day.
9321000	9324000	With Shane, we went and saw Mockingjay, which was great.
9324000	9329000	But I don't know if you noticed during those commercials that they were showing before the movie, there was a lot of video game representation.
9329000	9331000	There was a commercial for Smash Brothers Wii U, right?
9331000	9334000	But there was a commercial for Final Fantasy Type 0.
9334000	9339000	Yeah, I had no idea. I wasn't noticing because I definitely didn't point it out a couple times while we were sitting there.
9339000	9341000	I know, right? But that's still kinda...
9341000	9345000	It took me by surprise that we were seeing that in the movie theater.
9345000	9350000	I had seen the Smash Brothers one already in another movie. I don't remember which one.
9350000	9355000	But yeah, the Type 0 one for it being kinda still far away in a sense.
9355000	9357000	That did catch me off guard.
9357000	9361000	Yeah, and the fact that they actually mentioned the Final Fantasy XV demo as well was kind of surprising.
9361000	9363000	Yeah, and then it was at Amazon.
9363000	9367000	Yeah. So that was just kind of a random little aside there.
9367000	9372000	There you go. If you want to get the red PlayStation 4, it will be available in Japan.
9372000	9377000	We would usually, at this portion of the show, open up the mailbag.
9377000	9381000	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. I'm sorry.
9381000	9384000	Wow, Rob. It's only been like six months since we changed the address.
9384000	9385000	Yeah, Rob. Get with the program.
9385000	9389000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place where you can send us emails.
9389000	9390000	Precipitate.
9390000	9393000	Not precipitate. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
9393000	9395000	Persephone taint.
9395000	9398000	Is where you can... Precipity's taint? What about? Okay.
9399000	9403000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place where you can send emails every week,
9403000	9407000	and Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag head first and read some of her favorite emails here on air.
9407000	9409000	However, Dark Soccer, how's the mailbag look tonight?
9409000	9412000	I landed on my ass. Not a damn thing.
9412000	9414000	Well, so much for the mailbag segment tonight.
9414000	9418000	You people are not sending me any emails.
9419000	9423000	Well, here's the thing. I know there's a group of you that can't be here Sunday night,
9423000	9427000	and you listen during the week on the podcast feed via Stitcher, iTunes, or whatever.
9427000	9430000	Thank you for your support, even though you can't be here live.
9430000	9433000	You can send us your top three and why.
9433000	9436000	Do the thing, and Rob will read it next week.
9437000	9439000	We'll get Shane to read the mail.
9439000	9441000	And if you want to participate with Shane's...
9441000	9443000	I would, but I might not be here next week.
9443000	9445000	It doesn't work.
9445000	9447000	He works later, so...
9447000	9450000	I'm not there now.
9451000	9456000	But if you want to participate with Shane, you can also do your three most disappointing games of the year and why.
9456000	9461000	It's more fun to say your disappointing ones, because you have to really think.
9461000	9467000	Okay, just for example, in the studio tonight, how many of our favorite games overlapped?
9467000	9468000	A lot.
9468000	9474000	And there are so many other games that wouldn't make your top list, but there's tons of games that can make your bottom list.
9475000	9481000	So you're trying to say that we have to decide if we want to be a top or a bottom? Is that what you're trying to say?
9481000	9484000	You are disgusting. That's what I decided.
9485000	9491000	Alright. Anyway, I'm trying to think of three disappointing ones for me.
9491000	9494000	The new Tetris game, for sure, would be on my list.
9494000	9500000	That actually kind of pisses me off, how you can screw up Tetris. That's on my list, for sure.
9500000	9506000	I was reminded that the Final Fantasy VI remakes for iOS and Android...
9506000	9507000	Did you play it, though?
9507000	9508000	Yes.
9508000	9511000	Oh, you did? Okay. Because I think you have to at least play it before you say it's terrible.
9511000	9513000	Not my cup of tea.
9513000	9515000	I didn't like Octodad that much.
9515000	9516000	Really?
9516000	9517000	Yeah.
9517000	9518000	Well, that's too bad.
9518000	9521000	It's cute, and I like making fun of it, but I didn't really care for it.
9521000	9529000	You could throw Warlords of Draenor on there for the same reason I did Destiny. Like, it's not a bad game. It's just not good.
9529000	9537000	I would feel bad. Well, but it is the best expansion since Wrath of the Lich King. I can't, even though I may have canceled WoW this week.
9537000	9538000	The Sims 4.
9538000	9539000	Really?
9539000	9542000	Because when it was released, it didn't have much...
9542000	9543000	No pools.
9543000	9550000	There were no pools and hardly any furnitures or outfits or anything, and I just didn't want to give it another chance.
9550000	9558000	I watched a bunch of playthroughs and people playing it before I was going to decide if it was going to get my money, and it didn't.
9558000	9559000	Interesting. Interesting.
9559000	9565000	All right, well, we don't have any email tonight, and we're getting into this talk about disappointing.
9565000	9571000	You know, I really think it's the cue to get into the FUs of the week.
9572000	9584000	Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
9584000	9586000	This is fucked up.
9586000	9587000	Dark Sakura.
9587000	9594000	FU to my stomach for being so full. Damn Chinese food. It's so delicious, though.
9594000	9598000	And there's still dim sum left, and people aren't eating it. Why?
9598000	9600000	I'm full. I'm so full.
9600000	9607000	You're the one that said, hooray, I'll have leftovers.
9607000	9608000	All right, Loki.
9608000	9610000	Loki, your FUs of the week.
9610000	9614000	How did I get so many Steam games? That's what I want to know.
9614000	9618000	I have 321 games, most of which have not been played.
9618000	9625000	I was trying to find out the exact amount, but Steam isn't working correctly, so fuck you to Steam for being stupid derpy right now.
9625000	9628000	Your addiction is affecting your life negatively in the following ways.
9629000	9630000	Yes, Dark Sakura?
9630000	9632000	I actually just thought of another honorable mention.
9632000	9633000	For a game of the year?
9633000	9636000	Borderlands the pre-sequel. It was really fucking good.
9636000	9637000	Okay, now I'm done.
9637000	9640000	Shame on you for forgetting that whole time. FU to Jamie for being...
9642000	9646000	Let's see, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I have to work tomorrow.
9646000	9649000	I mean, I like my job and everything. Don't get me wrong. Please don't fire me.
9649000	9654000	But, oh my gosh, it's so hard after a holiday break to have to go back tomorrow.
9654000	9659000	If I didn't work tomorrow, I would stream Five Nights at Freddy's or something tonight, but I can't, so...
9659000	9663000	You still could. Again, cry yourself to sleep. It'll work.
9663000	9665000	How long has he really got to stream for me?
9665000	9669000	No, like 20 minutes, and you'll die so many times.
9669000	9670000	I have to be up at 6 AM tomorrow.
9670000	9671000	Oh, boohoo.
9671000	9672000	Yeah, boohoo.
9672000	9674000	Oh, poor baby.
9674000	9676000	Poor me, I know. I have a love life.
9676000	9678000	6 AM? Oh, that's like sleeping in.
9680000	9683000	Alright, Shane, do you have any FUs of the week you want to get out of your stream?
9683000	9694000	FU2 working, like, what basically amounts to 11 hour days for the past three days, and the next two days, and then a small break, and then doing it all over again.
9694000	9696000	It's very tiring.
9697000	9701000	Alright. There it is. Your FUs of the week.
9701000	9705000	Jason in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying,
9705000	9711000	How did I get so many games? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Too many bundles and kickstarters.
9711000	9715000	But Jason also says five days off has been amazing. I agree. Five days off has been amazing.
9715000	9721000	If only I could get, like, another week, like a lot of my coworkers have. Oh well. It is what it is.
9721000	9728000	Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we will quickly open the Skype line for any other comments you want to throw out there on tonight's show.
9728000	9730000	But then we're going to wrap up here. So, Loki.
9731000	9734000	Alright, so, um, excuse me.
9734000	9743000	This is kind of interesting, I guess. You know how they kind of frown upon, you know, having emulators and stuff on, you know, iOS?
9743000	9747000	Well, there's another one that snuck on there.
9747000	9753000	And it's in the form of a program called Floppy Cloud. Yes, you've got to hate that name.
9753000	9758000	But Floppy Cloud is basically supposed to be some sort of file management app.
9758000	9768000	Which, you know, is supposed to let you manage files, but also allows you to connect to your Dropbox account and load ROMs.
9768000	9777000	Which, when you manage one of the Super NES or NES ROMs, it also happens to manage to pull up an emulator for said ROM.
9778000	9788000	So you can check it out before they pull it. It's $1.99 on the iOS store, and it looks like it's pretty easy to actually do that.
9788000	9793000	Already gone, and it was gone by the time this story was making its way around the blogs.
9793000	9796000	Which, you've got to hand it to the guys who tried to sneak it in.
9796000	9802000	They put it up on the day that Apple was closing all the submissions for the holidays.
9802000	9805000	Where they were going on the break or whatever, and it still got pulled.
9805000	9808000	Even though somebody had to come in on their day off to pull that game.
9808000	9812000	So you're not going to be able to get that. That's why Nintendo has lobbyists.
9812000	9818000	Okay, well, that's funny about the emulator, but technically those are illegal.
9818000	9826000	But it does also go to show that even though Apple screens everything before it goes on the store, they can't catch everything.
9826000	9828000	That's not the first time an emulator snuck through.
9828000	9833000	It's hard to imagine it's a file management software.
9833000	9843000	This whole thing was deceptive. The creators who did it probably had the intent of sneaking on an emulator onto the iOS.
9843000	9851000	They did it, but who knows at what price. I'm sure they lost their Apple license or whatever, all that.
9851000	9857000	Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and this is pretty awesome.
9858000	9863000	I guess what's going on is that there is a remake going on of this game.
9863000	9868000	I don't know much about this game, but I've seen some stuff on YouTube, and it's kind of like batshit crazy for lack of a better term.
9868000	9875000	This is the type of game that Jamie probably knows stuff about because it's crazy. It's called LSD Dream Emulator.
9875000	9876000	Oh, yes.
9876000	9881000	Of course you know this one. It was on the PlayStation, and I didn't know a lot about this game.
9881000	9884000	I somehow missed this, but you can see some stuff on YouTube about it.
9884000	9896000	I don't even know how to describe this game. When you call it a dream emulator, it's basically like a bad LSD trip, but on PlayStation 1 style graphics.
9896000	9898000	So you know it's all polygon.
9898000	9906000	You were supposed to walk through these different levels of this guy's freaky dream. It was really, really just a weird game.
9906000	9908000	I've even heard of this game.
9908000	9911000	There's full playthroughs of it online.
9911000	9917000	Well, I don't know much about this game, but you can actually check out the remake that is in alpha right now.
9917000	9930000	It's been being remade since 2011, actually. You can check it out at lsdrevamped.net, and they actually have a PayPal and a Patreon trying to fund this.
9930000	9939000	Because eventually, we get a kick out of this, they want to bring it to the Oculus Rift, which you're going to send somebody to the hospital with that.
9940000	9942000	Damn, there's no OS X version yet.
9942000	9946000	Not yet, not yet. So there you go. That's pretty cool.
9946000	9950000	So good luck to the folks trying to remake that. Just don't get anybody killed.
9950000	9954000	Alright, there it is. That's it for our gaming news tonight.
9954000	9961000	I am going to open up the Skype line real quick for anybody else that wants to share their top 3s or anything else that we might not have covered tonight.
9961000	9967000	So that is open right now at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9967000	9971000	I thought I'd check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.
9971000	9973000	There is actually. It's pretty decent.
9973000	9983000	Apparently, AMD is building chips for a console that's going to debut in 2016.
9983000	9985000	Oooh.
9985000	9987000	Yes, so...
9987000	9989000	UYATU!
9989000	9993000	They haven't said what it is yet, but...
9993000	9997000	There's a lot of people that are probably instantly assuming it's Nintendo, but you know what?
9997000	10006000	Even though Shane made a joke over there, don't count out that it's somebody else doing a console that you might not have even thought of yet.
10008000	10012000	Yeah, so that'll be interesting to see what exactly that is.
10014000	10018000	Maybe that Apple console finally? I don't know.
10018000	10019000	You never know.
10019000	10025000	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is pretty much the last call.
10025000	10027000	It's Philips! They're coming back!
10027000	10029000	Philips CDI 2.
10029000	10033000	All that money they didn't win off the patent lawsuit. They're going to fund a new console with it.
10033000	10035000	You know what my number one game should have been?
10035000	10036000	Huh?
10036000	10037000	You would say no still.
10037000	10038000	What?
10038000	10040000	So we couldn't too, because it got re-released this year.
10040000	10047000	Okay, Jamie, before the show, you told me you were going to put a different game on your list that's in a very similar category.
10047000	10049000	And I said, you do what you want. It's your list.
10049000	10052000	I was going to do The Bourbon.
10052000	10055000	You told me I couldn't when we were talking about it last night.
10055000	10057000	No, you never said you needed a sweet code too.
10057000	10061000	Yes, I did. It would have been my number one, two, and three.
10061000	10062000	Well, fine.
10062000	10063000	And honorable mentions.
10063000	10065000	You can change your list, though.
10065000	10067000	Nope, it's already been recorded.
10067000	10068000	I ruined everything.
10068000	10069000	As usual.
10070000	10071000	Wham.
10071000	10072000	All right.
10072000	10078000	Well, while I wait one more minute here, see if we get any calls, I will mention next week on the show, we're going to be doing our predictions.
10078000	10080000	We're going to bring Listless back tomorrow.
10080000	10082000	Some folks asked why we didn't do Listless tonight.
10082000	10083000	Tomorrow?
10083000	10084000	I'm sorry, next week.
10084000	10085000	Some people asked why we didn't do...
10085000	10086000	Bitch, I won't be here.
10086000	10089000	I'll just be doing a show by myself.
10089000	10092000	Poor Lonely Rob.
10092000	10094000	It's the Lonely Rob Roberts show.
10094000	10095000	Rob is the lonely island.
10095000	10098000	I'm so bored, I guess I'll play Five Nights at Freddy's.
10098000	10099000	Now I'm bored and scared.
10099000	10100000	You know what, Rob?
10100000	10101000	What?
10101000	10108000	If you decided to do Five Nights at Freddy's, I would stay here with a blanket and cookies to comfort you in your fear.
10108000	10110000	Aw, I'd almost do that for the cookies, actually.
10110000	10111000	And then I would throw up.
10111000	10112000	All right.
10112000	10124000	Next week on the show, we're going to be doing predictions for 2015, and we're going to look back at the 2014 Listless that we did and see what actually came true from that list.
10124000	10126000	And see what happened there.
10126000	10131000	And laugh about how stupid we were a year ago, and then we'll do it all over again for next year.
10131000	10132000	How's that sound?
10132000	10133000	And the cycle will just repeat itself.
10133000	10134000	Sounds fun.
10134000	10145000	As we go into our lucky 13th year of broadcasting here at Orange Laundry, that's right, June of 2015 is our 13th anniversary.
10145000	10146000	Wow.
10146000	10150000	This show becomes a teenager next year, if you can believe it.
10150000	10152000	All right.
10152000	10155000	Well, nobody's calling in, so I guess we will start to wrap up the show.
10155000	10159000	We heard from so many of you earlier anyway with your top three.
10159000	10164000	If for whatever reason you were just slow on the get-go there and you didn't get through, you can always send us an e-mail.
10164000	10169000	Participate at orangelaundryradio.com, or you can send us a tweet, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
10169000	10172000	The FUGL question additionally will return next week.
10172000	10177000	We are about to 9 o'clock anyway, so it is about wrapping up time here at Orange Laundry Radio.
10177000	10181000	I want to thank all you guys for listening to the show and supporting independent radio.
10181000	10184000	Thank you very much for your support throughout 2014.
10184000	10188000	You know, we've accomplished a lot of awesome things this year.
10188000	10194000	We went to a lot more conventions and did a lot of very awesome things at places like Dragon Con.
10194000	10199000	I look forward very much to attending shows like PAX East next year I'm going to finally be returning to.
10199000	10202000	And some other cons will be back at Dragon Con 2015 as well.
10202000	10209000	And just, you know, continuing to get out there, have fun, meet people, hang out, and, you know, talk games.
10209000	10210000	That's what it's all about.
10210000	10212000	So thank you guys for being here and being along for the ride.
10212000	10216000	If you liked what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10216000	10224000	Help spread the word because, you know, again, we don't have any giant website or magazine or something backing us.
10224000	10227000	All we've got is ourselves, so please help spread the word.
10227000	10234000	A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Stitcher goes a very long way as well in helping us to get noticed.
10234000	10236000	So we appreciate all of that support.
10236000	10244000	Let's go around now and get everybody's final thoughts of 2014 here on this last live show at VOG Network for 2014.
10244000	10248000	Anime Jam Session is going to be off from the live show this week.
10248000	10252000	They're doing a pre-taped thing, so we are the last live show of 2014, believe it or not.
10252000	10255000	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10255000	10260000	Shane, since you sat in on the last bit of the show here, thanks for crashing the show. Appreciate it.
10260000	10261000	Yeah.
10261000	10262000	Bringing a little disappointment onto the show.
10262000	10263000	I try.
10263000	10265000	With your disappointing list, of course. I don't mean you're disappointing.
10265000	10266000	Yes.
10266000	10268000	Your final thought for us tonight?
10268000	10270000	I don't know.
10270000	10277000	All right. Loki, we'll see you next year. Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10277000	10279000	That joke is so old.
10279000	10286000	I'm going to work more on my game, and hopefully I'll have actually something to show for it next week or even in the middle of the week.
10286000	10287000	That's my goal.
10287000	10292000	Because if I don't have anything to show for it by the end of next week, it's not looking good.
10292000	10293000	Two weeks left.
10293000	10297000	I know, I'm in the same boat where it's like, oh shit, I hope I can get some work done on New Year's Eve.
10297000	10300000	Then it's like, what work are you going to get done on New Year's Eve?
10300000	10302000	So I just got to make time earlier in the week.
10302000	10303000	It shouldn't take too long.
10303000	10304000	Yeah, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.
10304000	10309000	All right, keep in mind, I don't know shit about Unity, so I'll need a lot of help.
10309000	10312000	All right, you may end up doing my game.
10312000	10313000	I'm just kidding, Loki.
10313000	10324000	All right, my final thought for the night, the year, is thank you everybody, and I look forward to hopefully some more projects in 2015.
10324000	10333000	I sunset some big stuff for myself this year so I could open up some new doors next year, and I look forward to exploring that as we move into 2015.
10333000	10339000	So I hope you guys will like some of the stuff that I create, and thank you guys so much, as always, for your support.
10340000	10345000	Last but not least, Darth Sockra, your final thought for the whole stinking year?
10345000	10346000	But...
10348000	10350000	And we'll leave it at that.
10350000	10360000	Have a wonderful night, everybody. Have a safe and happy New Year, and we will see you on the other side in 2015 here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10360000	10362000	Have a wonderful night, everybody. Good night.
