Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight we interview Max, Philip, and Jeffrey of Cooking with Unity, a web series of YouTube videos that teaches you how to create video games using Unity step by step in detail. We'll take your questions live and chat along with your comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:56.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this, our 579th episode, December the 14th, 2014, live as we are every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts. Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Maybe I should just go by Madame Spanky, I don't know.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
You do have a very hoarse voice tonight, I don't mean like a...

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
What happened? Are you okay?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I had the plague.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, I thought maybe you went to a New Kids on the Block concert and were screaming really loud or something.

01:24.000 --> 01:37.000
No, everyone at Locat has had the plague and I starved it off for a solid two to three weeks and then it finally got me and then when it got me, it really freaking got me.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Well, as long as you don't give it to us here in the studio.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
You know, that's so rude. You should be like, oh, I hope you feel better and then go take some vitamins. I'm kidding.

01:47.000 --> 01:55.000
People always say that and I'm just always like, you know what, maybe it just always strikes me as a little bit odd.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Because all I've been hearing is, don't get me sick, don't get me sick. I'm like, don't you want me to feel better?

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Of course we want you to feel better, but you know...

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm not getting you sick.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
I mean, either you're going to feel better or you're going to die. There's no like...

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I don't know, death might sometimes make you feel better. No, I'm kidding.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
But it turned into an upper respiratory infection, so...

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Yikes.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, I took codeine today.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Well, you know what'll fix you right up is some coffee. That's what you need.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm drinking some, but I can't taste it.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, good luck, but...

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It tastes vaguely like coldies.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
If we hear a little less from you tonight, this is why, because you're obviously...

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Even when you walked in here, you were sign languaging me, basically.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Or that, or you just really wanted to flip me off for something I did. I don't know.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
No.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
All right. And they're even asking in chat there, does Jamie need to be turned up a little bit?

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Probably, but she's just also a little... She's just quiet, because...

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I could try talking like this.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Hey, what's up, bitches?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
You're fine. Your audio's fine. You're just a little... You're a little weak tonight.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
Well, he's not weak tonight. He's here, strongest ever. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
I eat too much too fast, I think.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Uh-oh.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I hope you don't get the other kind of sick.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
No, no, no, no. I skipped lunch today, because I was working on the show, rolling stuff,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and then I was just tired and I was gonna take a nap because of the kids.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
And so I didn't bother to get up from the couch to make lunch.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
And so then I just got the bacon ultimate cheeseburger. I know, a very light meal.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
And then I just ate that really fast, and I'm like, oh, wow. I'm really full now.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh, that hurt. That hurt.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
A power meal to get you through the show.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm just uncomfortably full, but that's all right.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
All right.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate with our show,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
because, again, we tape live on Sunday nights at vognetwork.com.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
You can join us in the chat, live.vognetwork.com.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's on before us, saying,

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Jamie channeling her inner Travis Donovan with that what's up, bitches.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
Our good pal from under Sedation Live, which is Saturdays here.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
So there you go.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Let's see, DarkSakura, you wonder. I just have to say this comment because you're talking about this.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
I wonder if I should try making a webcomic in Unity.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Well, why not? Maybe you should.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I want to do it dating sim style, you know, with image, image, image,

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
because I love Homestuck, how it's got all the animations and whatnot,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
but I hate how all the text is at the bottom.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
You have to scroll through 50 million piles of, you know, stuff.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Well, if you make it, you can put it at the top.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
They do have, I have seen in the assets store,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
they did have something for, like, dating sim style game,

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
like a system already built out, you know, for that.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
So, but I've had the idea of doing it that way for a little bit, so.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Well, let's talk about why our chatters are talking about Unity tonight,

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
because we do have some special guests coming on the show in about 45 minutes here.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Loki, I'm going to have you talk about these guys,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
because this is actually a show that you've referenced quite a bit

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
in the making of your own game that you're trying to make right now,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
amongst, you know, New Job, amongst Raising Kids,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
amongst Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Yes. So, yeah, so I don't even remember how I came across them.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm sure probably just looking up information about Unity on YouTube

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
and stuff like that, just kind of trying to learn wherever.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
And I found the show, and it was just very informative, very entertaining.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
You know, that's incredibly important, and it's just fun to listen to.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Like, even, you know, while I'm working on my stuff and programming stuff,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I just love listening to them, and just...

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Does this show have a name?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Yes, I'm getting there. Hold on.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Oh, sorry, you're building anticipation.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
So, anyway, so, yes, well, the show is Cooking with Unity,

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
and hosted by Maximilien Moreau,

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
and, of course, he has Jeffrey and Phil on the show as well.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Occasionally, sometimes they're there, sometimes they're not.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
But they do a show twice weekly, or originally it was twice weekly,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
on Monday, and then also on Thursdays.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Thursdays tends to be, like, a 2D episode.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
So they'll do, for example, two different games kind of at the same time.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
So, one, I think they were working on, like, was it last week?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
It was, like, a rail shooter.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
So kind of like House of the Dead, I guess, if you want to,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
you know, something like that, for the 3D show.

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
And then on the 2D show, they're working on a project called Fight Go Right,

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
which is kind of like a beat-em-up, you know, 2D arcade game,

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
like Ninja Turtles or, you know, the Simpsons arcade, or Final Fight,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
or something like that.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
And so, kind of the two different styles in there.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
Plus, now Max has been doing a show in the mornings called, you know,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Breakfast with Unity, which actually started off about,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
it'd be like 10 to 15 minute shows.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I've been noticing they've been getting longer and longer,

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
which is cool, because he goes over kind of quick little tips on-

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
That's okay, when the Orange Launch Radio podcast started,

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
it was supposed to be 45 minutes.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
And now-

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Oops.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
But yes, absolutely entertaining.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
What's kind of cool though is they interact with the people that are listening

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
or watching the show live, and so you can ask questions about things,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
you can make suggestions on stuff,

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
and it's just kind of nice to have that live feedback, you know.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And also, you know, he invites everyone on every show, you know,

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
hey, if you have a question about something,

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
or you just, you know, need some help on something,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
just send me an email and, you know, I'll help you out.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
And it's really nice.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
And I love their attitude, you know, I can't profess to know as much about Unity,

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
I'm not as into, quote unquote, the programming side,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
but I love that these guys, at the end of their videos,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
they talk about, you know, in their descriptions too,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
they say, you know, go download Unity and make a game.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
You know, that's very much kind of like their message,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
is that more people should, you know, basically be making games.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
And I love that, because that's kind of the type of thing

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I've always said about podcasting,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
because I've had people come to me and say,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
well, Rob, I want to start my own video game podcast,

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
but I don't want you to be mad or see me as competition,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
because I know you've got a video game podcast.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I'm like, it's not, no, no, no, it's not like that.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I want you to make your, that's like the ultimate compliment

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
if somebody goes and creates their own podcast.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
We need more indie voices out there.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Go forth and podcast, please.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
That's a great thing.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
So I love that they bring that kind of message to games.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
We need more people making games.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
I love that.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
And I haven't caught up on all the back videos I missed,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
because I came into it a little bit late, but...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
There's a lot. I had no idea where to begin.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Yeah, they've got like a couple series,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
highly recommend that they've done.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
One recently, which I just think is fantastic,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
and I'm probably going to go look at it a bunch

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
when I'm actually getting to publishing,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
but it's from scratch to publish,

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
where they literally make a game,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
and I even have it on my phone, you know, it's fun,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
because my phone actually tries to play it on its own sometimes,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
because it's possessed.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
But they start, and they make a game from scratch,

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
and he goes through all the steps to even getting it published

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
on iOS, on the Android store.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
I noticed that.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Windows store, yeah.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
It got into a lot of like, not just here's how you program,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
but here's how, you know, all that other stuff

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
that sometimes a programmer doesn't want to have to get involved with,

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
but you do.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, so it was very informative,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
and then he's got like some other series.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
He did one which was like a Star Fox style game.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
I think I saw one, a pinball in there.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
One that I looked at, because it was short,

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
and it was their little featured video on their page,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
was the one where they made the game in three minutes.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It was kind of like the reverse kaboom,

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
where you don't try to catch the bombs, you try to avoid them.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Instead, it was such a like,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
it kind of gets back into what we were talking about, you know,

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
and it's kind of been almost a running theme on this show

09:51.000 --> 09:56.000
over the past month ever since YYR unveiled pixel sheds here on,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
yes, that was the game he made,

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
and I think he did that in Unity, right?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
I don't know if he's used their videos,

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
but he used Unity to make that very Atari 2600 game,

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
and we've talked about how sometimes it's just the idea.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Like, you don't necessarily need all these like gung-ho

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Final Fantasy-esque graphics,

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
although that's a nice thing for games to have.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
You don't necessarily need that.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
So, I mean, this game that they did in three minutes,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
and they're like, time me, and the whole thing,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
was a stupidly simple concept.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
I mean that in a complimentary way

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
that was executed quickly and easily,

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
so it was really cool,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
and it just kind of went to show like,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
oh yeah, you really can do this if you're just willing to,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
you know, put a little time in learning it.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
So, they will be on the show 45 minutes, give or take.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
We'll have them on the show,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
and you can ask your questions live,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
if you happen to be listening,

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Before we get there, though,

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
to the Cooking with Unity guys,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
which, quick plug for their site, of course,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
if you want to look at their videos,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
you know, when you're done with the show, of course,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
cookingwithunity.com just takes you right to their YouTube page.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah, they also have a Patreon,

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
and also, I believe, YouTube slash pushypixels

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
is their channel, I want to say.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Alright, we'll let them plug all their stuff they want to plug.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
They got Twitters and all that stuff.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
We'll get that a little later on,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
but let's get into, we got to talk about video gaming,

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
and what's been going on,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
because this week was a little less crazy than last week.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Obviously, last week was a very atypical week

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
for a December news pattern with the PlayStation experience going on

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
and the game awards happening.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
We had a lot of news come in last week,

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
so things have started to slow down a little bit this week,

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
but there's still quite a bit going on,

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
and so I want to talk about this big one to start,

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
because this is something that's outside of even just gaming.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
This is something that has started with something you've heard about

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
on the nightly news.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
You've heard about it everywhere,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
and that is about the hack that took place of Sony Pictures.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
The two are not tied together, Sony Pictures and PlayStation,

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
other than the obvious partnership,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
because at the end of the day, it's the same parent company,

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
so a lot of the stuff they pitch to you on the PlayStation Network

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
are movies made by Sony Pictures, right?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
But that's, I mean, just because Sony Pictures got hacked,

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
it didn't really affect the PlayStation side of things at all,

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
but certainly this is the second time in less than five years

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
that Sony has had to deal with a major, major hacking issue,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
and there's been a lot of stuff exposed because of this hack,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
and some of that has to do with very tabloid sorts of stuff,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
like what did this director say in this confidential email

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
about Angelina Jolie and so forth,

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
but it's also been very interesting into how Hollywood really works,

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and it's really been eye-opening for a lot of people,

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
not always in a positive way.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
And certainly there's an ethical debate to be had about that,

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
about should we be analyzing all this stuff that came out of a hack,

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
but I don't really want to have that debate today

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
because I can't really talk about should it or should it not have happened.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
It did happen, and now all this stuff is out there for us to sort of analyze,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
and us turning our back to it and saying,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
La-la-la, it didn't happen is not going to necessarily make it go away, right?

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
So that all being said, one of the big things that's catching a lot of gamers' attention

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
is this talk of is Sony about to make a Super Mario Bros. movie,

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
and how the fuck does that even work when Super Mario Bros. is a Nintendo thing?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Nintendo has said we're never doing a movie again

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
because that John Leguizamo Bob Hoskins movie was so bad,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Dennis Hopper, right, in that too.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It was so, so bad we're never doing a movie again.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
How does it even work when Nintendo teams up with their quote-unquote enemy to make a movie?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Now quickly, if you haven't heard about this,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
some of the information that came out of the Sony Pictures hack

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
were some emails that went back and forth between producer Avi Arad

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
to Sony studio chief Amy Pascal.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
And in the emails, which were dated, like this is recent.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
This is not like, this is a project that happened four years ago that got shelved,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
this email was from October 23rd.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
And the producer said, I am the proud father of Mario the Animated Film.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
And he sent pictures with Shigeru Miyamoto, Satoru Iwata,

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
and one of them actually said, happy CEO, let's get together, it's the mother lode.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.000
So essentially this producer went over to Japan, had a meeting with the Nintendo higher-ups,

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
and apparently, and we were having to kind of read between the lines a little bit,

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
you know, again, consider that this information, we're not supposed to know.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
We are not supposed to know this, but it got out.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
So take it with a huge grain of salt.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
But apparently what happened, the Sony producer went over there,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
or the producer went over there and pitched the movie.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
It's supposed to be an animated film.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, I was going to say, I could see that as an animated film.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Which also makes a little more sense as to why Nintendo might be on board,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
because it wouldn't necessarily be like a live action thing.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Nintendo has been experimenting a little bit with the animated film.

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
They had the Pikmin movies that showed up at that Japanese film festival

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
that Miyamoto actually was a big part of.

15:14.000 --> 15:19.000
So certainly Nintendo's dipping their toe in the water of these animated films.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
But I'm sure a lot of people are asking, well, why Sony?

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
But, well, why not Sony?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Because they're a motion picture studio.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
They've got, you know, an animation studio.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Nintendo doesn't have an animation studio.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
I mean, so your choices are, I think, I mean, I don't know if they're limited,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
but if you're looking at really big animation studios,

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
I mean, you've got Pixar and Sony Pictures Animation, DreamWorks Animation,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
and there's a lot of other smaller ones out there.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
But, I mean, it makes sense.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I mean, look at, and also kind of look at how they treated their properties.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
You know, Sony, I mean, they've got a Ratchet and Clank movie coming out

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
that looks pretty awesome.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
And I don't know about the, what was it, the other PlayStation 3 title

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
that they made an animated movie, whatever.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
That one wasn't that great,

16:05.000 --> 16:09.000
but the source of material wasn't that great to begin with either.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Let me jump in here in the chat room

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
because a lot of people saying this in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
and Rama starting us off saying,

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Sony Pictures is technically different from SCEI,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
so it's plausible for this to happen.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
And, yeah, I think that's the important thing is that even though at the end of the day

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
you have Sony, and then these are different divisions of Sony,

16:28.000 --> 16:33.000
that agreement that Nintendo may or may not have with Sony Pictures

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
doesn't necessarily have to carry over into PlayStation.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Like, and I'm sure that is very explicitly stated in the contract.

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
This does not mean that Mario's going to show up on the PlayStation,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
so get those fanboy images out of your head.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
You're not going to have Super Mario the Game,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
or Super Mario the Movie the Game.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
What was it called when they did it with Street Fighter II?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
The movie was, the game was so bad.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
It was Street Fighter the Movie the Game.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Street Fighter the Movie the Game.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
You're not going to have Super Mario Brothers the Movie the Game

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
show up on the PlayStation 4.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
That's not going to happen.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
And I bet Nintendo has that all very clamped.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
There would be no, and Nintendo probably has 100% control over the merchandise

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
because merchandising is something Nintendo really wants to get into now,

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
probably especially after what's going on with all this amiibo crap that we get in later.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
I got to say it.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Merchandising.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Right?

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
So I'm sure the agreement is very much this is about a movie and only a movie.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
And, you know, but as they say in the email, it's the mother lode.

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
I mean, an animated Super Mario Brothers movie,

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
I mean, there's an instant audience for that.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
You don't even need to see a trailer for it.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
You really don't.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Heavenly Sword was the title I was thinking of,

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
because they did a direct-to-video animated movie and it was just crap,

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
but Heavenly Sword wasn't that great to begin with.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Yeah.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Directed to you in chat saying,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
who was behind Final Fantasy The Spirits Within?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Was that Sony?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
That was Sony.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
Yeah, but Square Pictures was a part of that.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
That was a division that Square created and faded away real quick.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
A company that I wish would really do more stuff,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
because it wasn't bad.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
It was just not Final Fantasy.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
It's just they kind of it's as much Final Fantasy as was like,

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't know, the Castlevania game.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Honestly, there was a lot in that movie that was kind of ahead of its time,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
but we digress here a little bit.

18:21.000 --> 18:26.000
So what do you guys think when you hear about a Super Mario Brothers animated movie?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Do you think this is something that should happen,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
or let's stop with these video games?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Video games should be video games.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
Movies should be movies.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
When they cross over, it rarely does well.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
No, no, I think it's fine.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
I mean, especially if it's animated.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
That'd be fine, because it's when you do the live-action stuff

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
that doesn't really make any sense.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Look at how many Pokémon movies have we had.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
I mean, seriously, it's based off a game, so there's no problems there.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I don't see why this would be a problem.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Animal Crossing movie, I don't know.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
I didn't see it, but I heard it wasn't bad.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
My biggest concern about a Mario movie would be the voice of Mario

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
would be so, so important, because Mario, I mean, Mario has a very distinctive voice.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Obviously, Charles Martin.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Of course, it's going to be still him in the movie.

19:13.000 --> 19:19.000
But Charles Martinet never says anything besides the wahoo, yahoo, and all those voices.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Mario doesn't really have...

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
He'll just get Troy Baker to do it.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
He does everybody, so that's fine. He can do it.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
But I can imagine that Charles Martinet is going to be asked to voice the entire movie.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
With all due respect to the fantabulous man that Charles Martinet is,

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
I would just think that Sony would probably want to barter for some name-recognizable talent

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
as painful as that is for a lot of you guys to hear.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
That's the reality of the harsh business in Hollywood.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
Look at some of those other emails about Andrew Garfield and Spider-Man for what I'm talking about.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
I think it'll be fine.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
Just like, you know, there are people that can do the Mario voice that aren't him.

19:57.000 --> 20:05.000
Right, and I do think, well, Captain Lou, rest in peace, also pulled off an amazing Mario.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
It was a different Mario, but it was an amazing, memorable Mario that was a big part of our childhood.

20:10.000 --> 20:15.000
So to say that nobody else besides Charles Martinet can portray Mario would not exactly be right,

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
because Captain Lou had a different, but awesome Mario.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
But that's where we get into the tricky thing, because if we bring in another talent,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
then should it be different from the Mario we know in the games?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
Here's the tricky thing is...

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Then is it really based off the game?

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Here's the tricky thing is when you bring in talent and they're better than the source material.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Perfect example.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Heath Ledger as the Joker.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
No one's going to be able to compare to Jack Nicklaus' Joker.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
He was fantastic, and then...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
I mean, the guy that played golf.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Jack Nicholson.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Jack Nicholson, whatever, yes.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
The golf guy was good, too.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
But anyways, Jack Nicholson, you know, hey, I'm a fan of both, so that's fine.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
So, you know, no one can compare to him.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
Heath Ledger, that's a terrible casting.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
And then they saw it and they're like, oh, never mind.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
No one's going to be able to...

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
Now when, you know, the next, you know, was it the Batman Superman movie comes out, you know,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
now it's like, I think there's going to be another Joker in there.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Or, I don't know, Suicide Squad.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah, the new Joker's in Suicide Squad, and that, I mean, not to digress into a movie podcast,

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
but I mean, they're lining up some huge talent for that movie.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
They're talking about Will Smith in that movie.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
And I don't know if it's fan wank or whatever, but there's been talk about Oprah playing Amanda...

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
What's... Jamie, who's the head of the Suicide Squad?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Well, it's DC. I mean, who's the head of the Suicide Squad? Amanda?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
This is why I give you this flat look, like, the fuck do I read DC? No.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
Okay, well they're talking about putting Oprah Winfrey in the damn movie, and I'm like,

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
is she really going to be... But then the comic book movies are huge.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Oprah was in The Color Purple.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah, I know, I know.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
She was awesome in The Color Purple.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
If there was going to be a real-life Suicide Squad run by, like, you know, a powerful woman,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
then yes, Oprah I could see doing that.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But anyway, and then who's the...

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
What is the guy's name that got to play the Joker?

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Jared Leto.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
Who I think all the way back to... Wasn't he on My So-Called Life?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Wasn't that where he started?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
I don't remember, but...

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
Or one of those, like, 90s shows or something.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
And then he did the band. He had that band for a while, and now he's doing this.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And so he's going to be the Joker, and now you're right.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Everybody's going to inevitably compare him to...

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Heath Ledger.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Heath Ledger.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Same with Batman. I mean, Batman, they've been doing that, you know, comparing...

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
It's true.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
It's just, it's a different take on it, and honestly...

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
I don't know, I think...

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Amanda Waller, thank you.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
So that's why I'm not seeing if they come out with...

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
If he's going to have a different voice in the movie.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
It's not a big deal.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
I don't think it's going to...

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
As long as it works, I don't have a problem with it.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
If it's really weird, then yeah, that's going to be...

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
Okay.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
What other quick thought on this, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
This could be interesting.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I mean, who knows what's going to happen because of the hack now.

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Mario may get cold feet and pull out of this all together, and the hack may have fucked this movie.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
I mean, who knows?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
No, I doubt it.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Movies end up in development hell all the time.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
Just because this conversation happened doesn't mean the movie was ever, ever going to end up really being a thing.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
But it does open this interesting door.

23:14.000 --> 23:21.000
I mean, if Mario's going to end up being an animated thing, you know, every Friday on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
What did they have every Friday?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
The Zelda cartoon.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
Screw that show Monday through Thursday. It was all about Friday with no disrespect to Captain Lou.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
But it really was all about Fridays and the Zelda cartoon.

23:34.000 --> 23:39.000
And again, creating that very distinctive character that wasn't necessarily the same one from the games.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
Excuse me, princess.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
When has that ever been uttered in one of the games?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
They really should reference that.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
They really should, actually.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
But anyway, you can see the point I'm getting to.

23:51.000 --> 23:55.000
If a Nintendo Mario movie comes out, could Sony soon make a Zelda movie?

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Is an animated Zelda movie the type of thing you guys would want to see?

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
Or do we need to see IGN's April Fools trailer from six years ago expanded into a full movie?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Both.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
You want both.

24:09.000 --> 24:18.000
Also, speaking of IGN, I would also like to see their series. What was it? The Hogwarts Detective series or whatever that they had?

24:18.000 --> 24:24.000
Where it was like a cop drama set in the Harry Potter world. Yeah, I'd totally be down for that, too.

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room confirming that Jared Little's big break was my so-called life.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
Thank god I haven't forgot my 90s pop culture trivia. Phew.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
I could still kick butt in a game of Trivial Pursuit.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Some various people in chat talking about Amanda Waller and the different portrayals.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
We have Brad from Pod Culture coming right out and saying, fuck the new 52.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
So, not always popular, the reboot there.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
So anyway, and Akuma JP singing along.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
Friday, Friday, gotta get down.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
No. Stop.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
You know what? She did a sequel song called Saturday and it was actually kind of good.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
She milked that 15 minutes of fame.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
Well, the Saturday one is totally just making fun of Friday, but it was pretty funny.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
Back to the movie chat. We get on tangents sometimes on the show. Back to the movie chat.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
What you don't say?

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
Dark Sakura, Mario animated movies, is that something you'd be down for?

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
I think the Robitussin face that I just made sort of applies to that, too.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
So no, that was a very much do not want or it's nope o'clock face.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
It might be good for me, but I don't really want it.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
I'd be down with a Mario movie as long as it's set in like the Super Mario RPG universe,

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
because they had some pretty awesome characters for that.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
All right.

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
I do kind of miss the old Super Show cartoon, because that was fun.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Actually, the ones I liked were the Saturday morning ones that was set in the Mario world.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Oh yeah, the later ones, right?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Yeah, those were good. Those were good. I like those.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
All right, well, we will maybe see what comes of this, because my other big question,

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
would it be traditional cell animation like the old cartoons,

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
or would it be like that more modern CGI, Viva Pinata looking thing?

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Well, I was actually going to say if they did a Zelda one,

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
it would have to be a bit more serious and not the 80s cartoon style.

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
Right. Viva Pinata. There's a franchise that Microsoft really wanted to force down our throats

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
into becoming popular. It just didn't happen.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
I'd like to see something the way that you know how Street Fighter IV is done,

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
with that sort of 3D yet 2D-esque.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Kind of that jump out at you animation?

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
Right, where it's got the appearance of cell shading, but not quite.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
A comic book in motion.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Yeah.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
That's kind of what that looks like to me.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Or like Borderlands.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Yeah.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
So, was it a cartoon shading with an outline?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS, basically.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
I just think that it would lend itself well to Zelda.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
All right.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
If it was going to be an animated thing.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Some quick comments from chat to wrap this all up,

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Because it is a show where every gamer has a voice,

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
and some of the voices in chat right now.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Raginator says,

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
Hell, I'll take any Zelda movie, live-action or animated, so long as it's good.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Rama saying a live-action Super Mario Brothers movie would be great,

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
provided it's his fantasy setting like Willow.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
And some comments on Viva Pinata.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
YYR saying Viva Pinata was actually a pretty good game.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Magma Lemur. I don't think I've seen that before.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Magma Lemur.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Magma Lemur, sorry.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
Saying Viva Pinata was a fine game.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And if I remember correctly,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I want to say it's one of the free games of gold games that's coming up pretty soon.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
I think it was a while ago.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
A while ago.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Oh yeah, because I didn't download it.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I'm like, Viva Pinata.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
I played it when it came out.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
All right.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
We've got plenty more news to get to,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
but let's talk about our gaming weeks first

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
to help you establish, like where's our head at

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
when we're talking about all these games this week?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
What games have been filling our brains this week?

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I've been playing a lot of Dragon Age.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Oh yes.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
A lot.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
A lot.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
I hit 40 hours on my starting my second playthrough.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
And she's still in the Hinterlands.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
No, I'm not.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
Actually, I keep going back to the Hinterlands whenever I need elf root.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Although I did find, of all places,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
a really good place to get elf root and blood lotus

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
in the western approach in the desert.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Why 40 hours?

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
What has grabbed you about this game for 40 hours?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I'm just running around doing shit.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Really.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I'm MMOing it.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
It keeps you a busy bee?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I'm MMOing the lawn.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.000
So Dragon Age, I almost want to say Dragon Age Origins,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
but Dragon Age Inquisition is like an MMO without the other people.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Exactly.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
That makes it perfect.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I'm serious.

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
Because then I can just have, because I run it through Steam so I can screen shot it.

28:46.000 --> 28:54.000
After this playthrough though, I'm going to go in and set up the cinematic tools.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
So I can go in and take pretty screen caps and whatnot.

28:57.000 --> 29:03.000
But I've been doing this odd thing where because I've been delirious on coding for the last couple of days,

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
I've been creating my own dialogue in my head.

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
So now my Inquisitor is just this utter airhead who's like, everyone's like,

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
we're dying, we're being killed.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
She's like, look, I found blood lotus.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
Help me gather.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
But the quillbacks, blood lotus.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
Is that like when Alan and I watch the nightly news and we mute it

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
and then we just talk instead of the anchors when they're saying to each other?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
That sounds awesome.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
We're really good at that game, by the way.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
I've actually just been tempted to make a stupid video.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
I've been tempted to make a stupid Tumblr just for the weird dialogue

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
that goes on in my head during that game.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I've already started putting some on my regular Tumblr and I'm like, I can't.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
I don't know.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
D-A-I-M-H. Dragon Age in my head.

29:49.000 --> 29:56.000
Well, actually a few someones have said, are you going to do Dragon LoL?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Like you do LoL Effect?

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
And I'm like, fuck no.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.000
Do you know how long it takes me just to think of something for Mass Effect?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Haven't you talked about, you were mentioning to me the other day,

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
you were trying to do some broadcasting with it, but it was kind of bumpy.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
No, no, no. I wasn't trying to do broadcasting.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Raginator kept wanting to watch me play.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
Oh.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
And it worked fine a couple of times, but every other time it's like,

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
freeze the game and it would eventually unfreeze and I could save this last time.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Here I was freshly on a dose of Coding Cough syrup

30:24.000 --> 30:32.000
and when I am on opiates, I will switch from moods like you will not believe.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
And I was like, I can't, I can't, I got to turn off the game.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
It better save. My last save corrupted. What am I going to do?

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
And then it worked.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
And then I ended up playing like another fucking 15 minutes.

30:45.000 --> 30:49.000
That's probably the whole conflict between the fact that Dragon Age is not really a Steam game

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
because it's all on Origin.

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
And then I was like, but wait, I play this game so I don't have to play with other people.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
I don't want anyone to watch. Watch me run around in circles.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Well, turn off the broadcasting then.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
Well, no, I'm gonna, I'm just going to deny him in the future.

31:04.000 --> 31:09.000
But like half the thing that I do is like, can I jump up on this cliff?

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
I found half the shit I found by trying to climb rocks.

31:12.000 --> 31:17.000
I just keep, I keep my broadcast channel open all the time.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
I don't care. I still try to do that.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
If somebody wants to watch me stream when I'm playing, then that's fine.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
I am not an exhibitionist like you, Rob.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Well, but I always say, don't expect me to entertain you.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
Like if I do a Twitch stream, then I'm going to be on cam and make witty commentary.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
But if you're going to tap in and watch me playing something on Steam,

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
that's what you're going to see is me playing something on Steam.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
I'm not, you know, I'm usually trying to relax and do that.

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
But at any rate, my big thing lately is I'm just really running around and exploring.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
You know, I want to, I'm actually customizing my castle right now, which is like,

31:53.000 --> 31:57.000
oh, we've got this big guy out of here with red shit growing out of his face.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
We got to stop him or he's going to destroy the world.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
And I'm like, blood Lotus.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
All hail Skyhold. It is the best castle ever.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
I will decorate it with all the things.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
Can you quickly tell us about that funny thing we were talking about on Steam chat the other day,

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
the staff of sad or whatever it was called.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
The sad weapon.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Whoa.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
I have, I have slayed dark soccer with this sad weapon.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
It's like Mark something mace.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
It's a banana nailed to a stick.

32:32.000 --> 32:38.000
You find a schematic for it and it requires three sad splinters to make it.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
It is a banana nailed to a stick.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
So I've decided that maybe if, if, you know,

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
when a gamer X happens this next year,

32:51.000 --> 32:56.000
I'm actually thinking about doing some kind of dwarf cosplay because I'm short and you know,

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
buxom and I have decided that if I cosplay a dwarf,

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
she's going to carry around the sad weapon.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
Nice.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
The banana on a stick.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
The question is who will get it.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
But I bet that there'll be a lot of people probably that actually get that.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.000
So I also have a slight regret and that's putting a Varick in the scout meal

33:17.000 --> 33:22.000
because he needs to show off his, his carpeted chest,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
his carpeted dwarven chest.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
All right.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Manly chest hairs.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
All right.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
I played other shit.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.000
Okay.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.000
Well God, you could talk for three hours just about dragon age.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
Clearly I played some final fantasy today so that I wouldn't get kicked out.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
14.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Right?

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Yes.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
So I wouldn't get kicked out.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.000
And um, I've played some flux.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Okay.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
And I have an odd addiction to a game called Moonlight Mahjong.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
Makes me feel like I'm 70 years old, but I fucking love that game.

33:53.000 --> 34:00.000
I have no idea why, but whenever I just need something mindless to do, it's Moonlight Mahjong.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
That's it.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
Awesome.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.000
All right.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

34:05.000 --> 34:12.000
I just, my son has been playing a ton of Lego Marvel superheroes, so I had to play the game too.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.000
So I finished the game, at least the story portion of it.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
And I'm still trying to, I guess trying to platinum it.

34:18.000 --> 34:23.000
But the thing is, now that I've been playing it more, I'm starting to notice all the bugs.

34:23.000 --> 34:30.000
And um, yeah, it's, first off, okay, I had to reinstall the game because it crashed,

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
it would crash like all the time and it was really annoying.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
So I finally reinstalled it and that seems to fix that part.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
But now I'm getting weird glitch issues where, you know, I'll play as a character or something.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
And like I had one the other day where I couldn't control the character very well.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
Like it would only go in one direction and not the other directions.

34:49.000 --> 34:54.000
And end up having to kill him with another character in order to get control of him again.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
But um, what else?

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
Oh, and then for some reason, they have like these racing segments you have to do in the game.

35:01.000 --> 35:08.000
And the flying controls aren't very good, so you either go slow or you go super fast and can't control it.

35:08.000 --> 35:15.000
And you know, trying to go a little bit faster or just kind of control things, it just goes out of control very often.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
And the racing, they have racing controls.

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
So your driving controls are just, you know, gas break and left right and that's steers.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Okay, well that's how it is for the cars.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
But then they have these little RC car type things where they're like,

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Hey, you know what, let's just fucking change the steering control altogether.

35:33.000 --> 35:38.000
Let's just have it gas break and then you have to push in the direction that you want to go.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.000
So like if I want to turn and I'm going to the left, I have to push down, which makes no fucking sense.

35:44.000 --> 35:52.000
And so I was getting super frustrated with it because I'm trying to go, it's literally like just an oval track that happens to be on a roof.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
But the car just veers off the edge and just flies into the ground.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
I'm like, fuck this, I don't want that stupid car that this thing unlocks.

35:58.000 --> 36:06.000
Anyways, but I can't get platinum in the game if I don't finish it and it's really annoying.

36:06.000 --> 36:15.000
But it's fun. I have been unlocking some characters, you know, my son's now a fan of the song that plays.

36:15.000 --> 36:23.000
Well, in the credits and also in the home screen for the game, which is the Mary Marvel marching song or something like that.

36:23.000 --> 36:31.000
It's basically, I think, the Stanley's fan club's official song or something. So he's like really into that.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
And then he's been enjoying playing Loki because now I have Loki unlocked. So it's fun.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
And then I finally figured out how to customize my character.

36:39.000 --> 36:45.000
So I have a character with Thor's hammer and Loki's helmet and a goatee and stuff.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
That sounds awesome that you've been able to be doing a lot of gaming with your kid.

36:50.000 --> 36:56.000
Yeah, he's been very obsessed with it though. Like he gets mad if you have to turn the game off.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
So yeah, we're working on that. But yeah, he can actually play it now.

36:59.000 --> 37:05.000
I'm just trying to get him to be able to do it without me having to help him.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Switching characters is what he has trouble with usually.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
Alright. My gaming week, if you're all done.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
I am.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff to talk to you guys about.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
I've been playing a lot of the same stuff, you know, because not a lot of new stuff's come out.

37:19.000 --> 37:26.000
I've continued to play Final Fantasy XIV, which I decided to level a gladiator who's now a paladin for no particular reason.

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
But Alan made my little female lala, I play a little female lala, an entire set of all-pink armor.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
So I look adorable. So that's kind of one thing I've been doing in Final Fantasy XIV.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
I played Geometry Wars 3 earlier this week.

37:39.000 --> 37:44.000
And I actually played over SharePlay because Extifer saw me playing and he's like,

37:44.000 --> 37:48.000
I don't know much about that game, but I really like twin-stick shooters because he's really into super stardust.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
So Extifer, if you listen to my other show, Hoard House, you know Extifer.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
He was like, can we do the SharePlay thing?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
And I was like, sure.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
So we hopped on SharePlay and then I realized, oh, he doesn't just have to watch me.

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
Geometry Wars has that whole co-op built in.

38:01.000 --> 38:07.000
And it has the, you can play online mode, but then there's also the couch co-op.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
But thanks to SharePlay, you don't really need the couch.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
You can have the virtual couch.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
So we actually played a little bit of that and it actually ran.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
You would think there'd be a lot of lag, especially in a shooter.

38:16.000 --> 38:22.000
It ran really well and Extifer was able to hold his own pretty good on Geometry Wars over SharePlay.

38:22.000 --> 38:29.000
So thumbs up to that SharePlay technology because it's really unlocking new uses in these games.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
So being able to play Geometry Wars on the big virtual couch was a really awesome thing.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
So that was cool.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
So more Geometry Wars 3.

38:36.000 --> 38:43.000
And then one new but not really new thing that I've been playing a lot of this week,

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
and this might surprise some of you guys.

38:44.000 --> 38:50.000
I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIII on Steam.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
As you guys probably know, Final Fantasy XIII came out on Steam a couple months ago

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
and a lot of people weren't happy with it because it had some really weird issues with the graphics.

39:00.000 --> 39:06.000
Such as you could play in a window that was 720 pixels, that's it.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
Or you could play it full screen, 720 pixels, that's it.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
And there was just a lot of weird, crappy bugs with it.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
Well, they released this week a graphic patch.

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
So now you can play in a window that's 720 pixels or you can play in a 1080 pixel window.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
And they actually have the 1080p modes are kind of in this now.

39:25.000 --> 39:29.000
And you can play a whole lot of custom resolutions full screen.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
So I can play my native resolution full screen, which is what I've been doing.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
And the game looks great.

39:36.000 --> 39:40.000
Now not everything in the game is 1080p because like some of the pre-rendered movies and things like that,

39:40.000 --> 39:43.000
like that is stuck at the way they were rendered.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
They haven't really gone back and upped any of those things.

39:45.000 --> 39:49.000
But I'll tell you what, maybe it's because my machine's a little newer.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I upgraded a lot of it this year.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
But some parts of the game run smoother at like 60 frames a second,

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
like smoother than it does on the PlayStation 3.

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
And just the way a lot of the colors and things are kind of even more vibrant on a computer monitor

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
than they are necessarily on the TV while I'm playing on the PlayStation 3,

40:07.000 --> 40:13.000
I can just sit there and just watch the beauty of this game really unfold.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
And I know the game itself gets a lot of shit for some of its characters

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
and the fact that the first few hours of the game is press A to win type of thing.

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
But I think if you can get over that little hurdle, there's a really great story in there

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
that's a lot of fun to experience.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
And I'm having fun kind of going back and experiencing it again

40:31.000 --> 40:36.000
because this is really my second full proper playthrough.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
And I'm noticing a bunch of shit this time that I didn't notice the first time,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
such as characters that don't show up until partway through the game

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
are actually in the game early on if you look for them.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
They're in the background or like in a side type of thing, but they're there.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
So I'm kind of having fun looking at that.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
So kudos to Square for putting out that patch that actually fixed the damn game.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
Mostly, though, I do have one thing I've got to still complain about,

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
and that is that I was really thrown a fit on Twitter and IRL

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
because I got the graphic patch installed and I started running it,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
and I'm like, why is it skipping?

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
And what would happen is that it would run 20 frames skip, 20 frames skip.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
And it was this very noticeable skip.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
It would be like, go, stop, go, stop, go, stop.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
It was just really, really annoying. I can't play the game like that.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
It's too distracting.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.000
Well, I get really frustrated, and I'm like, God damn it.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
Why don't they put out a fucking demo so I can see that this is a piece of shit port

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
before I start playing it, da da da da da da.

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
And Alan looks over my shoulder and he goes, oh, I have that same problem,

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
and that's happening because your Xbox controller isn't plugged in.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
If you plug it in, it'll stop doing that.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
And I'm like, really? And I plugged it in, and sure enough, it stopped doing that.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.000
That doesn't make any fucking sense, but swear to God, that's what fixed it.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
And I don't know, I don't think an Xbox controller is required,

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
so I don't know if it's because I used one previously.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
It shouldn't still cause any frame skips if it's an Xbox controller's plugged in.

42:07.000 --> 42:14.000
Yeah, so a lot of that stuff was annoying to say the least,

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
but if you can clear some of those technical issues, the game is really good.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
Not that I can necessarily give Square a buy on a lot of these issues that are just like,

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
really? Really? It skips if the controller's not plugged in, really?

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
There's a lot of those little issues that it's hard to give Square a buy on,

42:33.000 --> 42:37.000
but if you can get past them, I would argue that the Final Fantasy 13 PC port

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
may actually be better than the PS3 port.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
And I'm really excited to get into 13.2 at some point,

42:44.000 --> 42:49.000
even though I hear not all the DLC carried over because of licensing issues.

42:49.000 --> 42:54.000
I'm really excited to beat 13 and then get into 13.2, which just released on Steam this past week.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
So there you go. I've been spending a lot of time playing 13.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
I do have my broadcast channel open, so if you happen to see me online, you can jump in.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
And I used to with Steam, I used to only accept people on my friends list that I knew,

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
like IRLs I used to beat, but I'm not such a stickler anymore,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
so for whatever reason I said no to your request before, just request again and I'll accept.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
So that broadcasting stuff is actually working now on Steam?

43:20.000 --> 43:26.000
Yeah, it's working. It's not as rich as, say, Twitch, but what I can do is I can say,

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
I have a little thing that is, you check the box, and if a friend right-clicks my name

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
and wants to watch my game, then they can. It'll just start streaming the game to them.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Yeah, and it'll show me in the corner a little, because Alan and I are playing this a little bit,

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
because I want to see what it'll look like. It'll show a little record light in the corner,

43:41.000 --> 43:46.000
it'll say one viewer or two viewers, whatever, and then in the top left in a really tiny font,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
if anybody says something in chat, it'll show.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
So it kind of uses that Steam overlay a little bit to be able to pop the important broadcasting information in there.

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
But there's still no webcam, there's still a lot to be desired for,

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
maybe a broadcaster that really, really wants to go pro.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
So do you have to turn that on, or is that just on by default?

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
You can turn it off.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.000
Because I can imagine that would use a lot of bandwidth if...

44:10.000 --> 44:14.000
No, you can disable it altogether if you want. Most people have it set to the way that Jamie has it set,

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
where somebody can request to watch your stream.

44:18.000 --> 44:22.000
But I just open my... if you're on my friends list, you can just tap in and watch whatever I'm playing.

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
But I just say, when I do a Twitch broadcast, that is performing.

44:27.000 --> 44:30.000
That is, I'm going to talk through the game, I'm going to give some explanations,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I'm going to tell you what I'm thinking, and all that stuff.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
When I'm Steam broadcasting a game, that's just you peeking in my window looking at my TV.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
You know, I'm not going to...

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
That's a little stalker-ish.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
It is a little stalker-y, but it's not like it's a webcam in my home,

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
it's just Final Fantasy XIII, so it's not too big a deal.

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
Alright, well, in just a couple minutes, we're going to get to our interview here,

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
but I think we have time to squeeze in one story.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Oh, I've got to do housekeeping real quick.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R, of course, and if you want to follow us on Facebook, you can.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and we're also on Google.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
And we are on YouTube as well, OrangeLoungeRadio,

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
and old episodes of the show available on YouTube.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Since I know we're interviewing a YouTube channel tonight,

45:19.000 --> 45:24.000
we may have some YouTube people that are listening or viewing or what have you tonight,

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
so we do have the YouTube, although the YouTube is just static pictures

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
over the show that Jason puts together.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
We do not at this time have a camera in our studio because it's OrangeLoungeRadio,

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
and we're really not that excited.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
If you want to see me in gym shorts bundled up in a Snuggie, then so be it,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
but otherwise it's not that interesting to look at, I don't think.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
And I still need a haircut, so yes.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
All right, you can see I did some light remodeling in Studio N7,

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
that arcade cabinet that Loki was complaining about last week.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Last time.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
We finally got it lifted and on and working.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
It's been a lot of fun, actually.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
I was playing BurgerTime on it earlier.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Nice.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
That's all I ever wanted was a BurgerTime cabinet in my house.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
All right, let's get into some news.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
We'll do one story here, and then we'll get to our interview tonight.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
Okay, so Amiibos have been selling pretty well.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
That's good for Nintendo.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
I mean, I guess everybody will be willing to buy anything that's in figure form nowadays.

46:16.000 --> 46:24.000
But apparently they've sold, well, Smash Brothers has sold nearly 700,000 copies,

46:24.000 --> 46:31.000
and they're saying that apparently the Amiibos themselves have sold quite a few as it is,

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
almost as many copies as the game.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.000
So, wow, you guys will really buy a lot of this stuff.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
I don't know.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Personally, I just don't get the Amiibo thing.

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
I mean, it's a cool add-on.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
I mean, if I want figure for my desk or something, that might be a cool thing to buy,

46:48.000 --> 46:51.000
but the functionality is just not there for me.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
I have a lot of Nintendo friends, like Nintendo fan friends, on my Twitter,

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
and let me tell you, the thirst is real for these things.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
I have people, somebody I follow on Twitter actually said,

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
I am so frustrated over this, I'm going to cry,

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
because they couldn't find the figures that they want.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
Like, I guess Nintendo released three new figures today,

47:11.000 --> 47:15.000
the Little Mac and the Diddy Kong came out today, and Zelda.

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Oh, yeah, because that's obviously one people want is Zelda.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
And so people really want these figures, right?

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
But they're so hard to find because Nintendo and hardware equals lull.

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
And I guess these things are really hard to find,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
and people are getting really, really frustrated at how hard these things are to get,

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
because now that we know Nintendo's pulling them from shelves,

47:35.000 --> 47:39.000
you know, it's like maybe they're not going to get one.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
I don't know.

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
Well, I think that you guys are just pointing to their hands if you ask me, but that's fine.

47:46.000 --> 47:53.000
And yeah, they're saying Nintendo did confirm that they're discontinuing some Amiibo figures after initial shipments.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
They're saying we will aim for certain Amiibos to always be available.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
These will be for our most popular characters like Mario and Link.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Do the shelf space constraints.

48:03.000 --> 48:09.000
Other figures will not return to the market once they've sold through their initial shipment.

48:10.000 --> 48:17.000
I think that's a load of crap if you ask me, because I think that the reason they're doing that is not necessarily shelf space,

48:17.000 --> 48:24.000
but they want you to feel the urge, like, oh crap, if I don't buy this right now, I'm never going to get it.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.000
It's just like the fucking Wii U was.

48:27.000 --> 48:35.000
They're trying to give you that impression that if you don't buy it now when you see it on that shelf, you're never going to get one.

48:35.000 --> 48:40.000
I don't believe that for one second, because they know that they're making money off of this.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
They're going to keep reprinting this.

48:42.000 --> 48:52.000
If it's any indication, like they've done with other games, they will have variants that they'll make.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
Or they'll be a different color one or something that comes out later on or something.

48:59.000 --> 49:07.000
Of course, they're saying that certain Amiibos are sold out, and they may return later on.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.000
They're saying that some Amiibos were very popularly launched, and possibly some Amiibos in the United States.

49:11.000 --> 49:15.000
Canada and Latin America may not be available right now due to the high demand efforts.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
I guess that's the expected, because people are really clamoring for these.

49:22.000 --> 49:27.000
I don't understand why, but once again, it's Nintendo. People are fans of Nintendo.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
I'm not going to buy for a second, though, that if there's an Amiibo that's sold out,

49:33.000 --> 49:40.000
I don't think that there's any figure that's in low demand right now, so I'm just not buying that.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
YYR says, I called Nintendo because of a problem redeeming a prepaid card.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
I asked the phone rep about whether they were going to make more Wii U GameCube adapters.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Exact quote from rep. I know, right?

49:54.000 --> 49:58.000
Bottom line, NOA has no clue as to whether more stuff is being made.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
I would expect the same to be true of Amiibos.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Once again, I think their strategy, and this has been their strategy since the Wii came out...

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
To starve the market?

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
To starve the market to drive up demand.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
It fucking worked, and people are buying into it, so why wouldn't they do it?

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
The fact that they're saying that, once we sell through this, we may not bring it back.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
Yeah, I could see that as possible.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
It's a possible scenario if you have an Amiibo figure that just is not popular.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
Say that they came out with, I don't know, a Birdo figure or something, and no one fucking...

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
I will be fucking buying that thing once, bitch.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
I understand that you would buy it, but let's just hypothetically throw out there.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
How dare you? How dare you say that Birdo has no fans out there?

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
I'm not saying that Birdo doesn't have any fans.

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
I'm just trying to throw out a random new character.

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
I'm not going to go down the list of every single character in Mario games until we get to the...

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Okay, I got one for you, Ice Climbers.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Aww, too soon, too soon.

50:58.000 --> 51:04.000
I'm just saying, let's just say, hypothetically, that they have a character that's just not popular.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
The dude in Hogan's Alley.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Because when has Nintendo ever revisited that game?

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Alright, that's fine.

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
Dude from Hogan's Alley, or how about CDI Mario?

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
CDI Mario or Zelda.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Those are figures that they're either derpy, no one wants them.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
Hypothetically speaking, yes, I can see if they're not selling, they're not going to make more.

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
Once they sell out of their initial shipment, that's it.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
That's going to be gone.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
But I think for any of these figures at launch, they're going to totally be restocking that stuff.

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
They're not just going to be...

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Why would you do that?

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Why would you stop selling a figure for the hell of it?

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
If it's selling through, you would keep doing it until it stops selling through.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
I think if you're the person that's getting really frustrated at not being able to find these figures,

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
let Nintendo know.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Tweet them, email them.

51:49.000 --> 51:53.000
I wouldn't necessarily say call them, because I don't think the people answering the phone can really...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Apparently they're in the same boat you guys are.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
But make sure Nintendo knows.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
You want these figures and they're not making enough of them.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
And that's probably going to be the best thing to get another shipment.

52:03.000 --> 52:08.000
That's how we ended up getting Earthbound on Virtual Console,

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
a western release of The Last Guardian and all these rainfall games.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
Now, SSJ100Matt was saying, listen, Nintendo isn't losing money on them.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
He was jerking people around like this and manipulating the market.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I don't think that they're...

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
They're not sitting on shelves.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
They're selling out immediately, so they're going to keep making them.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
I just think that they're...

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
But it always sucks when it's selling out immediately because it's eBay scalpers and buying it up.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
And you know that's what's happening.

52:36.000 --> 52:41.000
And also, and I've got to double check here because I know I didn't put these stories on our show roll,

52:41.000 --> 52:46.000
but they had some news about upcoming figures and the bullshit that they're doing.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
That crap where it's like, oh, hey, hey, you really want Rosalina?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Well, it's going to have to go to Target for that.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Or, hey, you want this figure?

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
Well, you got to go to Toys R Us.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
Or there's the rumor about that Shulk GameStop is purposely...

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
This is a huge grain of salt because it's one of those, I work for GameStop,

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
but I'm not going to tell you who I am.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
Where apparently GameStop is going to hold half the Shulks to sell as used.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
I mean, it sounds really...

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
I'm almost like, even GameStop's not that low.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Sell them as used?

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
They did that with another title.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
They did that with the...

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Yeah, Metroid Prime Trilogy.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
No, no.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
They did that with...

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
No, they did that with the reprint of...

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Was it The Last Story or something like that?

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
Xenoblade.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Xenoblade, yeah.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And they sold it for more than retail because of high demand.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Jamie, quick comments.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
We got to get to our interview with Jamie.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
Just that my coworker picked up four amiibos,

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
and all they do is sit on the wall between our cubicles

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
so that we have the eternal battle between Link and Red Ring Rico

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
from Phantasy Star Online.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Nice.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
Just saying.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Well, those amiibos seem to be doing very, very well for Nintendo,

53:48.000 --> 53:54.000
so whether it is artificial or natural, who knows?

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
That's anyone's guess.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
All right, but we are going to shift gears here quite a bit

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
because we want to bring onto the show here tonight

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
our friends from the YouTube series Cooking with Unity.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
We're going to get Max, Phil, and Jeffrey, all of them.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
They're all actually in the same room,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
and we're going to talk to them all here tonight,

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
the guys from Cooking with Unity.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
And if you have questions for them,

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
you can submit it in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
but I believe we have them on the line.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
You guys there?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
We are.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
We are here.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Yep, I'm here as well.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Hello, hello, guys.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
Hello.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Thank you so much for taking time to be with us tonight,

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
and you guys are all in the same room just like we are.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Yeah, yeah, we're all in the same room,

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
and thank you for inviting us.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
It's exciting to be on your show.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
No worries.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Actually, I got to give credit to Loki here.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
Loki's kind of our game maker here on staff,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
and he really likes you guys an awful lot.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
He's the one that showed me about the show.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I love the show and the banter.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
The banter's the best part.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
All right, well, I'm glad you do

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
because a lot of times when we do the banter,

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
we're like, oh, no one is watching this for this.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
So it's good to hear that the banter's coming across, too.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Usually when we're bantering,

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
we're talking about stuff

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
because we've run out of intelligent things

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
to say on the show.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
And we don't want YouTube to clip the video.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Yeah, exactly.

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
So for those who don't know, Max is the first guy that talked.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
I'm Phil from Cooking with the Unity.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
I'm Max.

55:17.000 --> 55:20.000
And I'm Jeffrey.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
And, yeah, we enjoy doing the show,

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
and I'm really happy that you guys,

55:24.000 --> 55:27.000
I'm really happy that Loki is enjoying the show,

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
and it's really great that we got an invite

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
to do the show with you guys.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
And hopefully we can answer some questions

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
and give people a place to actually start

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
for making games and starting their career making games.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Excellent, because that's where my head's at.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
It's like, well, you can't say I'm not a fan.

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
I'm still not understanding the subject matter fully,

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
but I want to get there.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
I want to get to that point someday.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
So that's really exciting.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.000
And I don't know if you guys heard earlier in the show,

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
I was kind of talking about

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
a lot of what you guys seem to do for game creation.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
There's a lot of what I've said about podcasting.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
I don't know if you know,

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
we've been doing Orange on its Radio for 12 years.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
That's wild.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
Especially considering how early podcasting was

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
at the time that you started it.

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
Yes, absolutely.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Well, there was no podcast when we first started.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
You were a radio station, right?

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Yeah, we were live through 65,

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
and then that kind of evolved into that.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.000
But we love it when people create their own shows,

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
just like you guys really empower people

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
to make their own games, which I think is so important.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Well, let me take a step back and ask you guys,

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
for those that don't know what Cooking with Unity is,

56:24.000 --> 56:25.000
tell us about it.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
What is Cooking with Unity?

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
So, what the show is,

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
it's my attempt to educate people on how to make video games.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
I realized, so I started in the industry at Sony,

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
and I went to DigiPen for school and stuff,

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
and so I kind of got immersed in how to make games and stuff.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
And when I was growing up,

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
there wasn't as much internet resources for things,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and there wasn't even as much internet.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
And it just seemed like, with Unity,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
this is the time to actually start showing people,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
in general, how games are made

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
and what people do when they make games,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
and what does it mean to make a game.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Like, my biggest problem was,

57:04.000 --> 57:07.000
if you were to ask a random person on the street,

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
how do you make a movie,

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
they wouldn't be able to give you a very specific answer,

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
but they'd be able to say,

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
okay, you get a camera,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
you get a bunch of people in costumes

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
on the other side of the camera,

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
you shoot the scene,

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
you do some editing,

57:18.000 --> 57:19.000
maybe you have a green screen

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
and use the magic of a computer or something,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
but they'll have a general idea.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
But if you ask a random person how to make a video game,

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
they're going to just give you this blank stare.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
They're going to be like,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I think you use a computer at some point in the process,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
and that's like all people know.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
And making games has gotten a lot easier

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
in the last few years

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
because of all the middleware and engines

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
and tool chains that are available for free or for cheap.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
We've got Unity, we've got Unreal,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
we've got Crytek, CryEngine,

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
we've got smaller, lesser known ones

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
like Cocos2D and Erlicht and a few other things.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
But if you want to actually get started making a game,

57:58.000 --> 58:01.000
you no longer have to start by making the game engine.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
You can actually just start making your game,

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
which is exciting.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.000
Why Unity in particular?

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Well, in my case,

58:11.000 --> 58:14.000
it's because it just fit my organization style.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
I started using Unity during a game jam,

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
and I had never used it before,

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
and I was able to make a very simple game in two days

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
without having ever touched Unity before.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
It's just very well organized.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
I like the way that it's a component-based organization

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
for building things.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
And the thing is, if your question is

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
why Unity over anything else,

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I'm not going to say that you should use Unity

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
over anything else.

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
I think you should use whatever works best for you.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
If you download Unreal and it just clicks

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
and you just love the Blueprint system

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
and you can understand you start making a game,

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I want you to make a game.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
I don't care if you use Unity or not.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
But I use Unity because it fits my workflow.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I'm very familiar with it.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I use it for my own projects,

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
and therefore I can teach it to people

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
and teach how to use it on their projects.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
You know why you guys are awesome?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Because in that sentence there,

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
you said, I want you to make a game.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And I think that is such a great message.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
Absolutely.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
That's something that I hear in your videos as well.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
So let me ask this question.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Why is that important?

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Why should you go make a game?

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Why shouldn't you make a game?

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
I mean, honestly, if you're passionate about something,

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
then you should absolutely go out and do it.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
You should get that passion out there into the world

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
and develop something.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
I mean, it's an art form just like anything else.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Oh, God, I went into the art form thing.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Oh, sorry.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Video games as art is a whole other discussion,

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
but I'm sure you guys have had that one before.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
So the thing is, yeah, why shouldn't you make a game?

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
The thing is, I talk to a lot of people who play video games,

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
and I always hear game designs from people.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
I'm like, you know what would be a really cool game?

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
And sometimes it'll just be a really high-level thing.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It'll just be like, if it was Call of Duty,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
but it had motorcycles.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
It might be something as simple as that,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
or it might be someone who has a really cool idea

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
for a puzzle game or something, and everyone has these ideas,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
and very few people get the opportunity

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
to actually build something

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
that works towards making these games a reality.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
And the other thing I'm worried about is,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
the games industry, because of how hard it is,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
or how hard it was, I think it's getting a lot easier,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
but how hard it is to learn how to make games,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
it was attracting these people

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
that might not even be interested

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
in the games themselves, but are interested

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
in solving the challenges, and that's great.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I have no problem with that.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I have no problem with non-gamers making games.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
But I want to see more gamers making games,

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
because gamers know what they want,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
and they can actually iterate on the previous art

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and create something new and interesting,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
and they already know the limitations

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
that they're working within,

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
and they're going to be able to figure out

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
how to work around those limitations

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
and change the expectations for games

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
from a perspective of someone who is themselves

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
a consumer of game products.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And so that's really important.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
You raise a really good point there,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
that there's a lot of non-gamers in the game industry,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
and we've kind of hit on this before

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
when we talk about management decisions

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that screw games up,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
that cause buggy things to be released

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
because it's more important to get a game out

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
at a certain day and date to satisfy an XYZ person.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
We get that all the time,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
and I think that's great,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
to get more gamers involved in making games.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Y-Y-R in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
The feeling of playing something

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
that I created with my own two hands

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
is one of my favorite feelings in the world.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
If you have questions for our guests tonight

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
from Cooking with Unity,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
you can ask that in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Have you guys heard of any games

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
that you may have helped through your YouTube series

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
or inspired to create?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
We're still early in our history for that kind of thing.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I have seen some really cool projects

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
from people who might not have started with our show

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
but are definitely using our show now,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
and I'm really excited to show more of that

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
on the show as things progress.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
The thing is right now,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I want to show what people have made on my show.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
We want to have more segments

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
that show what other people have made using Unity

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
and what other people have made using whatever they want to make it with.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It doesn't have to be Unity specific.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
We've seen some really good projects,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
but they're all in progress.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
They will need an audience later.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
I don't want to just jump the gun,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
show something that I think is kind of cool now.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Other people might not get why it's cool yet,

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
and then when they need the exposure,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
it might be harder for them to get it.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I don't have any direct examples for you right now,

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
but there will be some soon

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
as these projects come to fruition.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Well, I know of one. I know of at least one.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Right, Loki?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Yeah, absolutely.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I just wish I had something to show right now.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
It's just redoing the engine three or four times already.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
But the great part, though,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
is when I was learning,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
and I'm still learning

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
because I'm just teaching myself everything,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
I just started in March

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
to actually start working on a game idea.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000
But just trying to skip doing it the hard way,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
and then having to learn to do it the hard way,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
which is a good way to learn things, I guess.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Oh, it's always good.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It's a constant learning experience.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I mean, you never know all the answers,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
and there's always new ways to do things.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's really exciting to try to solve problems dynamically.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Sometimes you even find old ways to do things.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I found that, especially in the days of mobile,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
some of my knowledge about how PlayStation 1 games cut corners

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
is actually useful

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
because those same corners can be cut on mobile

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
and give you great-looking visuals with less performance.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
And so there's a lot to learn.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
You started in March, and as Phil said,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
you never run out. We haven't run out yet.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I learn a new thing every day making games.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
At least one thing every day.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000
And that's not an exaggeration by any stretch of the imagination.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And sometimes it's really simple stuff too.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Occasionally someone will be watching my show

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
and point out a feature in Unity that I didn't even know was there.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And I'm just like, wow, that saves me 20 minutes every time

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
that I would normally have to do it this other way

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
that I had already figured out

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
because I just didn't know that this was built in.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I'm sorry that I'm not giving concrete examples here,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
but I'm sure that you've run into this yourself

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
in the short time that you've been working

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
where you find a way to do something,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
and it totally works, and it's fine.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
And it doesn't have really many disadvantages or anything,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
but you find out later you could have done the same thing

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
in one line of code and even less worry,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
and it's a little bit more efficient and stuff.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
That being said, the super important thing to remember,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and this is something where I differ from a lot of teachers and stuff

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
where they're like, you need to learn the right way to do things.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
There's a million right ways to do anything in game development.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
There's a million. This is not an exaggeration.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
And there's a few that are terrible,

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
and there's a few that are awesome,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
and there's everything else that's in between.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And the thing is, most of the in-between stuff

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
will do what you need it to do.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
So my rule is, if it works, use it,

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
especially when you're learning.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
If you have a solution to the problem,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
don't worry that it's the best solution.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I have a lot of people who are like,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
did I do this right? And they've done it totally right.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And they're like, but is there a more efficient way to use it?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And my answer is always, yes,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
there's always a more efficient way to do it.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
It is efficient enough, and it works,

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
and that's the most important part.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
What needs to be important is you can always optimize later on.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
If you've encountered a situation where,

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
yeah, the game's running terribly

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
because of the way that I've implemented this thing,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
well, you can always go back and refactor it

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
into a way that's using a different solution to the problem.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
You can always optimize later on.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
This is great to listen to,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
but for me, I've got to admit,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
my knowledge of game making is so-so.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I used to be able to make stuff in ZZT.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
That game was awesome. I used to use that.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
And maybe Commodore 64 Basic back in the day.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
All right.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I love Commodore 64. We can talk Basic all day.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
God, that system was so flippin' amazing

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
and kind of ahead of its time in many ways.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
But anyway, let's say I want to make a game.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
I'm going to do this. I'm going to download Unity.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I don't have a whole lot of programming experience

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
except maybe like 10 print,

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Rob is awesome, 20 go to 10.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
So I have very little programming experience.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So now what? Where is Word 1 in chapter 1?

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Where do I start?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.000
So we made a series actually specifically for this.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
It's called From Scratch to Published.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
And we cover...

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So it starts in episode negative 1,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
which is a strange episode number to start at.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
But the reason I did that is the first episode teaches you

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
how to download and install Unity and start using Unity.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Episodes negative 1 and 0

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
are for how to set up your computer

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
and how to get an email address.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So we cover the most basic stuff you can possibly have.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
We talk about every single thing.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And we go all the way up to the point

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
where we actually publish on several stores,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
namely the Windows Store for both phone and PC,

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the iOS and Mac app stores,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
and the Android Play Store.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
And the thing is,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
so when you're watching this one,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
there's going to be points,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
especially if you're a fresh beginner,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
you haven't done much programming in a while,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
or maybe no programming whatsoever,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
there's going to be some stuff

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
where you're going to just have to take it on faith

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
what I'm saying.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I try to explain things very thoroughly,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
but sometimes in the effort to just get the next section done,

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I have to just say,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
here's the code, here's what we're doing,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I try to explain it,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
but it's not going to click at first.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
And so you've got to just work with it.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Don't stop there.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
It's not going to teach you everything you need to know.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
It's going to teach you enough that you can get started.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And from there,

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
you'll start forming questions

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and start answering your questions yourself,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
and you'll be able to figure out how these things actually work.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
The important thing is,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
on the series, because we start from scratch,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
we start literally on a PC

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
that doesn't have Unity installed,

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
or any program installed,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
we show installing Unity,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
we show installing Source Control,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
we show how to use Source Control stuff.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Most people don't even know what Source Control is,

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
and most people don't use it,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
and this is terrible.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
People should be using it.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
What Source Control is is basically a backup system

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
slash collaboration system

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
so that when you make changes to the project,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
everyone else working on the project gets those changes,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
and more importantly,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
if you make a change and something's wrong,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
you can go back later and be like,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
hey, that change was wrong,

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
and it keeps that history

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
of everything that you've done.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
That way, mistakes are less costly.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
What's fun about games

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
versus pretty much any other industry

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
is there's the only cost

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
involved in making them

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
effectively, once you have the tools,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
which the tools are free now,

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
is the cost of time.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
The worst mistakes in the world

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
that you can make will only cost you time.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
They will never cost you manufacturing resources.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
You will never have to replace things

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
because you did something wrong in code.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Well, okay.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Yeah, I mean, if you drop your iPhone on the floor,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
it'll be your test device.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
There's little problems like that,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
but it's from the physical world.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It's not from the digital world

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
that these problems are occurring.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
So mistakes should be embraced.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You really do learn from mistakes.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
So don't feel bad

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
when something doesn't work right.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Feel good when you make it work right afterwards.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
And so, yeah,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
From Scratch to Publish will give you

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
probably the best kind of overview

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
front to back of game development

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
using Unity.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And then you can start to get more specific on videos

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
and by downloading

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
text content or using assets

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
from the Asda store to try and figure out

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
the rest of the way, how things work.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Remember, there's always

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
more to learn. There's always tricks that

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
like, I don't know all the tricks.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
I try to teach as many tricks as I know.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
When I find a new trick, I try to tell people about it.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But I will never know everything.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And no one will.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
But try to know as much as you can.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And get into it. And I know you will enjoy it.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Alright, I'm going to check that out.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
In fact, I even see why YR just linked that

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
to episode negative one in our chat room

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
over there at live.vognetwork.com

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And if you are just joining us live, we are talking

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
with Max, Phil, and Jeffrey all from

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Cooking with Unity.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
If you go to cookingwithunity.com

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
it will just take you right to their YouTube channel

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
that has everything there.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Do you guys have any other, like, I don't know

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
if you guys do Twitter feeds or Facebook

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
or anything else we should be following you guys on?

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Oh, I'm on Facebook, or on Twitter.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Twitter is MagmaLemur

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Awesome. And I'm on

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Twitter as Drakfire, that's

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.000
D-R-A-K-F-Y-R-E

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Alright. I'm also in the channel as Drakfire

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
so if you just spell my name in there.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Sounds good.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And if you guys have questions, wait, there's three of you

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Wait, am I in the channel out there?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
There's three of us, but I don't think Jeffrey has a Twitter.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
No, I don't have a Twitter.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Alright, that's alright. That's alright.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Darsakra has a Twitter, but she doesn't ever use it.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
So I tag her in things. I use it sometimes.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Yeah, she'll reply to it like a month later.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And I'll complain about Pinkberry being closed ten minutes early.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Yeah, why did you tag me in this?

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Alright, anyway.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
So, awesome, awesome.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Loki, I want to go to you, because

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
surely you've got some things you want to ask these guys.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Yeah, I mean, the

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
one general question. First off,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
I was going to mention, they do have a Patreon as well.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So there's some cool stuff

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
that you get access to, like they have a

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
repo with some cool

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
code and stuff in there that you can

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
check out. So definitely

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
go check that out and support them

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
if you can. The other thing I was

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
going to say is, now I know you

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
guys have done quite a few different types of

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
games in the past,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
different projects and stuff.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Looking forward, what are some

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
different types of games that you're looking to tackle

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
in future projects?

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Well, I know

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
for one, I'm working

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
very close with Justin Morovitz

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
on Vanguard

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
V, and I really hope that we get funding

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
for that project, because that's going to be awesome.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Justin is

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
trying to start a studio

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
that's VR centric.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
And I think that's

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
important.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I do think that's actually ultimately

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
where the games industry is going to move towards

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
is virtual reality.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I'm not saying that we're going to get rid of TVs.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I think that's silly to think that.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I don't think we're going to be getting rid of tablets or anything.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
But we're going to be adding VR to the mix.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And I think that the people who have been

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
playing games the longest

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
are going to be very interested in seeing

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
what actually comes to pass with virtual

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
reality. So I would say that

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
in my future at least, what I'm hoping

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
for is to get to work on more virtual reality

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
related games

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
and projects. It's an interesting

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
challenge because you have the physical aspect.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
You don't want to give people

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
whiplash when they're playing your game. You don't want

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
people to get motion sickness.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Although I do think motion sickness

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
is going to be less of an issue as people get

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
their sea legs, so to speak.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Just like how

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
people forget, but when the games first started

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
just games scrolling left to right would make some

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
people sick. And now

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
you would never even worry about that. You would

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
scroll the game however fast you want it left

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
and right. You can jiggle it

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
back and forth and no one's going to get sick.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And it'll be that way for VR at

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
some point.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Cool.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Speaking of VR, I see in our chat room

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Bobby Blackwell says, I demoed Vanguard V

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
at a recent VR meetup with the

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
KOR FX vest. Bobby

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
by the way is our guy on the network that is really into

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
this VR stuff.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
He wants to know when the Proton Pulse talk is starting.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Well,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Proton Pulse is available on Google Cardboard

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
right now. Go get it. Go get a cardboard

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
and go download it.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Full games available, so

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
yeah.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
They just released the Cardboard SDK for

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Unity, I just saw.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Yeah, we've had a beta

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
version for a while and actually I think it's been

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
publicly available too, but we've had

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
some close interaction with Google which has been great.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Speaking of

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Bobby, there's always a really funny debate

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
that you and him

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
have, Loki, going back and forth

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
when you first got into programming.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I don't think there really is a right or wrong

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
answer, but I thought I would consult the experts

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
here for the Cookie with Unity and

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
ask this, when we talk about your very first

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
project, I'm going to start my first project

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
and my first game.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
In your opinion, do you think it's better to

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
build clones of existing

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
games or to just,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
you know what, I'm going to do my own thing. Do your own thing.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
This is a really, really good question.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Oh,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
yeah, I mean, my first project

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
ended up being that little game robot alone

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
that I made.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And that's only on iOS

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
unfortunately, I still haven't gotten around to

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
porting it to anything else, even though it takes

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
no time and effort, I just need to boot up the project.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Apparently I'm too lazy to do that.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It was my first game

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
and it's basically a clone of Puro 2

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
from WarioWare,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
the first WarioWare game

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
for the Game Boy Advance. It's a very small

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
mini-game there, but it was something

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
that's small in scope that I knew how it

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
functioned and I think it's very important

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
to take something that you kind of understand

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
how it works and just make something simple

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
and once you make that simple thing work,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
just step up the complexity a little bit more.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Like starting with Pong is not necessarily

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
bad or Space Invaders,

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
something like that, something small and

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
simple that you know kind of mechanically how it

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
works so you can kind of just

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
get a feel for what you need to

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
implement. Yeah, and on the show we model

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
our episodes based on

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
genres and we try to basically

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
make it based on another

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
game that's similar in that genre.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Our very first episodes were

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
well actually my very first episodes, it was

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
before we had multiple people on the show,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
were Space Invaders

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
and I believe Space Invaders

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
is probably the best place to start

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
and not necessarily on my show

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
because it's terrible, I had

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
no showmanship or anything back then.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
But some people still say they like the

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
episodes, but I'd say starting with

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Space Invaders is good because it teaches you

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
a lot of the basics about game development.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It teaches you how to

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
make bullets happen.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
That's a very common thing, how to spawn something

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
and make it move on the screen.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
It teaches you movement

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and it teaches you how to create and destroy

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
things on the screen that you're destroying.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
And all those things are really important in games.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Pong is a really good example

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
as well except for it doesn't really teach

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
it teaches very basic instantiation and

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
destruction, there's only one object. I like

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Space Invaders because there's a few more objects to work with

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
so it feels like there's something to sink your teeth into.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
As far as to whether everyone

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
should do this, what I

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
mainly want to say is

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
it probably doesn't matter that much as long as

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
you have a really clear idea in your head what you're making

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
whether you duplicate something that's

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
existing or if you go with your own design.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
But the scope

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
is important. So if your

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
dream project is, and I know a lot of people

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
have this and I'm not dissing the

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
dreams here, if your dream project is

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
an MMO where you

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
can do real time combat

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
and wherever you strike the shield

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
on the opponent is exactly where the

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
damage happens and there's a

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
damage model for it. You have this

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
pages and pages and pages. Don't start

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
with that game. Please don't

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
start with that game. Even if

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
your high concept starts with

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
is a multiplayer game, don't start with

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
that game. Start with a single player game.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
If you do want

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
to work towards your dream project though

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
start with a small project

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
that represents

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
a portion of your larger

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
project and then just keep doing that

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and then build them together.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And what I mean by that is

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
honestly a really good example

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I think is the Metal Gear series.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
In that

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
if you've ever played Metal Gear Solid

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
which

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Metal Gear Solid, sorry

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake, the MSX version

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
it's on the anniversary

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
collection. It's the

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
last 2D game before they went to 3D.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
If you play through that game you'll see

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
that pretty much everything that happens

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
in that game happened

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
in Metal Gear Solid later

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
in 3D. Even

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
smoking to display

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
lasers and go through them

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
that's in that game first.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Crawling under tanks is in that

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
game first. Pretty much

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
every single interaction, all the elevator interactions

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
all of the communication

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
between characters, all the codex stuff

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
was in that game first. And that game

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
is a 2D game.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
So he had tried

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
this formula already

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
before they moved to 3D. Before they did

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
something that was ground breaking.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
And Metal Gear Solid was truly ground

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
breaking for the time. And

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I think that company still just does amazing

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
work. I love Kojima's work.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
So think about it from

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
a perspective of make the

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
simple version of your game.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Do stepping stones and then once you have the simple version

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
you can kind of already work some of the problems

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
out and then you can make a slightly more complex version.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And then before you know it you'll have

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
you'll be working on the networked multiplayer

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
massively multiplayer online version of your game.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
I mean it's all about iterations upon

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
your development basically like

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
yeah just start with something simple. You know like Metal Gear

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
maybe didn't eventually originally have

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
like pressing up against a wall in the first

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
version so they added it in the second one

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
so you could start hiding around corners.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And so on and so forth and they just kept going

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
with these ideas and that's how you get

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
these really complicated games is you start

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
off simple and just kind of keep iterating

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
ideas and adding functionality

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
to things.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Alright well to be fair to Bobby he is saying

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
in chat room I stressed more something that

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
was small in scope not necessarily

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
a full clone but that seems to definitely be in line

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
with the message you guys are saying is that if you want

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
to make this gigantic dream game

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
MMO focus on that one little

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
part first that maybe you can build into

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
the larger game later. And yes Black Wolf

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I did say simple was boring. It's just not for

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
me. That's not what I want to do and that's fine

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
you know the fact that I didn't start with a simple project

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
means I've learned

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
so much more so and not to say that I

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
would you say that even though you maybe didn't take

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
on a simple project at first Loki you still

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
you're building one piece at a time. Yes

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
and I'm also not crazy enough to do an MMO

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
no one I don't want to ever

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
do an MMO ever ever

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
ever ever ever just

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
it sounds too too crazy

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
so never no idea how many

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
times that I've heard someone say oh I've got

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
this really good game idea I want to make it

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I'm working on an MMO like that's

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
that is usually surprisingly

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
it happens all the time.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Oh gosh well gosh a dungeon

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
buster in our chat says this is a great interview lots

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
of great advice you know what I agree this is

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
this has been so informative and there's

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
so much more information that I

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
hope folks will go check out over on your YouTube

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
channel over at cookingwithunity.com

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I do have to wrap things up here

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
pretty soon because we've almost been on the line

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
for a good half hour talking about making games

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
but before I let you go

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
I do always ask the people on our

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
show what games are you

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
playing you know besides the ones you're making

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
what games are you playing these days

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
so can we go around the room there real quick with you three

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
alright one two

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
three GTA 5

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
yeah I've been playing GTA 5 on the PS4

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
that game is astounding

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
no wonder you like these guys

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
listen I don't need the love you guys anymore

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I mean seriously

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
the scope of that game

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
and like the amount of detail they put into

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
it is just unreal

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
they must have

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
actually put human souls into that

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
game to make it run the way it does

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
like the

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
amount of things they network we've been playing

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
it online together and

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
it's just outstanding

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I do not know how

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
they network all this information

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Loki was like a top 100 player on GTA 4

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
yeah I used to play multiplayer

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
a lot on GTA 4

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
a lot a lot but

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I've been playing a lot

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
was it Playstation 4? I know I saw a video

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I don't remember if it's from Playstation 4 or not

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
but yeah we need

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
the hookup online

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
because I haven't played any online yet

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Jeffery what games have you been playing

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
because you probably have a more diverse

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
library than we do

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
well I usually play a lot of

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Steam games lately

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Gauntlet came out not too long ago

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I've been playing the 2014 Gauntlet

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I still play Monaco

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
from time to time

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
that's a really great stealth game

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Monaco was fun

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I actually really was impressed with that game

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
when you started showing that at work

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Jeffery and I used to work together at a place

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
called Play Habit that unfortunately is not around anymore

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
it was really cool

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
the person who ran the place actually

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
came up with the marketing

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
well effectively came up with the marketing slogan

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
that Sega used

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
for so long of

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
blast processing, he was actually the originator

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
of that phrase

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
so that was pretty wild

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
of blast processing?

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
I've got an interview with him

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I need to post it online sometime

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
he's giving me permission but I want to make sure

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
it has impact when it happens

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
well you guys are awesome

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
and I love the message you guys carry

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
that I want you to make a game

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
so I want to say something here real quick

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
this is kind of a little bit of an announcement

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
but I want you guys to be able to hear this too

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
because I think you guys will really like this

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
this is kind of like an ongoing theme that's been going on

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
with our show

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
and with Bobby's show and some of the other shows on the network

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
from talking about

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Loki's game and how he's been making a game

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
to when Bobby did the

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Flappy Vog project, it's kind of like a joke

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
thing to when YYR

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
did the O.L.R. Dream

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
maybe you guys probably don't know about this

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
but we have a list of dream games

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
or things we mentioned

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
in Jess, that would be a great game

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
and one of our listeners, YYR, actually turned

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
one of those into a game, it was called Pixel Shits

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
and

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
it's something

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
he actually

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
you got to get the link in chat, it's great

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
it's 2600 inspired, YYR please

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
please post the link

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
it's a 2600 inspired game

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
where you go around and you try to stop

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
joggers from running through a park

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
by taking a giant shit

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
oh that's amazing

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
the genius mechanic

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
is that when you run out

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
because you know a person can only do so much

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
there's a little taco cabana in the corner

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
that you go to and refill

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
your mirror

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
oh that's amazing

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
that's where the game went from

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
like LOL to just

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
freaking genius

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
yeah it was great

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
oh no, that's what I love to see

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
people making things like this

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
I love silly creative games and stuff

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
the sillier the better

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I want to just put a shout out there

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Jake Kaufman Vert, he's a really great game composer

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
you probably know about him

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
but he made a game called Dick Hand

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
that you probably don't know about

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
definitely check that out

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
that sounds inspired by Cards Against Humanity

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
well

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
the reason why I bring all this up is because

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
we've been doing some talk behind the scenes

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
and I was talking with YYR and I was talking with Bobby

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
and we've decided that we want

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
people to create things

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
just like you guys do

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
we think there needs to be more voices out there making games

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
so we are going to host

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
a vog jam

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
and that's video game jam

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
that's v-i-d-o

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
game jam

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
so it's the vog jam

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
and we just want people to create something dammit

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
so whether you have unity

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
and you're comfortable using unity

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
you want to learn unity

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
you can use that

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
but we're also going to encourage people

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
and if you only feel comfortable making

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
a level in LittleBigPlanet

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
or using RPG Maker

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
then do that

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
we are going to be doing our own game jam here at VOG Network

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
and I'm going to give you all some more details

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
in just a little bit

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
we're going to do Iron Chef style

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
where there's going to be a mystery ingredient

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
and we will talk about how we're going to come up with that ingredient

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
as a community next week

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
that is fantastic

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
it's not pixel shit

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
pixel shits will not be the game

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I just want to say that's super awesome

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
game jams are actually what got me started

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
it's not what got me started as a programmer

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
it's what got me started as making games on my own

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
it's what got you started in unity too

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
yeah it is what got me started in unity

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
actually we were going to use

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
a different engine and it didn't work

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
for collaboration so I ended up using unity

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
because a friend of mine said it was really cool

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
and the rest is history

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
so yeah

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
game jams are awesome

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
drop us an email

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
we'll promote and we'll be on it

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
we love game jams

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
that's awesome and this is very important too

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
and I want to stress this because there might be some people that feel

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
very overwhelmed any prizes that we do

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
with this game jam we will not be giving away

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
prizes on quality

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
we will only be giving away prizes on

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
participation and I think that's very important

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
because we want to make sure this is a very accessible

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
thing for people to participate with

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
but anyway I just thought

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
you know you guys helped inspire

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
a lot of that conversation that happened behind the scenes

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
this week so you know

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
if you guys want people to make games

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
we want people to make games too and

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
we hope this all comes together and helps that happen

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
alright that's amazing

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I mean that's a great thing just get people to be

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
creative put things out there

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000

funny video it was

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
messing with the train in the tunnel

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000

Grand Theft Auto 5 on Playstation 4

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000

when he made me buy the Playstation 3

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
alright I wanna give you guys

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
a little more details on the game jam I talked about

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
with the guys from Cooking With Unity we will have

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
all the details next week but

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
the contest is going to be called the

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
VoG Jam and in this

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
case VoG will mean video game

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
not necessarily what you're used to but VoG

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Jam and our little

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
tagline with this is

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
create something dammit

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
create something dammit I mean

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
you know maybe I'm not gonna be comfortable with using

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Unity but I know how to use Commodore 64

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
basic I know how to make programs

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
in the little big planet there's some other things I know

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
how to use so I am gonna participate

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
in this game jam YYR

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
has committed to participating in this game jam

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Bobby Blackwolf will be participating

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
in the game jam I'll participate Loki's participating

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
in the game jam I'll just put my game on hold for now

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
in this like video

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
so this is what's gonna happen

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
we're gonna use the time honored

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
scientific method that's proved

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
true in the past 12 years of Orange Lounge

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Radio and that is

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
listless so next

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
week on Orange Lounge Radio we are going to do

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
a listless segment to

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
determine what the mystery

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
ingredient for the game is going to be

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
and that is going to be

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
basically a

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
I would say a title but I don't wanna say that

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
that title has to be the name of your game

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
for example

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
cause I don't know like a theme

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
it should be the theme there we go

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
so for example let's

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
say we were to go over to

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
the Orange Lounge Radio list of dream games

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
which we're not gonna do we're gonna come up with something new

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
but just as an example let's say I go to the

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
OLR dream games page and I decide that

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
puzzle sluts is gonna be the theme

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
and we're not gonna throw something

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
that adult at you but puzzle sluts

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
ends up being the theme then you would have to

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
make your game or your level or whatever

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
it is somehow incorporating

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
puzzle sluts into it

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
and whether that's just something that kinda

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
happens on the side or whether that's the focus

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
so it's just like cooking right

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
just like those guys cook with unity

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
this is the mystery ingredient so

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
what is that theme

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
going to be we wanna take

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
suggestions from you guys even though usually

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
with listless it is what

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
DarkSakura, myself and Loki ultimately

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
decide that goes into the pot we

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
wanna take your suggestions

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
so if you have a suggestion

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
you can do one of two things you can e-mail us

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
participate at orangelandstrator.com

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
make sure that subject line says

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
game jam and then tell us

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
what is the mystery ingredient you believe

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
should be included in the game jam

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
or you can comment on the posting of this

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
show over at vognetwork.com

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
just comment and that

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
way the little thumbs up and thumbs down will tell

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
us what we ought to think of using

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
for the theme in listless next

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
week so we will be choosing that mystery ingredient

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
you will have over the holidays until

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
the end of january

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
to submit your project

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
and if you need help hosting

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
even let's say you create a

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
project in unity but you have no where to put it

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
bobby blackwolf has offered help

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
so at vognetwork we can actually

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
post some of those creations for you

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
guys over at vognetwork if you need a

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
place that's not required though if you

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
post something on your own site we

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
just wanna give you the tools we don't want anybody

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
can't do like garris does calibrations

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
cannot be the game theme because

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
garris is a character

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
but you can make that game for me personally

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
so keep that in mind we are not

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
out to make sequels it has to be

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
an original idea calibrating with garris

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I'm sure there's already the shakarian calibrator

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
out there somewhere I'm sure there is

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Brad from Paw Culture says what about

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
collaborations I'm

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
always going to refer to the golden rule of the

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
game jam which is create something

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
dammit so if the only way you're gonna

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
be able to create something is to work with somebody else

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
then I'm gonna say yes

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
create something dammit that's the golden

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
rule I'm gonna refer to throughout the game jam

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
so partner up yes

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
just create something dammit

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
to register participation for this weeks

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
use the pass phrase fork

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
alright so

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
we'll have more information we're gonna have a big

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
prize pool there will be

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
no grading done on quality

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
that is ultimately up to the community

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
if one of these games goes viral

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
that is the community that makes

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
that happen but we

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
will be giving out prizes based on participation

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
we have accumulated a

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
crap ton of prizes throughout the year

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
so I don't

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
want to say cause I don't know how many

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
participations we'll get I

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
want to say if I almost want to say

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
everybody who participates will get something

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
but then I go well that's

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
only allowing for like 20 people

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
if we get like 200 submissions which would be

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
amazing boxes I know

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
right so I will say this

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
we are going to try well I will

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
we do know this we have the

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
loot system on vognetwork.com for sure

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
100% everybody will get exclusive

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
loot on vognetwork.com even

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
though it's virtual you'll at least get that little badge

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
of honor that you participated in the game

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
jam the first one which we hope

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
of many now I have a question

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
since I totally

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
don't even realize this is there a way to see what

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
loot other people have on their profile

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
click on their little profile

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you're already 100% better than playstation 3

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
and playstation home problems with the trophy

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
so there you go

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
100% better

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
we got to get back to some news more info on the game jam next week

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
but submit your ideas but we got to

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
run through the news and I'm going to say

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I'm going to take this a little bit of an accelerated

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
pace just because this first

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
part of the show is running really long so let's talk

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
quickly about street fighter 5

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
street fighter 5 more news is

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
coming out about street fighter 5 and Charlie

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
has been revealed as a character

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
that will be in street fighter 5 Charlie was not

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
in street fighter 4 if I recall

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
you have the pointy hair but Charlie

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
was in what was it alpha?

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
alpha 3?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
he was in alpha

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
and alpha 2 and alpha 3

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
so they've modernized him a little

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
bit it looks like for this game because we don't see

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
an awful lot of them we only see just kind of

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Charlie wasn't in like

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
cross Tekken was he?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
I don't think so

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
but yeah so Charlie was announced

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
for street fighter 5 which by the way showed

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
off the first footage

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
of the gameplay and literally

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
you know it was like a splash screen that was pressed

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
start and then it went right into a Ryu vs

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Chun-Li battle I

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
thought that was pretty funny what oh just

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
did you watch did you watch all the

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
reactions of the guys going oh my god

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
it's got the oh my god no not that there's

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
there's a part in it like where

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
um Ryu knocks Chun-Li into

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
like at the end of one of the rounds he knocks her

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
into a wall in the kitchen

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and a bowl of noodles falls on her head

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
and it stays there for the whole next round

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
there's a bowl of noodles on her head

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
it's hilarious

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
yeah people details I love

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
details it's great

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
so people getting excited at that first

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
footage of Street Fighter 5 and

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
yeah there's like a revenge bar at an EX bar

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
and there's I noticed

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
that speaking of getting knocked through the wall

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
then that next stage started

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
in the middle of the room they were in so

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
it's kind of neat how those environments are coming into play

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
as well so I think we'll be having

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Street Fighter 5 news a lot I mean they could

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
announce like a character a week probably leading up to

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
the release we'll see

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
DarkSakura what do you have for us?

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
I have some stuff

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
specifically something about Borderlands

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
there's going to be a Borderlands

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
remastered apparently this

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
was information released

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
from the Australian age rating

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
board they didn't

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
actually say exactly what Borderlands it is

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
but there's going to be a Borderlands remastered

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
edition with

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
an MA 15 plus rating

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
supposed to be on Xbox One

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Playstation 4 and likely

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
PC the

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
thought is that it's

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
well at least it's a speculation that it's going to

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
be the original one but honestly

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
I think it's all three

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
for the guess see that would

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
be really I mean

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I don't think it would be that hard

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
really to update graphics wise

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
and

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
well yeah they don't have to do anything graphics wise because it's on

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
PC so they already have the high res graphics

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
they just redo the engine for console

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
and

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
port it over probably want to

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
have maybe more smoothing

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
for the PC iteration

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
we talked a lot last week about that whole Final Fantasy

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
7 reveal which is a PC

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
port on the PS4 so we know this

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
is an outlet that a lot of people are using

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
so

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
I'd say if you

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
don't have the games yet just keep your eyes open

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
there's of course not exactly

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
a release date on this this is

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
just coming from

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
the Australian ratings

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
board but it's something

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
to think about

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
it's not the only game that's looking like this

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
later in the show we have news of another

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
game so this seems to be

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
could be a theme where

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
a lot of the PS3 classics

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
so to speak end up getting remade for PS4

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
this year alone

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
we've had Tomb Raider, Sleeping Dogs

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
they had

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
well it's a PC port but

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Shadow Warrior came over

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Saints Row

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
4 and

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
God of Hell is going to be in January

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
which I'm totally picking that up again

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
I own it on 4 systems

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
already but I'll buy it again

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
even though I really didn't care for

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
4 too much but

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
whatever

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Grand Theft Auto 5

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
but hell I'll buy that 4 times if I need to

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
I'll buy it on PC when it comes out again

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
when you love something enough Loki

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
exactly you'll buy multiple

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
now you understand okay next time

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
you ask me why do you own the

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Mass Effect trilogy 5 different times

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
okay well that's a little

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
different okay let's talk

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
about how that's different one Grand Theft Auto 5

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
on PlayStation 4 is a significant

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
upgrade of Grand Theft Auto the only reason

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I bought it on the other 2 systems

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
in the past was because

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I was going to play it on

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Xbox but then my

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
my boss wanted to play it on

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
PS3 and he promised that we would so

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
play this game multiple times on PS3

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
and we'd just be playing all the time because we'd play

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
tons of Grand Theft Auto 4 and

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
that never happened that's why I bought it on

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
3 systems

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
otherwise it would have been 2 systems and to be fair

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I've sold back my copies on the other systems

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
but if Mass Effect trilogy ends up

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
being one of those games that ends up on PS4 as well

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I know you'll be buying it

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I'm doing it

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
and I guarantee you it will

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
at some point right before

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
and check out some games we do know are coming

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
for most of the world not much right

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Loki? I wasn't going to say

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
I haven't even looked at it yet but I'm going to

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
go out on a limb here and say I don't think

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
anything's coming out this week in fact I'm

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
going to say nothing's coming out this week I think

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
digitally I think you get Tetris

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
well digitally there's going to be stuff coming

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
you know physical releases and

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
there is not a

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
thing coming out in fact I would be willing

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
to bet that you won't see anything until January

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
well it is that slow

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000

is releasing this week on the 18th

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
that'd be so awesome if the 3DS was region

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
free but it's not

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
but I know people with Japanese 3DS's that'll be

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
getting it anyway cause they crazy

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
and I mean that in the best possible way

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
alright Dark Soccer how about the UK

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
there is an entirety

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Baldur's Gate 2 Enhanced Edition

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
there it is

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
alright just a couple more stories for you guys

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
and then the classic game of the week

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Loki

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
so um

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Sega is trying to figure out

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
how to adapt their properties

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
into other forms

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
of media and entertainment

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
including TV

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I'm hoping that the fact that they're hiring

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
this media exec

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
means we're gonna get some better

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
stuff other than Sonic Boom cause I don't

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
know, I don't know if that

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
new cartoon's any good

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
from what I hear but apparently

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
even Choflin

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
is going to, is set to

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
adapt some of

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
their old franchises into

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
you know, television

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
web series, you know

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
you name it, movies

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
they're seeing adaptions of

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Altered Beast, Crazy Taxi

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Shinobi, Streets of Rage

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
and other titles

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I can only think, you know

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
we've seen Sonic so far

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
and I'm just hoping that they reboot

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
that at some point

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
that actually works for them

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
but man, I would like to see some of those old

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Shenmue, Shenmue

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Shenmue

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
come on, lucky hit

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
hits the big screen

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
you know, as weird as it would be

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
I would love to see like

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
a Moonwalker series

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
or something like that, even though I understand

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
that's, you know, based off of the Moonwalker film

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I'd still

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
love to see that as a spin-off series

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
or Space Channel 5

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
hello, yeah, that's what Fifth Dream in our chat says

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Space Channel 5 the series

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
YYR in chat says, go home

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Sega, you're drunk

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
or can we do like some

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
you know, not the

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I fear that Crazy Taxi

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
will be it, it's gonna be like really

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
like, just like second-handed

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
can we do like something with like all the Dreamcast

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
you know, characters and stuff

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and like a sort of Captain N type of environment

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
but not stupid

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
you know, can we do something like that, you know, have Ooh La La

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
and maybe, you know, get

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
the nameless characters

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
from Crazy Taxi or whatever

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
and hell, let's throw in some

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
what was it

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
I don't know

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
other series that they had

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
on Dreamcast

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Fifth Dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
suggests Hatsune Miku the animated series

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
now that one I could actually see happening

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
because Hatsune Miku is a pretty big deal

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
for Sega, so especially overseas

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
so, yeah

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I don't know, maybe

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Daytona

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
do do do do do do

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
don't even

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
alright, well

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
a lot of people cry

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
a lot of people on the internet

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
saying don't even to this

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
character that was announced for Tekken 7

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
and this was

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
a character kind of like

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
a, I guess you could say like a

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
cosplay

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
fan girl, kitty girl

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
the name was Lucky Chloe

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
was the character unveiled during a

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
livestream celebrating the 20th anniversary

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
of the Tekken franchise

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
she's wearing pink cat ears

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
and like a pink

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
like cat paws thing

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
and she's got on like a little black tutu

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
with a tail that actually kind of looks like a cat

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
so I mean she looks just like

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
a cute, you know, anime

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
girl that

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
could show up in the Tekken series, right?

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
maybe she works at a cat girl

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
cafe, perhaps

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
but they announce Lucky Chloe for Tekken

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
and all of a sudden

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
a lot of negativity on the

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
internet get out, but negativity

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
hit the internet

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
and the series producer Katsuhiro

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Harada was alerted

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
to a thread on NeoGaf

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
where a bunch of people were saying

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
things like, God, I hate her already

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
but first off

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
why did you go to NeoGaf?

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
but NeoGaf, they hate everything

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
sorry, not sorry

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I'm just keeping it real, you guys

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
but anyway, I'm sure Twitter

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
was no better, speaking of Twitter

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Harada ended up tweeting out

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
quote, are you Western, only one

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
bulletin board? Hello, small world

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
I'll make muscular and skinhead

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
character for you

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
probably in reference to

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
stereotypes of American characters

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I can see the meme already

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
they have

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
the Heath Ledger Joker

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
sitting there

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Felicia!

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Catgirl, Felicia, and Dark Sockers

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
no one blinks an eye

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
bye Felicia

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
alright, anyway

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
he went on to say that

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
American fans shouldn't

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
be upset because Chloe is just one of the

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
game's many characters

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
which, if I recall

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
involved a fighting

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
panda bear

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
and a wooden dummy

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
a wooden dummy

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
a kangaroo

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
a dinosaur

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
give me a fucking break, this is

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Tekken, people

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
and Yoshimitsu, I mean, come on

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
if a catgirl wants to catgirl, then let her

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
catgirl

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
here's the thing that I have to say, it's his

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
fucking game, he can put whoever

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
whoever the hell he wants in it

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
if you don't like that character, don't play as that

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
character, I don't really care for Dalzim

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I don't play as Dalzim

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
not that I hate the character itself, it's just I don't like the way he controls

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
nobody bonks when Dead or Alive

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
had a Teletubby

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Dead or Alive had a Teletubby?

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
What's his face

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
with the Teletubby outfit?

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
since we are talking about

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
game creation and game creators a lot

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
tonight with that special theme, and I should have asked the guys

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
from Kooky with Unity about this

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
here's a tip

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
from me to the guy here, producer

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
of the Tekken series, don't read the

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
comments, do not ever

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
ever ever read the comments

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
don't read them, don't let NeoGaf

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
influence your game, don't let any

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
website influence your game like that

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
just make a good game

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
that you love, and that is what's most important

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
I'm not even going to get into any of this

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
so, but yes, I whole

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
hardly agree, you know, if you're making

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
a diverse set of characters, that's fine

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
this is the character you want to make, that's cool

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
they have other characters, there's

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I don't think Tekken suffers

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
from non-diverse characters, they have

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
plenty of diversity in characters

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
and species

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
and sex

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
orientation, whatever

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
it's

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
that's not even a complaint of that

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
series, it could be Dead or

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Alive, I mean that's, you know

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
a little bit worse

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Rama in our chatroom over at live.fognetwork.com says

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I'm amused at the cosplay

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
fandom who got mad because they assumed

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Lucky Chloe was based off of Jessica

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Negri

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I hope I said the name right, I don't even know who she is

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
she's the one that did the

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Lollipop Chainsaw

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
cosplay, and she's down on her stuff too

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
sorry, I believe that she's also

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
the one though who did

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I may be getting her confused

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
but she also did cosplay in Blackface

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
at the end of the, oh, well

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
at the end of the day, at the end of the day

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
if this was inspired by a real

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
life person or whatever, so what

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
so what

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I mean, god, they put that one girl

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
in Mass Effect... Law? Hello?

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Yeah, right? Law?

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I mean

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
No, he's totally original, not inspired

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
by anybody named Bruce Lee

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
They put that one IGN girl in Mass Effect 3

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
and it didn't ruin the game

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Who's did, uh...

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
It might not have been her, by the way

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
I might be confusing her with somebody else

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Yeah, alright, yeah, don't start

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
rumors here, I'm just kidding

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
No, Rama told me who it was

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
but anyway

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
No, who I'd want to see a fighting game done by

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Rama clarifies that wasn't her

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
I know, it was somebody else though that looks

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
very similar to her

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
I would love to see a fighting game done by Platinum Games

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
That would be fucking amazing with all their character designs

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
You never know

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Alright, let's

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
travel back to a time when things were

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
simple, because, like, we're gonna go back to

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
a time when, you know what, who

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
knows what it looks like, because it's a big square box

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
moving around your television

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Alright, maybe we're not talking about a game

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
that old this week, but we are gonna take

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
a trip to the vault, where Dark Soccer's gonna

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
open up the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
you should show a little respect

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
to the games that came before you

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
This is the classic game of the week for this week

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Dark Soccer, what'd you pick?

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Well, my whole logic

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
behind this was trying to find a game

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
that was ten years old

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
that people would go, holy shit, that's ten years old

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
So, I picked

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Silent Hill 4 The Room

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Holy shit, that's ten years old?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Yes, it is

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
At any rate

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
this one

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
was published by Konami

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
of course, developed by Team Silent

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
It came out in

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Japan in June 2004, and in

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
North America and Europe in September

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
This was at my

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
second or third E3

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
and they had the whole

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
big kitchen set up and everything, it was really awesome

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I have pictures of it somewhere

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
But this one, instead of being set

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
specifically in Silent Hill

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
is set in a town called South Ashfield

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
and it follows this dude named

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Harry Townsend around

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
He's locked in his apartment

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
and he finds different ways to

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
escape through his bathroom

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
through other ways, and

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
goes through all these different craziness

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
where he's chasing an undead serial killer

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
named Walter

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
because Walter is totally

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
a serial killer's name, don't you think?

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
A little bit, yeah

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
So basically

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
you've got the one save point

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
which is his room

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
The room will restore his health

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
but there are

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
hauntings that happen

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
in the room during the second part of the game

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Whatever you do, don't

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
get the Robbie the Rabbit

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
to take him back to your house

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Seriously, it will fuck you up

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
He also is

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
spending the second half of the game

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
helping his neighbor Eileen

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
who

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
she has to go around with him

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
She takes damage as she gets

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
possessed over and over again

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
and so basically

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
however much damage that she takes

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
directly affects the ending

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
that you get

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
So

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
basically though

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
you beat shit up

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
You can shoot things

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
You've got different

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
talismans as well that can protect you from damage

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
can protect your

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
room from being haunted

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
and you can

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
charge your melee attacks

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
You can actually do more damage

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
You also have unkillable ghosts

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
that are

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Walter Sullivan's victims

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
and the ghosts can hurt you

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
and can only be nullified by two items

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
and you can also

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
exercise hauntings from your apartment

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
with those same items

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
and you can knock down

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
ghosts

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
It's basically two bullets that will knock them down

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
or you pin them permanently with a sword

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So there are certain

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
ways you can kill things

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
So there's also

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.000
another

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
character that actually you see

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
I don't remember how many

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Well I'm sure everyone remembers the

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
remakes of

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
the songs they did for DDR from this game

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
but

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
one of the characters who

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
dies early on in the game is in the

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
beginning

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
is in the video

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
with Cynthia

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
but I mean

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
the game is

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
it's weird

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
It's one of the last of the good Silent Hill games

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
And then of course

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
don't worry

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
you also get the special endings

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Well actually

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
in this one

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
actually I'm wrong

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
this one does not have the UFO ending

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I was going to say I thought it

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Yeah this one didn't have the UFO

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
It's the first one that didn't have the UFO ending

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Oh bummer

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
You have

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
four endings

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Mother, Eileen's death

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
The

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Twenty One Sacrament

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
and

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
hold on because I know I've never gotten the dog

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
not the dog but the UFO ending

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Yeah there's no UFO ending

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
There's not a disco party ending?

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
No there should be a UFO ending

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
PT better have a dog ending

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I know right

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
There's actually a picture

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
of

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
how they set up the whole kitchen

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
thing

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
which is not a very good picture

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I'll have to find a better one for the chat room

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
but the soundtrack

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
is just really amazing

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
of course like all the Silent Hill soundtracks

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
that were done by Yamaoka

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
The

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Japanese soundtrack had a second

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
disc that had

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
music

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
done by Yamaoka

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
that was done to reading of

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
traditional Japanese stories and then the

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
American version had 13

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
exclusive tracks and

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
remixes and then there was

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Your Rain that was redone for DVR

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
and

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
there was also a

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
UMD out called The Silent Hill Experience

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Track 22

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
was also called

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
No Way to Escape

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
and it was a special recording for the soundtrack

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
so

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
there you go I have picked

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Silent Hill

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
4th Room

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
probably like I said one of the last

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
good Silent Hill games

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I haven't played it since the game first came out

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
I think I still have your copy

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
On what? Xbox right?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
No I thought it was

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Yeah it was

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
No I had it on Xbox

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
I remember playing the game when I was living with

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Loki I must have been 10 years ago I was living with Loki

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
and I got so scared at one part and Loki

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
looks over and goes what the hell is going on over there shut up

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
I didn't say that

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Yes you did!

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I would never tell you to shut up

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
I may have inquired what's going on

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Alright walking into

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
studio a connoisseur

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
of the Silent Hill series

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
a friend of the show

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Shana Lee goes here in studio with us

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
So I have to talk about this for a second

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Is there a dog ending yes or no?

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
No it only has 4 endings

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
That was the start

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
of the downfall

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
That's what I should have done

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
as the fortune cookie

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
You go bark bark bark bark bark bark bark

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I heard there talk of

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
your reign being in

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Silent Hill in DDR

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
it did not get mentioned at least by the time

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
I got up that there was another Silent Hill 4 song

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
in DDR

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Did you guys talk about that?

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
I don't think so

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
No Shana

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Is that the one from 3?

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
No no not in PS2 DDR

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
UltraMix

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
2

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
has

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
from the US CD sampler

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
the remix of Waver

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
from

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
cause that was all my doing

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
and then they did a really bad cut of it

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
so I feel bad in a way

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
but I do not feel that bad cause I like that song

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
So you pushed to get that song in the game and then

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
I'm the only one that said anything about that song

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
and they brought it into the game

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Yay Shane

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Well there you go

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
So who knew you had a little piece of the classic game of the week

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
How does it make you feel to hear that Silent Hill 4 is 10 years old

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Really old

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Cause I remember that E3

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
That was my first E3

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Also remember we had

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
the

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
scoop on that song

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
We had the world premiere of your reign

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
from DDR and that was Shane who

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
made that all happen

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
We had to talk over half of it for people recording it

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Yes cause that was back in the day

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
when people would do that

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
People were obsessed with DDR

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
And then

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I got a bajillion copies of the sampler

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
because of Dan

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
And that's actually what happened

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
is that Shane had an early

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
print of that sampler

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
so that's how we were able to use it

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
And I want to say

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
cause that's one of my favorite Silent Hills

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I love 4

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
The scariest ones cause I don't like Walter chasing me around

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
It's not fun

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
When that game came out in Japan

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I used an import site

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
to import that game

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
overnight

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
weekend just so I could have the CD

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
that came with it for a car trip

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I was taking on that Saturday

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
How much did that

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
set you back?

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Well the game I think itself at the time was maybe like 60 or 70

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
and it was the collector's edition

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
which made it a little more expensive

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Pretty sure it was like 180

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
at that point to hear the CD

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
You know what? I've done that

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Because when Rival Schools

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
the evolution for Rival Schools came out

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
I had that shit

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I paid 120 bucks for that

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Alright

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Well we gotta go to break you guys

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
because we still have plenty of show coming up

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
and we're like 2 hours into the show

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
so we're gonna skedaddle through part B

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
so we can get to your calls, your emails and much more

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
right after this

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
live on this Sunday evening

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
December the 14th of 2014

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
the 579th episode of our show

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
We're running a little long tonight

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
because we had an awesome interview

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
with the guys from Cooking with Unity

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
and you know what? Can't complain

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
if that's gonna hold us and make us run a little long

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
it's for damn good reason

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
as you know, encouraging people to get out there

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
and create and make games

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
it was a great interview, a great time

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
We are gonna try to make up a little of the time

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
here by running through some more news

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
here with our rapid fire news

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Loki! Yes, so let's talk a little bit

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
about free stuff

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
and this is awesome

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
You know, Origin does

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
these kind of free games

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
for a while, on the house

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
they call it, and they've been swapping

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
out different games and pretty much

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
this is my entire Origin collection anyways

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
but SimCity 2000 is now up for grabs

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
so you can

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
get that for free if you have

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
the Origin client installed on your system

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
and check it out

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
and then I guess they said

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
normally they're also offering

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
I guess the $5 special edition

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
oh, it was the $5 special edition

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
that they were offering on the house

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
pretty cool

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
so go check it out, rather old SimCity game

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
and it's not a bad SimCity game

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
and then of course

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
with the popularity of

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Theatrythm Final Fantasy

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
we are now gonna be seeing

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Theatrythm Dragon Quest

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
as a next game coming out

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
from Square Enix

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
kind of along the same lines

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
except now instead of music from the Final Fantasy series

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
you'll have music from the Dragon Quest series

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
and it's expected now

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
to be coming out in Japan

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
on the 3DS

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
March 26, 2015

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
there's yet ones coming over the west

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
but you better believe it probably will at some point

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
well, I assume some of the music

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
will come from Dragon Quest X

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
which is a game we don't even have here yet

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
but I guess Theatrythm Curtain Call

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
had some Final Fantasy games that weren't out here

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
either yet anyway

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
with the Type-0

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
I don't know, I don't think it's as sure of a thing

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
as you seem to think

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I think that they would bring it over here

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I hope so, if nothing else

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
just freaking make it a digital only game

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
and buy it, exactly

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
and then Final Fantasy

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
X and X-2

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
are getting another

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
well, a port

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
of the HD remaster

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
so I don't even know how much better it's going to look

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
but it's going to be coming now to

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
PlayStation 4

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
and they said that it's going to be priced

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
at $50

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
so next spring

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
PlayStation 4, Final Fantasy X and X-2

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
almost pretty much a year since the last one

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
was released on PlayStation 3

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
so

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
I don't know, I'll check it out I guess

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
they haven't really said what's going to be unique about it

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
other than that there's going to be some system exclusive features

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
thanks

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
that's very vague

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I worry when they say

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
system exclusive features

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
that means share play

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
and broadcasting on Twitch

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
because those are features that are built into the system

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
I really would take that

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
to mean nothing more than

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
just things that are on the PS4 that aren't on the PS3

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I think that they're just porting it, I don't think it's going to look any better

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
I would not

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
get your hopes up about this at all

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
and then

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
unless you have a PS4 and not a PS3

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
then get your hopes up

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
and then finally they've confirmed that the

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
Final Fantasy XV demo will be

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
exclusive to day one copies of Type 0

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
HD

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
it will not be coming out separately

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
they're saying it's intended to be

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
a special gift for those who purchase

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
early

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
so pre-order that game if you want it

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
the demo

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
and they're saying that

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
is that going to be coming to North America as well

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
or is that just the Japanese copies

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
because I'm not really sure yet on that

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Final Fantasy XV

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
or I should say Final Fantasy

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Type 0 HD

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
March 17

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
2015

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
lots of stuff to look forward to

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
and we have to buy an early

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
copy so I can play the demo

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
it looks good

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
I would have bought the game anyway

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
but for the demo

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
certainly that just cements it

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
alright well moving on to some other quick news here

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
as far as expos and conventions

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
go GX3

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
which was once known as

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
GamerX3

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
GX3 has been dated for next

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
year this is now moving from a

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
summer convention to a winter convention

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
we knew that was going to happen but it is now

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
dated December 11th through 13th

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
and they have a new venue

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
they have moved it out of San Francisco

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
it will now be in San Jose

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
at the San Jose area

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
is that less of a drive or

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
more of a drive?

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
it's more of a drive but quicker because of traffic

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
and less of a cost ideally

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
yeah and actually they're saying

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
they haven't said officially but they're saying that the rooms

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
will be like $100 cheaper a night

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
this year so that's already

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
which is funny you know what's funny if you go back and listen

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
to some of the talk I said

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
on an earlier show when I was kind of summarizing GamerX

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
I said they really should think about moving it to

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
San Jose and they can have it

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
there's the convention center and all the hotels right there

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
well guess where the Marriott is?

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
it's one of the hotels connected to the convention center

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
so I like to think

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I called it and maybe I helped

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
see I used to say like Santa Clara

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
would have been a good place but now that they built the Niner

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
stadium right next to it that's probably not good anymore

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
and you know there are some people are very

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
happy to hear it's moving to San Jose because it's closer

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
to him some people where San Francisco is closer

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
not as happy to hear about it

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I think at the end of the day

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
you know you don't hear a lot of bad stuff about

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
this con by the way disclosure

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
or whatever or encouragement VOG

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
network is a sponsor of GX3

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
we will have a table at the show

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
myself and Dark Soccer are for sure going

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I'm hoping Loki can go depending on

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
the situation we'll see I have a year notice

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
just for one day if nothing else

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I would like to go I haven't been to a con

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
in I don't know

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
a very long time

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
well you'd have a good time here so

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
again it's December 11-13 at the San Jose

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Marriott and tickets are available right

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
now and they have all different

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
levels and platforms right now the cheapest

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
is $70

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
to $5.95 but if you really do want to

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
go Loki let's talk off air because

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
I have an opportunity for you

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
alright

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
that is that so GX3

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
will see you there in December

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
moving on to some more stories about

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
The Witcher 3 is up next

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Witcher 3 got delayed and

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
this is what I think the second time

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
this game has been delayed it's been pushed back

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
now from February to

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
May 19th is the new date

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
and a big apology letter going

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
up on the Witcher.com the official site

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
we owe you an apology we set the release

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
day too hastily it's a hard lesson

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
wanted to take heart for the future you know what

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
you know what exactly I rather

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
you push it back like EA

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
do with Dragon Age Inquisition and Battlefield

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
and have it be a good game when it comes out

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
then to put it out like Assassin's Creed

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
you know I don't

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
we'll wait the extra three months

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
I realize you're going to get shit from Twitter now

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
like oh you pushed it back again

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
can't make your deadline

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
but when the game comes out if the game kicks

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
a lot of ass then people

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
are going to shut the hell up about the delays

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
and enjoy the game or Grand Theft Auto

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
right Loki that series never gets delayed

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
well yeah exactly and

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
it's not and people aren't complaining

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
because well they're just complaining because

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
they don't get to play as early as they'd like

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
to and that's really you know

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
that's not a bad thing

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
alright and lastly

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
it's your last chance to check out

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
After Burner Climax

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
now this game came out a little while ago

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
but it is going to be delisted from

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
on Christmas Eve December 24th

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
so if you were at all interested

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
in the game you might want to grab it because again

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
it will be pulled on December 24th

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
and you will not be able to buy it

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
if you should accidentally delete the game

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
or something you can download it again

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
that won't be a problem but this has to do

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
with some of the license

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
agreements between Sega and the

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
aircraft makers of some of the

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
planes that are in the game those license agreements are

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
expiring so much like

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Outrun got delisted

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
and you know some other things that have licensed

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
content and they get delisted

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
that's why it is fictional aircraft

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
that are like those aircraft

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
fictional aircraft

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
that's why Ridge Racer was so cool because they have fictional

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
cars or Punch Out when they just replaced

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Mike Tyson with Mr. Dream it was easy

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
but anyway alright well whatever

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
they got to do what they got to do so After Burner

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
if you want to get that last chance Dark Sakura

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
we do have

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
other news

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
there is something going to be

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
on the Virtual Console only in Japan

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
and that is Vampire Hunter

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I'm sorry, yeah Vampire

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
predecessor to the Castlevania

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
series so

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
it was

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
originally

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Akuma Jill Dracula which

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
we got as Vampire Killer over

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
in the English speaking countries

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
but it was a little bit

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
more open ended so you should be seeing

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
alright let's go to

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
the FUGL question of the week

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
it's my vehicle

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
ha ha

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
each week we visit

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Facebook and Google Plus

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
you slam that together you get FUGL and we ask

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
a question of our communities

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
and tonight we wanted to know you know we were talking about creation

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
tonight we knew that was going to be a theme

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
of the show tonight so we asked our audience

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
what's something you've created

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
in the video game world did you program a small

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
game or work on a large one maybe you made

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
levels for a game of yours what did you

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
create we also kind of put in there if you really

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
really really haven't made anything

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
a. we hope you start

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
b. what do you hope to create someday

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
so a couple

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
different questions there depending on your situation

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
act deaf starts us off on Google Plus

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
saying the closest I've been to video game

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
programming has been translation

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
I haven't been directly involved in it but I

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
helped some friends with translations and editing

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
hey you know what important

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
very important I wouldn't have got to play

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Final Fantasy 5 when I did if it hadn't been

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
for some people translating the original

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Super Nintendo ROM

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
translation didn't end up perfect but at least it got me

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
through the game so translation important

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
role makes the game more accessible to people

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Redertainment in chat

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
saying there's a book I put out a couple years

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
ago that no one read called volume 11

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
when I originally dreamed it up it was supposed to be

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
a stealth action game complete with long sections

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
spent sneaking around and trying to avoid groups

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
of people looking to kill you and all of

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
your people since I have no visual

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
artistic skill and coding is hard

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
volume 11 became a

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
book so interesting you had like a game

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
idea that ultimately you poured into a book

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
very interesting

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
let's check out some of the answers over on

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Facebook Raginator says back in my elementary

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
school days I modded

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
an edutainment typing game

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
originally called turtle trot

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
during the down time at the end of

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
computer class I made it a very

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
obscene pervy renaming it turtle

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
twat and the game talked dirty to

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000

unexpected twat oh what

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Raginator making a game out of poop and

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
fart jokes is unexpected I beg

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
to differ

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
no I mean just I was

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
the word twat to me

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
is intensely hilarious

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
and whenever I hear it

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I just

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
twat are you talking about I can't hear you

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
I thought you live on twat avenue

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
that was the old one sorry

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
anyway one thing I

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
wish to make is a new OLR dream

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
game a moral combat clone or parody

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
featuring wilford brimley the golden

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
girls matt lock angela

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
landsbury etcetera

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
which I entitled in the chat room earlier

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
as smash tv land

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
love it or golden gladiators

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
golden gladiators love it

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
monty boggs says in banjo

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
kazooie nuts and bolts there was a mission

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
to defend a statue from enemy planes for a

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
set time instead of building

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
a combative plane as most would I

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
created a giant cone cover with

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
propellers to simply cover the statue

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
and absorb all the damage that

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
game was fantastic at rewarding

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
creativity so kind of

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
talking about a game there that has

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
you create as part of the game

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
mechanics

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
febreeze mentions on facebook

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I programmed a version of the tron light

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
cycle game for a school project

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I really want to pick up programming again but don't know

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
what to choose there's so many programming

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
languages I have no idea where to start or

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
which is the most useful well I hope you got something

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
out of tonight's show I do have

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
a dream game I want to make a pure

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
sega arcade racer like daytona

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
sega rally and

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
those awesome games well surely

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
he knows about that kickstarter from a few

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
months ago right yes exactly

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
that looks pretty awesome and

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
er says I did some flash games in high school as

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
part of my web design class pretty much

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
all were clones of existing games for

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
example one was a mario clone where

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
you played as link nintendo ripped me

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
off for nes remix now

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I know he said that comment very tongue in cheek

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
but it made me think of when people used to hack roms

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
like people put

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
zelda in mario because they would hack the

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
rom and put the little

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
picture of link in there although

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I realize it's a questionable

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
legality territory the reality

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
is people have done it and some people got

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
their start doing it and of course

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
you know somebody made like super penis

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
brothers where they were all naked yep

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
they did we played all of those roms

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
to see who they were and and they're all

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
garbage and

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
uh

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
dark tetsuya says I've been writing games off

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
and on ever since I learned basic on the apple

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
2 series back in the day wrote some simple

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
dragons lair esque text adventures

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
uh twine sounds

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
right up your alley dark tetsuya because that's uh

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
what that does text adventures uh lately

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I've been tinkering with programs like the games

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
factory writing some simple arcade

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
style games and other game makers the

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
most recent of which is called construct 2

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
the first paid edition is pretty

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
pricey but the free one does plenty

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
if you're just getting your feet wet

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
and lastly steven d on

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
facebook says I was 8 in

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
1984 and my friend's father made

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
us a little stand up arcade cabinet with a back

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
board to be used for the screen we

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
drilled pathways in the back board and would

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
take leds on hangers

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
and move them around like spaceships

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
can't remember what we did for the controller but

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
it was awesome

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
so there you go a lot of uh cool little

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
answers very diverse the way people have been

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
making their games uh on

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
facebook and google plus

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
uh hopefully lots more people gonna

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
participate in our game jam

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
the vog game jam all the details

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
next week and you know I realized

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
something by the way I as much

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
as I would love to give a tangible prize

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
to everybody that participates I have to

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
pay shipping on everything out of my own pocket

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
so it probably it probably will be limited

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
to like 10 something

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
and we can take any leftovers

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
that we have still we'll take with us to

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
gx next year I have lots of steam codes left

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
over so there's always digital stuff

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
that's true there is a lot of digital stuff

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
so we'll try to put it all together this week

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
honestly talk of this idea

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
started on thursday

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
and I loved it so much I was like we

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
need to make it happen and bobby put a good

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
idea out there he said well people

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
should probably have the holidays to work on their

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
projects cause a lot of people have downtime

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
from work I was like oh crap you're right

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
so we better make it happen fast so

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
we will anyway let's

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
get on to some more news tonight

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
we have a few more stories for you guys Loki

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
alright so as much as I like

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
the call of duty series the last few years it's been

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
kind of not doing as well as

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
it used to it used to be kind of record

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
setting each year where it would sell

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
out you know beyond

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
what you know the previous years edition

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
did and unfortunately that

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
kind of gone downhill since

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
I want to say black ops

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
2 which is sad

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
because black ops 2 is actually a really good title

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
but they're saying

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
basically advance warfare

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
is down

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
27% year over year

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
and that's

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
that's not good and that's

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
kind of sad cause I thought that was gonna be a

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
little bit more of an interesting

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
game but I guess people

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
just aren't getting the call of duty as much as

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
ever and honestly they're just

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
milking it too much maybe they need to

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
sleep it for a year maybe

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I think it

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
they tried some different stuff with it but it

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
still did feel a little bit like black ops

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
2

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
I don't know it's

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
it's an interesting game it's just

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
and

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
maybe it's just not peeling maybe it's

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
not different enough year over year where people

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
are like yeah I don't really need to

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
get this one I

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
can understand that and honestly like

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
even like the new mechanics in the game it does

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
enhance some things but it's not

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
you know completely

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
different but I don't know

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I mean you know like Madden

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
and stuff like that they enhance things and they don't really

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
change everything so

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
people still buy that

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
it did well it still was you know one of the

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
best selling games this year it's just

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
unfortunately not a lot of people

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
are buying it I think also still

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
we're kind of in that phase where maybe

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
people are picking it up right now because they're

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
gonna pick it up on another console later on once

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
they decide to you know bump up

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
to a current gen console

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
maybe that's the situation

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
or maybe they're skipping it this year because

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
they're saving up for that console or maybe

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
because there's too many fucking games that

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
come out you know in the month of November and

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
October I think it

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
could be a lot of those things or

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
you know there was this big shooter game that came

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
out that was kind of an MMO called Destiny

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
that did really well

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
so I think

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
a lot of those factors play into it but

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
I think if next year if it's

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
kind of still

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
on the down turn then maybe they have

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
milked all they can out of it

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I don't think that they have

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
but maybe I'm sure

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
they'll try to figure it out maybe go back to

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
World War II again I don't know

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
do something different

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
maybe you should fucking buy the rights

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
of time splitters and put out a new time splitters

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
game because that's really what I would want to see

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
now you're fishing now you're fishing I know

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
well maybe people aren't playing the new Call of Duty

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
because they can't let go of the shooters they've

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
been playing for like seven years now

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
one of those big popular

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
shooter games is Team Fortress 2

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
it's also popular because

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
it's free and Team Fortress 2

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
is going to be getting a new

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I guess update

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
I don't want to say expansion because they're calling it an update

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
but the update is called End of the Line

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
and I went oh does that mean this is

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
the last one and Team Fortress 3

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
imminent? Not really

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
can't count to three

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
even though End of the Line will have

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
21 cosmetic items

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
and it'll have a new taunt for the pyro

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
and a new multi-class melee weapon

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
and apparently a big

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
focus on ducks

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
like collectible ducks and duck tokens

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
and so forth okay this whole

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
thing is actually based on a community film

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
that's actually also called

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
End of the Line so they were

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
oh my god is it

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
oh that sounds awesome then because that film

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
was fucking rad so

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
yeah it's a fan film that runs

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
14 minutes on End of the Line

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
yes yes please more

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
of that that is pretty that is pretty rad

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
it is something that they are

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
building into the

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
official canon then of Team Fortress 2

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
so lots of folks looking forward

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
to that and bless Valve

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
for keeping this game going that

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
honestly you know with

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
some of those Team Fortress 2 videos

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
you're missing that VoG Team Fortress server

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
right about now aren't you no no no

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I once again

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
too much stuff to play but I

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
honestly would love to see a

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Team Fortress movie I think that would be awesome

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
because they have some really great characters

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
they have a lot of machinima they do but

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
I would love to see something that was like a few

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
hours long that was actually in theaters you know

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Seattle in our chat room not a fan saying

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
End of the Line was such a disappointment

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
they should have partnered with Disney and done

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
End of Line as DLC to dress up your characters

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
as Tron characters that's what I said

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
when I first saw the story I was like

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
oh shit is Tron in Team Fortress oh

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
it's End of the Line

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
got it that's what everybody says

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
our guild in Final Fantasy is actually

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
called End of Line and it's because of Tron

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
but we get like people

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
send tells their ass all the time shouldn't it be

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
End of the Line

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
no in this case

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
it is End of Line because it is a quote

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
from a movie anyway

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
and also it was a legit

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
statement command

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I know I know

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
anyhow Dark Soccer

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
you got some legit news for us

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
I do

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
actually you know

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Valve had the big holiday

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
auction thing going on

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
they actually had to shut it down

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
and restart the holiday auction

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
because

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
there were some activity done

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
by a few people

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
where they were

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
basically just

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
let me

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
start over basically they figured out

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
there was a Reddit thread that said

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
that there were some weird

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
things going on basically that you could

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
use a duplication exploit

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
and people were exploiting it

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
and they were just getting tons

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
of freebies

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
you know by

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
actually even creating a second hand market

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
to sell gems for

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
money so

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
basically Valve just

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
rebooted it started it over

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
and have been doing

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
the cases

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
item by item so

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
they just started it over they're like

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
fuck you guys for doing this we're just starting it over

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
screw you guys I'm going home

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
well yeah

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
no but I mean

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
it sucks that people have to

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
I don't know anyway

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
if you've got a system that someone

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I know that has a manipulation

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
in it I know

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
I know it just sucks it's the holidays

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
people

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
people are monsters I know

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
it sucks

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
alright so twitch kind

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
of going the route of esports

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
because they know that that's popular

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
and hell a lot of people

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
stream their esports stuff on

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
twitch so it makes sense

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
that they've acquired

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Goodgame which I guess

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
they're saying it's a company that the world's

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
first full service agency dedicated

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
to esports and live video game

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
broadcasting communities

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
so is that like a recruiter

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
I don't know but basically

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
there is a good game has an amazing

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
reputation in the industry for its

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
expertise in both sponsors

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
sponsorship sales and talent

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
support their passion for helping

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
the content creators and pro players achieve

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
success has elevated the entire

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
industry in the minds of

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
brands worldwide so it's kind of

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
like a promoter you know

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
talent scout type thing it sounds like

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
I'm sure now

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
that you know

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
it would be a good angle for them to go I guess

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
because esports are pretty big

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
and they kind of have the

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
grasp of you know

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
streaming on their site so

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I don't know

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
advertisers

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
interesting

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
apparently

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I didn't see how much so they purchased them for

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
but

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
it'll be interesting to see how they take

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
that if they're going to try to maybe make

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
esports more like

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
well mainstream

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
it's interesting to see twitch acquiring companies

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
when they themselves were just acquired by Amazon

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
I mean I realize that you know it's still

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
in a lot of ways business as usual

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
but it's just interesting that all those chess pieces

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
are moving the way they are well now that they have

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
an extra almost billion dollars to do

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
that with they could probably spend

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
some of that you know on this

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
kind of thing we're for sale by the way no I'm kidding

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
I'm kidding alright moving on

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
talking about games

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
for windows yeah no really

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I'm going to talk about games for windows or at least

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
what the hell is Microsoft's future

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
in gaming on the PC

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
because we don't really know a whole lot

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
about what that has in store

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
you know we talk about things like valve and

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
all these other store in fronts you know Microsoft

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
wants a piece of that and they've tried before

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
and surely they're going to come back

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
at some point and what's interesting

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
is there's been a

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
tweet that Phil Spencer

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
actually responded to

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
the tweet asked Phil Spencer

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Phil can we expect some UI

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
footage of windows 10 on

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
xbox one in January

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
and Phil responded to it saying

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
I'll be focusing more on what we are

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
doing on windows 10 in January

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
it's time for us to talk

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
about gaming on windows

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
hmm so

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
what are they going to do with windows 10

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
a new store that's so exciting

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
I can't wait to

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
see what windows 10 brings

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
nope sorry I don't care

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I honestly I'm just like

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
you know they've it seems like Microsoft likes

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
to try to do things that other people

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
do and don't get

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
me wrong they do a great job

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
on their gaming platform but as far as

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
like some of the other platforms

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
that they try like PC is a

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
art phones and tablets

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
and you know

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
mp3 players haven't

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
exactly been stellar and

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
like I'd say their PC storefront

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
is not

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
excellent but I would

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
assume that whatever this is going to be is

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
going to tie together xbox one

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
as well as

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
you know windows phone

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
as well as the PC

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
I know the idea

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
is that they want you know

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
those cross platform applications

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
to where okay say I get

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
you know

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
say I buy a game or something

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
on my PC

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
well it runs on my PC it now runs

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
on my xbox one and it runs on my phone

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
is the perfect world scenario

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
of that but I just

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I don't know I just don't think

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
anyone's really really care

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
what exclusive apps could you possibly

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
have that would

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
that anyone really

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
really care if they ran across all those platforms

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
minecraft

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
yeah but minecraft already is on those other

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
platforms minecraft 2

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
cool I guess

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
I'm waiting to see that

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
that seems to be

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
that's going to be the key piece I'm very curious

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
to see if that's that's what they pull out

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
and put out on the table that's

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
their only card I mean then that's

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I mean cool that well it's an expensive

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
card exactly their ace of spades

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
and more power

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
to them if that helps drive their

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
platform but you can't

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
just run a platform

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
it's just like me okay I have origin

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
installed in my system because I wanted to play

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
titanfall I played the

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
titanfall demo I didn't uninstall it but doesn't

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
mean I'm shopping for games on origin

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
I mean that's the same thing with minecraft 2

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
I will buy it on

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
their store if this is the only way I can

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
buy the game is through their storefront then sure I'll

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
buy it through their storefront doesn't mean I'm going to use their

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
storefront to buy more games

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
I just I don't know what they're

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
trying to do with it whatever let's see

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
I really want to see what windows 10

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
does to enhance the experience of the

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
xbox one that's what I'm curious to see

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
that and directx 12

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
or whatever it is that they're on now

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I'm curious to see how

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
because that's actually supposed to do a little bit more

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
but we'll see I mean

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
don't fuck it

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
up

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
good advice good advice

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
some comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
bonds 006

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
says they killed game for windows

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
and I won't go back

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
rama is saying that windows 10 is pretty fucking sweet

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
I haven't

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I guess they do have the whole like preview build

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
or whatever but I haven't really checked it out

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
I feel like when it comes to OS's

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I don't want to screw around with something that's not

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
like finished

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
if I had an extra computer

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
maybe but I don't really have that luxury

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
alright

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
let us get to the

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
mailbag every week you guys send us

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
emails

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
participate at orange lounge radio

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
.com and usually

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
dark soccer will dive in head first and read the

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
emails but I believe I'm doing it tonight right

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
yes because dark soccer

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
is still got a little bit of the voice we don't want her

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
to use it too much

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
she has to use her

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
she needs her voice

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
for complaining

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
not to read emails tonight

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
alright

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
I'm going to read some emails here instead

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
so let's get to it

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I'm going to go ahead and stop the music now

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
because I got to multitask here

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
so let's go to AZHP first off tonight

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
saying just wanted to submit a small

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
correction from last week's podcast

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
where Rob stated that instead of Marvel

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
or Star Wars being included or considered

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
for Kingdom Hearts 3 that it would only

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
be frozen that would be added to the game

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I pulled a quote from the source interview

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
which will clarify the vague quote Rob

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
quoted last week well how dare you try

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
to correct me on something how dare you insinuate

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
that I thought that was a joke not necessarily

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
well let's get

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
to the quote that AZHP

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
emails us here saying and by the way I'm kidding

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
AZHP says when I asked whether

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
I could safely infer that Star Wars

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
and Marvel are not off limits

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Yase confirmed

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
that they are being considered well

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
yeah they're all under consideration he

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
said nothing's off limits we're considering

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
all of the worlds there are so many

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
wonderful concepts we're happy about

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
that but at the same time it's really tough

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
to choose the

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
email goes on from AZHP

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
while I would honestly prefer if Star Wars and Marvel

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
were in Kingdom Hearts 3 myself

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
since I would prefer more cartoony characters

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
in the game I wanted to let you guys know that it

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
actually is what they're considering

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
that sounded like

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
though honestly thank you for the clarification

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
but that did sound like a lot of a non-answer

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
answer he just said

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
oh yeah you know we're considering everything

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
but it's so hard to choose and

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I'm not telling you shit

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I still stand by

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
what I said last week though that Frozen's

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
got a better chance of either of these things

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
on showing up in the game

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
real world stuff doesn't always tend to show up

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
in Kingdom Hearts I do realize Pirates of the

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Caribbean made an appearance

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
that was a pretty rare exception and that's still

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
a very very very very

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Disney grown thing at heart

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I just

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
you know when we talked about this

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
story last week we were coming off all this other

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Frozen mania and I just

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I just see it happening

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
for Kingdom Hearts 3

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
that doesn't mean the other stuff can't happen

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
but I just don't get your

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
hopes up people don't get your hopes up Star Wars

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
has their own line of video games as does

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Marvel I think in some ways

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
it would be really weird if they showed up in

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Kingdom Hearts I wouldn't hate it I'd actually

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
kind of like it but it does make

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
sense to instead

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
showcase these other properties that may

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
never show up otherwise I don't know

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
regardless it was a huge

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
non-answer answer in my opinion and

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
we just we don't know we're going to continue

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
to speculate and fan wank

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
all the way until we see some

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
more concrete information I would assume

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
at the next E3 maybe

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
actually it'll probably be two years from now because next E3

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
will be all about Final Fantasy 15

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
maybe in 2016 we can finally

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
fucking talk about Kingdom Hearts

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
yyr emails us

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
saying I found the discussion on

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
quote games that define last generation

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
from last week's show to be really interesting

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
partially because I'm not quite certain that one can

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
define last generation with a list of games at all

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
how do we define define

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
anyway I would take it to mean something like

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
this games that have the look and feel

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
made possible by that generation

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
and that influenced many games to

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
come both as part of that

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
generation and for generations afterwards

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
it's easy to put games like Super Mario

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Brothers Sonic the Hedgehog and Final Fantasy

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
7 on lists such as this but the

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
sheer length of time between last generation and this

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
one along with a massive number of and diversity

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
of titles released makes this almost

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
impossible gaming has transformed since

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
the release of the 360, PS3 and Wii

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
some things that define the generation

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
for me include the Gears of War trilogy

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
the introduction of achievements

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
the first Dead Rising, the indie games channel

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
and the availability of online fighting games

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
these are all revolutionary in their own way

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
but for many people none of these things will have

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
even been on their radar which leads

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
me to my point there is just too much

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
about this generation to fit on a short list

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
for example I personally

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
wouldn't define it with such events as the rise

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
of motion gaming or the popularity

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
of the American music game because outside

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
of the genre faithful

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
both of these turned out to be fads and are no

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
longer popular at all but

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
both definitely belong on a bullet list

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
of things that defined it for many people

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
it's just that this will wind up becoming a very very

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
very long list don't forget that

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
the very same hardware that ran the brand new

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 also ran the brand new

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Ridge Racer 6 with an 8 year

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
gap in between I guess what I'm trying to say

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
is this I would not want to attempt taking

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
on this task because I believe it would be nearly

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
impossible let me stop

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
there because the rest of the email gets into something else

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
it is a huge task

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
but so is trying to name the game of the

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
year yet people seem to do it

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
anyway and I think it's really too hard sometimes

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
to name just one game of the year

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
and that's going to change from person to person

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
just depending on your experiences

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
and you know what you like and that's

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
why diversity is great because everybody

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
brings different things to the table

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
I do want to clarify though I don't know if

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
the rise of motion gaming was a reference to

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Wii Sports but I just want to clarify

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
I put Wii Sports on

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
not just because of the motion gaming

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
but because the accessibility is a huge thing

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
and more people that started playing

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
games as a result

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
but I would agree with the fact that it is very

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
hard

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
to define the one game

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
that changed the generation that is a very hard thing

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
to do but I could try to pick

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
the one that I think

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
is a huge opinion I think

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
did it the most out of all of them

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
and that's why I picked Wii Sports and I think Wii Sports

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
out of all of them did it the most

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
but certainly is not the only game

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
that would define a generation which you're right

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
is kind of a vague concept to begin with

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
but then again so is game of the year

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
does that mean the best game the most fun

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
game the prettiest game

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
who knows

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
anyway the rest of the email here from

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
YYR also thank you for the information

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
on the upcoming Wii U CD-ROM attachment

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
but the latest news suggests that while it is capable

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
of playing CD-ROM discs it will not

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
actually allow users of the Wii U to play

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
music CDs oh well

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
finally thank you for suggesting a subtitle for

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
Pixel Shits 2 projectile explosive

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
diarrhea however I heard

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
the PED is illegal for most athletes

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
some game developers and

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
a few podcasters

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
anyone else play Acrophobia back in the day?

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Aaron YYR

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
uh yes yes

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
really I played

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Acrophobia back in the day I sure did

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
that was a fun game that's why

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
I think that's why I do have

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
such a soft spot for like when we had the

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
uh guys from Jackbox Games on a couple weeks ago

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
cause a lot of the old Berkeley stuff

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
like that's where most of them ended up

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
so uh that's why I probably have a

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
soft spot cause I loved the old

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
uh Berkeley games

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
alright lastly but not leastly

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
actdeft emails us hello

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
from your friendly neighborhood Mexican actdeft

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
you know how amiibos have been actually

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
quite popular running out in places and even

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
selling for more than their worth but so

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
far the only game that has given them some use is

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Smash Brothers granted they're still new

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
and all but I hope that Nintendo does more with

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
them in the future and try to give them more than

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
an quote use an amiibo

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
in game to unlock items thing that they have

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
going right now in fact I do have

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
an idea I think it's a really great one

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
since Animal Crossing Wii U is apparently

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
coming either next year or in 2016

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
it will probably have amiibo support

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
but instead of just giving you items in game to decorate

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
your house how about they make the amiibo unlock

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
a neighbor of that same character

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
like you place the Kirby amiibo on the game pad

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
and the game will give you Kirby as a

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
neighbor for your town wouldn't it be fantastic

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
having your regular neighbors and special

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
neighbors maybe have the amiibos

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
live in an apartment complex or something like that

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
oh see I like that idea it would be like

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
um Tomodachi life or something

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
where they all live in a building

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
I posted this idea on other sites like Reddit

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
and got a somewhat mixed reception

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
as you will get on Reddit

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
but I wanted to know what you guys in the chatters

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
and other emails or callers think of this idea

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
anyways thanks for reading hope you're having a great Sunday

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
and he does end with a PS

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I have a code for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Edition on Steam and since I got the Lego

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
movie code for PS Vita a few weeks back

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
I thought I should pay it forward

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
or back I don't know either any of you

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
can keep it or give it away in chat

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
enjoy well thank you for that

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
steam code I'm going to put that

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
over in the prize pool for the vog jams

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
there you go that's the first thing going in the prize pool

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
steam code for Super Street Fighter 4

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Arcade Edition on Steam we'll just put that in the prize pool

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
for people to participate

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
um as far as the part

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
about amiibos your idea is cool

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
um

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
I do realize Nintendo had

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
to kind of back the car in so to speak

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
with amiibos as far as

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
you know what they did with Hyrule Warriors

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
what they did with Mario Kart and so forth

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
so I don't judge them too

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
harshly on

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
what they did there

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
however I think the really telling

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
thing is going to be what do they do in

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
next year's games

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
the one to really keep an eye on in my

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
opinion I want to know how those

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
amiibo will work in

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Splatoon I think

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
however amiibos function

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
is in Splatoon is going to be very

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
telling for the future of amiibo

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
is that what it's going to be hats

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
is it just going to be have amiibo unlock

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
crap or would there possibly be

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
that you could play some of those characters in Splatoon

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
or that you would level

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
up maybe you have the hat but you're kind of

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
doing like a level up thing that's the one thing I like

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
about the amiibo is that you're leveling it up

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
but it's like if I level it up in Smash

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
then what? I think that they're doing too much

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I mean I don't have a problem with

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
them doing like the unlock crap stuff

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
because honestly it's unreasonable to

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
expect them to incorporate every single amiibo

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
that they're ever going to create into

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
all of these games like I shouldn't be able to play

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Mario in like

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Hyrule Warriors although

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I would totally love

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
to see a kingdom was it

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
a mushroom kingdom warriors or something like that

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
would be fucking amazing but

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
I understand that it's unreasonable

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
for me to expect them to have

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
all these characters playable in every single

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
I mean Wii Fit Trainer it doesn't make any sense

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
I have a good idea here's my idea I'm going to pitch out there

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Mario Maker is coming out soon

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
right? What if

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
in Mario Maker there's certain

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
new things not existing things

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
new things that you can use

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
if you have an amiibo

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
that you've leveled up to a certain

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
point in some other game

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
so for example like

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
maybe I get a Kirby picture

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
that I can have in a stage somewhere

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
or Kirby music oh even better

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I get Kirby music and if I have the amiibo

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
I can use one song in a stage

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
yes I know I'm talking Kirby music in Mario

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
but roll with me here but maybe if I've

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
leveled my Kirby fighter to level

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
30 in Smash Brothers then I have a

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
second song I can use or maybe it just skins

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
everything to Kirby yeah

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
or maybe changes the colors to Kirby colors

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
or like you can have

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
like you know for Yoshi it changes everything

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Yoshi Island style or something

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
but I love the idea of I would have to

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
and this would be really smart for Nintendo to do

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
you have to do something in this game over here to make it happen

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
over here but maybe not necessarily restricted

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
to just one game I kind of think

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
the amiibo should level up as a

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
whole so that way like

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
okay I level it in Smash Brothers

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
but then if I want to push it even further

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
and even though it might not do anything in Smash Brothers

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
my like amiibo level I would

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
use it Mario Kart and then I would use it Mario Maker

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
it'd be cool if like they'd have different

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
stats or something like you could up you know

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
if I play them in Smash Brothers become stronger

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
and you know they

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
gain fighting skills or something like that where if I

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
play them in Mario Kart

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
they gain driving skills or something

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
doesn't necessarily mean if I have a level

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
50 amiibo in Smash Brothers that's

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
good at driving or something I don't know

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
it's an easy thing to balance but

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
you know Nintendo has

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
gone down this path and I think there's a lot of really

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
awesome shit that they could do with this

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
but I just worry is Nintendo

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
going to be too stubborn to do it as

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
they often are I don't know

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
and maybe amiibos are too popular for their own

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
good I don't know

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Tigerclaw in chat says they're probably

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
going to make amiibos specific to Splatoon no

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
doubt well with

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
as much as those things are selling

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
why not make more more more more

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
alright that's it for the mailbag if you want to participate

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
with the mailbag in a future week participate

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
at orangelaungeradio.com

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
let's get into the FUs

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
of the week

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
it might sound a little bit odd

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
there's a lot

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
of positive posts going on

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
about people

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
you know how people will do

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
romance mods for games

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
oh well I want to be able to romance

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
this person even though they're straight

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
or I want to romance this person even though

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
they're gay and there's a bunch of people

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
going around saying well you can't

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
change a person's sexuality don't

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
do it for the game

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
don't take but

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
then these are the same people who are also

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
shipping characters

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
in TV shows that are

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
canonically of a different

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
sexuality if it's

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
wrong to do it in one genre it's

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
wrong to do it in another genre

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
and it doesn't just apply

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
to wanting to make

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
homosexual characters straight it also

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
applies the other way around it applies to

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
wanting to make asexual characters

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
have attraction to

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
bits or something

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
respect the

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
way the author or the

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
creator of the universe has said it

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
they're not in control of it no more

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
than real people are in control of it

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
if you are going to write your

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
fiction I have no problem with you exploring

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
themes but accept that

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
it is not actually the way

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
that it was intended

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
and that you are creating an alternate universe

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
the end okay so I was just gonna say

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
devil's advocate like if somebody

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
is making fantasy

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
and that's fantasy then that's fine as long

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
as they acknowledge it as fantasy

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
there are people who say this is

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
like they'll try to insert

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
canon it's not

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
canon but don't push your fantasy

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
on everybody else exactly

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
and there are people out there saying oh well

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
it's just another canon no no no

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
it's an alternate reality

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
canon refer canon means the author

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
wrote it the word canon

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
relate originated with

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
religious canon in

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
a religious doctrine in this

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
case canon refers to something that is the

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
way that the author created you can

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
have a head canon which is

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
your addition to things that

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
happen in the canon that might

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
be plausible

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
in the canon but when you go

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
and you change something that

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
is completely outside canon

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
and

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
your little fantasy world does

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
not apply to how the author

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
created it and I'm writing a book now so I

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
start thinking about these things

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
and I was like I don't want people to take

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
this asexual character

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
that I'm writing and make

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
them you know completely interested in

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
this guy's dick no

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
dick's gross that's

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
how I'm writing her so

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
hey you know what else is not you know what else is not

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
canon the Star Wars

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
extended universe aww

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
too soon indeed

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
I approve of that one Rob

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
low key

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
um I guess

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
just the fact that I haven't had a lot

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
of time to work on the programming

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
stuff I literally get sometimes

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
at work just like 15 minutes

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
and it's just not enough time to even

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
sit down and open my laptop and

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
work on anything just

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
can't switch my

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
train of thought to something

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
different so it's kind of disappointing

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
you know that's all

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
uh my FU

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
goes to I have a

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
crazy week at work ahead I like

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
my job and all but oh my god FU

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
to the fact that I probably have to get up at 6 am tomorrow

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
not looking forward to that thanks

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
means I have to be in bed in less than an hour

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
that's not going to happen if I want 8 hours of sleep

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
that won't happen we all know that

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
alright uh

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
there it is the FUs of the week just a couple more stories

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
for you guys then we're going to quickly take some calls

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
but I warn you guys I'm not keeping the skype line

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
open very often if we don't get calls

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
we're wrapping up cause like I just said

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
I have to be at work I have to be up

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
really early tomorrow so uh

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
we will allow though it is the show

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
where every gamer has a voice so if you do want to call in

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
we will take a couple quick calls

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
uh a couple

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
quick stories here at the end though

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
so it's hard to believe that OC Remix has been around

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
for 15 years but that's

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
what they're celebrating is 15 years of

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
independent remixes

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
of video game music and that's pretty cool

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
in fact including with that

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
they have um

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
some new tracks

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
that they've been putting together 15 new

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
remixes uh that

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
from 15 different game consoles

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
and this is all in celebration

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
of you know

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
15 years and

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
man they've even had all these different

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
uh

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
albums that they put out I mean it's just

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
crazy I can't believe that they've

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
been around that long

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
yeah my gosh and sg100matt sums it up

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
perfectly in chat shit 15 years

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
god I feel old yep pretty much

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
pretty much that's how I feel too but

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
congrats to them I mean

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
I look back on this show and I go god 12 years

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
it must be like the oldest fucking thing on the internet but nope

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
OC Remix has us beat

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
OC Remix has us beat good job guys

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
uh lastly

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
but not leastly

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
prepare your wallet because uh

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
the steam holiday sale

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
oh it's coming

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
December 18th is the day

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
now this is now keep in mind Valve

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
hasn't announced this but this is

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
coming through some Japanese paypal

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
users apparently uh

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
some correspondence went out to them revealing

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
the launch of December 18th

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
uh a reddit user actually shared

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
the email that they received which

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
does mention that the sale will start on December

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
18th and run through January

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
2nd of course we do not

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
know what the uh thing will

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
entail but if it's if it's like

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
any previous steam sale you know it's gonna

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
be on sale everything

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
except maybe the new new

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
releases and the stuff that's still commanding

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
$60 call of duty will not be on sale

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
call of duty well you never know even call of duty

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
if it's not selling so well

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
maybe they'll even knock it down take a page from

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Shadow of Mordor and I'm not even sure why Shadow

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
of Mordor is marked down so much but

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
shit that game was like

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
half off for like a long time

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
it just came out

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
I don't think it was selling that bad of course

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
uh Valve not commenting on these

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
rumors but uh of course but this is

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
how it's leaked out in the past so

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
it doesn't it makes perfect sense that's right

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
alright uh we're gonna open up the Skype line

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
right now here's your chance 1877

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
game OLR or our username on

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Skype is orange launch radio if you want to talk

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
about anything we've talked about so far on

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
the show or something else uh

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
meanwhile let me just check in real quick if we have any

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
last minute stories from Loki while we wait for a call

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
uh

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
they have a

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
cool hack that's going on for

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
uh remote play that you can get it to work on

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
an android phone

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
that's kind of neat I don't think that's

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
actually um yeah

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
it's uh an app that they have that

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
you can actually use a tablet device or

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
something to do remote play

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
on in case you don't have a Vita

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
alright we are gonna go to the phones

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
cause it's lighting up hi you're on orange launch radio

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
who's this uh hello this

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
this is Hitstun hey Hitstun how are you

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
we haven't heard from you in a long time what's up

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
yeah I'm doing alright I'm the man that used to do tech support

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
for the fastest internet in the chat

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
hahaha nice

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
alright um I'm really excited

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
you guys are doing like the vog jam

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
a game jam here that sounds great

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
me too so

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
officially count me in on that

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
yes that's awesome

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
I'm pretty hyped for that I'm hyped for it too

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
you know and it's scary uncharted

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
territory cause who knows people may

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
hate the theme but uh I think

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
you'll find a way to work with it even if you end up

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
hating the theme I think people will find a way to work

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
with it cause it doesn't mean that has to be

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
the central theme of your game you know or whatever

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
uh and it's scary I don't know if you can do worse

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
than the most recent Ludum Dare though

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
oh entire game on one screen

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
that's what they picked oh wow

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
uh like that you could do anything

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
with that but it's a little too wide you

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
know um when you guys are picking a theme

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
like I mean try to

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
try to give something that at least gives

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
us a little bit of direction about what the game

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
should be about or like a topic maybe

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
well I would think you know even if we did

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
something like Puzzle Sluts

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
like Puzzle Sluts maybe doesn't necessarily have

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
to be a puzzle game Puzzle Sluts

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
could be you know you're looking

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
for missing pieces of the puzzle

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
in a point and click adventure mystery game

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
you know what I mean like yeah and obviously I'm

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
making that up completely that's not

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
gonna be the theme but well that might be too

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
narrow but if you just do Sluts we might be

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
able to use more

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
we could do all kinds of games well

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Puzzle Sluts, Fighting Sluts,

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
Action Sluts the ingredient is

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Sluts!

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
Awesome!

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
So tune in next week to find out

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
that I'm really excited

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
about it and what's really exciting

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
is that we have a lot of people who have

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
experience jumping into

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
this like you know Bobby says

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
he'll do it you're gonna say you're gonna do it

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
YYR is gonna do it now even the

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Cookie with Unity guys are saying

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
they're gonna they're gonna keep an eye on it and they might do it

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
too I know

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
right but remember this isn't about

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
quality and that's why I wanted to stress that because like

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
if somebody's like I don't

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
know how to like this

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Unity stuff I don't have time it's too

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
scary like I appreciate it but you know what

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
I just want to make a slutty little big planet level

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
then cool

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
you know we want to do it

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
just don't get banned

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
So it'll be awesome to see what you guys come up with

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Let's see

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
I don't really have to do Plug for the Instagib stream

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
because Raven's Dolphin did it for me last week

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
thanks dude

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
so instead I'm gonna Plug something else

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
there's a convention

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
coming up at the end of July

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
called Replay FX

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
I'll go ahead and

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
throw it in chat here but it's in Pittsburgh

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
and it's a gaming convention

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
and it's also attended by

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
PAPA, the Professional

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
and Amateur Pinball Association

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
also run out of Pittsburgh

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
and it's gonna have like 700 arcade machines

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
and I think, sorry

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
700 pinball

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
tables, 2000 arcade machines

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
and I'm kinda interested to see if there's

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
anyone else involved that's going to that

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
so we'll probably see without shakedown

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
maybe it'll be a forum topic or something

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
and we'll see

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
I don't know of a lot of listeners in the Pittsburgh area

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
at least I can't think of any off the top of my head

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
but if it's on the east coast

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
it's certainly possible Rama will go

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
yeah, that'll be cool

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
hopefully we can get Rama out of that one

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
I'm also going to PAX East

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
so I will see you there

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
yes, I will

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
pretty excited for that

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
and that's about it I think

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
alright, well hitstun I'm gonna let you go so we can try to

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
get a couple more calls in but excited to see

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
what comes out for the game jam

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
yep, doing my token

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
call in saying yeah I've been listening for 9

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
years and

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
keep going for a good 12 more

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
oh my gosh, we will try

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
that means so much, just don't tell me how old

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
you were when you first started listening because that always throws me

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
alright, have a good one

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
it's all good, have a good one

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
alright, take care

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
on orange lounge radio

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
we haven't heard from him in a long time

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
it's always good to hear from him

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
I love the people that call in all the time

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
but I love hearing from new people and

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
blast from the past as well

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
I was literally thinking of Jim Sally the other day

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
and I don't even remember what made me think of him

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
but I was like, we haven't gotten a call from Jim Sally

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
in so long

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
I must have, I heard a train

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
or somebody imitating a train

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
and I was like, oh my god, is Jim Sally here

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
I don't know, we got a call on the line, let's get to it

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
hi on orange lounge radio, who's this?

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
uh, yeah, this is Zormac

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I'm sorry, Zormac?

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
I'm Zormac

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
oh yes, yes, yes, how are you my friend?

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
good, how are you?

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
am I coming okay? I don't know how well

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
we can hear you, it's a little bit

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
like a walkie talkie sound, but that's alright

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
it's good enough, we can hear you, what's up buddy

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
ok, great, so first of all

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
this talks to the

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
final hill 4

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
little music during the break

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
it was running late, I didn't get to hear the first part

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
but to just like, log in

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
and hear that was pretty awesome

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
um, well, Silent Hill 4

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
was actually our classic game of the week

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
this week, because believe it or not

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
that game is 10 years old

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
yeah, I uh, I actually remember

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
uh, running around

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
I'm not saying anything else, but

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
to play it at home, but uh, yeah

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Silent Hill 4 The Room, correct?

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.000
correct

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
yeah, yeah, so I remember

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
playing that back in the day, it's been almost

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
forever, since I've actually heard it, so

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
uh, the other thing I wanted to talk about was

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
the

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
whole gaming, uh

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
people playing, making their own games and stuff

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
is that, could be a thing

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
that you guys are gonna start doing now, it looks

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
pretty interesting that you guys are

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
going into that, well, I wouldn't say

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
we're changing the whole show

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
but, you know, we're about

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
being the show where every gamer has a

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
voice, and I think one thing

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
you know, any show you watch on TV

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
is gonna have a story arc that

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
goes on for weeks and weeks sometimes

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
and I think right now, kind of the arc that

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
we're embracing is, why don't you use your

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
voice to actually make some games

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
um, because, there's

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
I think especially this year, it's kind of a

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
there's been a lot of

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
talk this year about

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
diversity in games, let's just put it that

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
way, right? And what better

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
way to diversify

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
games than get everybody

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
making games

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
to diversify the voices that are making them

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
it's kind of like they said in that interview

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
the guys from Cooking with Unity, we need to get more

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
gamers making games

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
is what we need, so I don't think there's

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
I kind of see that

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
I like embracing that idea

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
right now, now are we gonna turn into a

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
tech oriented how to

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
make your own games podcast?

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
Not necessarily, that's what

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Cooking with Unity does, and there's plenty of other

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
resources out there to help you out with that type of stuff

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
but are we gonna do what we can to really

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
kind of nudge people and go

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
you ever thought about trying this, yo?

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Nudge people and encourage people

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
to try in a place

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
where people, we will

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
say, you are not allowed to hate

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
here, this is not,

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
OLR is not about hate, it's don't be a

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
dick, I don't care who you are, where you're

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
from, what you do, but here

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
we respect each other, so

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
you're gonna create a game and

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
dammit, we're gonna embrace everything that is

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
made, and believe me, there are gonna be some shitty

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
entries in this game jam, because I'm participating

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
there will be some shitty entries in this game jam

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
but dammit, we're gonna love everything

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
as long as somebody tries, that's the important part

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Alright, cool, so are you

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
going to maybe point out

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
your favorite

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
website to kind of look at

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
certain games being made in

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
a different environment, I know

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Unity is gonna be pretty much the

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
primary language

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
to create the game, but I'm pretty sure there's gonna

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
be other websites that

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
utilize other tools

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
I would love to highlight

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
different things every week

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
to help people with ideas

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
and I just wanna say, even though we had the Cooking

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
with Unity guys on the show tonight, and

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Unity is a great choice

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
I don't wanna say Unity is the official

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
platform of the competition, it's not

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
the theme of the competition is create something

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
dammit, so if you create it in Unity, awesome

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
if this is what gets you to learn Unity, awesome

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
but if this is what gets you to learn Unreal

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
or something else, and that's what you've

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
been wanting to do, then

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
then we embrace that just as much

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
I think a great source, like I always

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
tend to go, well for me, just

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
doing Unity and stuff, I tend to go

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
to Reddit a lot, so Reddit, you know

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
they have the, our Game Dev

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
and our Unity 3D

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
are pretty good sources, if you're looking to do

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
a different language, they have those as well

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
our Unity, our Unreal

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Engine, they have, I'm pretty sure

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
they have one for the Coast Coast

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
2D or whatever it is

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
lots of different programming language out there

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Game Maker, I think is free at some

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
points, so you can do that

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
RPG Maker

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
lots of resources

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
5th Dream in Chat with an excellent question here saying

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
fuck, does it even have to be electronic, can I make

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
a pen and paper RPG

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
well I'm gonna consult the golden rule

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
of the competition, which is

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
create something dammit, so

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
I actually think a

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
board game, a pen and paper game

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
if that's what you really wanna do

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
it's starting to push it a little bit

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
but I think I'm okay with that, because at the end

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
of the day, create something dammit

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
yeah, and that's pretty good too, because if anything

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
if it's a really good game, pen and paper

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
I'm pretty sure that they'll make some version of it

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
you know, so people can play on the

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
some sort of console

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
I think the rule for that is that it has

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
to be accessible online

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
that means

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
you have to publish the rules

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
publish the rules online, basically

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
indeed

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
if you've got

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
a board game, put the template up

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
online, Cards Against Humanity

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
great example, it's a game you play

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
in person, but it's something you can download

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
and print and make your own deck, right

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
it's a great example, it takes like

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
you can go in and make a 300 DPI

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
game board

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
I like that as a rule, so

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
yes, it's fine if you do

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
a board game or a pen and paper, but it has to be

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
something I get online and I

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
can, so that it is accessible

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
all who are participating in the game jam

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
ok, I like that, I like that, great

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
clarification there, Brad from Pod Culture

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
says, do drinking games count?

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
ok, now you're pushing it, now you're pushing it

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
ok

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
only the ones where I'm drinking

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
it's part of the development process

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
alright, well my friend, I gotta let you

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
go so we can try to squeeze in one more call

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
but do you think you might participate in the game jam?

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
um, yeah, I mean

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
I'm gonna be looking at some of the

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
websites for information

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
and we'll see, I love it

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
YouTube is a great help and

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
I even went through some

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
of these free courses for

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
I don't know, just like

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
even programming and stuff

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
I had to try to teach myself

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
and a lot of it was just kind of looking up

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
examples online and just seeing

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
how they do stuff and I'm still looking up

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
like, oh, how do I use this command

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
and how do I do this

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
I'm still waiting for your vlog

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
yeah, call him out

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
call him out

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
any information is good information

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
yeah, that blog, hopefully

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
I have a URL already

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
and I just have to make the webpage

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
someday, but that's time

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
it's time away from programming, so I don't know

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
we'll see

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
you take care my friend, thanks for calling

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
alright, bye

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
alright, we're gonna try to squeeze in one more call here

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
and this will be it for the night, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
just the one and only

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
Rama, how is everybody tonight?

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
Rama, how are you?

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
I am good, I just want you to know

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
because of what Hitstun has said

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
I am starting a Kickstarter call

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
get Rama and the crew to conventions

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
hahahaha

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
you need a van

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
like they have in Scooby-Doo

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
well, I don't think

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
it'd be hard for us to get a van

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
because Mako-chan is pretty beastly

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
when she drives, so you know

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
we got nothing to worry about

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
I'm just saying, clouds of smoke come out of both those vans

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
well

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
there is a reason why she does drive

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
and does all the cooking, so

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
haha, what's on your mind my friend?

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
well this whole

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
fog jam thing

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
I might have to break out my visual

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
basic skills and do something or

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
learn Unity, since I now have free time

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
fuck yes, and by the way

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
AkumaJP in chat says, I don't want to be that guy

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
but Unity is not a language, don't worry

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
you're not being that guy, you're right, Unity is not a language

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Unity is an engine, there is a big

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
difference, but at the end of the day, the golden rule

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
again, is create something, dammit

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
so if you are going to use an engine, if you're going to use

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
a language, if you're going to use, you know, whatever

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
whatever it takes to

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
get the job done, we encourage it

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
so, love it

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
yes indeed, yes

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
a couple more things, I'm going to get out of here

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
now this whole Lucky Chloe thing, now

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
you already said what I said

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
in the chat earlier

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
but also, I have a feeling

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
Lucky Chloe is going to be on the US release

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
because I don't see Namco

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
doing two separate presses

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
of the game for separate coding for this

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
I have a feeling

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
it's going to be there, but

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
it's just going to be locked

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
so you can't access it, and then

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
when all the drama dies down

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:18.000
for $3.99

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:20.000
you can have the character

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:22.000
yeah, DLC, that would be the best way to

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:24.000
stick it, is to give it to Japan for free

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:26.000
and make us pay for it, it would be hilarious

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
exactly, I just think dude's

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.000
pissed off at what he read on the internet

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
and I really don't think it's going to impact the final game

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:34.000
I think in a slow news week

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
people are really reaching for a headline here

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
I think he said something when he was really pissed off

03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:40.000
and he was kind of like, well maybe I should make

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
this instead then, and people are reading

03:02:42.000 --> 03:02:44.000
that to say, oh he's not going to do it

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
I think you're right, Namco's not going to

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
make two completely different copies

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
that's just not really what they're going to do

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
she'll be in the game

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
everybody just needs to pull their stick out of their

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
ass and get over it, because again

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
this is the same series that has

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
Panda Bears and Yoshimitsu

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
come on, let it go

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
let it go people

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
exactly

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Loki thought I was going to break into

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
a song, that was last week

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
I'm moving on

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
the cold never bothered me anyway

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
alright

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
anything else Rama?

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
Final Fantasy, real quick

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
now I came across this on my

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
Facebook and it does remind me

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
of you and Al in a way of how

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
you two met, I have a long

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
time friend and she

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
just got married, what I didn't know

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
is that she met her now

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
husband while playing Final Fantasy

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
11, was this the

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
story that was on Reddit? Yes

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
and I tagged you in it because it was for a possible

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
article, the girl

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Jen, that's one of my closest

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
friends, I've known her for like 10

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
11 years, how funny

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
we were a couple of conhors back in the day

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
how funny, you're right, I'm sorry I didn't throw that in there

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
tonight, just all the other stuff

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
sidetracked me a little bit, but

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
that's awesome that they met

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
in Final Fantasy 11 and what, they play

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
14 now right?

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
Probably, but right now

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
real life

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
has been taking over for them

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
because they just came

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
back from the honeymoon and this and this

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
and that, you know

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Well to be fair, Alan and I didn't really meet in a video

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
game, although we did meet online

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
and we met on LiveJournal, which

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
I realize there's a lot of people now listening to

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
the show that don't even know what LiveJournal

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
really is, because it's kind of what

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
predated Facebook, there's actually

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
an Orange Lounge LiveJournal community, I don't think

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
it's been posted in since 2007, but it's

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
there, and I am a part of that

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
and the only reason I said Final Fantasy is because I remember

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
y'all two crossed paths that I think was

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
a Distant Worlds concert or something

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
like that, it was actually Video

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
Games Live, I was close

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
you were close, you were right

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
the first time we actually met in person

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
was at Video Games

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
Live, and we knew each other

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
virtually through LiveJournal, and it

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
was actually, believe it or not, it was

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
CaptainSpike from GameBooey.org who said

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
oh, you guys haven't met? And actually

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
introduced us, so

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
then we met in person at that concert

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
So, yeah

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
I know, right? Just looking at the chat room

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
it's hilarious, Fifth Dream

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
says, I just said LJ, and

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
onstov06 says, what's Hi5 or

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
my yearbook? No, we didn't

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
meet on Zynga, people, we didn't meet on Zynga

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
or was it, sorry, not Zynga, Zongo

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
what was that site called? Zynga

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
It's still around

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
Is it really? I believe so

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
I knew

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
people who used to post there, and don't forget

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
with LiveJournal, there was a

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
spin-off, there was Dead

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
Journal for the gods, Dream

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Journal for the people who

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
were psychics, and you had Open

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
Journal, and this journal, and that

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
journal. Every time LiveJournal

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
did something to piss people off, it was like

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
I'm getting a dead journal, that's the day

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
And then there's the ultimate alternative

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
Dream Width

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
Still going strong

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
Crazy, crazy. Alright, my friend, I gotta let you go

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
so we can wrap up the show, but have a good one, thank you for calling

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
You too, thank you

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
I love that he's thinking

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
about starting a Kickstarter to get his

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
van, his

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
posse, the anime jam session posse

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
He needs to come back out here

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
and do a con

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
Or send me a plane ticket so I can

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
go out there

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
And you're

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
not even going to PAX East, I'm going to the East Coast

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
Finally

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
You know what?

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
See, this upcoming year

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
is going to be the year of lots

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
of money saving, not just by the house that we're in

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
Dan and I hit our 10 year

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
anniversary

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
And we're either thinking Disney World

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
Because I'm not going to

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
a con on my anniversary

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
Or Disneyland at the Grand Californian

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
Nice

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
So I'm going to be on the shoestring for

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
GX3, but yeah

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
My car has paid off this year, so I'm hoping

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
I do the smart thing and save a little more money

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
instead of spending it on frivolous things, but

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
there will probably be a few frivolous things here and there, let's be real

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
Anyway, if you didn't

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
get through tonight, I'm so sorry, but please consider

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
sending us an email, participate at

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
orangelaunchradio.com, but we are

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
waiting way long you guys, we have got to wrap

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
things up for the night, but what an

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
awesome show tonight, and

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
yeah, even though

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
to follow up on that one call,

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
Orangeland Radio is not changing, we're still the show where every

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
gamer has a voice, and we're going to talk about news every week

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
and comment

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
on it and give our opinions just like

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
we always have, but if we can

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
encourage more people to

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
make games, you know what?

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
Because one of you guys out there

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
might have the idea for the next great game

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
that we talk about on a future show

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
and so

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
why wouldn't we not

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
want to start that and foster that?

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
So yes, it will be the theme

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
over the coming weeks here at Orangeland Radio

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
Thanks again

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
so much for staying up late and listening to

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
our show, be it on the podcast feed

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
or being here

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
live at the Voice Gees Network, vognetwork.com

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
As we say every week, if you like the

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
show, please tell a friend or five

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
about the show, help spread the word

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
we are an independent production

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
and indie voices are so

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
important out there, help spread the word

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
not just about us, but your favorite

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
indie podcast, that's why I say that

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
and if for whatever reason

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
you can't think of a lot of people, you really rack your

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
brain, you're like, I just don't know anybody

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
please consider leaving us a five star review

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
wherever you found this show

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
iTunes, Stitcher

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
even if you do tell friends

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
consider leaving a five star review there as well

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
those go a long way

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
in helping promotion on those various

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
websites, because the makers of those sites look at that

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
information when they consider who to feature

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
so really appreciate your consideration for five star

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
reviews on sites like iTunes

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
Stitcher or wherever you found this show

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
It's time to go around and get

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
everybody's final thought for the night

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
we will be back here in seven days to do it

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000
all again on the 21st

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000
we're getting towards the end of the year

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000
we might have to do, Latke Fest

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
because it'll be right at the end of

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
Hanukkah

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
starts Tuesday right?

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000
which while I was high on coding

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000
I did the dance of Hanukkah around my house and

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
decorated

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000
well happy Hanukkah to all of our listeners who celebrate

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
this coming week and we'll check in with y'all on

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
Sunday and see how the festival's going

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000
and we will have the

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
VoG jam ingredient

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
will come out of the show

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
next week in an epic edition

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
of Listless

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000
I'll be a dreidel, just kidding

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
now were we gonna have people submit

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000
ideas as well?

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
we want your, yeah

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.000
if nobody submits an idea

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
fine, we'll make our own damn list

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:38.000
but what we want to do, and this is different than our usual

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
Listless, Latke, we want people to submit

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
their ideas for

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
us to consider for

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
putting on the list, we don't usually do that in advance

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000
well that's good because I have no idea

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000
so submit away

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:52.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:54.000
is the place to send those

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:56.000
and you can also send those to

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000
our VoGnetwork.com

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
posting of the show, for those of you listening on the podcast

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.000
you can leave your ideas there as well

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.000
again, it should be, what should

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000
the theme of the game be?

03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:08.000
Should it be about cats?

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000
Cats who are

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:12.000
Now Rob, we have to specify

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
that it's felines

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000
and not pussy

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.000
Should it be

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000
Then we would have twat masters

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000
Should it be cats with labels?

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000
Should that be the theme of the game? Who knows

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Send us your ideas, remember nothing

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:28.000
that's copyrighted, please, we have to

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:30.000
throw those out immediately

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.000
But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
for the night. Dar Sacher, I'll start with you

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
our sick one, please feel better

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
and we'll see you next week

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000
Is that your final thought?

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000
Really? I hate that

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000
Where's my mute button?

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.000
Alright, feel better

03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000
My final thought for the night, my final thought is

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:50.000
I don't think I've shaved in like ten days

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000
I really should probably do that, it's a good idea

03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000
And I'm really excited that I finally

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.000
have a BurgerTime cabinet in my house

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000
sort of

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:00.000
It's multiple things and there's more games

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000
emulators on there

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000
Super BurgerTimes on it too

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
There's more emulators on there, I will be

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000
making a point this week though, Rob

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
to copy my ROM set off

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:12.000
of my other cabinet because it's a lot better

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
and it has Miss World nude

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000
That was the one thing I needed on the cabinet

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000
I had to make it work appropriate

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:20.000
it was on there and it

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000
still actually may be on there, that's what I was looking at

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:24.000
earlier, but I couldn't find it

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.000
so I will copy my old ROM set

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000
and I'll dump it on there and then you'll have

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:30.000
You'll have all the weird

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
games on there including

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000
all the, was it

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
Are we allowed to do Twitch streams of Miss Nude

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000
World 96 or is that against their terms of service?

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000
It's probably against their terms of service

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000
You can't do emulated stuff on Twitch

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
anyway, I feel like

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
I need to do a U stream or something

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:48.000
I don't know if that computer is

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000
You could probably do it, it's not

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000
that fast, I don't have to run it from the cabinet

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000
I can run it from there, just thinking

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:56.000
Anyway, Loki last

03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.000
but not least, your final thought tonight

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000
I'm going to work on lots of programming this week

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
trying to make it a point that my son is going to want me to play

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000
Lego Marvel with him, that's fine, I can play Lego Marvel with him

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
while he's awake, program him when he's not awake

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.000
so, sounds good, sounds like some motivation

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:10.000
this week, I am very motivated

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:12.000
I can't wait to work on some new

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000
stuff, it'll be interesting

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000
to start from scratch again, by the way

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:18.000
check your email, because our buddies

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:20.000
from Cooking with Unity told you how to play

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 with them

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:24.000
Yes! Damn it, that's going to take me away

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.000
from programming, but that's okay

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000
that's okay

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000
It's a good purpose, a good purpose

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000
I need to get back into Grand Theft Auto

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000
because I miss it

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000
Thank you so much to our friends from Cooking with Unity

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
for coming on the show tonight, thank you for all of you

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000
