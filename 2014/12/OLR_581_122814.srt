This week brings 2014 to a close as we discuss the holiday events and look back with our annual year of gaming retrospective. We'd also like to hear what games you've played most this year, new, old, or revisited. We'll take your comments and calls to help us close out 2014 right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight on December the 28th of 2014 with the 581st episode of our show. That's right, we're here.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I know a lot of folks are taking off for the holidays and to be fair they earned it, but the way the days fell this year we were able to bring you a show this week. So why not? We're here tonight. Myself, Rob Robertson, here in studio with me. As always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hi. How are you? Full. Full? Yes, we did a little bit of our belated Christmas tradition this year. Our Gay Jumis.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So for the past couple years, DarkSakura, myself, and Alan on Christmas will go have Chinese food. Or Pho. We'll have some in Asian. Whatever's open, people. Whatever's open, we will go have it. But DarkSakura ended up, even though our Christmas plans got canceled. Can you believe that?

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Like, I know as a kid your parents always threatened to cancel Christmas if you're naughty, but Alan and I actually had a canceled Christmas this year. No Christmas for you. No Christmas. I don't feel too bad, guys. We made the most of it. I worked.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, I know. You don't want to talk about Christmas being canceled. But you're Jewish, so, I mean, what's the big deal, right? Jews like Christmas. Why not?

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No, um, LoCat was open because of people getting their shiny new toys. Sure, of course. And there are a lot of hardworking people on Christmas. And they fed us. And it was slow. So it was awesome.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We took Shane, who is having his first Christmas not with his family. So we took him to the movies. Really, it was taking me to the movies because finally I got to see Mockingjay. Finally. I want to go. I'll go again. It was so good.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I still need to watch the other movies, but I've read the books. I was not expecting Mockingjay to be that good because it's the worst book. But the movie was really good. So, yay! Yes, there's that.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, um, but you're not, now, even though you're Jewish and we talk about celebrating Christmas together, you're not one of those Jewish folks that gets super offended like that guy on that plane did in the news.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's not you.

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I just don't like to, I will, I had a few people antsy with me and say, well, I'd say, well, happy holidays and say, well, Merry Christmas. I'll be like to you too.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But honestly, I, I spoke with a good number of perfectly nice Jewish people and I wish them a happy post Hanukkah and nobody was fussy. It was really nice.

18
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My mom didn't preach at me this year. Um, but I would like to just say that I want my family members to stop having strokes, heart attacks, jaundice, or other inflammations of their internal organs that send them to the hospital because no.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You poor thing. I mean, families should be together during the holidays to fight as good families do. That's what happens.

20
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Not in the hospital.

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:50,000
All right. Anyhow. Well, um, I, I, we're looking at the turning of a new page, uh, coming up here in the new week, a happy new year in advance to everybody out there. Everybody celebrates new years, right?

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, I guess, no, in some cultures, your new years might come a little later, but with all due respect, I hope everybody has a happy new year this next week and looks forward to the page turn that's coming.

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And tonight here on OLR, we're going to look back on, uh, 2014 and next week we'll do a little more looking ahead 2015. Uh, but we couldn't do it without the one and only also joining us as studio tech master.

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Loki. Hello. How are you doing? Loki. I'm pretty good. Yeah. How was your holiday? You guys do celebrate Christmas even though your wife is Jewish, right? So you kind of do, you could do both. You do everything this holiday, right?

25
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Pretty much. Yeah. Nice. That's the way to do it. How was it? Um, it was okay. We just, you know, I had to put together a trampoline then Christmas Eve.

26
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What was up with that? I saw these pictures on Facebook. This, this like, it looks like a prison. It looks like a prison for children that you send them to and they're naughty, but that's not what it was. Right?

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's just a safe trampoline. It's a happy prison. It's a fun prison. It's a bouncy prison. Exactly.

28
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But so, so that's what they do now. They put trample, they put cages on trampolines to make sure the kids don't bounce out. Yeah. So you don't, you know, die or something. Oh my gosh. See, when I was younger, we had a trampoline.

29
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:15,000
My mom bought a little trampoline because I don't know, back in that day it was supposed to be good for fitness or something like that. I guess maybe it still is, but, uh, we had a little trampoline and the way I learned not to jump off the trampoline is that the first time I did it, I hurt myself.

30
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That taught me to never do it again. It doesn't work that way these days, huh? Um, no, I mean, and they don't even have like springs anymore. It's all, um, like nylon cords that they have and stuff.

31
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So, but it's just a pain in the ass because their instructions aren't entirely clear. And so, you know, they don't stress like the importance of, okay, hey, you know, make sure that this doesn't shift slightly while you're putting it together because you'll end up with what happened the first time around where,

32
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I got it all put together and look, hey, look, the door shifted slightly to where now it's right in front of a pole. I'm like, thanks. I had to take it all apart and do it again.

33
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Is that how, like when I build the new shelf from Ikea, I realized that one of the wood pieces I put on backwards and now you have the unsightly side facing outwards is like, son of a, so I guess it's similar type of thing, right?

34
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But I'm sure, uh, I'm sure the kids loved it traveling. Yeah. Josh loves it. So he's been playing that. And then, um, you know, other than that, um, I only went over to my mom's house and they did, you know, kind of Christmas there and stuff and got more toys and pretty much it.

35
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
All right. Well, uh, how are you guys doing in our chat room? Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network www.vog network.com vognetwork.com.

36
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Uh, six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern is when we are alive on Sunday nights immediately following the Bobby Blackwell show and a quick programming note for you guys.

37
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Uh, Bobby was, uh, had a prerecorded show tonight because, uh, as you guys know, if you've listened to the show, he does this whole, um, he does this whole thing with the NFL and, and drumming for his local team, uh, the Falcons.

38
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So they actually had a game tonight, uh, that kind of came out of the blue. So he had a, well, they can flex game. I don't even know how this all works because I follow football so terribly, but I guess they can change the schedule of games at the last minutes to accommodate probably what's on TV and all that stuff.

39
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So, uh, they did that. So he ended up having to pre tape a show tonight, so he wasn't live and he was a little worried that, uh, they, he wasn't going to be live next week, but the good news is the Falcons lost.

40
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So he will be live next week. Um, but I suppose the bad news for some people would also be the Falcons lost. And maybe that, maybe that's actually bad news for Bobby because that might be like he wouldn't get paid for a game that doesn't happen.

41
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So I guess, I guess that's too bad. So, uh, sorry to hear about the Falcons, but hey, if you are a Carolina Panthers fan, then you're having a great day. So, um, happy day to you of, of the football sports ball variety.

42
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm glad you sported harder.

43
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm glad you all sported very well. And if you're Bobby, I'm glad you were out there banging the drum all day. That's, that's what a lot of us aspire to do there.

44
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Uh, let's see over at our chat room, over at live.vognetwork.com, Tiger Claus says, since this is the last OLR of 2014, I'm sure you guys have a lot to look forward to in 2015.

45
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know, we will be doing predictions and all of that next week because we anticipate this is going to be a slow week for news as well coming up.

46
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So we will do all of our predictions and also we're going to look back at what did we predict in 2014 that hilariously didn't come true.

47
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And we're going to take a look back next week because technically there are still three days for something to happen.

48
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So, you know, a lot can happen in three days. So, uh, we'll be taking a look back next week, but we will look back on 2014 a little bit this week with as far as, uh, what were our favorite games of the year and what were your favorite games of the year.

49
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We'll be getting to that a little bit later.

50
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Raginator schooling me a little bit in our chat room saying, not all New Year's celebrations coincide at the same time because not all cultures and religions use the same calendar.

51
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That is true. That is true. So my bad if I misspoke there a little bit, but I would think most people are celebrating the change of the calendar that's coming up.

52
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If nothing else, it's the one that impacts your work week. So there's something in there and paydays and all that stuff.

53
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Uh, Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room also, uh, saying I had to work Christmas Day. Didn't get a single damn tech call all day.

54
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh my gosh. Can you imagine like you, you have to work Christmas, you don't get a single customer all day long.

55
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That would be, that would be great and that would be bad all at the same time.

56
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And, uh, Tigerclaw summarizing the Black Wolf news there saying that's good news for the listeners, but bad news for Black Wolf. Yeah, pretty much, pretty much.

57
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So, uh, I'm sure he did his very best and the reason why the Falcons lost had nothing to do with the drummers. I'm sure the drummers did just fine.

58
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Alright, anyway, um, I guess, honestly, I don't have all, we're going to have a weird show tonight.

59
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I mean, I fully admit that upfront because it was a very slow news week.

60
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Um, no matter what it is you celebrate this time of year, the fact of the matter is most offices are closed on Thursday,

61
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
except, you know, those that expect customer relations and so forth.

62
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But certainly the video game developers were pretty much, for the most part, all closed on Thursday.

63
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Most of them Wednesday as well. So it kind of just makes, makes us that everybody was gone the majority of the week.

64
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So we only have a very few things to report on this week. So I don't even have really a kickoff topic for you guys.

65
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Um, but we will later on, uh, in part B, we are going to get into our top three games of 2014.

66
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And the key word there is our top three games of 2014 because this time of year everybody likes to bitch and whine

67
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and moan and complain about, I can't believe so and so picked XYZ as their top game of the year.

68
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And I think especially this year, um, there's a lot, it's very diverse this year.

69
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's not really a clear front runner for a lot of people what's going to sweep the board for most people's games of the year.

70
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Sure. Would you, Loki, would you kind of say you're noticing that to be the case too?

71
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There really doesn't seem to be a front runner this year like there has been in years past.

72
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know. That might be for some people.

73
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

74
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You know, there's, there's been some good releases this year.

75
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sure, of course. But I think there's been enough strong ones where, uh, like everybody's picking something different, you know?

76
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah.

77
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I mean, you could say Dragon Age Inquisition is somewhat of an early front runner based on this, based on the video game awards.

78
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I mean, it did win that, but that's, again, one award show out of how many.

79
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So tonight we're going to be doing our top three games and, uh, they are not incorrect.

80
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Our lists are correct. You know why? Because they're our lists.

81
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And then we're going to open up our Skype line a little early tonight to invite you to call in to share your lists and, most importantly, why.

82
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So I'll be giving more information on that when we get into part B a little later.

83
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
For now on the, uh, for now though, let's get into our gaming weeks and what types of games have you been playing this week with, with, uh, the time off work or the adjusted schedules as a circumstance may be.

84
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What have you been playing with your week? Dark Sakura?

85
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I've been staring at Bald Elves.

86
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Bald Elves?

87
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Bald Elves.

88
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What game is that?

89
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Dragon Age.

90
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Oh, right. Of course. Of course.

91
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Because I take solace in every party in more ways than one.

92
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you romancing solace of all people?

93
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, I am.

94
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Why?

95
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Not the one I would have picked.

96
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He makes the most sense. He's actually probably my favorite of the characters in the game.

97
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sarah is pissing me off, so I've decided not to romance her in my second playthrough.

98
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
My headcanon is forever solace.

99
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's all right. I wouldn't romance Garrus in Mass Effect either and that's, you know.

100
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, they're two different kinds of characters.

101
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They are.

102
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'd say that the Dragon Age character that probably would correspond most to Garrus would probably be Cullen.

103
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They're a lot more alike.

104
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I actually would romance Cullen, but he's not an option for a male character, so I can't.

105
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But, um, I've actually been having, I've decided what it is about solace that I like.

106
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, why other people don't like him and why I do is because he reminds me of other aspies.

107
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, interesting.

108
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Very single-minded focus.

109
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Little bit of being too blunt in public and a little bit too of a know-it-all, you know what I mean?

110
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Not necessarily a know-it-all, but being very knowledgeable, trying to be helpful about it,

111
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but to the point that it comes off as being a know-it-all and that's a very aspie trait.

112
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So, and it's just really kind of hit a resonating familiarity with me.

113
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Was that intentional about, because I really don't know, was that like an intentional parallel on Bioware's part?

114
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Because I know Bioware has tried very hard to kind of diversify their games.

115
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I mean, is that another sign of diversification in a Bioware title?

116
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't know, honestly. I mean, I would have to ask, you know, the writers, but it's just the impression that I get.

117
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And I've noticed that everything that people complain about him about are the same things that they complain about male aspies I know.

118
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Interesting.

119
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So it's just, it was sort of like the parallels came together and I was like, well, that's probably why I like the character so much because I find him more relatable.

120
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But I mean, you know, just all the things that people don't like him for are the same complaints that people have about, you know, the people with Asperger's.

121
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Right, right.

122
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So I have, I don't, and I wasn't even thinking about it when I first decided to go to him. I was like, ooh, hot balled elf.

123
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Sure. What an interesting, neat little thing to pull out of a game though. I mean, who would have thought a video game shows us that type of, you know, diversity within characters. That's so cool.

124
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And, um, I've been getting back a little bit more into fractal again because I super love fractal, uh, played some transistor and I played it on a Mac.

125
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Um, that's okay. Nobody's perfect.

126
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You know what?

127
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

128
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't, don't listen to him, baby. You're so pretty. You're pretty and shiny and you and faster than all those other things as I pet my Mac.

129
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Um, and, uh, I played a little smash on my, uh, 3DS.

130
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Nice. Who's your go-to character in smash? Do you have one?

131
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Villager.

132
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Villager. You know, mine is surprisingly.

133
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wii Fit Trainer.

134
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I love Wii Fit Trainer. I do, and I am totally the guy that will stand in the back and do the, you know, uh, what does he say? Stand the sun, or what does he say the sun?

135
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sun salutation?

136
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Sun of the suns. Damn it. I can't even remember what he says. But he fires that bolt like over and over and over again. I stand in the corner and do that the whole match. And then I do little hula hooping thing.

137
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And then everyone looks at you and goes, gee bitch.

138
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I know, pretty much. Cause that's me and Ness. PK fire, PK fire, PK fire.

139
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Uh, but, but I am really surprised. This is the character that I find that I play a lot and I'm, I, I'm not good at smash. I'm fucking terrible at smash actually.

140
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But the one I'm actually okay with? Pac-Man. Of all characters. Like I really enjoy playing Pac-Man and I think I'm getting pretty decent with him. Like I'm really learning about how to like use the hydrant effectively and, and kind of, you know, using the spins of the different Namco symbols to, you know, kind of store a key at all times.

141
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And most importantly, I'm really learning about how to control him because my biggest problem in smash is that I suicide off the edge way more times than I would care to admit.

142
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And that's why I like Wii Fit Trainer cause I can hula hoop out of a crappy situation if I'm stupid.

143
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Kirby was my go to for the longest time.

144
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh yeah. Cause he can, you know, kind of float around, right?

145
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Yeah. Kirby was like my long time that, and it was kind of funny just, uh, consuming other people and pooping them out.

146
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Um, but, uh, I did a little bit of that and I've been, um, what was the other thing that I was doing? Cause I was playing something else and I got new games thanks to Loki and thanks to you.

147
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yeah. We all kind of did, we all ended up trading steam games pretty much for the holidays this year.

148
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I have gauntlet and I am bread and go to sleep. I think it was called?

149
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Among the sleep.

150
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Among the sleep. Yeah. Where you play as a toddler is a survival horror game featuring a toddler.

151
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
And I was like, okay, the concept is just really cool.

152
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've heard of that. I haven't. Oh, I want to play that. That looks, that sounds awesome.

153
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah. It's been on my list for a few weeks. So now I've got it.

154
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Um, let's see. Uh, actually, thanks. I, I, I got my final fantasy on in a bit. I must be a final fantasy fan boy or something because dark soccer gets me final fantasy three and final fantasy eight along with La Mulana.

155
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But you know, the final fantasy games there. Right. And then Loki gets me final fantasy 13 too.

156
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So I, I, I now have a copy of every final fantasy game that's out on steam and yes, I will.

157
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I got you La Mulana cause it was $2.

158
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I will.

159
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're worth $2.

160
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I am worth $2. Thank you. Not much more, but I am worth $2.

161
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But, uh, and, and, uh, final fantasy eight, even that I will play, even though you all know that I think it's one of the absolute worst games in the series.

162
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In fact, I think, and I am not a popular man for this. I will probably get hate mail because of this, but I say, I don't give a fuck.

163
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You can, you can send the hate mail all you want, but that draws on the one that reads it, that draw junction thing was the worst thing ever and single handedly ruined the game.

164
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Uh, but final fantasy eight, which had no case story otherwise, uh, was my least favorite, but I understand one of my favorite scenes, but the PC version allows you to cheese it and just draw 99 spells every time I hear.

165
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So that might make the game a lot more tolerable. So we'll see. I like cheesing the games. I'm gonna, I know, I know.

166
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I loved the ballroom scene in that game. That was so pretty. And it had a good ending.

167
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The story, the story was really good. And so I understand why the haters come at me. I totally get it because the story is really good. I will give the game that.

168
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But I, I, I, I believe the battle system's broken. Not everybody agrees with me in that. That's fine. Uh, I just didn't like the game for those reasons.

169
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So the game itself.

170
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I enjoyed the story, but the game wasn't all that great.

171
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah. I'm surprised I haven't brought 12 out to like PC.

172
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Me too. That's the one, like, and there's a lot of people like sitting on pins and needles. I think it's not just me that are like, okay, okay. Square.

173
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So you're, you're doing a remake of 10 and okay. Uh, you, you did 13 on PC. Okay. And you've done four or five, six on the phone.

174
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Now you did seven on PlayStation four TV. Where's 12 show 12.

175
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
They do like the DS one as well. Remember there was a DS 12.

176
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah. The side story, the revenue wings. Yeah, there was technically that's a, that's like a side story. Like I guess you could say like a 10, two or, but not even, it's even more like spinoff than that.

177
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's not totally, it's, it's different. That's all I can really say.

178
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But what's interesting, and a lot of people don't realize this, I didn't even realize this, a lot of the team that worked on 12 are the people that are working on 14.

179
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And I only learned that when I went to final fantasy fan fest. And for the longest time, I was convinced that 14 was set in Ivalice.

180
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And that was going to be a big reveal, even though everybody was like, no, Rob, you're stupid. And eventually, finally they, they kind of said, no, it's not going to be an Ivalice game.

181
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And they, they did a fun little, uh, uh, thing talking about the new race. That's going to be a fantasy 14 and they were teasing that it might be the Viera, but then they said no, because they couldn't, they couldn't make male Viera work.

182
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Just like they couldn't make the female lizard people, the bongra, I think they were called. They couldn't make the female versus them works. They didn't do either one of those.

183
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Uh, so that's why they're getting this new race that our raw or whatever it's called.

184
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why couldn't they just do a race that was like, or like just do one, like remember in 11 where they had, you know, uh, the Mithra were only, uh, female and the Galco were only male.

185
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Why couldn't they do that?

186
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I would have been okay with that totally because I totally think the Viera should be in 14, but I also understand the team's desire to want to do something different.

187
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So, and the our, I look really cool, so I'm okay with it. I'm, I'm, I'm okay with what they're doing. The new classes look hot, not to turn this into a 14 cast, but it's a game I play a lot. Sorry, not sorry.

188
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The dark knight looks great, even if they made it a tank. Uh, the astrologer looks awesome. It's a healer that's going to use cards and that looks really cool.

189
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Uh, and it's kind of a throwback to the tactics games because, uh, the astrologers was a class in that as were the machinists, the DPS class are going to be the new DPS class in the game.

190
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So you notice a lot of the tactics into 12 now into 14 influence. So it is kind of surprising they don't do, you know, they don't go back or revisit 12, but I guess maybe it's because a lot of the team works on 14.

191
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But I was going to say, they mentioned at fan fest, uh, that the enemy system in 14 runs on the gambit system from 12. So that's why enemies will do things at certain percentages and stuff is because they all run off the gambit system from final fantasy 12.

192
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So I, uh, I think that's a pretty neat. So anyway, sorry, dark Sakura, as always, I derailed your gaming week into a final fantasy wankathon, but, uh, did you have anything else you want to share?

193
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I was done. I started reading fanfics. Okay. You're not kidding though. I think, I don't think you are kidding over there.

194
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, I'm actually looking at the other stories that have up for the day. Oh, fair enough. Prepping a little bit. All right. Well, while you prep, let's go over to Loki and Loki. How was your gaming week?

195
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Um, I didn't play a whole ton and I was actually trying to work on my fog jam entry, which I ended up scrapping on, uh, Thursday, I think.

196
00:22:42,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Basically my original concept was a little bit too elaborate and it had like some spider robot things in there and I was trying to animate the legs procedurally so that like if it was next to a wall or something like it would put the legs up on the wall and be able to like climb up the wall realistically.

197
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:10,000
And I was like, why the hell am I spending four days on this? I'm going to, this is just dumb. I'm going to scrap that. If basically gave myself a deadline, I'm like, I don't want to waste a ton of time on this.

198
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So if I can't figure this out by, you know, this day, then I'm just going to say the hell with it. I'm going to do something else with that. And actually ended up scrapping the whole, whole game idea because, um, I came up with something better.

199
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So, um, try to work on that now. And then, um, what else did I do? Oh, I did play a little bit of, uh, Lego Marvel superheroes because my son wanted to play that. I just checked the other day. I have like 50 hours in that game. It's ridiculous.

200
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But, um, I'm noticing it is quite a buggy game itself. It's just like, um, you know, characters getting stuck in places. We actually know something funny that they had like a node for the, um, yeah, the Lego characters just kind of walking around the city place in the wrong spot.

201
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And so like right under this tree, they just kind of jump up into the air, like really high and then come back down. And it just doesn't make any sense, but it's kind of funny.

202
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Um, so I think I'm, I looked at it, I think I'm like 75% down at the game now. I'm just, I can't convince my son to go into the actual levels with me so I can just finish the rest of it. So I had to play it on my own in order to do that.

203
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But, um, so I was just doing that and, uh, I have pretty much all the characters unlocked already. I just have a few more missions to do.

204
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Um, I bought stuff. I was trying to buy Battlefield 4 because it was on sale so I got that for 14 bucks on PlayStation 4 and at the same time I figured I'd just buy Peggle 2, aside from that.

205
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And, um, I don't know if I bought anything on Steam or not. I know I got Steam games and, uh, I was gonna buy that, was it, that one, um, there's a game on Steam right now, it's like 9 cents.

206
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So, go pick it up, cause it's 9 cents. I mean, 91% off, so you gotta check it out.

207
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Um, but that's it. It's just mostly working on, you know, my game. Hopefully I'll have something to show for it and fortunately, like I said, I had that kind of restarted, but, um, I like the new concept better than the old one.

208
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, I already told you guys what it was, so.

209
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Well, thank you for reminding me to remind the listeners about the video game jam that we're doing, or the VOG jam, uh, that kicked off last week and if you missed last week's show, the theme was decided to be a buggy game.

210
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And you can interpret that many different ways and we're not here to tell you what is the right or wrong answer. You just take that theme, a buggy game, and create something, dammit.

211
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Um, create a game if you are so inclined. There's tons of game makers out there. Loki's very much into Unity right now.

212
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Uh, we had the Cooking with Unity guys on a couple weeks ago, uh, to kind of help motivate, uh, motivate all of us, really, and that was a great, uh, it was a great conversation.

213
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I think it really did motivate Loki, uh, especially, and it motivated me a little bit, too, actually.

214
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Um, so, uh, you can make something, uh, a complete new game. There's lots of other, like, RPG maker and other, like, games that facilitate game creation are out there.

215
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Make a level in LittleBigPlanet. Make, uh, just create something, um, out of that theme, a buggy game, and, uh, I'm working on something, too.

216
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Uh, from the programming aspect, I haven't even scratched the surface, but I have, I know what I want to do.

217
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Um, and I did go down the route of, and I'm trying to keep mine a little bit secretive, because if I can pull off what I want to pull off, I think it's really gonna surprise some people.

218
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So, I'm really, I told Loki what it is, and, uh, I-

219
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It should be very doable. It's only that difficult.

220
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I do, too. I'm keeping it, I, I kind of thought in the back of my head about why YR, when he made Pixel Shits, and he was just like, you know what? Simple.

221
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Simple, simple, simple. And I hear Bobby in the back of my head, don't overdo it on your first game. Don't be like Loki, you know, trying to do everything in your first game.

222
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So, I have a stupid, simple idea. It's honestly probably been done somewhere before, but it hasn't been done by me, so I'm gonna do it.

223
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So, uh, that's, that's where I'm at with the VoG Jam. I'm just hoping I can do it in two weeks, because it's a lot to learn in two weeks.

224
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll be able to do it. It's, it won't be that hard.

225
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Alright, I'm hoping. Fingers crossed.

226
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Okay, so anyway, all that's- but, don't expect me to talk a lot about it, just because I'm me, and I'm choosing to keep mine a little bit more of a secret.

227
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But, other people are sharing what they're doing on the forums. In fact, Darkdead Studio posted an update today, and I was like, oh shit, he's way further along than I am.

228
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
He's got, like, pictures of spaceships, and enemies and all that shit.

229
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
And I do want to talk about what I, what I want to do, but the problem, I mean, I guess we can, because, yeah, sure.

230
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah, go for it.

231
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:41,000
So, my original concept was actually, is completely different than what I'm doing now, because it was going to be like this, kind of like Tower of Guns, roguelike type game, where it's a first person shooter action thing.

232
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm like, okay, well that's, sounds really cool, but it's too fucking hard for me to do, so I scrapped that.

233
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So the new idea came to me from a couple things.

234
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:03,000
One, I was watching some videos with my son about, from the Reddit thread Shitty Robots, and so it's just robots that are just fucked up, and just, they don't do what they're supposed to do, and it's hilarious.

235
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And so they had this thing, was it HeboCon or something like that, where these people, they basically picked, like, 30 people or whatever, make robots, and these people don't know what the fuck they're doing.

236
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And that's the whole point, is it's supposed to be really shitty robots battling each other.

237
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And that didn't really give me the idea for the game, so it's not going to be about robots or anything, but my son, like, watching these robots made out of, like, McDonald's fry boxes or whatever, and it had this, like, stick thing, and it was kind of crawling along the ground and stuff, and it looked so silly because it was just stupid.

238
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
So, from that, for some reason I went, I'm going to make a racing game, but I want to make a really terrible racing game.

239
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
So, what's the most terrible racing game out there? Big Rigs Over the Road Racing.

240
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's the absolute worst racing game, period, because everything is broken in it. Everything is broken in it. There's no physics, everything's all fucked up.

241
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So my idea was, I'm going to make a racing game, and every level, something different is fucked up, and it keeps getting more and more fucked up in different ways.

242
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But the best part about it is, each time, basically there's an update to the game. It's like, okay, update, downloading the patch and stuff.

243
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Every few levels there'll be a screenshot of, like, a fake Twitter social media type thing of them apologizing, you know, that the game is buggy or something like that, but in hilarious ways.

244
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Some of the ideas I had was, let's see here, one of the first levels, you'll have square wheels for some reason. Another one.

245
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
We didn't know how to render the wheels. We apologize for the wheel rendering, Buck.

246
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
There's one that you can't turn left. It's just stuck right. You can only turn right.

247
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I love it.

248
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:00,000
One that's like, literally, like a marble maze thing. Your car actually doesn't move, but you can tilt the level, you know, and stuff like that.

249
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Okay, I got one. I got one. I got one. One, we're just partway through the race. Your car just fucking falls onto another racetrack that you already did earlier in the game.

250
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Like, without explanation, it just fucking falls to the level.

251
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's gonna be like weird glitchy shit that's just not gonna make any sense, but that's the whole point of it, is it's supposed to be, you know, each time they patch the game, they kind of break something else in the process.

252
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Okay, all I'll say about my game, now I gotta say something about my game. All I will say is, the reason why I'm not talking about it is so that I can switch it at the last minute.

253
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
No, that's fine.

254
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:43,000
It's a game you've all played or you've all heard of, only I'm reversing it. That's all I'm gonna say.

255
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Okay, so, my gaming week. A lot of the same old standbys. Final Fantasy XIV, of course, been playing ample amounts of that, and XIII on PC, because I still love the PC remake of that.

256
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And I unlocked Fang, finally, as a playable character in XIII, because you don't get her until like seven chapters into the story.

257
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
That made me excited, because she's my favorite character in XIII.

258
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:18,000
But I have played a few new games. Thanks to Loki, he gifted me a copy of the game L.O.V.E., or Love, but I think it's actually L.O.V.E., some type of acronym.

259
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
But this is on Steam.

260
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Yeah, it looks awesome.

261
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's called Love, and it's one of those like, retro-esque, very simple, like, do nothing but jump type of games.

262
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Like, when Alan saw me playing it over my shoulder, he's like, oh, is that VVVVV? It kind of has like that type of look to it, but it's got the really cool chiptunes in the background.

263
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And here's the catch on this game, is that you can set your respawn point anywhere you want.

264
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So you have to kind of remember every time you clear one little area to set your respawn point, or you're going to end up having to go back a long ways.

265
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And I imagine what happens later on in the game is there comes like choices and probably pathing, and they just haven't probably got that far later in the game.

266
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
But I imagine there comes a point where you might not want to set your respawn point every five seconds.

267
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
That could actually be a bad thing.

268
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But I have seen parts of the game where if you set your respawn point way up here, and you fall down earlier into the level, is it faster to just suicide and respawn than it is to run all the way back to where you were at?

269
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And in the normal mode of the game, you're limited to 100 lives, so you have to kind of make that choice.

270
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
So maybe in that regard, it's a little closer to 1,001 spikes, which I think a lot of you guys checked out this year.

271
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So yeah, that game's neat. I like Lego. I'm sorry, I'm reading the chat room as well, or you guys are talking about Lego Batman and Lego Marvel.

272
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But I'm liking Love so far. That game's cool.

273
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The other game I've played quite a bit of this week, and I am actually really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.

274
00:32:50,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't usually go online and read reviews and read what other people think quite often, because I find that a lot of the professional critics are a little bit jaded.

275
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And sometimes I don't always agree with them. And this would have been a great example of that, because from what I understand, this game is not being very ravely reviewed.

276
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But I think this game is great, and I'm having an amazing time with Gauntlet 2014. That's right, the new Gauntlet remake that just came out.

277
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It was on Steam sale, down to about 10 bucks from 20 the other day, so I was like, what the hell, I'll finally get a copy.

278
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And what I knew of the new Gauntlet is that it was going to be like the old Gauntlet, but they say it's a little more like Diablo.

279
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Believe me, I've been playing a lot of Diablo lately. A lot. Especially this week, because they're doing the double XP this weekend.

280
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So Alan and I have been playing a lot on our seasonal characters. He just hit Paragon 100, so we've been playing a lot of Diablo 3.

281
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I actually don't think Gauntlet is that much Diablo as a lot of people think it is. I think it's just because Diablo is a very modern-day dungeon crawler, so it's very easy to make that comparison.

282
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:07,000
But Gauntlet plays like Gauntlet. That's right, it plays a lot like the old game, but in this new, you know, using a lot of the new tricks you see in games.

283
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Each character has different move sets, and what's kind of neat is that the elf turns into a twin-stick shooter, because the right stick will just shoot arrows wherever you want on the screen.

284
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:27,000
The wizard turns into a character from Magica, where hitting the buttons in certain combinations will cast different types of spells, which is really neat.

285
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And then the wizard is a little more traditionally what you'd expect in Gauntlet, or did I say the wizard? The warrior is a little more what you'd expect in traditional Gauntlet, with the sword and everything.

286
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
And then the Valkyrie is similar, but with the more defensive-type maneuvers, where she can shield bash people and stuff.

287
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And they, you know, they tried to flesh out the little characters more and give them depth, but it's a fun little dungeon crawler, and it's very hard.

288
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Which, you know, the original Gauntlet was not an easy game either. So I like that you play through the levels, and depending on how many pots you smash, how many enemies you kill, or even how many times you died in a level,

289
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:10,000
you'll get buffs that will help you for the next time. So it's like you're perpetually unlocking these achievements that, like, let's say you smash pots.

290
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Well, the more pots you smash, the higher percentage that the pots you smash later on will have gold in them.

291
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So, like, you build these achievements that then impact your game, and it kind of gives you that incentive to play those levels over and over again.

292
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So I was really digging Gauntlet more than I thought I would. I kind of thought it would be one of those games where I play a couple times, and I'm like, eh, whatever, and then move on.

293
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
But I'm talking, like, it's one of my favorite games, like, that I've played recently. Good.

294
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So I ended up getting a four-pack, and I gave a copy to Dark Soccer and Loki, so I'm hoping they'll get a chance to check it out at some point too.

295
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I have yet to play the game online, and I can only imagine that when you bring everybody's talents into it, where, you know, everybody's diverse, like with the elf having to kind of stand back and do his arrows or what have you, and the warrior can kind of get up in there and soak in the Valkyrie.

296
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I imagine that really changes the dynamic of how you clear levels. So I'm excited to check that out.

297
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So yeah, Gauntlet is pretty cool. I enjoyed that quite a bit. So I'm very happy about how that one turned out.

298
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So there you go. That's pretty much all the new stuff I've been playing this week between Love and Gauntlet, but I have even more games in the coming weeks to catch up on.

299
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I just bought Shovel Knight today on PC, which I already played on Wii U, and I already, you know, love that game. It really is one of the year's best.

300
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:39,000
But I just decided, you know what, I'm going to get it on PC, because I saw they've been doing updates on PC, and it's just like, all right, this game's so good, and for $10, what the hell? What the hell? I'll get it on PC as well.

301
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
All right, let's get into some news for tonight, but before we get to the news, some quick housekeeping.

302
00:36:46,000 --> 00:37:01,000
We will be here next week, and next week we'll be doing our prediction show, but we will not be here the week of Martin Luther King weekend, which is, not on my calendar in front of me, but it is January 18th, I believe is the day.

303
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:12,000
January 18th, we will not be here that week. We might tape something in advance. We will not be here live January 18th. I will be in Seattle with Alan. We're going on a late holiday trip.

304
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Since I had to work over the holidays, I took some time off a little later, so we're going to go to Seattle. It'll be fun. Can't wait.

305
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
All right, let's go around and do some gaming news tonight. Loki, we'll start with you.

306
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Okay, so as many people are probably aware, the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network were kind of down during the holidays, and it wasn't because tons of people were opening their new systems on Christmas morning and trying to do their updates, but rather that there was actually a DDS attack happening on both of those services.

307
00:37:43,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I guess it happened starting late December 24th, and I believe both services are back online now. I know PlayStation Network just came up completely, I think, today, but that kind of sucked.

308
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And of course, both services were quite aware of what was going on, and if I remember correctly, I'm trying to remember who was actually behind it. I think it was the Lizard something? I don't remember the name of the group, if you will.

309
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, and why give them attention? Who cares what their name is?

310
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I did think it was funny, though, seeing posts like that.

311
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm going to call them Jizzmasters. That's it. The Jizzmasters did it.

312
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Lizard Squad. That's what it was, okay. But I did find it funny that Anonymous, I guess, was kind of fighting back against their botnets or whatever, and kind of taking down their botnets at the same time, so it was interesting.

313
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But yeah, thankfully, the only thing that really affected for me is I couldn't buy the games I wanted to at the time I wanted to.

314
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So everybody's shouting the name in chat because you couldn't remember it at first, but I need a tangent for a minute because this is what really bothers me about the whole thing.

315
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Why are the Jizzmasters doing this over the holiday season? Why are they doing this? Because, I mean, and they might say, oh, it's for the lolz or whatever. Isn't that the whole common trait? Why do hackers do what they do for the lolz?

316
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That, to me, says for attention. They want attention. That's the only reason they do this. Otherwise, why would you claim responsibility in the first place?

317
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:38,000
If you don't want attention, then you don't claim responsibility. And usually, it's to bring attention to some sort of cause. Maybe some sort of extremist cause, like maybe what's happening with the whole Sony Pictures hacks and all that stuff.

318
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Maybe. I don't know. Usually, there's some type of cause. But in the absence of that, if it's quote-unquote for the lolz, then that just tells me it's attention.

319
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:57,000
They're doing it to get attention. They want everybody to see that they wield the power and they will happily shut down whatever networks they want as they so please, yada, yada, yada.

320
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So every time you tweet their name and every time I see it trending on Twitter that the jizzmasters, you know, are in the top ten on Twitter and so forth, I just shudder because they are getting what they want.

321
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And that's why they will continue to do all this crap until eventually, and this is the way it will always go down, eventually, one of them will turn on another to get more attention and then they all turn on each other and stab each other in the back and the whole thing topples down.

322
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Look at what happened to, there was a group about a year ago, it was very, they weren't shutting down PlayStation and all that stuff, but they were doing all these extreme hackings and so forth.

323
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
And what happened? One guy turned on all the others, right? Isn't that what happened?

324
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
LulzSec, I think.

325
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
That's what it was. And there was one guy that turned, like the FBI caught one guy and got him to rat out all the others. Isn't that the deal? Something like that?

326
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Something like that.

327
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That's what will happen here inevitably too. And so, you know, a lot of guys, what's taking so long? Why isn't this getting shut down?

328
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Well, probably, you know, our government can be kind of slow sometimes. I don't know if you all noticed, but if you ever try to see like how a law gets passed and so forth, it takes a very long time.

329
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:10,000
So for all you know, they're already infiltrated and we're just waiting for everybody to get caught. I mean, that's, you know, we'll see what happens. But anyway.

330
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I just had to get on tangent. I just stop saying their name, stop, stop contributing to them trending on Twitter because they're using your tiers as lubricant.

331
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I mean, that's what goes on in these people's minds. Really. I mean, really. So pretty much. Please think. Anyway.

332
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So yeah. So the servers are dead. So no PlayStation or Xbox for people on Christmas Day. So if you're that 9, 10-year-old kid, mommy, mommy, daddy, daddy, all I want for Christmas is an Xbox One.

333
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And then you get one, you can't even play it online. That's like way to be a buzzkill. Now, of course, there are two sides of it.

334
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And that could be as well as if Microsoft and Sony know that they are going to be the target of attacks, then why are they better prepared for shit like this?

335
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Especially Sony right now. I mean, I'm not even talking about the Sony pictures hack, which is still kind of a thing.

336
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But even after the shit that they went through three years ago, let us not forget, when, you know, actual account information was stolen, credit card information was taken and so forth, you would think that Sony would be a little better prepared for this type of stuff.

337
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Now, I don't profess to know all the technical workings about dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. But I mean, can't Sony arm themselves a little better against an attack like this? Loki?

338
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I would think that they would be able to, but I don't know. I don't really know. Once again, I'm not sure how that stuff works. So, don't know.

339
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Let's see. Dungeon Buster in chat says, FBI is already investigating one of them, but he's in Finland. They can refuse extradition. And then don't get worked up over this. It's nothing. Pay it zero attention. I did.

340
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Well, I say don't say their name. That's, anyway, whatever. Let's see. And then Tiger Claw says, I think somebody from the Jizzmasters got interviewed and they said the reason they did it was to prove a point that Xbox Live and PlayStation Network have crappy security.

341
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:33,000
There's other ways to prove that point than shutting the networks down on Christmas Day, I would think. I mean, there's other ways to do it. And aren't the people that are trying to, I mean, God, it's like a fucking soap opera.

342
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Like, aren't the people that are trying to attack the Jizzmasters in turn, like the good guys, quote, unquote, aren't they trying to help Sony and Microsoft kind of better their security? Aren't they, like, sending that type of information over?

343
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I don't know.

344
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That's what I thought I was hearing.

345
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Maybe. Who knows?

346
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Such a bit. These are the, these are the sands to the hourglass, like the days of our hacking lives.

347
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:06,000
It's just like, once again, you know, even with Anonymous and stuff, there's no organization to it. So you could have people that could be part of Anonymous or say that they're part of Anonymous and then they're in their own little group and it doesn't matter.

348
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
If an organization like that had a head, it'd be easier to take down.

349
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Well, yeah. And if you said you were part of Anonymous and you're not really Anonymous, are you?

350
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I mean, isn't that the trick? Isn't that, isn't that the thing? I thought that's how it works.

351
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Well, you're still Anonymous.

352
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
But you're not, because you just said, you said I'm with them. But, but okay. Well, I thought the thing was you're supposed to, it's in the name. You stay Anonymous, right?

353
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Well, you don't know who they are, so they're technically Anonymous.

354
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm confused. Am I just too old? Is that what this is? Have I, have I hit that point where I'm too old for this?

355
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Don't worry, Rob. We'll get you your cane next year.

356
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I guess so. I don't understand. All right. Let's see. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

357
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Ragenator says, Sony did better arm themselves, Sky, but their hamster that served as chief security officer recently died from overuse of exercise wheels.

358
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Kaijuto in chat says they do it more for the laughs, not attention. If they wanted attention, they'd show themselves.

359
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, they are showing themselves. You know their name. Everybody's tweeting it. I, I, I don't see where they're not showing themselves. They are.

360
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:24,000
This is just their, their chosen identity that they're, they're putting out there or whatever. So, I don't know. Anyway, I just, I'm disappointed that we pay for Xbox Live.

361
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:37,000
We now pay for PlayStation Plus and I get that, I get that there's great deals on games and all this stuff, but part of their reasoning for charging for PlayStation Plus was because we need to better our security.

362
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:47,000
We can't afford to do all the free, you know, stuff anymore. It's not, you know, they, they throw all these lines at us about what, about why they're going to charge for PlayStation Plus because they want more money, right?

363
00:45:47,000 --> 00:46:00,000
And this happens. And it's down for three days during one of the busiest periods of the year. And boy oh boy, you should have seen some of the Twitter spats I was having over this thing this week.

364
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Which, you know, I understand I respect everybody's opinion and the places they're coming from, but it was getting a little heated on Twitter. And, you know, I get it.

365
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Some people and the way they complain about things like this is like, I want my money and I want it now. You know, some people throw a real tissy fit about it. And, you know, I, I understand that there's, I have very thin patience for things like that too.

366
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But at the same time, if people are going to be upset that what they pay for isn't working for three days, I would think that they are entitled to some type of compensation.

367
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'd like to quote something my husband's fond of saying. How does it feel to want?

368
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Well, but okay. But then why are we paying for it? Maybe my PlayStation Plus is up for renewal. Maybe I won't renew it this time.

369
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Okay, then don't. Speak with your money.

370
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I might not. I'm going to wait and see what they do in response to this whole thing to see if I'm going to renew it or not.

371
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But even like the most shittiest customer service experience that I can think of, Comcast, even them, you know, if you complain in your services like, stay out for a couple days or something, they'll usually credit your bill those couple of days.

372
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And I'm not, I'm not saying that Sony has to come out and provide all these free games again and have it be like fucking Christmas all over again and all this stuff. That's not what I'm saying.

373
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:26,000
All I would like Sony to do in this situation is acknowledge our network was vulnerable to this and this is what we're doing to make it better.

374
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And since we were down for three days, we're going to credit everybody with three days.

375
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:42,000
That's all I want. And that's all I think any, any person wants in this situation when things get heated is that you want the corporation or just not Joe Blow who represents corporation gets paid to take all the verbal.

376
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Credit the people that have PlayStation Plus like a couple bucks or something, you know, because that I understand that you can't, there's no really no way to extend your, you know, membership out a couple days because I think it renews.

377
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'm not even sure that really does it for me because yeah, if you work out the math, it ends up being like less than a dollar, but I want Sony to say it was vulnerable.

378
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:15,000
We got attacked and this is how we're going to make it better. And I know a lot of you guys, a lot of you cynics are out there saying they're never going to admit that. Well then why are we continuing to support it?

379
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Everybody gets a free PlayStation Go or a PlayStation portable. Was it a PSP Go, PSP Go. They've got tons of those. I'm sure.

380
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I don't know. It's, it's not so much about the, because I also understand where it's kind of bullshit that somebody else, an outside influence takes down their network. And so now Sony has to pay up for that.

381
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But at the same time, why has Sony been down for three days? Like this says a lot about their security.

382
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
How quickly was Microsoft able to get up?

383
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:59,000
They got up and within 24 hours, I'm pretty sure. But any, but, and then here, here sits Nintendo who knew that, you know, your Wii U is the only thing that was going to be online this holiday. Who knew?

384
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Well, and then once again, it think, you know, the reason why is resources, you know, it's like, okay, well we can take down two, you know, come, you know, if we take down Nintendo, I don't think a lot of people are going to give a crap.

385
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But well, but at the same time, I think it's easy to say that. I think it's easy to say they didn't target Nintendo because they just don't fucking care. And that's, and maybe that's the truth, but at the same time, consider this.

386
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:31,000
If they did target Nintendo and they couldn't do it, would they admit it? I don't think so.

387
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I think I remember reading that they said they're fans of Nintendo, which is why they didn't do that.

388
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:51,000
And I'm saying they're criminals and that could just be a convenient excuse for you couldn't do it. You couldn't do it. So you're, you made a convenient excuse that you're fans of Nintendo. I'm just, consider it. Why not?

389
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Why not? Because this is a company that just now figured out how to do DLC, you know, what like a decade after everybody else. I'm sorry. I don't believe for a second that they have some sort of security system that's, you know, out matching any other game network security system.

390
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Could that be the reason why it's taken so long is because they wanted to do it right. I'm just, I don't think so. I don't think so at all.

391
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:34,000
All right. We'll see if they, if, if these, if jizz masters or whoever comes next decides to take out Nintendo, then whatever, I guess I'll be proven wrong. But for what it's worth right now, saying that they couldn't, they didn't want to do it. It could be a convenient excuse.

392
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So that's all. Anyway, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Tigerclaw says there Nintendo security is really tight because nobody ever hacks them. Nintendo does have a bunch of credit cards on file. You would think, you would think.

393
00:50:49,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Let's see. Bonds006 says Nintendo laughed all the way to the bank on not getting a DDoS attack. DGRamaS says Nintendo has a network? Question mark. So there you go.

394
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And then Fifth Dream says no one is breaking into anything. And that I understand the whole concept about hackers versus DDoS flood and all this stuff.

395
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Whatever label you want to put on it, it's being a dick. So they're being a dick. That's, that's what it is at the end of the day. They're being a dick by shutting down PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas day. That's just being a dick.

396
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Anyway, sadly, that was one of the biggest news stories that came out of the week, but there were some other things that happened during the week, including this, which interesting timing on this. Speaking of Nintendo, Nintendo is upping their lobbying presence.

397
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:59,000
So you know what it means to be like lobbying means you have money. That's when you lob money at people and hope it sticks. That's when you lob money at people and you get their votes in return. That's essentially what it is.

398
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:09,000
And Nintendo is increasing their lobbying presence. And what they did, they hired, and I will probably mispronounce this name, called Cho-Groves Consulting.

399
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And what they're going to be doing is lobbying the federal government on issues related to intellectual property, intellectual trade, and anti-piracy measures. Now this is according to recent lobbying disclosures, as there are rules and things. You have to make certain disclosures as a public company like that.

400
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:45,000
So we can get into specific names and all that, but I don't see the point into that. But that's overall what's happening. Nintendo has hired this firm to lobby Washington on issues such as IP, international trade, and anti-piracy measures.

401
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Because, you know, Nintendo does get hit with a lot of these piracy things all the time, right? These DS and 3DS loaders that allow you to download carts from online and install them on the flash cart and so forth, right? The R5, is that what it was called?

402
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
R4.

403
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:16,000
They got it banned in a lot of places, and you can't sell it anymore, but Nintendo does fall victim to that quite a lot. And I imagine when it comes to intellectual property, you could probably get all sorts of bootleg t-shirts with bootleg Mario and bootleg Zelda on them everywhere.

404
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I know, I mean, look at their games. There's games on other systems like the CDI, I mean, clearly those couldn't have been possible.

405
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Clearly, Nintendo would have never allowed that.

406
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Seriously.

407
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:39,000
But, I mean, in all honesty, we also have, you know, when anybody can make a game for iOS, you know, how easy would it be to put a copy of Super Mario Brothers on there?

408
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Or somehow backload, you know, an emulator or something.

409
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I wonder if that'll come up later in the show.

410
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I wonder.

411
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Or something like that, you know? Exactly.

412
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So Nintendo, what do you think they hope to accomplish with the lobbying that they're doing? What kind of law are they looking to get passed with this?

413
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Is it something about clamping down on intellectual property in relation to games and so forth or what?

414
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I don't like it any, I don't know. I hate lobbyists.

415
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Do you think that they're looking to hold a company like Apple or Google responsible when a clone gets through onto their stores?

416
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Just throwing it out there. I don't know. I'm not saying I want it or I'm just, could that be what they're lobbying for?

417
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Maybe. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I still don't like lobbyists.

418
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Yeah?

419
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah, because usually, especially when you have companies like this, I understand they're just trying to, you know, get the passage of certain types of laws for them.

420
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And I'm sorry you have a lot of it ends up being anti-consumer because they kind of overstep their bounds.

421
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Look at like, you know, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Yeah, that did a number on everything. Thanks. Yeah.

422
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Well, when I hear about these companies are interested in lobbying, I worry about things like, remember SOPA?

423
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
A couple of years ago, that whole thing that they were trying to pass where they could, they could just shut down your website without even taking you to court or whatever.

424
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And all us indie folks are banding together going, hold on, hold on. No, this is some bullshit right here. Hold on.

425
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And, you know, it was one of those rare cases where the people of America spoke up and shut the lobbyists down because enough people, you know, rose up against it.

426
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Which I'm, you know, at the same time though, I'm all for if Nintendo wants to try and prevent piracy and so forth, they have a right to do that.

427
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You know, you, as much as it might make some people upset to hear, you have to understand it is wrong for you to download Pokemon Ruby Sapphire remakes on 3DS and play them for free.

428
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Like that, that is wrong to do that. No, I understand that.

429
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:55,000
My problem I have with it is when they start saying, oh, we're protecting our, you know, our IP by not allowing you to make a YouTube video or something like that.

430
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's like, how far does that hand go? How far does it go? I get that.

431
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Or like, oh yeah, you, um, you know, you made this like fan, you know, art type thing. Oh, I'm sorry. That's, you know, violating our, you know, IP or something.

432
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Right.

433
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
That's where I have the problem.

434
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah. That I, I get that is that, you know, how, how far does that do those protections shorter reach? And you're right. And I've bitched about this on the show.

435
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I don't know how many times a lot of the stuff on YouTube goes too far and it's all, none of it, none of YouTube's rules are in the interest of the people that make the content for YouTube.

436
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:42,000
That's the thing that blows my mind how they are so damn successful when the people that actually create the content for YouTube, YouTube never defends.

437
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:54,000
YouTube never sticks up for them. YouTube doesn't care about them. They always bend over to copyright holders first, even if the copyright holders don't have a legitimate claim.

438
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Yeah.

439
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's crazy to me.

440
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And there's people abusing the system even, you know, like there's some indie guys out there and, um, not even indies, but like Warner, you know, they were doing that where, oh, you, you're not part of our, uh, you know, our embargo reviews or whatever like that.

441
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Or, you know, you had to agree to this in order to be able to put the video out at a certain date, but you didn't get, somehow you received a copy of the game and now you're not allowed to put this video out there because you didn't sign this agreement or something that it's messed up.

442
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Uh, Tigerclaw with an interesting perspective in our chat room over at a live.vognetwork.com saying, maybe the lobbying is also to help protect them against these companies trying to sue them for patent infringing.

443
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Well, now that's fine. That's once again, that's going up against, you know, these trademark laws and stuff like that or, you know, copyright laws.

444
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
We'll all support Nintendo on that one.

445
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:59,000
There needs to be copyright law reform anyways, and I'm fine with that, but I just don't think that, you know, I don't think that's the case in this time. I think it's something else.

446
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Let's see, uh, Kaijuto in chat says Nintendo wants to freeze the pirates in Carbonite. Well, they probably would if they could.

447
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Uh, and bonds006 says Google, owner of YouTube, is making money for the video hits. That is their business.

448
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Well, imagine if people stopped making videos for them to get the hits on. I'm just saying, like, and I've, I've even created stuff on YouTube and I've, I've made stuff and so forth.

449
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And I get very frustrated with some of their little like claims where they claim that I'm using copyrighted stuff, but I'm literally looking at the website where they have released all those rights to people that want to do Let's Play videos and so forth.

450
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
But you can't fucking send that information to YouTube because there's not a human being there.

451
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So why am I still on YouTube? Because there is, like, literally no other site. There's literally no other site that takes, like, ga-, that'll take gaming content.

452
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Because it's such a slippery slope, admittedly. But, ugh, so irritating.

453
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Uh, DarkSakura, you re-, you get into some of this political stuff sometimes and so forth. I'm dying to know your thoughts. What do you think about Nintendo, uh, getting a lobbying firm to represent them?

454
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm not really surprised. I mean, especially now, if you also look at the fact that Nintendo has been getting into more and more online content, they could very well be throwing in their lot with, um, some of the issues regarding net neutrality as well.

455
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So that was another thing that I was sort of thinking of.

456
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Oh, good point.

457
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Um, I-, I-, as I've said for other issues in the past, I don't want to speculate until I have something more firm.

458
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But I think that, yeah, I really don't know what to think, to be honest.

459
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:45,000
That's a really good point, though, about the net neutrality. I didn't even think of that, but you're right. Now that Nintendo, like, actually has more online playable games, as they've had a few this year, that's something of particular interest to them.

460
00:59:45,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And they've always taken a very, I would say, solid approach to protecting their IPs, to protecting their interests, and I could see where it would be beneficial for them to throw their lot in with the political game.

461
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:09,000
So, I still-, I think it's all speculation at this point. We have no idea. I'd rather wait for something more concrete.

462
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You know, some people have called Nintendo the Disney of video games, which is-, it's really not a bad comparison in many ways. I mean, it's a quick and rushed and sloppy comparison in some ways.

463
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But in other ways, I mean, you have these extremely identifiable characters. You got Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, you got Mario, Link, and, you know, all these characters in Smash Brothers on Nintendo's side.

464
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It's not to say that Sony and Microsoft don't have their own, but there's also other animation studio-, like, you know, there's Warner Brothers, there's other animation studios outside of Disney, too.

465
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Don Bluth.

466
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah, there's all this other stuff, right? So, but Nintendo, in some ways, is the Disney of the video gaming world.

467
01:00:47,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And we all know that Disney-, look at what Disney does. Like, if you look at, like, Disney's lobbyist, Disney got copyright law changed to prevent Mickey Mouse from going public domain.

468
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Mickey Mouse was supposed to go public domain, like, in the last decade or something, but Disney lobbied to get copyright laws changed so that Mickey Mouse wouldn't go public domain.

469
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That was-, that was to keep-, keep that protection, basically. And so, it, like, doubled the length of time or something like that, that something will stay copyright before it goes into public domain.

470
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So, I mean, if you're curious about the types of stuff Nintendo might be doing, Disney might be a company to look to for inspiration of what they're doing. Who knows? Just throwing a thought out there.

471
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some more news. DarkSakura.

472
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Well, we do have some news out of the fuckery that came through with Assassin's Creed Unity.

473
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Well, there is a patch out now that improves the performance of the game.

474
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:54,000
This third patch is supposed to fix framerate issues and make the game play more fluidly.

475
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:06,000
That's with this fourth patch. Basically, it's 6.5 gigabytes and it refurbishes, as they've said, some of the areas, especially here it says in Paris.

476
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:17,000
It's supposed to be more beneficial for PS4, but there are some updates on Xbox One that people should see.

477
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:26,000
So, they're trying to make the games fit each other, each edition of it, look more alike in terms of quality.

478
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Really, the other thing too is that they're supposed to help the NPCs run more smoothly instead of just being sort of useless there.

479
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Not really that it's helping anything like framerate or anything like that, but they said overall it's supposed to just improve the playing of the game.

480
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:55,000
It does look like, though, from some of the scenes that there are more NPCs included now without too much of a framerate drop.

481
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So, maybe that's something.

482
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah. You know, Extrovert over in Hoard House, I've been noticing his tweets, he's been playing this more and more and it really sounds like a lot of the issues that were going on have been addressed.

483
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So, kind of a bummer that it had such a botched launch, like the game might be great now, but, you know, are there going to be as many people that stuck with it to discover it? We'll see.

484
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:25,000
We'll see. Of course, if they were to end up slashing the price of the game by 20 bucks, I suppose that's going to open it up to a whole new audience that will check it out at that point.

485
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I still won't buy it.

486
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Well, you never know. I think there'd be a lot of people that would.

487
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I pretty much know I won't buy it.

488
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yeah. I know I wouldn't buy it because I'm not a fan of Assassin's Creed.

489
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Yeah.

490
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I tried.

491
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:44,000
The only ones of those I'd ever had an interest in was the second one, which I did buy, but that was also when I was having this minor obsession with learning everything about the Medici family.

492
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
And I loved their whole drama.

493
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
So, playing a game where I get to go around killing historical figures was pretty cool.

494
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I never got super super into the Assassin's Creed series, but I understand why they're popular.

495
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And I did play three, I think it was, which I'm even told is not one of the stronger games, but I actually was pretty impressed with the storytelling in it.

496
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
So, for as little as I did play, I was like, oh, this is kind of rad.

497
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So, I get why people are super into that series.

498
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I do think they're putting them out a bit too frequently, and I think that's starting to shoot them in the foot.

499
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And they might really want to consider scaling it back to one every other year, as much as some of the fans may not want to hear that.

500
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But I think that could be a good, healthy thing for the series. In the long run, you'd probably get better games out of it.

501
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But we'll see what happens. We'll see.

502
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Moving on. Loki.

503
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So, Destiny's done pretty well for itself.

504
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Right now, they have, I guess, just about 13 million players playing the game.

505
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:56,000
And they said, with that, over almost 23 million characters created, and over 872 million hours.

506
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,000
That's a lot of hours.

507
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That's a lot of people grinding for nothing.

508
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yeah, and I still haven't played yet. Still sitting, collecting dust on my phone.

509
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Why not?

510
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Why not? Just don't have time, and also got a limited amount of time.

511
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Got to dedicate all that free time right now to VOGJAM.

512
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Once it's done, maybe I'll take a break and do that.

513
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But then I gotta go back to my other game, too.

514
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Maybe by that time, they'll have the balance patch out or something that helps out.

515
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I really don't like their whole concept for endgame in that game.

516
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Gear with light on it is the way you level up? What?

517
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
And then the expansion does nothing to bridge the gap at all for people that want to catch up?

518
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I don't get it.

519
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But I know some people that are super into it still, and love it, and think it's one of the best games of the year.

520
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
They play Watch Dogs, too.

521
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It's also sitting there.

522
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I played a little bit of that. That game's pretty good. It's interesting.

523
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Let's talk about Amiibo.

524
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Amiibo's been doing crazy well for Nintendo. Lots of them selling.

525
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
We talked a little bit last week about how Toys R Us was having some issues around the whole Amiibo.

526
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
There is a little update to that whole thing.

527
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Toys R Us actually canceled a bunch of the Lucario Amiibo.

528
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Some orders got reinstated, and some other people were able to get a different way of ordering.

529
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Like if you use PayPal or a gift card or whatever.

530
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
There might be a redemption code that these folks received this week.

531
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Maybe some of you out there were in this.

532
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Where if you had pre-ordered a Wave 3 Amiibo, what happened is that there's a coupon that will bring the price down to $10.99.

533
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
So I guess what happens is that they have the Amiibo in stock at $999.

534
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
But these people that pre-ordered and then couldn't get it, they can go get it now for $10.99.

535
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That's even cheaper than I believe with the manufacturer. Aren't they usually $12.99?

536
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Yeah.

537
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
And then that way other people aren't going to buy them for, you know, they're not going to scoop them all up for $999.

538
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
But if they do, they're crazy. You get to get them even cheaper from scalpers on eBay than that.

539
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So, there you go.

540
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Toys R Us trying to resolve that crazy Amiibo situation which, man, those Amiibos, it's nuts.

541
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
But then again, Dark Soccer, you said you saw some on Christmas Eve.

542
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Yeah.

543
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And my assumption was that you were probably seeing the common ones that Nintendo has said they're going to put tons of out there like Mario and Link and all that stuff.

544
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yeah. I got a Link one for Secret Santa for somebody.

545
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Yeah. The ones that people are going crazy over are like the limited ones that are coming out in these little waves like Wii Fit Trainer and now what?

546
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Little Mac and Pit, I think, were in this latest bunch and it's, yeah, people going crazy for it.

547
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
But I, dude, I got friends on Twitter that have like every single Amiibo.

548
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And like, so they were trading tips, like somebody was saying, oh, a spice rack is a really good way to display your Amiibo.

549
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And I was kind of looking at it going, that actually does look really cool.

550
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I got a hint that that's a good tip.

551
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
But some people are collecting it like totally just for the figures.

552
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Like doesn't even, like some people, like again, again, Nintendo is the Disney of the gaming world in many ways, in many ways.

553
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And there's another great example that people just want to have the little figurines.

554
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, rock.

555
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to what I'm sure will be a very dry release day schedule?

556
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Well, actually kind of dry news, but it's sort of interesting.

557
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,000
There's a UK games industry publication, MCV, and another one called Develop, that are doing a 2015 salary survey for people in the video games industry.

558
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,000
This is including publishers, retailers, developers, services, anywhere in the world.

559
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,000
And basically they're wanting to collect what people's salaries are for their positions worldwide.

560
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I guess to do a big survey on it.

561
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:20,000
If any of our listeners are in the industry, you can go to MCVUK.com and participate in the survey.

562
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
So I will also be sharing a link with that in the chat room.

563
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Nice. Interesting. Did you do any research, just kind of digging in to see what kind of money people are making?

564
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:40,000
I would honestly put it more in the category of making sure that people are being paid fairly around the world.

565
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
You know, seeing if people are actually being paid what their degrees are worth for one thing.

566
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's actually a pretty good way also of seeing exactly what the industry is doing with the money it's bringing in.

567
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So maybe it's trying to hold them to some ethics.

568
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Nice. I like that.

569
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what is coming out to a video game store near you.

570
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I imagine it's going to be pretty dry this week, but let's check anyway. Loki?

571
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Yeah, in fact, I'll just take a look at that.

572
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Because usually in January there's some things, you know, very little.

573
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But the next thing I show coming out is not until the 20th, and that would be Saints Row Gat Out of Hell.

574
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But yeah, unfortunately, nothing this week.

575
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Alright, well, traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.

576
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
You know what? It's looking very, very thin over there as well, and I think it's going to be for a little bit.

577
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
On the PlayStation 4, I don't see anything until late January, and that's really the same story on the Xbox One.

578
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
The Wii U. The Wii U does... Oh, no, that's Europe.

579
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I was going to say they get Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, but that's actually Europe, gets that very early January.

580
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Sorry, Jamie, didn't mean to spoil that.

581
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And yeah, honestly, I'm even looking at the Vita, the 3DS, nothing.

582
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Japanese release dates aren't really going to pick up again until mid or late January.

583
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:13,000
There's a lot coming in late January, but I think we have really exited the season of game releases for a good month.

584
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
But Dark Sakura, let's check in with Europe anyway.

585
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Jack shit.

586
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
I thought that might be the case.

587
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Yep, Jack shit put up by EA.

588
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:32,000
So, one thing we don't usually get here is a list of digital releases, so I'm not sure, but probably this week, nothing.

589
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I would imagine you'll see a lot of sales, though, so keep an eye out for that.

590
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
All right, let's do a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

591
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:52,000
All right, so I guess this is good news for Nintendo, because the federal court has dismissed the patent case against them for their Wiimote.

592
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I'm trying to remember which patent this one was, because there's been several for the Wiimote.

593
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:11,000
This one, I guess, is Ultimate Pointer, and I guess they had a patent for easily deployable interactive direct pointing system and presentation control system and calibration method, therefore...

594
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Wow, that's really fancily worded.

595
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And this was back from, I guess, 2011 is when this case was filed originally.

596
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And, of course, you know, they're very pleased with the decision, and, you know, the fact that they haven't, you know, infringed on any patents and stuff.

597
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Of course, you know, I want to say, yeah, this isn't necessarily completely in their favor, because you may remember, you know, not too long ago,

598
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Philips won the dispute against Nintendo for the Wiimote thing. See, this is what kind of confuses me about that.

599
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It's like, how can you have multiple companies claiming that you're infringing on their patents for things?

600
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I mean, it's like, which one of you actually made this? I mean, they can't all be here.

601
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Well, because there's more than one thing that comes into play, and I want to say, with the Philips one, and again, I don't get paid to follow this stuff, so I have a hard time.

602
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:23,000
But I believe it was specifically with a remote control type device that controlled games. That was Philips' whole thing.

603
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And then somebody else might claim to have the patent on the, I don't know, just humor me here, infrared sensor bars or whatever, right?

604
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Other components that make up the Wii. I think somebody took issue with the whole Wii channel interface was an issue for somebody that sued Nintendo.

605
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So, it's all those little bits and pieces, everybody wants, you know, their piece of it.

606
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Lame.

607
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I know. Law is complicated. That's what I should have got into, and I'd be rich with all these.

608
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Why you gotta be, you know, why you gotta be picking on Nintendo? I mean, seriously, they're having enough trouble as it is with, you know, getting the Wii U launched.

609
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You know, but their online was up during the holidays, so there's that trade-off, I guess.

610
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Alright, bonds006 in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

611
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,000
The patent suit against Nintendo is still going on. I would think Nintendo settled this case or settled out of court.

612
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Nintendo, though, also strikes me as the type of company that doesn't want to settle for shit.

613
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Because that would admit proving, or that would admit some type of guilt, even though there's a type of settlement you can do that is, you're doing a settlement without any admission of wrongdoing.

614
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But I think even that Nintendo does not want to do unless, like, their back is against the wall or something, you know what I mean?

615
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Anyhow, speaking of Nintendo, there's just a lot of news coming out of them on this very slow week, including the new anime app Crunchyroll, which is now available on the Wii U.

616
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
That's not new.

617
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I know nothing about-

618
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Crunchyroll's been out forever.

619
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I know Crunchyroll's been out forever, but not on the Wii U. That's the news.

620
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It's now out on the Wii U, woo!

621
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I don't know Crunchyroll. Tell me about this service, though.

622
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It's how I watch Sailor Moon.

623
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Seriously, I'm watching the new Sailor Moon series. I paid for Crunchyroll just so I could watch it.

624
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Well, now you can get it on the Wii U, and if you want to use it, you have to have a premium Crunchyroll membership. That is going to cost you about $12 a month.

625
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:27,000
But if you want to get into watching lots and lots and lots of anime, this is a great way to do that.

626
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Is it implied by that picture that the Animal Crossing movie is on there?

627
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,000
That's my assumption, but whoever ran this article could have just tried to tie it to video caving.

628
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Anime Nintendo.

629
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, Anime Nintendo. Who knows? I do not know.

630
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And the Animal Crossing movie is super adorable.

631
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I would ask Rama, or Giovanni, one of the folks over at Anime Jam Session, which I can throw a programming note out there.

632
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
They are on holiday break. They won't be back until mid-January.

633
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
But they are bringing us a new episode this week from DerpyCon, which I guess they taped a while ago, so they're going to play it this week.

634
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But that would be the guy to ask. I would assume he would know if this is available or not, because I sure don't.

635
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I did the program guide for DerpyCon.

636
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
DJ Rama S says it's better on Hulu.

637
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,000
So there you go, from the guy who knows his shit himself.

638
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Alright, let's travel back to a classic time in games. Let's travel back to a time when you didn't watch fuckin' anime on your video game console.

639
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
You had a friend who lived in Japan send you tapes.

640
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Off of TV.

641
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Off of TV.

642
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
So you also got introduced to Japanese game shows that way too.

643
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That's right, which really is the best.

644
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,000
There really is.

645
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And I wish they had a whole television network in the US that was all Japanese game shows.

646
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
That was the first time I'd ever seen a dog shit live on TV.

647
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I'd love it. I'd love it. I'd love it.

648
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
No, no, no, no. It was, it was, they were doing, like, cow soccer and dog soccer and baby soccer.

649
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And the dog, like, they were trying to lure it with treats and everything.

650
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And finally it looks from one side to the other, stops and shits.

651
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And then they replayed it.

652
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
That's awesome. That's like Puppy Bowl.

653
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Puppy Bowl.

654
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Anyway, before my co-host took the conversation literally to dog shit discussion,

655
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
we were gonna get into the classic game of the week.

656
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Dark Soccer's gonna step into the gaming vault and over the poo on the ground

657
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should really think about checking out this game this week.

658
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Because, uh, there's nothing else to play this week unless you, you know, your catchphrase.

659
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I gotta say, though, that, that's the only thing that was probably missing from,

660
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
was that that dog football game that they had on the Wii is dogs, you know, randomly shitting on the field.

661
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Push X to shit?

662
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
And you know what, you know what, what would have been fun is that if they leave the shit there,

663
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
then it can cause, like, dog, other accidents, like, they could slip in the shit or something.

664
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You guys think about this way too much. I'm getting uncomfortable.

665
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

666
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Balloon Fight. I picked it because Dan said so.

667
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I was literally sitting there going, Dan, I need a game. You should do Balloon Fight.

668
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
This is a good game, though.

669
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Okay.

670
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Well, I don't know, I used the term good loosely, but it's influenced a lot.

671
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Well, and he's the one who told me to put the other video up, so that's why I linked it to you.

672
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Because it actually has the, the full music. So it'd be a good idea.

673
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Anyway, Balloon Fight came out in 1985. It was developed by Nintendo.

674
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It's a joust ripoff, but that's okay, because apparently Nintendo can rip off whoever they want to,

675
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
but other people can't rip off of them.

676
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:50,000
It actually first was out in 1984 as Versus Balloon Fight, which was an arcade one.

677
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It was the Nintendo Versus system, which I'm sure we all remembered how this pissed us off because of their time limits and whatnot.

678
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:05,000
The official console version of it in the US came out in 1986.

679
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,000
And it is very much like joust. You sort of float around and run into your enemies and knock them down.

680
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:23,000
It has had ports. The actual NES version was ported to the NEC PC-8801 October 1985, and then the Sharp X1 in November 1985.

681
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:29,000
We have a Game Boy Advance version called Balloon Fight E for the E-Reader. Who remembers that? I had that one.

682
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I do. I had that one.

683
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I thought that was rad that you had, like, you had a video game on a frickin' card.

684
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Yep. That was awesome. Well, five cards, but still.

685
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And I had, uh, that came out in 2002, and then the Famicom miniseries came out in 2004.

686
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:56,000
So, basically, like I had said before, joust, you know, like, um, you play as a balloon fighter who has balloons attached to his helmet, which totally wouldn't work in the real world. Don't try this at home, kids.

687
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,000
And you keep pressing the A button or holding down the B button to flap his arms and rise into the air.

688
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
If your balloon is popped, or if one of the balloons is popped, then you lose some flotation, making it a lot harder to rise.

689
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
And if you lose both of your balloons, then, you know, you're dead.

690
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
You fall to the ground and crash your head open.

691
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
And you die, die, die.

692
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:22,000
I'm kidding. Um, if you fall into the water, you can get eaten by a large piranha, too, which is awesome. Or you can get hit by lightning.

693
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:31,000
So you have the one player and then you have the two player game, um, where you just have to clear the enemy, and then you have Balloon Trip, which is the second video. Rob.

694
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Uh, yes, which I actually, I think some of the music just played there in the background, but let me, let me bring up video number two.

695
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
This is the Balloon Trip music, which is the full theme.

696
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Okay.

697
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Um, Balloon Trip is where you're supposed to avoid obstacles on a side-scrolling stage.

698
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Um, the original arcade version did not have Balloon Trip, but the, um, but I mean, it's, it's different every time you do it.

699
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Um, so basically you just have to clean off the stages and you burst balloons for other people, and you have your bonus stages.

700
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You have, now I mentioned all of the other versions as well. It was also on Animal Crossing on GameCube.

701
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Um, there was a Game & Watch version as well, uh, and it was based off of the Balloon Trip mode, and then, um, you play as Balloon Man.

702
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Uh, there were also, there was a sequel called Balloon Kid that came out in 1990, um, 1991 in Europe, um, on the Game Boy, that, uh, turned into a platforming version.

703
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:36,000
And it, uh, did not come out in Japan, but there was a version that was Hello Kitty World that came out, um, that had all that on there.

704
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
There was a port on the Sharp, uh, Zaris, the PDAs.

705
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:50,000
And I don't know if you were going to mention it or not, but lest we forget the Tingle version, that they had a Balloon Trip as well.

706
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Yes, there was, uh, you had, uh, hold on, because I was just actually getting to one of that.

707
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
You can actually get the Balloon Fighter Helmet as a power-up for the Wii U, uh, Super Smash Brothers.

708
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Um, and then in WarioWare, you had a Balloon Fight version as well.

709
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Uh, there was Yoshi Touch and Go that had Yoshi's Balloon Trip.

710
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Um, we had the Tingle one as well, which was called Tingle's Balloon Fight for Nintendo DS.

711
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Um, it came out on Virtual Console a few times. It's been on the Wii U Virtual Console.

712
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:33,000
So yeah, there's a lot of Balloon Fight. I'm looking at just an entire page of Balloon Fight right the fuck now.

713
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Never-ending Balloon Fight information. Well, and, uh, in Smash Brothers, the villager uses some of that Balloon Fight stuff.

714
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Well, that's why I said there's a power-up. It's the Balloon Fight Helmet.

715
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Yeah, yeah. Is it actually in Smash Brothers, or is that the balloon for, like, the packages that come in?

716
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
No, no, no, they have the Balloon Fight Helmet in the two new ones.

717
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Yeah. So, it has been out on Arcade, Famicom, PC-88, uh, Sharp X1, uh, Game & Watch, Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, the Sharp Xaris, the GBA eReader, uh, other versions on GBA DS, Wii Virtual Console, 3DS Virtual Console, and Wii U Virtual Console.

718
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:25,000
So, Nintendo, I know we love, we know you love Balloon Fight, but really, that's a lot of fucking Balloon Fight.

719
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And, and, surprisingly, they never really revisited the game for as much as they, you know, are kinda, you know, on this game.

720
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Balloon Fight for Oculus.

721
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Balloon Fight 2.

722
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Now it's personal.

723
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Bigger, fluffier balloons.

724
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Silicon.

725
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Mylar balloons.

726
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Alright. Anyhow.

727
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Yeah, that would be like a power-up, you get the Mylar balloons that, like, never fucking die.

728
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Exactly. Pop this, motherfucker.

729
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah.

730
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
You could, if it hits the power line, and in which case, you know.

731
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Electrocutes everyone.

732
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
That's right.

733
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Breaks the power line.

734
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
That's right. Shuts down power in the entire city all night.

735
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Alright.

736
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
And then everyone tries to hunt you down with your balloons.

737
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
There it is.

738
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
And kill you.

739
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Classic Game of the Week Balloon Fight on the NES.

740
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
You know what? We have a lot of imagination.

741
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
We do. We have some very active imaginations.

742
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Which we hope people will turn to reality in our video game jam that's going on right now.

743
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
I'm gonna hire someone. I'm gonna outsource my game to Russia.

744
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So I can be, like, a real developer.

745
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
That's pretty good. I like that.

746
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Alright, we're gonna take a break, guys. We are gonna take a quick break.

747
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
When we come back, we're gonna do rapid-fire news, and then we're gonna get into it.

748
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
All your gaming podcasts are gonna be doing this this week.

749
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Our top games of 2014.

750
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
The top three games of the year from us here in the OLR Studios.

751
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000

We are gonna be hearing your top three games of the year when we come back with a break with more of OrangeLoungeRadio right after this.

755
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio.

756
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Live on this Sunday, December the 28th, 2014.

757
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Episode 581 of our show, currently in progress.

758
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
We are about to get to our top three games of the year and your top three games of the year.

759
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Gonna be able to call us on Skype here shortly.

760
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Username OrangeLoungeRadio. All one word on Skype.

761
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Or our phone number, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

762
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,000
But first, we have some rapid-fire news to get to before we get to the big games of the year list.

763
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
So, Loki, let's get to it.

764
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Alright. Wasn't a whole lot this week, but let's start off with a cool cameo that's gonna be happening with a couple indie games.

765
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
You may remember there's, well actually, both of these were Kickstarters at one time.

766
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,000
But Road Redemption, which is in Early Access, and it's kind of like a spiritual successor to Road Rash.

767
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Well, they're gonna get a cameo from Shovel Knight in that as well.

768
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And you can actually use Shovel Knight as a character in the game and hit people on motorcycles with the shovel.

769
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
So that's pretty awesome.

770
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,000
So, check that out. I guess, I think that's a free download that they're gonna be including in there.

771
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:25,000
If you're playing on pre-ordering the Resident Evil HD collection, or I should say the remake that they're doing in HD,

772
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
on the PlayStation Network, you can actually get that as a cross-buy title.

773
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:35,000
So if you don't have a PlayStation 4 yet, or maybe you own a PlayStation 3 and a PlayStation 4,

774
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
if you buy it digitally, you will get it unlocked on both systems.

775
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,000
So that's pretty awesome.

776
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,000
It is only available, though, to pre-order, so you have to purchase the game before it comes out.

777
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:52,000
And it looks like that will be coming out on January 20th, 2015.

778
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And then, let's see, last but not least, because of the whole hacking incident,

779
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Rockstar Games is extending their Grand Theft Auto Christmas event that they have going on for Grand Theft Auto Online,

780
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,000
which includes some different outfits and stuff you can buy.

781
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Hopefully that means the snow, because I missed the snow again for the second time in the year.

782
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
They always do snow around the holidays in the game, which is kind of cool.

783
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,000
So, yeah. And I guess that'll be now available through January 5th.

784
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:35,000
That's good that they are extending that. I hope some other games extend their holiday stuff, too, to kind of make up for that.

785
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Destiny, I think, was doing their event that they had going on.

786
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
They're extending that out, but I didn't remember how long that was, too.

787
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Dragon Age multiplayer, I know if you log on, you can get a Mary Chest or something like that right now,

788
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
and they extended that as well, so you can get that later.

789
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,000
That's kind of nice.

790
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I finally, finally full-cleared a map on Dragon Age multiplayer.

791
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That was hard. This is no joke, the Dragon Age multiplayer, but I finally did that this week.

792
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I have yet to play it.

793
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's interesting. You should check it out. It's very different than the Mass Effect multiplayer, but sadly, I'm on PlayStation 4.

794
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
I've had to play with nothing but strangers, but I just turned the voice communication off, and it's fine.

795
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Again, the nice thing is it's co-op, so for them to sit there and just say, like,

796
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
You suck! It's not going to help anybody.

797
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Usually, co-op people are a little bit more civil.

798
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Exactly.

799
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Unless you're really holding things up somehow.

800
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
In which case, again, they're only going to end up hurting themselves.

801
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
They start berating you, then you just quit, and then they have to play with one less person,

802
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
which really is a hard thing to have in Dragon Age.

803
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Completely off-topic. I don't know if it's actually today, but has Stan Lee turned 92?

804
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I have no idea if today is his birthday, but that sounds about the right age.

805
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
It's fucking intense.

806
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
He's an antique. He's a national treasure.

807
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
He's not allowed to die.

808
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Never.

809
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Excelsior, then.

810
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Excelsior, exactly.

811
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Him and Betty White should, like, collaborate.

812
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I'm not sure on what, but it would be awesome.

813
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
They should stop, collaborate, and listen.

814
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Oh, you. Alright.

815
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
That's it for Rapid Fire News.

816
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
That's it. That's all we got.

817
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I know usually Dark Soccer and I have something, but it was kind of a slow news week, guys.

818
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's the holidays.

819
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
So, we're ready to get into, and instead of the frugal question of the week,

820
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
we're going to invite you guys to participate tonight.

821
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
By the way, TigerConChat says, you're right, 92 years old today.

822
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Gives a little link there if you want to see that in our chat room.

823
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Alright.

824
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
We're going to invite all you guys to participate with this segment tonight.

825
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
It is the Resequate. You must do this.

826
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
We've been doing this show for what?

827
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
We're going into our 13th year next year.

828
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
92 years.

829
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Stan Lee was bored.

830
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
You guys, when we started this show, Stan Lee was only 80.

831
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Dude, I got to say, he looks great for 92.

832
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
He does.

833
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
He doesn't.

834
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
And he still goes to all these cons and everything.

835
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
I don't know what's funny, actually.

836
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
He, uh, the guy, um, uh, crap, why did I forget his name?

837
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Um, Joe Simon, who created Captain America.

838
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Stan Lee was like an intern when he was drawing comics.

839
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Wow.

840
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So, he's actually mentioned in his book.

841
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And they're saying in chat, TigerCon and Jason are saying it was actually yesterday.

842
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
His birthday was yesterday.

843
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Close enough.

844
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
You know what, when you're 92, your birthday can go for an entire week.

845
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I think that's acceptable, actually.

846
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
So, there you have it.

847
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Anyway.

848
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Alright.

849
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Are we going to talk about Stan Lee for the rest of the show?

850
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Or are we going to do our top three games?

851
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
You know what?

852
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Don't answer that.

853
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Don't answer that question.

854
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I was going to say, ironically, if you do still are going to play my, uh, fortune cookie

855
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
message of the week, it's so appropriate and I didn't even realize it.

856
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Alright.

857
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the show for that.

858
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Alright.

859
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
For now, though, it is time to get into our top three games of 2014.

860
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Do we have a bumper or something for that?

861
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
I feel like we need, I feel like we need like a...

862
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

863
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
We need like a CNN or whatever style, like, graphic.

864
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
This is all I was able to get on our budget.

865
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,000
There you go.

866
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Our top games of 2014 and yours.

867
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
We're going to open up the Skype line in a little bit.

868
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:16,000
But first, it's time to go around the studio and see what were your top three picks for

869
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
the year.

870
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
And, um, again, I always give this disclaimer.

871
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,000
There is no right or wrong answer.

872
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
You know, sometimes games from 2013 might sneak their way onto this list and that's

873
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
okay, uh, because of Steam sales and other sales and bargain bins in retail.

874
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:36,000
You know, there's only so much a human being can play in a year worth of video games, especially

875
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
when you're not paid to do it for a living, as none of us are and I don't think any of

876
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
you are.

877
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Um, so, uh, there's no right or wrong answer.

878
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:49,000
This is just your three favorite games of the year and, uh, let's get to it.

879
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'll start with you, Loki, because I'm dying to know.

880
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I can probably guess hers.

881
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Yours I have no idea.

882
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
So, I'm going to start with you.

883
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Loki, what is your number three game of the year?

884
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I guess my number three game of the year, I mean, I, God, I don't even know how many

885
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
games I've played this year.

886
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,000
It's very small because I've been working on games.

887
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Um, so, I guess if I had to pick something, probably, well, Lego Marvel Super Heroes,

888
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I guess.

889
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

890
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
And it's, I don't know, it's a decent game.

891
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
It's kind of my introduction to the whole Lego games because I haven't really played

892
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
any of those before and I like it.

893
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I like the open world-ness of it, which is kind of fun.

894
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Um, and this, the details, you know, like the humor of the game and stuff is pretty

895
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
nice.

896
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It's a little buggy, you know, and I get frustrated sometimes.

897
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Well, they were just participating in the game jam, Loki.

898
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Well, yeah, some of the level design is kind of like, ehhh, like, I don't know, but it's

899
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,000
fun.

900
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
It's nice to see all the, you know, the Marvel cameos in there and stuff.

901
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So, I think it's pretty awesome.

902
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Alright.

903
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Stan Lee's in it the whole time.

904
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
So, you did work Stan Lee into this segment.

905
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Damn you, Loki, damn you.

906
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Alright.

907
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Uh, there it is.

908
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Loki's pick for number three game of the year.

909
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Dark Sakura.

910
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I'm dying to know.

911
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I think I know, but I don't know.

912
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
My number three?

913
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
So, tell me, yeah, your number three.

914
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I'm gonna go Five Nights at Freddy's.

915
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Five Nights at Freddy's.

916
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
I'm not any good at it.

917
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I've died way too many times, but for just something that snuck up out of fucking nowhere,

918
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
it's pretty intense.

919
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,000
It is kind of-

920
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And it's fucking scary.

921
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
It's all of my childhood nightmares in one game.

922
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Like, the only thing that would make it worse is clowns.

923
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Which, oh, don't give him ideas for Five Nights at Freddy's.

924
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Three.

925
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
And we've got the sequel in the first year because the first-

926
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Ah, fuck!

927
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Well, they already have, like, the timeline in place, and there's, like, prequels and

928
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
stuff.

929
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I forget how the games fall in line, but there's a whole, like, lore video and stuff.

930
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Yeah.

931
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,000
It is kind of the indie darling of the year in many ways, and a lot of people are talking

932
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
about it at the same time.

933
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
And it's made furry cosplay cool again.

934
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
No, it was always cool, but still.

935
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Yeah.

936
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And sells like crazy on iTunes right now, I'm noticing.

937
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I looked at, like, the top three paid apps in games right now is Minecraft.

938
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It will be number one for all eternity.

939
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
It will be Minecraft.

940
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And then number two and three are Five Nights at Freddy's 1 and 2.

941
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
See, here's the thing.

942
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Remember, was it that, um, remember how Miyamoto was supposed to be working on it?

943
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Was it the Project Watch or whatever?

944
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Andy Guy beat you to it, and it's already, you know, fantastic.

945
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Whatever you're going to do with it, I'm sorry, but it's not going to be as good.

946
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, VX Jason XV says,

947
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I can't bring myself to play Five Nights at Freddy's.

948
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I want to, but oh my God.

949
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
That's kind of the same boat I'm in.

950
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
And trust me, guys, ActDeaf was kind enough to buy me a copy of the game going,

951
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
you should livestream this, Rob.

952
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,000
You should livestream this.

953
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And then Shane, every night, every night.

954
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
So, tonight's the night you're going to livestream Five Nights at Freddy's.

955
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
No, no, Shane, I'm playing Diablo 3.

956
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Tonight's the night you're going to livestream, why not?

957
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It's just like, oh my God, every night.

958
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
At some point, I will do the livestream of Five Nights at Freddy's, but not tonight.

959
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I think number two has the puppet, which is sort of like a clown.

960
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Number two also has the mask that you can use to try to fool them,

961
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
except some of them can always see through the mask.

962
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
The second one's on my wish list.

963
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I haven't even finished, well, I've died in the first one.

964
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
I guess that counts as finishing the game.

965
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Wasn't that a trope from the original Halloween movie,

966
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
where like the beginning of the movie, you were seeing it through Michael's mask,

967
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
and that's the whole, I forget, anyway.

968
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
No, you can actually put on one of the masks of one of the animatronics,

969
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
so that they think you're one of them.

970
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Oh, interesting.

971
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:39,000
All right, let's see, my number three game of the year.

972
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
You know what's funny?

973
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I also, this is hard, by the way, because I've been switching back,

974
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
like two, three, and four have all been flipping around places,

975
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
but I think I finally have what I want to do.

976
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And my number three happens to be a scary game as well,

977
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
but I went a different place, and I think some people are going to be surprised,

978
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
and some people are going to say, you can't put that on a game of the year list.

979
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
You cannot put that game on a best game of the year list.

980
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
If it's what I think it is, it was my number two.

981
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
And I'm going to tell you, I can do whatever the fuck I want, it's my list,

982
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,000
and my number three game of the year is PT, is my number three.

983
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I have to pick a new number two now.

984
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
No you don't, you can pick whatever you want.

985
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,000
You can pick whatever you want.

986
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Here's the thing, and a lot of you guys are going, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Rob.

987
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,000
PT is a demo for Silent Hill.

988
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
It's a concept, it's not a myth.

989
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Yeah, and that's the thing, is that at the very end, it tells you,

990
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
this might not reflect the actual game.

991
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,000
But let us also consider a few things about PT.

992
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:42,000
One, it was free. That's the best fucking price for a game all year. It was free.

993
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Two, it was a legitimate surprise that came out of nowhere,

994
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
and that continued to surprise right up until the very end.

995
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:55,000
In fact, I think people still don't know how to beat this game, for sure, definitive every time.

996
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And what I also love about this game, think about it,

997
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
people did not know that it was a Silent Hill concept thing, right?

998
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,000
And then suddenly it's being streamed on Twitch, as a lot of people do these days,

999
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
and a small mid-level streamer overseas was actually the first one to find

1000
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
and discover that PT was in fact a trailer for Silent Hill.

1001
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
And it's on her little stream where she's celebrating like,

1002
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,000
oh my gosh, oh my gosh, and she's like screaming along to all this.

1003
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
It was a really great element of surprise that we didn't really see at all.

1004
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Like, in the age of the internet, how many surprises actually stay under wraps anymore?

1005
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Very, very, very few. So, that's it.

1006
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
My number three game of the year is PT.

1007
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
I noticed, just walking into studio...

1008
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I'm changing mine.

1009
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
You don't have to change.

1010
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
I am.

1011
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Alright. You're going to get real mad at me in a minute.

1012
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
But anyway, walking into studio here, I see that Shane has joined us.

1013
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Hello.

1014
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
How are you doing?

1015
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Fine, tired.

1016
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Tired?

1017
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Yes.

1018
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
You're wearing an Assassin's Creed shirt today, it looks like.

1019
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Yeah, I'm wearing two hoodies.

1020
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Does that mean that...

1021
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
It has a hood here, and then it has a hood here.

1022
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Wait, you have two... Why are you wearing two hoodies? Is that cool?

1023
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Because that's just how it worked out.

1024
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
So, does that mean your game of the year is Assassin's Creed Unity?

1025
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Never.

1026
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Never? Alright.

1027
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Well, I thought you might want to play along with us.

1028
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Do you have a number... We're on number three.

1029
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Do you have a number three game of the year?

1030
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
My number three has already been said, but my number three is Five Nights at Freddy's.

1031
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Because it's amazing.

1032
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,000
And for the reasons you guys already talked about, for the most part, I love the lore.

1033
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
So, I'm actually going to combine one and two because they came out this year.

1034
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
So, the Five Nights at Freddy's series.

1035
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
The lore is amazing. It's frightening as all get out.

1036
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I played over at Blocko Jones' place with him and his wife, and there was lots of screaming going on.

1037
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
It was so good. I loved it. It was really fun.

1038
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I'm anxious to see a third game.

1039
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:01,000
And even today on my lunch, I was reading just stuff about Five Nights at Freddy's because it's really engrossing.

1040
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Alright. I'm gonna... I swear I will check this game out at some point.

1041
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Tonight.

1042
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Not tonight!

1043
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
It would make a great movie, I think.

1044
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yeah. Maybe that's where it's headed. Who knows?

1045
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Alright. Let's get to the number two choices.

1046
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
So, it's time for the number two picks.

1047
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Number two picks of the year.

1048
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
So, Shane, this time I'm starting with you because you're the guest walking in here.

1049
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
So, what's your number two game of the year?

1050
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
My number two has also already been said.

1051
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,000
P.T.

1052
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
I don't care if you say it's a demo. It is a demo.

1053
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:33,000
It's better than, apparently, all but one game that came out this year for me.

1054
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,000
So, P.T. was scary. It was intense.

1055
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I love the mystery around it. Even the next little teaser trailer they had was really interesting.

1056
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:47,000
I'm still sad that so far there's no Akira Yamaoka.

1057
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:56,000
But I like the direction they're taking and I have not been excited about a Silent Hill game like this since four.

1058
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Alright.

1059
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Which was like ten years ago.

1060
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
That's right.

1061
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
As you guys did on one of the shows.

1062
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Alright. Well, then let's go around and get everybody else's number two game.

1063
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
So, Loki, what is your number two game?

1064
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,000
My number two game is technically a remake.

1065
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
But that would be Grand Theft Auto 5, the next-gen version.

1066
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Because it was just so...

1067
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:21,000
They took a great game already that was just kind of phenomenal and just took it even further.

1068
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
They literally turned it to eleven.

1069
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Seriously, it's going to be awesome.

1070
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
And I love the fact that they're going to have DLC coming out hopefully sooner than later because it's been forever.

1071
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
But it just looks amazing on next-gen.

1072
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Or current-gen, I guess.

1073
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
So that would be my number two.

1074
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Even though I've only played it for a few hours.

1075
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But it's still fantastic.

1076
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I would have called Shenanigans if that game did not show up on your list somewhere.

1077
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So, there it is.

1078
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
I considered not having it on there.

1079
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Really? Shenanigans.

1080
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Alright. Dark Sakura, your number two pick.

1081
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
My heart still says P.T.

1082
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Then go with P.T.

1083
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Because I kind of have a sort of a middle one that also goes with it.

1084
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Goat Simulator.

1085
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Your number two game is Goat Simulator.

1086
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
It's Goat Simulator.

1087
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Awesome.

1088
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I love P.T. and it stands in its own little category in my heart.

1089
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
But I will go with Goat Simulator because...

1090
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Goat.

1091
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Is it just because you love goats or is it just because...

1092
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Goats are adorable. You shut up.

1093
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:27,000
No, I mean, I liked Goat Simulator a lot too because it was just...

1094
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It was kind of like the video game you just want.

1095
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
You just wanted this in a game.

1096
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Meaning that, you know, you just do whatever the hell you want and you get points for acting like an asshole.

1097
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
That's what Goat Simulator is.

1098
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
What?

1099
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Speaking of acting like an asshole.

1100
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Alright.

1101
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Well, I'm about to act like an asshole too.

1102
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Jamie's going to be very upset when she hears my number two.

1103
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You're going to pick my number one.

1104
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I know I'm going to. I'm totally going to.

1105
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Because you're a bitch.

1106
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I have to. You can't have me change this.

1107
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
This really is my number two game of the year.

1108
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It's a great game with a lot of depth.

1109
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And honestly, even in its single player mode alone, it would be a contender for top game of the year.

1110
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:25,000
But then that there's this whole second game that's tacked onto it that although might not be as enriched as some that have come before it.

1111
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I still think this game is definitely deserving a lot of the accolades it's going to get.

1112
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Including one from probably Dark Soccer here in about two minutes.

1113
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
But my number two game of the year is Dragon Age Inquisition.

1114
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
And for a lot of the reasons we've discussed, but I'll allow others to elaborate here in a moment.

1115
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Loki, your number two game of the year.

1116
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I already did my number two game.

1117
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I'm sorry, what?

1118
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Derp.

1119
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Shane.

1120
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
We're going to get to number ones now, right?

1121
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Yes.

1122
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Number ones.

1123
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
This is it.

1124
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Number one game.

1125
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Do the thing.

1126
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
The best.

1127
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Do the thing.

1128
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Shane, what is your number one game of the year?

1129
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Well, I'll let Jamie talk about this.

1130
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Because my number one is Dragon Age.

1131
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Hands down.

1132
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:14,000
So, instead I'll take this time to discuss my top three least favorite games of the year.

1133
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Or biggest disappointments.

1134
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Oh, wait.

1135
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,000
I want to come back to this later.

1136
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
No, I want to come back to this later.

1137
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Then let me just say, I have not beaten Dragon Age yet.

1138
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
I haven't touched multiplayer.

1139
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I made somewhere around 16 different characters because I'm never satisfied with the way my character looks.

1140
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Yes.

1141
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,000
What?

1142
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Yes.

1143
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Yeah.

1144
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I have, between those characters, spent well over 100 hours in the game.

1145
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
And I haven't beaten it yet.

1146
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
And I've done over 100 hours.

1147
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So, this is by far my number one favorite game of the year.

1148
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Nothing comes...

1149
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Well, P.T. came close.

1150
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Came close.

1151
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Very, very close.

1152
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But Dragon Age won.

1153
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Alright.

1154
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Well, Loki, don't mind me if I go out of order for a minute here.

1155
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But now seems like a good time to...

1156
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Oh, my God.

1157
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Something just occurred to me.

1158
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
If you would have switched to P.T., we would have had the same list.

1159
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
That would have been...

1160
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Yeah.

1161
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Unless, unless, unless.

1162
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Now, wouldn't it be cool if one of the mounts in Dragon Age Inquisition was a goat?

1163
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
It's getting dangerously close to sheep.

1164
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And I can't do that.

1165
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Alright.

1166
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I'm going to skip around in a different order because I just have this funny feeling that

1167
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Dark Soccer should probably tell us her number one at this time.

1168
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
So, Dark Soccer, what is your number one game of the year?

1169
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Transistor.

1170
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I'm kidding.

1171
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
You thought about that one.

1172
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
You were thinking about that one.

1173
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I did.

1174
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Transistor was really good.

1175
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Plus, I'm playing it on my Mac, so it makes me happy.

1176
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
No, it's Dragon Age Inquisition.

1177
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,000
I'm at my current playthrough.

1178
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I'm at 68 hours.

1179
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I am putting off the inevitable because I'm doing the soulless romance.

1180
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
And everyone who has been paying attention knows that my heart is going to be ripped

1181
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
out of my chest, stepped upon, shat upon, and kicked across a cow field so it will end

1182
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
in more shit.

1183
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Because soulless.

1184
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Oh, it's in the name.

1185
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Soulless.

1186
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I will need soulless after that.

1187
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Haha.

1188
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Anyway, I've really been enjoying the game.

1189
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I've been exploring everything, and I've also tried to break the game.

1190
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I've decided that I'm not modding it until I beat it, and I'm probably not going to beat

1191
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
it for at least another 40 hours.

1192
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Because I'm going to do everything so that the last thing I do is have my heart stepped

1193
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
on before I beat it.

1194
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
But in 40 hours, how long is that in actual days you're going to play it?

1195
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Because I'm giving myself until March to beat it, because I don't think it will be

1196
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,000
before March.

1197
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I remade it after, I remade my Inquisitor a few times after, until I found the one I

1198
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:30,000
liked, after playing it for four days.

1199
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
And then since then I've been playing, but I've been playing only a few nights after

1200
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
work, except when I had the flu.

1201
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,000
And I played drunk.

1202
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
That was funny because I kept getting motion sick.

1203
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Oh, I could see that in that game.

1204
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I've decided that if I could live anywhere in that world, I would move into the Emerald

1205
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Graves, have a tent there, and just poke people in the eye until they left me alone.

1206
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Even on my 70 hour playthrough that I just ditched recently, I don't think I ever made

1207
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,000
it there.

1208
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Because I'm so bad.

1209
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I'm in the hissing wastes now, and I just keep thinking, why do they call it that?

1210
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
There's just people going, sssssssss.

1211
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Probably.

1212
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Yeah.

1213
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
It's the Templars.

1214
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Alright.

1215
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Always, always kill the Templars.

1216
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Always side with the mages.

1217
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Yes.

1218
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Alright.

1219
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Always romance soulless if you're a female elf.

1220
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Now that we've gotten all the Dragon Age out of our list, because I have this funny

1221
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
feeling Loki probably didn't name it as number one.

1222
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I get to ride around on a giant elk.

1223
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
But who knows?

1224
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I haven't played it, so it's a good bet.

1225
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Well, we're about to find out.

1226
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Loki, what is your number one game of 2014?

1227
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,000
My number one game of 2014 is probably the one I talked about the most, which would have

1228
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
been Goat Simulator.

1229
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Wow.

1230
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I'm really surprised at how many common trends we're seeing.

1231
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Alright.

1232
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Well, I didn't play that much this year, so I mean, it's...

1233
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Sure.

1234
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It's hilarious.

1235
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
It's because, I mean, they have, you know, they've been doing updates for it, and they've

1236
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,000
added so much content to the game, and now they have, was it the online MMO simulator,

1237
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
whatever, with the microwave class.

1238
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
It's, you know, a microwave with feet walking around.

1239
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
So, I mean, it's awesome.

1240
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
And it's such a silly, broken game.

1241
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
And I love that.

1242
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Can't wait to play it on console, because my computer doesn't run it very well.

1243
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Awesome.

1244
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Well, there it is.

1245
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Number one game of the year.

1246
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Alright.

1247
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Mine, I guess, is going to be somewhat of a unique pick, because nobody had it on their

1248
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
list anywhere.

1249
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:24,000
In fact, this entire console was sorely underrepresented on our list here for how well, I think, the

1250
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Wii U did this year.

1251
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:32,000
And Nintendo, as a developer and a publisher, have done very well this year.

1252
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,000
They're all they've got on their own console, and they're giving people reasons to buy a

1253
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Wii U this year.

1254
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,000
And they've obviously had a lot of strong titles, and some of you may be surprised at

1255
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
which one of the Wii U titles I'm going to pick to sort of represent as my game of the

1256
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,000
year.

1257
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:55,000
But I really think in looking back as to what game came out that really made people go,

1258
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
oh, shit, I should really think about getting a Wii U.

1259
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:05,000
What game is just so much fun, which is what a video game should be, so much fun that practically

1260
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
anybody can pick up a controller and jump right into this game.

1261
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:15,000
What game pushed things forward for Nintendo when it came to being more social, finally

1262
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
getting the online play right, and giving people the online play they wanted out of

1263
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Nintendo, and actually doing the social sharing in a new way that didn't just, let's add

1264
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Twitch TV streaming as well, because fuck, everybody else is doing it, let's do it too.

1265
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:38,000
It did its own thing, and it did it so well that it spawned a meme that lasted almost

1266
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
the entire rest of the year.

1267
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
You've probably figured out by now I'm talking about Mario Kart 8, I believe to be the best

1268
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
game of 2014.

1269
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Why are you laughing over there, Jamie?

1270
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Just because I'm thinking of the convention Luigi.

1271
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
See, and Mario Kart 8 gave us all that, and I-

1272
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Convention Luigi replaced the ball pit.

1273
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
I do recognize that for other people, it might be Smash Brothers Wii U, or it might

1274
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
be Bayonetta 2 for you, and I totally get that and I respect it, and if I had a top

1275
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
ten, those two would probably both be on it somewhere, but I think more than anything,

1276
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:20,000
I think Mario Kart 8 really spoke volumes for fun in a year where unfortunately sometimes

1277
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:26,000
a running theme was broken games that had to be patched and fixed after the fact, whereas

1278
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Mario Kart 8 instead delivered a solid game from the get-go where patches only stood to

1279
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:37,000
enhance that, whether it be through comprehensive value-added DLC, not like nickel and dime

1280
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:43,000
DLC but really robust DLC that was really good, to even patching in the amiibo support

1281
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
which granted was a little silly and didn't necessarily add too much to the game, but

1282
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,000
it added something that they really didn't have to add at all, but they did that because

1283
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:58,000
they wanted to enrich those amiibos even more and let them do things in more games than

1284
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
just Smash Brothers, so I just think Mario Kart 8 has been tremendously well supported

1285
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:09,000
and how many people will go back to a game that came out six months ago and treat it

1286
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
like it was new again, like that's what Mario Kart 8 went through when the DLC came out,

1287
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
so for all those reasons, I think Mario Kart 8 was the strongest game that came out in

1288
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:22,000
2014. Alright, we are going to be opening up the phone lines here shortly for your calls

1289
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,000
at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, please note this is only to

1290
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
discuss your top three games of the year. If you have other topics to talk about, we'll

1291
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:37,000
open up the lines later for that. Just looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,

1292
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Dark Tetsuya says, To this day, I still play Mario Kart 8 with my parents. VX JasonXV says,

1293
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:50,000
More people in my office play Mario Kart 8 than anything else. While we open up the line

1294
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,000
and we get to some calls here shortly to discuss your top three games of the year,

1295
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Shane, I want to check in with you because you wanted to be the downer. No, I didn't

1296
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:04,000
want to be the downer. I'm just going to stop you right there and talk over you. You're

1297
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
very good at that. I am. So, I thought it would be more interesting to have your biggest

1298
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,000
gaming disappointments of the year, because everybody finds the ones they like, but rarely

1299
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:21,000
do you get a list of ones you just hate. So, I came up with three that I hate. And we'll

1300
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
get to that right after this call, because we got a call coming in. So, we're going to

1301
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:28,000
get into the three dislikes in a moment, but we have a call coming in. Hi, you're on Orange

1302
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Launch Radio, who's this? Hey, guys, it's Jason. Hey, Jason, how you doing? I'm pretty

1303
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
good, and yourselves? Good to see you, my friend. As always. There was a lot of chatter

1304
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:42,000
in the last show posting about your epic beard. Still making for great radio there. I love

1305
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,000
it. No, I know, but you know what? You look like one of the people I work with. A bunch

1306
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:52,000
of the guys I work with, actually. They can just imagine. Use your imaginations for what

1307
01:51:52,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Jason's deep, dulcet tones. He's missing plaid and an axe. Alternatively, go to bognetwork.com

1308
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
and look at episode 580, and I have two links in there that you can go look at directly.

1309
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:10,000
There you go. Fantastic. Jason, what are your top three games of 2014 and why? Number three

1310
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:17,000
is Destiny, because it is the first effective first-person shooter MMO that I've played,

1311
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:25,000
and as far as I've heard, that somebody actually finally got it right. It's not a pure MMO

1312
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:31,000
in the widest extent, but it is a reliable first-person shooter. There's a group of coworkers

1313
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
of mine that play right over here to my left that I'm actually looking at right now. One

1314
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
of them brought his Xbox One into the office so that the three of them can sit down and

1315
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
play, and they've done raids more days than I can think of for more hours than I care

1316
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:55,000
to think about. I have leveled my character up to 20, and I think even 22 or 23, possibly,

1317
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:01,000
but I'm not really an endgame person, so it's not so much that I enjoy the game for the

1318
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:08,000
MMO merit, but I enjoy the mechanics that go into it, and I have a very, very big appreciation

1319
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,000
for what Bungie managed to pull off. I think that's going to be a very polarizing title,

1320
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I think. I know a lot of people that loved it, I know a lot of people that didn't love

1321
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:25,000
it, so that's a very interesting selection. Yeah, it's refreshing. It is truly unique

1322
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:32,000
to the vast amounts of MMOs that are coming out, but it focused first-person shooter first,

1323
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
RPG, MMO second, and in my opinion, they did it right, and with my soft spot for FPSs,

1324
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I thought they did a spectacular job of it. And you can do whatever you want with your

1325
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
list. What about your number two? Number two is Titanfall, because I have continued to

1326
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:50,000
play that game over the year. They have continued to add new modes to it that I need to make

1327
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:55,000
time and branch out and actually play, but everything I just said about Destiny, but

1328
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
even more, applied to the extent that Titanfall did it. That game, Titanfall is super fast,

1329
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
it is super frantic. I actually just wrapped up a couple of rounds not terribly long ago,

1330
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:15,000
and it's just fun. It's the best combination of agility, shooting, and just literally madness.

1331
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:21,000
I went to it, I was playing Geometry Wars and Grand Theft Auto V and a couple of other

1332
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:25,000
games, and I hadn't played Titanfall for a couple of weeks. I played the game, and it

1333
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:30,000
was seriously three times faster than anything else I played, and I had to adjust to it again,

1334
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
but it felt really good. You know, I think that's one of those games a lot of people

1335
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
kind of forgot came out this year, because it came out so early in the year. Didn't it

1336
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,000
come out late March 2013, though? No, I think Titanfall was like a March title. Wasn't it

1337
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,000
bumped from the end of 2013? It was, it was the end of March for, or it was in March for

1338
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:56,000
the Xbox One version. It was PC, or Xbox One and PC and Xbox 360 was in April. Huh, there

1339
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:03,000
it is. I... Yeah, I think it had been bumped back from what it was originally supposed

1340
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:08,000
to be in 2013. I'm trying to compare it to like when I got home after my trip, and, because

1341
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I played it here in the office before I went home, and then I played it, and I left San Francisco

1342
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,000
in February. So it had to have been before March this year, but... Maybe it was... No,

1343
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:25,000
because they had the beta out in February, because that's what toasted my laptop in February,

1344
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
and I had to buy a new laptop. Maybe that's what it was, Jason, the beta. Okay. Yeah,

1345
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
yeah, yeah, that's right. That did go on for a while, didn't it? Yep. Alright, so how about

1346
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,000
your number one? Time is terrible. How about your number one? Number one is Grand Theft

1347
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Auto 5. I don't know how I missed Grand Theft Auto 4. It just never showed up on my radar.

1348
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I missed it outright. I barely touched San Andreas. I've actually never beaten a Grand

1349
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Theft Auto, and I really hope to break that trend. Grand Theft Auto 5 has been super engaging

1350
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:58,000
to me. Like, scary engaging, and it's like, it's definitely like gotten into my mind.

1351
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:05,000
The visual aspect of it is definitely in the uncanny valley. For anybody that hasn't heard

1352
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:12,000
that term before, realism of things has gotten so good over time that it's just become obviously

1353
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,000
bad, even though we're almost close to perfect. Like, there is just something rigid and strict

1354
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:24,000
about recreating people's bodies that isn't footage that's obviously fake. Grand Theft

1355
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Auto 5 is right in the uncanny valley as far as the look of humans, but the acting and

1356
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:38,000
the voice acting, the dialogue, the storyline, and as exaggerated as Grand Theft Auto 5 is,

1357
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:45,000
it is consistently exaggerated in a way that just feels really, really good. I've really

1358
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
enjoyed playing it, and like I said, I definitely need to beat that story for once.

1359
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Out of curiosity, are you playing Grand Theft Auto 5 in first person mode?

1360
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Most of the time.

1361
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
You know what's interesting about that, Jason? You just named three first person shooters

1362
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
as your game of the year. Did you ever think that would happen?

1363
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:10,000
First person shooters and platformers have kind of been my go-to, and considering, it's

1364
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
representative of this year. It's been very shooter heavy for me as I've slowly kind of gotten

1365
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:23,000
myself back into a regular swing. Everything else was fun, but didn't really dominate my time.

1366
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Ultimately, especially looking back on my youth as well, it doesn't surprise me personally, no.

1367
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Alright. Well, it's a good list, Jason. I think there's a lot of people that would agree with you

1368
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
on those picks.

1369
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Honorable mention?

1370
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Quickly.

1371
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Cook, Serve, Delicious.

1372
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Why?

1373
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:45,000
It reminded me of a Japanese cooking game on a demo disc from many, many years ago, literally

1374
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:54,000
from middle school or so. Very, very cheap, both in flash, the style of the game, and price.

1375
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:58,000
It's just super fun. It's a really, really good game. I suggest everybody check it out.

1376
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
I love that when I get reminded of games in the past. I love that.

1377
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
It just hit me in all the right places.

1378
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Alright. Well, Jason, thank you so much for sharing your list. You have a good one.

1379
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Happy New Year, okay?

1380
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Happy New Year, guys.

1381
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Alright, later.

1382
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Bye.

1383
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Alright, back to you, Shane. I know you're dying to start in on your list here, so give us your number three.

1384
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Well, I'm going to give you all of them because I've got to go do something else while you break that computer.

1385
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Okay, this thing has been falling apart all night. Okay, yes.

1386
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Number three, Destiny. It's a really fun, terribly made game.

1387
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:30,000
He just put it on his top three. You're putting it on your bottom three.

1388
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Yeah, it's my third least favorite game of the year.

1389
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Wow.

1390
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
It feels like a fourth of a game. It's not that good.

1391
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Okay.

1392
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Number two, Legend of Korra. It takes a really amazing show and it's made by Platinum Games, which is a really amazing developer,

1393
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,000
and somehow it turns out to be garbage like every other licensed game.

1394
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:54,000
And then, surprisingly, my number one least favorite game of the year, Pokemon, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire.

1395
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,000
What?

1396
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,000
It's boring the crap out of me. I just have tried so hard to play it.

1397
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Who are you and what did you do with Shane?

1398
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:08,000
I put 200 hours into X and Y. I've put maybe eight hours into Sapphire. I'm not liking it at all.

1399
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I really think it's not a good game.

1400
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
What went wrong? Is this just a cheap cash-in game or what?

1401
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I feel like it is. They gave us a couple new mega evolutions. They changed the story a little bit.

1402
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:22,000
They added some stuff, yet I'm still bored to tears. I cannot bring myself to play it.

1403
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Like, I pick it up and I start to play it and it's boring.

1404
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Wow.

1405
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
So, that's it. I'm leaving. Bye.

1406
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Alright. Bye, Shane. Thanks for sharing your top three most disappointing games of the year.

1407
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
My gosh, I'm surprised to hear that.

1408
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Well, let's go to the phones. We'll take another call. Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1409
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Hey, this is Bobby.

1410
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Bobby, what's up, my friend?

1411
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I just got home. I was listening in the car.

1412
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Welcome home. Glad you were listening in the car.

1413
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I don't know whether I'm supposed to say congratulations, you get a show next week, or I'm sorry to hear you don't get paid.

1414
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
It's congratulations, you get a show next week.

1415
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Alright.

1416
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I do not want to have to watch that again next week.

1417
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Oh, what you went through tonight. Alright. Well, welcome to our show, Bobby.

1418
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I miss talking on Sunday night, so I gotta usurp your time.

1419
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Any time. Any time. Well, you know we are talking about our games of the year, and I'm surprised you don't want to save this for your own show, but by all means, please indulge us.

1420
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Your top three games of the year.

1421
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Okay, so one of the games of the year is one that you've repeated, but the other two you haven't.

1422
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Alright.

1423
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:37,000
So my third game of the year, it's because when I look at game, like for me personally, game of the year, it's something that brings something new and different to the table, or is something that I have had the most fun with.

1424
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Yep.

1425
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
And number three is something that brings something new and different to the table.

1426
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Mm-hmm.

1427
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
And that's fibbage.

1428
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Interesting choice. You know, Shane and I were talking last night about like our games of the year list, and we were actually talking about Jackbox Party Pack, kind of as a whole.

1429
02:00:51,000 --> 02:01:00,000
And that, for me, that is like a bubbling under title, where it would probably make my top ten, but just miss my top three. But I get you. I get you.

1430
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Yeah, and I mean I specifically like fibbage. I probably, you know, I probably get the whole Jackbox Party Pack in general, especially with Drawful if I ever got to play it with more than one other person.

1431
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Right.

1432
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:22,000
But, you know, just something like, you know, that type of gameplay, even though I had some issues with how they did some of the stuff in Jackbox Party Pack, like the controllers in You Don't Know Jack.

1433
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Mm-hmm.

1434
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:30,000
That, you know, that, just that brought something new to the table that I hadn't seen before, and I really like where that's going.

1435
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:37,000
And I'm with you. You know, the Jackbox Party Pack is great. I don't want to knock it. But a lot of you, like Drawful, we have kind of seen that before a little bit.

1436
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Like it's done a different way, but that was a game we'd seen before. Fibbage was something really, really different, I think.

1437
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Yeah.

1438
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
And so it was kind of like the first one that hit big, and then Jackbox kind of like trailed after that in a way.

1439
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Right. And Drawful is fibbage with drawings.

1440
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's true. It's true.

1441
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
All right.

1442
02:01:55,000 --> 02:02:03,000
My number two, and, you know, I know Fifth Dream's in chat. He's like all Oculus list incoming. I really did almost put Time Rifters on the list.

1443
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:10,000
It probably would have been number four, but really, honestly, my number two is, this is the one that you guys have already said, Mario Kart 8.

1444
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Ah. There we go. Somebody finally also put a Wii U game on their list. Thank you.

1445
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Yeah, and it's not Smash Brothers or anything, but Mario Kart 8, just because that was fun, and, you know, it just works, and it worked over the holiday season, no matter what any, you know, reptiles thought or tried.

1446
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:34,000
You know, and just, you know, Mario Kart 8 is just something that I can play with my girlfriend, and, you know, we have a lot of fun with it.

1447
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:40,000
And not many games have that couch multiplayer experience down, and the online experience down.

1448
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:47,000
And, I mean, I like the YouTube thing, even though, you know, some people, you know, would criticize it for its bit rate or whatever crap.

1449
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:57,000
But, you know, just the fact that they did that, the Mario Kart TV, that's kind of neat, and, you know, yes, I know Dark Tetsuya plays it, because that's all I see on Miiverse are all his YouTube postings.

1450
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:05,000
But that's why it's such a good game of the year, is that it's still going after all these months, and I know there's a lot of people out there that are going to be like,

1451
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:12,000
why aren't you talking about Smash Brothers, or why aren't you talking about Bayonetta? And I'm kind of like, there's something about the accessibility level,

1452
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:19,000
and the avalanche that Mario Kart 8 started, that those other two games can't really speak to in the same way.

1453
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:25,000
And I'm not knocking those games. Again, when we talk about bubbling under, both of those other games would make my top ten.

1454
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:31,000
But there's something about Mario Kart 8 that really makes it my number one. I think that YouTube thing in particular, I love.

1455
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:40,000
You know, and sometimes Nintendo does this wrong, and sometimes they do it right, but instead of copying what the other guys do, they march to the beat of their own drum,

1456
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:47,000
and that's Miiverse, and this YouTube thing was, I think, born of that as well, and I think those highlight reels are actually pretty darn amazing.

1457
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
And, you know, my brother, he's not that much of a gamer, but he did just get a PS4 and a Wii U.

1458
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,000
He's a little bit of a gamer, but he's not like, he wouldn't be somebody who listens to our shows or anything.

1459
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Right.

1460
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
But I got a Mario Kart 8 for Christmas.

1461
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Nice.

1462
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:06,000
You know, so that was like the game. He's like, is this really good? I'm like, yes, it's really good. You will enjoy it.

1463
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:14,000
So, you know, that says a lot that, you know, I feel comfortable suggesting it to my, you know, non-hardcore gamer friends.

1464
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Well, I'm gonna check in next Dragon Con and see what he thought.

1465
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Yeah.

1466
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
All right. Well, how about your number one, Bobby Blackwell?

1467
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,000
My number one game is the game nobody here has played.

1468
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I know.

1469
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
And I think it's a shame. It is a crying shame.

1470
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:38,000
And the retweets that I got on the VOG Twitter when I posted about this from the developer mean that they also believe this.

1471
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
The Talos Principle.

1472
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Mm-hmm.

1473
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:47,000
This is, it's a first-person puzzler game. It's, you know, you could say it's like Portal, but A, there's no portals, and B, there's not really that much humor in it.

1474
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:56,000
I almost bought it today, actually. I saw that, and I was like, eh, maybe. It was on, was it that Steam feeds or whatever that they give you, like, some suggestions or something?

1475
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Yeah. And you know what? You know what I say earlier? We can't play everything. We don't have time for everything, but Bobby is explicitly saying, make time for this.

1476
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Yes, and I mean, it's a great puzzler, and it's got a really interesting story underneath.

1477
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Mm-hmm.

1478
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:20,000
And it's not a funny story, but it is a very interesting story, and I mean, it helped me get through the puzzles, because some of those puzzles are damn hard, just to be able to get to the next part of the story.

1479
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Mm-hmm.

1480
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Which is, in games, a lot of times as I get older, I'm like, I don't care why I'm fighting. Just get me to the next fight.

1481
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Right.

1482
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:35,000
And this is a game that, you know, is like, I hate the fact that I have to do these puzzles, because I want to know what happens next in the story.

1483
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Mm-hmm.

1484
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
And these puzzles are damn hard.

1485
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Mm-hmm.

1486
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:43,000
And not as, you know, Portal was a four-hour game. This is, it took me 23 hours the first time to go through it.

1487
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:47,000
This sounds amazing. I love puzzle games, and I'm back.

1488
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Have you, where'd you come from? Have you heard about this game, The Talos Principle?

1489
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
No, but...

1490
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
It's by the serious Sam people.

1491
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Mm-hmm.

1492
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
That means nothing to me.

1493
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:07,000
But it sounds like something I would like to check out, for sure, because I love puzzle games, and making it first person adds a different sort of depth to it that I think would be fun.

1494
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:11,000
And Bobby's saying enough, too many people aren't checking this out. That's the problem.

1495
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:18,000
It got, I gave it an A-plus review on VoG, and the only two bad things were, the puzzles are hard, but get over it.

1496
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Oh, I love that. I love really ridiculous puzzles.

1497
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
And the second one was, you haven't played it yet.

1498
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,000
It's true.

1499
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Wow. Well, that's a good list, Bobby.

1500
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I like that.

1501
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
So there you go.

1502
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:41,000
There you go. Do you want to, now Shane came out with this disappointing list. Do you have any games you want to throw out there that maybe disappointed you a little bit?

1503
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Because I know I have at least one, maybe two.

1504
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:51,000
The security of Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

1505
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Fair enough. Fair enough.

1506
02:06:53,000 --> 02:07:00,000
You know, when we were talking last night about disappointing things, I was going to say, can one of my games start with a hashtag?

1507
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
But then I was like, maybe I don't want to go there.

1508
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I was going to say, there's one I was going to, I haven't played yet, and that's why it's kind of disappointing, was Drive Club, because apparently it was a mess.

1509
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Yeah.

1510
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Yeah? That's a good point. That's a good point.

1511
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Well, actually, and for me, The Crew.

1512
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Oh. Yeah.

1513
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Because The Crew, it's, you know, I mean, I loved a lot of the concepts in it, because The Crew does their online multiplayer a lot like Destiny, which a lot of people don't like, you know, the faux MMO type of thing.

1514
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:34,000
But The Crew is just, it's too difficult if you're playing alone.

1515
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,000
If you're playing with people, at least if one person is good, you can get through if you're in a crew with other people.

1516
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:44,000
But as a single player game, if you're not top notch, you're not going to get far in that.

1517
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:50,000
And that was kind of disappointing to me, because I liked everything about The Crew, except for the difficulty level.

1518
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:57,000
It was just a little bit too much. And there were other people that had the same complaint as I did, so it's not the whole Bobby Black Wolf mode joke, you know, meme that we do.

1519
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Right.

1520
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:07,000
It actually is, it's a legitimately difficult game, which is great for a lot of people, but it does cut out people like me, so it's more of a personal disappointment, maybe not a game disappointment.

1521
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Sure.

1522
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
As much.

1523
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
That's fair. Totally fair.

1524
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Bobby, so great to hear from you. Everybody should check out the Bobby Black Wolf show. You want to tell people quickly about that interview you had tonight, which will be on the podcast feed?

1525
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Yeah, so I interviewed, this was the All Oculus Rift show, because I had an interview scheduled for tonight, and then the sports ball stuff got moved, and I wish it didn't.

1526
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:38,000
And I wish I wasn't there, but that's a whole other story. But it was with Aaron Lemke, he's with Unello Design, and he did a virtual reality experience, a relaxation experience.

1527
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:46,000
So it's not exactly a game, but it is basically, you're floating down a river. And he's done a bunch of these virtual reality experiences, so we talk about that.

1528
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:55,000
We talk about the future of the quote-unquote experience genre, which is not something you see in normal games, because you don't get that type of thing from a monitor.

1529
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:03,000
So we talk about the experience genre, we talk about his games, what's next for him, and reminisce about some old stuff going on.

1530
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:11,000
So we talked for about, I think it was about a 30-minute show, and that was about it, and it aired earlier tonight, and it'll be on the podcast feed later this week.

1531
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And it was a really cool interview, and kind of eye-opening to see his perspective on things.

1532
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:25,000
You know, we're going to get into predictions a little more next week, but just to give you guys kind of a sneak peek of something I really think is going to be true for 2015,

1533
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:33,000
just because Bobby is kind of the VR expert of the network, and going into 2015, one of the things I would probably say,

1534
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I don't know if I would be so bold to say this is a prediction, but I kind of really feel like next year is really the year we're going to see if VR is the next big thing.

1535
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Would you agree with that, or you think, no, Rob, we kind of know the answer to that?

1536
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,000
See, the thing is, I don't know if it's going to be 2015 or 2016 when we'll see it.

1537
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I am not as convinced that a consumer-ready product is going to be available in 2015.

1538
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Because, to be honest, the Oculus consumer-ready version of the Oculus Rift was supposed to be out this holiday season, initially.

1539
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,000
And they bumped it back, and we have no clue. They say 2015? I don't think so.

1540
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Because I see how bad the DevKit 2 runs on my system, and the DevKit 1 ran great on my system.

1541
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:27,000
So I see kind of where they're going with the Gear VR, and see some of the more consumer-focused things that they're doing.

1542
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:32,000
But I still think it's got a long way to go, and I don't think it's going to be in 2015.

1543
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I hope I'm wrong. I absolutely hope I'm wrong, and I hope that it comes in great in 2015 and everybody loves it.

1544
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,000
But I would not be surprised if the consumer VR comes out in 2016.

1545
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Well then, I'm also thinking about Morpheus, a very likely thing that's going to happen in holiday 2015.

1546
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:56,000
But again, it would be fair to say, but we don't know for sure. That also could be something that gets bumped to 2016, you're right.

1547
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:03,000
But if both those devices are out for holiday 2015, I'm so curious to see how the market responds. So curious.

1548
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:10,000
And the good thing that makes me happy is that I did read that Oculus has actually talked to Sony and had meetings with Sony.

1549
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Not because they're working together, but because Oculus actually does not want Sony to quote-unquote poison the well.

1550
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,000
They want to make sure that Sony delivers a good experience, and so they're sharing information with them.

1551
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Specifically because they know, because of the PS4, that the Morpheus will most likely be a lot of people's first introduction to virtual reality.

1552
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
And they don't want them to screw it up.

1553
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:42,000
You know what? One of the highlights of the year in gaming for me personally was just not only getting to play that Morpheus at E3,

1554
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
but getting to really just kind of hang with the developers for a bit. How rockstar was that? That was awesome.

1555
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:53,000
But getting to actually meet them and talk to them, they definitely know what they're doing.

1556
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:59,000
And I think that does not surprise me at all to hear that they are collaborating for the greater good.

1557
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
It doesn't surprise me at all to hear that.

1558
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Right, and it's not that Oculus is providing them tech, but they're saying, hey, this is how we solved a motion sickness problem.

1559
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:13,000
You may want to look into this, because they don't want people to put on the Morpheus and get sick and say,

1560
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
VR sucks, because that hurts everybody.

1561
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:24,000
And Oculus is so worried about somebody poisoning the well that they're actually working with Sony and working with Samsung and stuff

1562
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:31,000
to make sure that the first VR experience that most people have is going to be a good one, even if it's not an Oculus product.

1563
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:37,000
And I'm really happy to see that, and everybody thought that wouldn't happen once Facebook bought them, but look at them now.

1564
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:43,000
How many times has the word Facebook been used in a conversation about Oculus since that initial news?

1565
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Like, it's very rare, so it does seem like Oculus is getting to kind of grow and do their own things. That's great.

1566
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:53,000
But anyway, Bobby, love having you on the show. I do want to let you go so we can get some more people online, though.

1567
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
This was the segment for just the top threes.

1568
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,000
I know, right?

1569
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Everybody call in with more of your top threes, and I hope next year one of our video game jams will be your top three.

1570
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Alright, we'll hope so. See you guys.

1571
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
See ya. Take care, Bobby.

1572
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I have a 1.5, actually.

1573
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
What's that?

1574
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Pixel shits!

1575
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
I seriously considered-

1576
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
It is pixel shits.

1577
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I seriously considered pixel shits for the top three, but I couldn't justify it. It would seem biased.

1578
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Anyway, we're going to get to another call here. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

1579
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

1580
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Hey, Raginator, buddy. How you doing?

1581
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Good, how are you?

1582
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Good. Talking about the top three games of the year. Your three favorite games of 2014 and why, sir?

1583
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Alright, well, I'm going to have to punch my muscle a little bit because I got very few games that actually came out this year, but here goes.

1584
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:54,000
In no particular order, I'm going to have to say Pinball FX2.

1585
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Technically, that game didn't come out this year, but they released DLC for it this year.

1586
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Yeah, a lot of tables come out this year, so a lot of people discover it this year. That's fine.

1587
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Yeah, I particularly like the Venom table, the South Park table, so on and so forth.

1588
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Yeah, those are really great.

1589
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:21,000
My second game would be Geometry Wars 3 Dimensions.

1590
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:27,000
That's a great game. Probably in my top ten as well.

1591
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Yeah, ever since I got rid of my Xbox 360, I've been kind of missing Geometry Wars 2, which is a game that never came to Steam, but Geometry Wars 3 certainly makes up for that.

1592
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Yeah, it's all the same modes, and then some.

1593
02:14:49,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Let's see, I'm trying to find my third game here. Oh yeah, like you guys, I'm dominating Geometry. No, not too.

1594
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:07,000
You liked it so much, you're putting it on your list twice. I'm just kidding.

1595
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Goat Simulator, it's just one of those games that's so weird, it's actually amazing.

1596
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:23,000
This is very interesting that Goat Simulator of all the games from this year is doing very well on the OLR Top 3s all around.

1597
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:29,000
But at the same time I'm also not surprised to hear that. It's just such a quirky, fun, different experience.

1598
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I think that is definitely a common theme you're hearing about a lot of these choices that we're picking.

1599
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Fun. These games are fun. Mario Kart 8 is fun. Goat Simulator is fun. Dragon Age is heartbreaking.

1600
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:50,000
But that's fun for some people. So there it is. Scaring the shit out of your friends in Five Nights at Freddy's is fun.

1601
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Which is what you're doing tonight after the show.

1602
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
No, I have to work tomorrow.

1603
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
It doesn't matter, so you can cry yourself to sleep.

1604
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Alright, so anyway, Spaznator, thank you very much for sharing your list. I know you probably are getting a real kick out of the Steam sales going on right now, right?

1605
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Well, I'm trying to. I'm basically broke, so I can't really buy anything per se.

1606
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:29,000
The only reason I even got some of the games I do is because I've been selling some of the trading cards for Nickel here, Dynair, and you know, sending out games that way.

1607
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:41,000
In fact, I've got pretty much everyone gear cracked for Christmas. I've given everyone something a little bit more substantial, but it's the best I could do.

1608
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Games that game, and sometimes the really cheap ones actually are a lot of fun. About a year ago this time, Super Hexagon was what, like 29 cents, and that game was amazing.

1609
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:59,000
So I will say this though, if you are able to squeeze out like $2, I think it's like $1.50, that love game I talked about earlier is pretty rad and is worth a look.

1610
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
101.

1611
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:06,000
You know, $1.01. If you can squeeze out a dollar and a penny, that might be a game to check out.

1612
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Anyway, my friend, I gotta let you go to try and squeeze some more calls in, but thanks so much for calling and sharing.

1613
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Sure.

1614
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Take care.

1615
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Have a good one.

1616
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
You too, buddy. Bye-bye.

1617
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Alright, we have some more calls coming. People want to share their lists, and I don't blame them whatsoever, so we have another call on the line. Let's get to it.

1618
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1619
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Hey, what's up? This is Kaijuto.

1620
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Hey, Kaijuto. I love your avatar. You got a Heathcliff now, right?

1621
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Yeah, that's one of my, not one of my, but probably my favorite cartoon of all time.

1622
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Can you still sing the theme song?

1623
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I can sing it, but I still don't know what the hell the words are. There's some parts to it where I'm like, what the hell are they singing?

1624
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
What if Heathcliff, no one should terrorize his neighborhood? Alright, anyway.

1625
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Yeah, there's a part where they show Hector Wordsworth in Mongo, and there's something about Speedy something.

1626
02:17:51,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I never knew what the hell they said to this day, and I kind of don't want to know because it'll probably ruin my childhood because I have just fond memories just remembering being a kid trying to figure out what the hell they're saying in that song.

1627
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:06,000
So I don't know. I can easily Google the lyrics, but I actually don't want to.

1628
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:12,000
We all have that rap from our childhood. It's just better off. We don't understand. For me, it's Paula Abdul's Cold Hearted.

1629
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Just today, I learned part of the lyrics to M.I.A.'s Paper Planes. I'm like, I thought that was something else, and I'm like, oh, that's what they're saying. Okay.

1630
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Or the rap in Erasure's version of Take a Chance on Me. Like, literally, what the hell is she saying? Anyway, we could talk about these raps all day, but we want to talk about your top three games of 2014.

1631
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
So, Kaijuto, you're number three, and why?

1632
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:40,000
My number three is going to be Fantasy Life for the Nintendo 3DS.

1633
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Interesting.

1634
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I don't know if any of you ever played it, but it's a great game. It kind of flew under the radar, and I'm just having a ton of fun with it. I don't see myself ever stop playing this game for a while.

1635
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:05,000
I have heard a lot of good things about it. I've not checked it out personally myself. I always think people are talking about Tomodachi Life, but I realize they're very different games.

1636
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Because, actually, I've got to say, Tomodachi Life would probably be on my list of three disappointments. If I had done a list of three disappointments, that particular game would have shown up there.

1637
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:19,000
But, anyway, I don't want to digress, because they are very different games, and I've heard a lot of great things about Fantasy Life.

1638
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Basically, it's like an MMO in your pocket. It runs like any of your standard MMOs, but it just has a lot of charm to it.

1639
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I love the job system in it, because you can change jobs whenever you want. You can explore with your friends locally or online.

1640
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I think there's even voice chat. I'm not 100% sure, but I think it might have voice chat in it as well.

1641
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:51,000
The story is great. This is probably one of the first games I've ever played that's all text-based, where I actually sat there and read everything.

1642
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Usually, I'll just start pressing B or A just to skip everything, because it's always the same story. The guy loses his memory, he has to regain it, and he meets all these characters.

1643
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:09,000
It's always that. It still has that stuff. You don't know who you are, but it's actually pretty funny. A lot of dialogue in it. There's a little butterfly that follows you. She's really funny.

1644
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Well, my shopping list is growing thanks to tonight's show, but we'll move right along and get your number two game of the year and why.

1645
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:25,000
My number two is actually two games, but I believe that they're kind of like companions, so I'm just going to say Smash Brothers for the 3DS and Smash Brothers for the Nintendo Wii.

1646
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Fair enough. I would agree with that notion, so why these games?

1647
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Just for the simple fact that they did something to Smash Brothers that I didn't think they could actually do, and that was just make it fun all over again.

1648
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:52,000
It feels like I'm playing it back on the GameCube again. I played the other Smash Brothers before that, and they just felt like a continuation, but this one actually feels like a fresh new game.

1649
02:20:52,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I don't know how they actually did that, because it's actually the same game that's been around since 1999 or 2000, but it just feels new and fresh.

1650
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:09,000
It's not so much the 8-player Smash. I don't really play that, but it's just something about it that makes it feel new and fresh. Maybe it's because it's on the Wii U.

1651
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:16,000
It just feels different. It doesn't feel like past Smash Brothers games, not even the Wii Smash Brothers games.

1652
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I hear you. Your number one game of the year and why?

1653
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Pokemon Ruby and Alpha Shalfike.

1654
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Wow! Even though Shane said it was a huge disappointment. Interesting.

1655
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Super huge disappointment.

1656
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Let's hear Kai's end of it. Why your number one?

1657
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:40,000
I actually called Black Wolf and told him that I wasn't having fun with it, but after you play it for a while, after you get involved and you start to mess around with the...

1658
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I don't know what the hell it is. I don't know if it's a damn Pokedex or whatever, but it's stuff that you collect that allows you to sneak around and catch Pokemon and you can see invisible Pokemon.

1659
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:57,000
There's a lot of different gadgets. I'm just going to say the gadgets that they give you in this one, it helps you a lot more in the Pokemon games.

1660
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:06,000
If you're into breeding and training like I am, this is the game you're going to want to breed and train Pokemon on, because they make it so easy.

1661
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:12,000
I know that X and Y had the super training, and it's basically the same super training from X and Y.

1662
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:24,000
But with the other enhancements, like I said, actually going out there and being able to find the particular Pokemon that you want and also knowing what their stats are going to be like before you catch them, I think that's huge for Pokemon.

1663
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Because a lot of Pokemon, basically it was almost like if you were going into the store and you were buying those random decks of booster packs for Yu-Gi-Oh! or Magic the Gathering, you never really knew what you were going to get.

1664
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:39,000
But this one, you actually get a preview of what you're going to get. The more you put into the game, the more you're going to get out of the game.

1665
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:46,000
So if you're not really dedicated in putting your effort into the game, you're not going to really get much out of it. You've got to really put an effort into it.

1666
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Plus, the number one thing, which I'm not the biggest Pokemon fan, so it didn't get me excited right away, but now that I know what it's about, I'm actually pretty excited about it.

1667
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:05,000
You can catch pretty much almost every single legendary that's been in the game, all in that one game. Almost all of them.

1668
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I think that's what Shane will be able to tell me, but I think there's a few that you're not going to be able to get which were promotional or something.

1669
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:21,000
But pretty much a lot of the Pokemon that were on the covers of all the other previous Pokemon games, you can catch them in this game, along with X and Y.

1670
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:24,000
It sounds like you're just not giving it a good enough shot. Eight hours is not enough.

1671
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Actually, I'm in 13 hours. I just turned it on the scene.

1672
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
You turned it on. Well, he did turn it on.

1673
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I'm trying to make it not my number one, and for the reasons you said, I understand why people like it.

1674
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:42,000
And there's some cool, like those aspects are pretty cool, but overall, I still think it's just a cash grab that I just disappointed.

1675
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Do you think part of it is just because you played the story already? Like this? I've never played the original.

1676
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:53,000
But this was like how many years ago did it come out? It came out like back when, a long time ago.

1677
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Back when a long time ago. And I just, this story, after playing X and Y, I thought that story was pretty good.

1678
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:07,000
This one is just really dull, and there's technically really no new Pokemon. And that's why I play them.

1679
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:11,000
All right, you know what though, Kaiju, your list is your list, and nobody can tell you it's wrong.

1680
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
So I appreciate you calling and sharing with us, and happy gaming.

1681
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Yep, same to you.

1682
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
All right, happy new year. We'll see you next time.

1683
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Happy new year.

1684
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Later.

1685
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:25,000
All right, I do not see the phones lighting. Actually, I think I saw one more person trying to get through, so I will see if that person comes back through.

1686
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
What's that? Yeah, that's what I thought.

1687
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:34,000
So we'll try to leave it open here. 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1688
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:38,000
And then when we wrap this up, we will take it over to the rest of the stories.

1689
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,000
And then we'll see what time we have for Skype calls at the end. We might actually be getting our fill here.

1690
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:46,000
We do have another call coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1691
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Hey, hey, guess who?

1692
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Hey, it's Rama, and I see it, but I don't just see Rama.

1693
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,000
That's right.

1694
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Nope.

1695
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
It's also Giovedea.

1696
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Yep.

1697
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,000
And her pussy.

1698
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,000
I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.

1699
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Her cat, people. It's her pussy cat.

1700
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:07,000
She's petting live on air.

1701
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,000
She's petting live on air, but it's okay because it's a cat.

1702
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
I'm petting my pussy live on air.

1703
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,000
God.

1704
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Is it purring?

1705
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Yes, he purrs like a race car.

1706
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:27,000
All right. All right, kids. Well, you know what the topic is tonight. It's the top three games of 2014.

1707
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
So you guys, what are your top three and why?

1708
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
You want to go first?

1709
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
By all means, you go first.

1710
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,000
All right.

1711
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Well, you know, Rob, I'm a casual gamer, so I got to play as I travel or I got to sit down in front of the console and just play for a few minutes and then pick up the game later.

1712
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:50,000
So number three would be the Lego movie, The Game.

1713
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Nice. You're actually not the first one I've heard put it in like a top ten. A lot of people seem to really dig this game.

1714
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Why? What's your why behind that?

1715
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Besides the fact that the game, the movie was fun, the game is very simple. You sit there, you build things and you go through it.

1716
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
It's very simple. Just pick up and play at any given time.

1717
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Plus, as you know, with almost every single Lego game, the replay value is just out of this world.

1718
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Mm hmm. That's true. Very true.

1719
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Do you have a day? How about you? You're number three.

1720
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:27,000
My number three is a phone game, actually. Doctor Who Legacy.

1721
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Okay. You know what? We're not getting a lot of iOS and Android games.

1722
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,000
That's pretty fun.

1723
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Here in the top three. So what's your why on Doctor Who Legacy?

1724
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:44,000
My why is probably the fact that you can capture characters and get characters from the series.

1725
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
And I'm a huge Doctor Who nerd.

1726
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Mm hmm.

1727
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:54,000
But some of the skins for the characters that you can get, especially the ones that they did for their 25 Days of Christmas.

1728
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Mm hmm.

1729
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:06,000
They went and did some 8-bit skins, different, like they've gone past into the classic Who and did skins from the classic Who.

1730
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:13,000
So I really enjoyed that aspect of it. Plus it's, you know, a little bit of a puzzle. So I like it.

1731
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Hey, I don't know if you guys can hear it, but we're hearing like a high pitched ringing or something.

1732
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:20,000
And I'm not I don't hear it because we're on speakers here in studio.

1733
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:24,000
So it doesn't bother me as much. But I guess those are listening on headphones can really hear it.

1734
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,000
And it's like, really?

1735
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
I could hear it.

1736
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Yeah. Interesting. I don't know.

1737
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Well, it might be because I'm rebuilding Mako Chun's computer and it's right next to us.

1738
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
That might be the case.

1739
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
That could be part of it.

1740
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I apologize. I'm sorry.

1741
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,000
It also so so we'll have to hurry through this. So you're number two, Rama.

1742
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Number two, I'll enjoy my music games. So number two will be Final Fantasy Theater Rhythm Curtain Call.

1743
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Good pick. Why?

1744
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:56,000
It's just fun. It's very simple to play. You know, just tap and follow, tap and follow.

1745
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Plus, I like some of the newer music and the fact that the new DLC is going to more Square Enix titles.

1746
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:07,000
A freaking Chrono Trigger song came out this week. I didn't think we were going to get that in America.

1747
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Merry Christmas from Square.

1748
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Yes.

1749
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Seriously. Jovidaya, you're number two and why?

1750
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:18,000
My number two, I only just got it this year. So Deadpool, because it's Deadpool.

1751
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Deadpool. Oh, my God. I love the part when he's in the elevator rocking out.

1752
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:29,000
And changing out the little box covering his bits.

1753
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
That was that was possibly my favorite reasoning I've heard for why a game is on somebody's top three.

1754
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Deadpool, because it's Deadpool.

1755
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Yeah.

1756
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Like, come at me. Come out. How are you going to respond to that? How are you going to respond? You can't. You can't.

1757
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Deadpool.

1758
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
All right. Last but not least, number one, Sarama.

1759
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Number one. Well, as most people know, besides music games and RPGs, my one thing is puzzle games.

1760
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:58,000
You put a puzzle game in front of me, I will just keep playing it until I can't play it no more or until my battery dies on my phone.

1761
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:02,000
So my number one pick would have to be Diamond Digger Saga.

1762
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I don't even know this game. Diamond Digger Saga. Why this of all the puzzle games out there?

1763
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Because it's the way the way it plays.

1764
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:19,000
You're pretty much clearing up bricks, waters coming down to collect the different items to gain points.

1765
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
And then some of the levels, you're just clearing out diamonds and rubies for a massive amount of points.

1766
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
It's just fun. It's fun, dammit. It's fun.

1767
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:32,000
And I tell you this, I enjoy this more than I do the Candy Crush one because I got tired of that one.

1768
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:36,000
I hit level 385 and I said, the hell with this. I'm done.

1769
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I still can't believe you of all people are my Candy Crush addicted friends. I just, oh my God, I can't. I can't with you.

1770
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,000
You shouldn't support them though because of how they stole from...

1771
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Well, he did. He quit.

1772
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Good.

1773
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:53,000
All right. All right. Last but not least, your number one.

1774
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Do you have a idea?

1775
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:57,000
My number one is South Park Stick of Truth.

1776
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Oh, that's a good pick. And again, one of those ones that came out earlier in the year. And, you know, there's been a lot of...

1777
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I forgot that was this year.

1778
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Yeah, right. There's been a lot of Ubisoft booze in the past few months between the Assassin's Creed mess up and the new Tetris.

1779
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:16,000
And, you know, there's been a lot of stuff where people are getting irritated with them.

1780
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:21,000
But earlier in the year, they were really knocking it out of the park between a Child of Light and the South Park game.

1781
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,000
But what's the why for you on that?

1782
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:33,000
I got the original South Park game for Nintendo 64 and played the hell out of that game.

1783
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Yeah.

1784
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:38,000
So I was looking for a South Park game that was going to remind me of that.

1785
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:49,000
And while this isn't exactly that, it does bring in a lot of those elements that made that game so crazy.

1786
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:54,000
There's a reason why Trey Parker won an acting award for that game. Let's just leave it at that.

1787
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Yup.

1788
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Amazing. Well, you guys, I have to let you go so we can get rid of that little buzzing we're hearing.

1789
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
But thank you guys so much for calling in and sharing. I love the group call.

1790
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:05,000
Enjoy.

1791
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Best of luck with Anime Jam Session in 2015. We'll miss you guys until you're back.

1792
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Thanks.

1793
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Heart.

1794
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Take care, hearts.

1795
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
From all of us here at O.L.R. Happy New Year.

1796
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Happy.

1797
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,000
All right. So good to hear from them. I love that. A combo call.

1798
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:24,000
All right. That's a good one to end our Skype segment for now on.

1799
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:34,000
But we'll open it up briefly a little later just in case you guys want to comment on any of the other news.

1800
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,000
But we're only going to open it for a little bit.

1801
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:40,000
But if somebody didn't get through that wants to give their top three, we can fit that in as well a little later.

1802
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:43,000
We actually have just some other quick, quick news to get through here.

1803
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:47,000
And we got to get, you know, the FUs of the week and check in with Jamie if anybody ever e-mailed us.

1804
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Let's get to all that right now.

1805
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Loki, some more news for us.

1806
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:57,000
So PlayStation Now is hitting yet some more devices starting the first half of 2015.

1807
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:04,000
So if you don't happen to own a PlayStation 3 or Vita or a Vita TV or PlayStation TV, however you're going to call it.

1808
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
It's also going to be coming to smart TVs.

1809
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Starting out with the Samsung smart TVs.

1810
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:16,000
And they're going to even have the functionality of, you know, all the functionality of PlayStation Now.

1811
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Including, you know, trophies, cloud saves and online multiplayer.

1812
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:26,000
And apparently they're not sure when exactly it's going to launch.

1813
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I'm assuming that you're going to probably need some sort.

1814
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Maybe, oh, it looks like, yeah, it supports the DualShock 4 out of the box.

1815
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,000
So you would have to buy a DualShock 4, but then you'd be able to play with that.

1816
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:42,000
That's pretty cool, actually, that they're going to have that.

1817
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I'm still waiting for when they actually have streaming PlayStation 4 games on there.

1818
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:50,000
And also when it becomes more affordable.

1819
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:54,000
And if they had some sort of monthly thing where I could get whatever I want.

1820
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Still, the fact that they're building that into TVs.

1821
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:01,000
I mean, I don't think these are the types of TVs that a lot of people are going to buy.

1822
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:05,000
These are more the high-end TVs, but that's still pretty impressive.

1823
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Well, the fact that it's on a smart TV, though, most of these smart TVs run off of Android.

1824
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:13,000
And I know that I've already seen some stuff leaked out there.

1825
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:22,000
I don't think there's an official app for it, but I've seen people using, you know, even like the streaming to Android devices.

1826
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Not necessarily PlayStation Now, but like with Share, not SharePlay, whatever they call that.

1827
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:31,000
I don't remember now, on the Vita, where you can stream remote play.

1828
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Yeah, remote play.

1829
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1830
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Yeah, very cool.

1831
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:43,000
All right, well, speaking of PlayStation, some folks may be interested in a sexy red PlayStation 4.

1832
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:46,000
Sadly, not something that's coming here in the U.S.

1833
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Didn't they do like a red PS3 in Canada?

1834
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,000
I seem to remember that one year, because it looked really awesome.

1835
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
And this one looks awesome, too, but it's only in Japan.

1836
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Still, some of you might be importing it or trying to get a hold of that controller.

1837
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I don't know.

1838
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:04,000
But Japan is getting a red PlayStation 4 released on March 19, 2015.

1839
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:08,000
It is to go along with Final Fantasy Type 0.

1840
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:17,000
In fact, that little faceplate type thing or the thing on the side that you can pop off, that actually has a Final Fantasy Type 0 little logo on it as well.

1841
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:22,000
If you want to get one, though, it's going to cost you about $392 plus tax.

1842
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:26,000
That's converted from 46,980 yen.

1843
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Also, a red DualShock with that.

1844
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
15 days of PlayStation Plus.

1845
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:36,000
And, of course, a code for Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, allowing you to download that online.

1846
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:42,000
And the Final Fantasy 15 episode, Dusque, or whatever, however that's pronounced.

1847
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Duska? Dusque?

1848
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
The Final Fantasy 15 demo.

1849
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,000
There's also a unique PlayStation 4 theme that apparently comes with that.

1850
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:55,000
I would like to know why we still don't have the Final Fantasy 14 PlayStation 4 theme here that Japan got.

1851
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Japan gets all the cool stuff.

1852
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
You guys.

1853
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Anyway.

1854
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Nothing about that PlayStation 4 coming out over here.

1855
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Although people do sure seem to love their limited PlayStation 4s over here, too.

1856
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:10,000
If that PS1 PS4 is any indication.

1857
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
That thing sold out within seconds.

1858
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,000
That's pretty crazy.

1859
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
So there might be a demand for this as well.

1860
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
You know, crazy little side story.

1861
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:21,000
When I went to the movie, I mentioned I went to the movies on Christmas Day.

1862
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:24,000
With Shane, we went and saw Mockingjay, which was great.

1863
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:29,000
But I don't know if you noticed during those commercials that they were showing before the movie, there was a lot of video game representation.

1864
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
There was a commercial for Smash Brothers Wii U, right?

1865
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,000
But there was a commercial for Final Fantasy Type 0.

1866
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Yeah, I had no idea. I wasn't noticing because I definitely didn't point it out a couple times while we were sitting there.

1867
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I know, right? But that's still kinda...

1868
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:45,000
It took me by surprise that we were seeing that in the movie theater.

1869
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I had seen the Smash Brothers one already in another movie. I don't remember which one.

1870
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:55,000
But yeah, the Type 0 one for it being kinda still far away in a sense.

1871
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
That did catch me off guard.

1872
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Yeah, and the fact that they actually mentioned the Final Fantasy XV demo as well was kind of surprising.

1873
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Yeah, and then it was at Amazon.

1874
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Yeah. So that was just kind of a random little aside there.

1875
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:12,000
There you go. If you want to get the red PlayStation 4, it will be available in Japan.

1876
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:17,000
We would usually, at this portion of the show, open up the mailbag.

1877
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com. I'm sorry.

1878
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Wow, Rob. It's only been like six months since we changed the address.

1879
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Yeah, Rob. Get with the program.

1880
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place where you can send us emails.

1881
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Precipitate.

1882
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Not precipitate. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

1883
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Persephone taint.

1884
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Is where you can... Precipity's taint? What about? Okay.

1885
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com is the place where you can send emails every week,

1886
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:47,000
and Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag head first and read some of her favorite emails here on air.

1887
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
However, Dark Soccer, how's the mailbag look tonight?

1888
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I landed on my ass. Not a damn thing.

1889
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Well, so much for the mailbag segment tonight.

1890
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,000
You people are not sending me any emails.

1891
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Well, here's the thing. I know there's a group of you that can't be here Sunday night,

1892
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,000
and you listen during the week on the podcast feed via Stitcher, iTunes, or whatever.

1893
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Thank you for your support, even though you can't be here live.

1894
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
You can send us your top three and why.

1895
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Do the thing, and Rob will read it next week.

1896
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
We'll get Shane to read the mail.

1897
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
And if you want to participate with Shane's...

1898
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
I would, but I might not be here next week.

1899
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
It doesn't work.

1900
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
He works later, so...

1901
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,000
I'm not there now.

1902
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:36,000
But if you want to participate with Shane, you can also do your three most disappointing games of the year and why.

1903
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,000
It's more fun to say your disappointing ones, because you have to really think.

1904
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Okay, just for example, in the studio tonight, how many of our favorite games overlapped?

1905
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:48,000
A lot.

1906
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:54,000
And there are so many other games that wouldn't make your top list, but there's tons of games that can make your bottom list.

1907
02:37:55,000 --> 02:38:01,000
So you're trying to say that we have to decide if we want to be a top or a bottom? Is that what you're trying to say?

1908
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,000
You are disgusting. That's what I decided.

1909
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Alright. Anyway, I'm trying to think of three disappointing ones for me.

1910
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,000
The new Tetris game, for sure, would be on my list.

1911
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:20,000
That actually kind of pisses me off, how you can screw up Tetris. That's on my list, for sure.

1912
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I was reminded that the Final Fantasy VI remakes for iOS and Android...

1913
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:27,000
Did you play it, though?

1914
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Yes.

1915
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Oh, you did? Okay. Because I think you have to at least play it before you say it's terrible.

1916
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Not my cup of tea.

1917
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
I didn't like Octodad that much.

1918
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Really?

1919
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
Yeah.

1920
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Well, that's too bad.

1921
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
It's cute, and I like making fun of it, but I didn't really care for it.

1922
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:49,000
You could throw Warlords of Draenor on there for the same reason I did Destiny. Like, it's not a bad game. It's just not good.

1923
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I would feel bad. Well, but it is the best expansion since Wrath of the Lich King. I can't, even though I may have canceled WoW this week.

1924
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
The Sims 4.

1925
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Really?

1926
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Because when it was released, it didn't have much...

1927
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
No pools.

1928
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:10,000
There were no pools and hardly any furnitures or outfits or anything, and I just didn't want to give it another chance.

1929
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I watched a bunch of playthroughs and people playing it before I was going to decide if it was going to get my money, and it didn't.

1930
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Interesting. Interesting.

1931
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:25,000
All right, well, we don't have any email tonight, and we're getting into this talk about disappointing.

1932
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:31,000
You know, I really think it's the cue to get into the FUs of the week.

1933
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

1934
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
This is fucked up.

1935
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Dark Sakura.

1936
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:54,000
FU to my stomach for being so full. Damn Chinese food. It's so delicious, though.

1937
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:58,000
And there's still dim sum left, and people aren't eating it. Why?

1938
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
I'm full. I'm so full.

1939
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:07,000
You're the one that said, hooray, I'll have leftovers.

1940
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:08,000
All right, Loki.

1941
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Loki, your FUs of the week.

1942
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:14,000
How did I get so many Steam games? That's what I want to know.

1943
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I have 321 games, most of which have not been played.

1944
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I was trying to find out the exact amount, but Steam isn't working correctly, so fuck you to Steam for being stupid derpy right now.

1945
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Your addiction is affecting your life negatively in the following ways.

1946
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Yes, Dark Sakura?

1947
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
I actually just thought of another honorable mention.

1948
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:33,000
For a game of the year?

1949
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Borderlands the pre-sequel. It was really fucking good.

1950
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Okay, now I'm done.

1951
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Shame on you for forgetting that whole time. FU to Jamie for being...

1952
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Let's see, my FU of the week goes to the fact that I have to work tomorrow.

1953
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,000
I mean, I like my job and everything. Don't get me wrong. Please don't fire me.

1954
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:54,000
But, oh my gosh, it's so hard after a holiday break to have to go back tomorrow.

1955
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:59,000
If I didn't work tomorrow, I would stream Five Nights at Freddy's or something tonight, but I can't, so...

1956
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
You still could. Again, cry yourself to sleep. It'll work.

1957
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
How long has he really got to stream for me?

1958
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:09,000
No, like 20 minutes, and you'll die so many times.

1959
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
I have to be up at 6 AM tomorrow.

1960
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Oh, boohoo.

1961
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
Yeah, boohoo.

1962
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
Oh, poor baby.

1963
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Poor me, I know. I have a love life.

1964
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
6 AM? Oh, that's like sleeping in.

1965
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Alright, Shane, do you have any FUs of the week you want to get out of your stream?

1966
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:34,000
FU2 working, like, what basically amounts to 11 hour days for the past three days, and the next two days, and then a small break, and then doing it all over again.

1967
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
It's very tiring.

1968
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Alright. There it is. Your FUs of the week.

1969
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Jason in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying,

1970
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:51,000
How did I get so many games? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Too many bundles and kickstarters.

1971
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:55,000
But Jason also says five days off has been amazing. I agree. Five days off has been amazing.

1972
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:01,000
If only I could get, like, another week, like a lot of my coworkers have. Oh well. It is what it is.

1973
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we will quickly open the Skype line for any other comments you want to throw out there on tonight's show.

1974
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
But then we're going to wrap up here. So, Loki.

1975
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Alright, so, um, excuse me.

1976
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:23,000
This is kind of interesting, I guess. You know how they kind of frown upon, you know, having emulators and stuff on, you know, iOS?

1977
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Well, there's another one that snuck on there.

1978
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:33,000
And it's in the form of a program called Floppy Cloud. Yes, you've got to hate that name.

1979
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:38,000
But Floppy Cloud is basically supposed to be some sort of file management app.

1980
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Which, you know, is supposed to let you manage files, but also allows you to connect to your Dropbox account and load ROMs.

1981
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:57,000
Which, when you manage one of the Super NES or NES ROMs, it also happens to manage to pull up an emulator for said ROM.

1982
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:08,000
So you can check it out before they pull it. It's $1.99 on the iOS store, and it looks like it's pretty easy to actually do that.

1983
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Already gone, and it was gone by the time this story was making its way around the blogs.

1984
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Which, you've got to hand it to the guys who tried to sneak it in.

1985
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:22,000
They put it up on the day that Apple was closing all the submissions for the holidays.

1986
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Where they were going on the break or whatever, and it still got pulled.

1987
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Even though somebody had to come in on their day off to pull that game.

1988
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:32,000
So you're not going to be able to get that. That's why Nintendo has lobbyists.

1989
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Okay, well, that's funny about the emulator, but technically those are illegal.

1990
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:46,000
But it does also go to show that even though Apple screens everything before it goes on the store, they can't catch everything.

1991
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
That's not the first time an emulator snuck through.

1992
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:53,000
It's hard to imagine it's a file management software.

1993
02:43:53,000 --> 02:44:03,000
This whole thing was deceptive. The creators who did it probably had the intent of sneaking on an emulator onto the iOS.

1994
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:11,000
They did it, but who knows at what price. I'm sure they lost their Apple license or whatever, all that.

1995
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Anyhow, one more story for you guys, and this is pretty awesome.

1996
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:23,000
I guess what's going on is that there is a remake going on of this game.

1997
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:28,000
I don't know much about this game, but I've seen some stuff on YouTube, and it's kind of like batshit crazy for lack of a better term.

1998
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:35,000
This is the type of game that Jamie probably knows stuff about because it's crazy. It's called LSD Dream Emulator.

1999
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Oh, yes.

2000
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Of course you know this one. It was on the PlayStation, and I didn't know a lot about this game.

2001
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:44,000
I somehow missed this, but you can see some stuff on YouTube about it.

2002
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:56,000
I don't even know how to describe this game. When you call it a dream emulator, it's basically like a bad LSD trip, but on PlayStation 1 style graphics.

2003
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
So you know it's all polygon.

2004
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:06,000
You were supposed to walk through these different levels of this guy's freaky dream. It was really, really just a weird game.

2005
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I've even heard of this game.

2006
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
There's full playthroughs of it online.

2007
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Well, I don't know much about this game, but you can actually check out the remake that is in alpha right now.

2008
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:30,000
It's been being remade since 2011, actually. You can check it out at lsdrevamped.net, and they actually have a PayPal and a Patreon trying to fund this.

2009
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Because eventually, we get a kick out of this, they want to bring it to the Oculus Rift, which you're going to send somebody to the hospital with that.

2010
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Damn, there's no OS X version yet.

2011
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Not yet, not yet. So there you go. That's pretty cool.

2012
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:50,000
So good luck to the folks trying to remake that. Just don't get anybody killed.

2013
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Alright, there it is. That's it for our gaming news tonight.

2014
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:01,000
I am going to open up the Skype line real quick for anybody else that wants to share their top 3s or anything else that we might not have covered tonight.

2015
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:07,000
So that is open right now at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2016
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:11,000
I thought I'd check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute stories.

2017
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
There is actually. It's pretty decent.

2018
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Apparently, AMD is building chips for a console that's going to debut in 2016.

2019
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Oooh.

2020
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Yes, so...

2021
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
UYATU!

2022
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:33,000
They haven't said what it is yet, but...

2023
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:37,000
There's a lot of people that are probably instantly assuming it's Nintendo, but you know what?

2024
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Even though Shane made a joke over there, don't count out that it's somebody else doing a console that you might not have even thought of yet.

2025
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Yeah, so that'll be interesting to see what exactly that is.

2026
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Maybe that Apple console finally? I don't know.

2027
02:46:58,000 --> 02:46:59,000
You never know.

2028
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is pretty much the last call.

2029
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
It's Philips! They're coming back!

2030
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
Philips CDI 2.

2031
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:13,000
All that money they didn't win off the patent lawsuit. They're going to fund a new console with it.

2032
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
You know what my number one game should have been?

2033
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Huh?

2034
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:17,000
You would say no still.

2035
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:18,000
What?

2036
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
So we couldn't too, because it got re-released this year.

2037
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Okay, Jamie, before the show, you told me you were going to put a different game on your list that's in a very similar category.

2038
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
And I said, you do what you want. It's your list.

2039
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I was going to do The Bourbon.

2040
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:35,000
You told me I couldn't when we were talking about it last night.

2041
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
No, you never said you needed a sweet code too.

2042
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Yes, I did. It would have been my number one, two, and three.

2043
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Well, fine.

2044
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
And honorable mentions.

2045
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
You can change your list, though.

2046
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Nope, it's already been recorded.

2047
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,000
I ruined everything.

2048
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,000
As usual.

2049
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Wham.

2050
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
All right.

2051
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Well, while I wait one more minute here, see if we get any calls, I will mention next week on the show, we're going to be doing our predictions.

2052
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
We're going to bring Listless back tomorrow.

2053
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Some folks asked why we didn't do Listless tonight.

2054
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Tomorrow?

2055
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:04,000
I'm sorry, next week.

2056
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Some people asked why we didn't do...

2057
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Bitch, I won't be here.

2058
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:09,000
I'll just be doing a show by myself.

2059
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Poor Lonely Rob.

2060
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
It's the Lonely Rob Roberts show.

2061
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Rob is the lonely island.

2062
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:18,000
I'm so bored, I guess I'll play Five Nights at Freddy's.

2063
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Now I'm bored and scared.

2064
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
You know what, Rob?

2065
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
What?

2066
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:28,000
If you decided to do Five Nights at Freddy's, I would stay here with a blanket and cookies to comfort you in your fear.

2067
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Aw, I'd almost do that for the cookies, actually.

2068
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:31,000
And then I would throw up.

2069
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:32,000
All right.

2070
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Next week on the show, we're going to be doing predictions for 2015, and we're going to look back at the 2014 Listless that we did and see what actually came true from that list.

2071
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
And see what happened there.

2072
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:51,000
And laugh about how stupid we were a year ago, and then we'll do it all over again for next year.

2073
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:52,000
How's that sound?

2074
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,000
And the cycle will just repeat itself.

2075
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,000
Sounds fun.

2076
02:48:54,000 --> 02:49:05,000
As we go into our lucky 13th year of broadcasting here at Orange Laundry, that's right, June of 2015 is our 13th anniversary.

2077
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Wow.

2078
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:10,000
This show becomes a teenager next year, if you can believe it.

2079
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
All right.

2080
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Well, nobody's calling in, so I guess we will start to wrap up the show.

2081
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:19,000
We heard from so many of you earlier anyway with your top three.

2082
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:24,000
If for whatever reason you were just slow on the get-go there and you didn't get through, you can always send us an e-mail.

2083
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Participate at orangelaundryradio.com, or you can send us a tweet, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

2084
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:32,000
The FUGL question additionally will return next week.

2085
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:37,000
We are about to 9 o'clock anyway, so it is about wrapping up time here at Orange Laundry Radio.

2086
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:41,000
I want to thank all you guys for listening to the show and supporting independent radio.

2087
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Thank you very much for your support throughout 2014.

2088
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:48,000
You know, we've accomplished a lot of awesome things this year.

2089
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:54,000
We went to a lot more conventions and did a lot of very awesome things at places like Dragon Con.

2090
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:59,000
I look forward very much to attending shows like PAX East next year I'm going to finally be returning to.

2091
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:02,000
And some other cons will be back at Dragon Con 2015 as well.

2092
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:09,000
And just, you know, continuing to get out there, have fun, meet people, hang out, and, you know, talk games.

2093
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:10,000
That's what it's all about.

2094
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
So thank you guys for being here and being along for the ride.

2095
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:16,000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2096
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Help spread the word because, you know, again, we don't have any giant website or magazine or something backing us.

2097
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,000
All we've got is ourselves, so please help spread the word.

2098
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:34,000
A nice five-star review on a site like iTunes or Stitcher goes a very long way as well in helping us to get noticed.

2099
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
So we appreciate all of that support.

2100
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Let's go around now and get everybody's final thoughts of 2014 here on this last live show at VOG Network for 2014.

2101
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Anime Jam Session is going to be off from the live show this week.

2102
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:52,000
They're doing a pre-taped thing, so we are the last live show of 2014, believe it or not.

2103
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:55,000
So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2104
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Shane, since you sat in on the last bit of the show here, thanks for crashing the show. Appreciate it.

2105
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Yeah.

2106
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Bringing a little disappointment onto the show.

2107
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:03,000
I try.

2108
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
With your disappointing list, of course. I don't mean you're disappointing.

2109
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Yes.

2110
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Your final thought for us tonight?

2111
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
I don't know.

2112
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:17,000
All right. Loki, we'll see you next year. Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2113
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
That joke is so old.

2114
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:26,000
I'm going to work more on my game, and hopefully I'll have actually something to show for it next week or even in the middle of the week.

2115
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
That's my goal.

2116
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Because if I don't have anything to show for it by the end of next week, it's not looking good.

2117
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Two weeks left.

2118
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:37,000
I know, I'm in the same boat where it's like, oh shit, I hope I can get some work done on New Year's Eve.

2119
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Then it's like, what work are you going to get done on New Year's Eve?

2120
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
So I just got to make time earlier in the week.

2121
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:43,000
It shouldn't take too long.

2122
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Yeah, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.

2123
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:49,000
All right, keep in mind, I don't know shit about Unity, so I'll need a lot of help.

2124
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:52,000
All right, you may end up doing my game.

2125
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I'm just kidding, Loki.

2126
02:51:53,000 --> 02:52:04,000
All right, my final thought for the night, the year, is thank you everybody, and I look forward to hopefully some more projects in 2015.

2127
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:13,000
I sunset some big stuff for myself this year so I could open up some new doors next year, and I look forward to exploring that as we move into 2015.

2128
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:19,000
So I hope you guys will like some of the stuff that I create, and thank you guys so much, as always, for your support.

2129
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Last but not least, Darth Sockra, your final thought for the whole stinking year?

2130
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,000
But...

2131
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
And we'll leave it at that.

2132
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Have a wonderful night, everybody. Have a safe and happy New Year, and we will see you on the other side in 2015 here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2133
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Have a wonderful night, everybody. Good night.

2134
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:46,000
