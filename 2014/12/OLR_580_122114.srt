We got lots of comments in our chat room, people talking about the holidays

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's talk about the holidays before we talk about the games we've been playing here in studio

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
With myself, Rob Roberts, and our co-hosts, say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What? What? What? What? What?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Happy Hanukkah to you, Ms. Summers

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're welcome

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How is the Festival of Lights treating you?

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Flammable

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Highly flammable

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a season of miracles, yo

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Which, by the way, I gotta say, it is a miracle, all this fatty food that you've brought to the OLR studios tonight

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's amazing

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I have brought truffle mint M&M's, not M&M's, Hershey's Kisses

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I have brought cookies that are chocolate cookies with candy cane kisses on them

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Which come to us via Becky

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
From Becky

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you Becky for listening

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you Becky

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And then Becky has given us a pie, this is Mary Jumas or December Wien

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Love it

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's apple pie, and Becky's apple pies are the best apple pies in the universe

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Everyone eats some now

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And then she actually baked us a pie, that's love right there, that is love

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you Becky

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Becky is the pie master

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Becky's the best

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Her pie knows no equal

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And then later on, you are gonna get it all Jewish up in here

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
McLackas

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
McLackas

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
With applesauce

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm excited

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Cause it's also Foodmas

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You know what, this time of year, I celebrate everything because there's great food with every holiday

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What did you get for the holidays?

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Food

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Fat

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Exactly, exactly right

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Also say hello in the studio to Techmaster Loki

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hello

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hi Loki, how are you?

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Doing alright

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright, we were reminiscing a little bit before the show

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This week was Stephen Colbert's last show on Comedy Central

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It was a little bit sad

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It was a little bit sad

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I didn't watch it because I don't cable, but I did watch the YouTube of the last 10 minutes of the show

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Of course

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And it's like, oh man, it's

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It was well done, let me put it that way

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's disappointing to see him going off the air, but he'll move on to better things

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's only for six months because he's gonna be in a slot where he'll get exposed to even more people

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Taking over for David Letterman

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And a lot of people I think are concerned because he hosted the Colbert Report as a persona

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And he's gonna be hosting the Late Show as himself

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's like, seriously, have you seen anything else?

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, he followed him for a long time, even on the Daily Show

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And my favorite TV show of all time ever was one that he co-created called Strangers with Candy

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Which I don't understand how that only ran for a few seasons because it was just brilliant

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was really brilliant

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, I don't know why, it got cancelled in favor of Strip Mall

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Which, you know, I love me some Julie Brown, but I just don't understand why Strangers with Candy

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But anyway, it was the best TV show and Stephen Colbert was on it and he was hilarious

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I actually, and you might be wondering, why are you talking about Stephen Colbert on your video game show?

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, A, because he's awesome, and does he have a video game? He really should

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Technically he is involved video game wise because he did have a song that was in Rock Band, remember?

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, that's right, that's right

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Charlene, I'm Right Behind You

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, but that was from the 80s, that wasn't even something he did recently

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That was a long time ago when he was first starting out, that's right, I remember that

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But I truly consider the man an inspiration, so I am like really happy for him

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know, some of you that listen to the show for a while know that I'm a corporate trainer by day

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And so I consider his teacher character in Strangers with Candy like an inspiration

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Not that I literally do a lot of that stuff in class

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where's your permission slip, Mr. Knoblet? Shut your dirty little mouth!

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's just amazing, anyway

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ah, good times

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There should be a Strangers with Candy video game

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That would be an amazing idea for the video game jam that's kicking off tonight

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If it wasn't something copier

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Or Telltale Games

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Maybe that's something Telltale Games can adapt

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You know what, if he really wanted to, well, obviously he's gonna be really busy with the late show

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But man, if he really wanted to bring Strangers with Candy back, I think he'd probably do it now

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Bobby's in our chatroom saying that Stephen Colbert made that song recently

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He just made it look like the 80s, but it was a new song

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I was convinced it was before from his XF57 days or something

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I was convinced it was from a long time ago

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's hilarious

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Alright, and in chat they mentioned that he's way into Lord of the Rings

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I heard he has a cameo in the movie

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He does have a cameo in the movie

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And he also did like a photoshoot where he was dressed up like all the characters

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's pretty awesome, they did some really good makeup jobs on him

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Amazing, amazing

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's get into some video game news

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I know, I have, I think, officially lost interest in these things because it's just been too crazy

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But if they made one out of Stephen Colbert, I might be interested again

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I'm gonna talk about the Amiibos

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And, you know, we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show when they were first launching

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We didn't really know what they were

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And Nintendo really, I mean, for all practical purposes didn't really reveal what the hell these things were gonna do until the last minute

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I don't think people still understood it until they finally played Smash Brothers and got to use the Amiibo

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Or unlock stuff in Mario Kart or so forth

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But this Amiibo stuff, I mean, I don't know if it's just the perspective of me as a gamer

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But this stuff really feels like it's like the Beanie Babies of this year

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It is nuts

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's just, I don't know, I still don't see the point to it

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean, yeah, it's cool, don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to have collectibles and stuff like that

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you wanna put that stuff up on a shelf and have it look nice, then that's fine

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Those things look pretty cool

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But I just think, like, even looking at, like, the Pop figures and stuff like that

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think those look more interesting than some of the Amiibo figures

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And that was always my complaint with not only just the Amiibos

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But also the Skylanders and the Disney Infinity stuff

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They're stuck to that base, you can't do anything for them

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think it would be awesome, like, you know, kind of like look at Legos or something like that

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Where, like, the figure would come off and you'd be able to do stuff with that

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now I understand that, you know, they would be afraid of losing the base or something like that

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But somehow get that RFID chip in there where you could do that

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I sort of understand why these things took off though

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I think that just speaks to the volume of the classicness and pop culture infusedness

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Of the characters that Nintendo has created

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Which, you know, last week we were talking about the Sony hacks and the movie

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That, you know, the Mario movie

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And we talked about how, you know, this movie is gonna be big

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No matter what, even if it's bad, it's animated

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And there's gonna be tons of people that are gonna take their own kids to see a Super Mario Brothers movie

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Because they grew up with Mario Brothers, right?

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I mean, you did, you know, you did your kid's room in all Mario Brothers stuff

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Which was amazing, by the way

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But it just speaks to the volume that these characters are

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
By the way, quick follow up, because I shouldn't work this in at some point

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
There is a quick follow up to the whole Sony hack and the movie leak stuff

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that is a little bit of a coyness out of Miyamoto about the Mario movie leak

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And he said, I heard something about that this morning

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's interesting is that over the past 20 years

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
People come to us on a fairly regular basis about creating Mario movies

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There are times that those ideas end right when they bring them to us

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And other times we'll listen to presentations

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not very unusual and it's something we've been doing for a very long time

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't particularly have a vision that the next iteration of Mario is going to be in film

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Here's the thing

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I get that answer totally

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But it is absolutely a non-answer answer

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And I think in Miyamoto's head

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The next iteration of Mario Brothers will not be in film

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I would think that Miyamoto probably never wanted that first film to happen

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But I also think that

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's been enough time now to where we can kind of forget about that

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And I also think ultimately it's not up to Miyamoto

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Like yes, I understand, he's the granddaddy of it

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But at the end of the day

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If a boardroom signs off on it, it's going to happen

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Look at this way, okay

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There's Batman and Robin

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And now there's the new Christopher Nolan movies

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Which, you know, one does not soil the rest

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I mean, if anything, it makes them better

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I don't think just because there was

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the Mario Brothers movie

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I know it was kind of stupid, but you know what?

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
A lot of the movies that came out around the same time were kind of stupid

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Judge Dredd had some really stupid moments to it

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You know, just something like that

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm okay with that

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Because that was just kind of the way things were

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Like Double Dragon, remember how terrible that movie was?

182
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's just

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It was loosely based on it, but it was just kind of like

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That was just how it was going

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Anyway, not to digress too much

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I consider that a non-answer answer out of Miyamoto

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And ultimately, as rough as this is to hear

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't think it's up to him at the end of the day

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And also that answer wasn't really him saying no

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He just says, I think the next thing is not going to be a movie

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But I don't know, it still strikes me as a non-answer answer

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But anyway, rewinding a little bit

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I want to talk about the amiibos

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Because, you know, the reason why these things are doing so well

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Is it just speaks to the strength of the characters

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Behind these amiibo

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And I don't think it has really anything to do with the game functionality at all

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think grown adults want to collect those little toys

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Because it's okay

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's okay, unlike Beanie Babies

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
For whatever, it's socially acceptable

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
For 30-year-old men and women to be collecting those toys

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Unlike Beanie Babies, which kind of got the grandma stigma

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's grown people that collect those Skylanders and the Disney infinity stuff as well

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So, you know, I'm not surprised

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So, anyway

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, amiibo is going crazy this holiday season

208
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Whether you think they're useful in the games or not

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
People want those figurines

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And it's kind of becoming a mess

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And for me personally

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This whole freak-out around it

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Is kind of turning me off to it in a big way

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But for some people it just drives them even more

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But some of the big news that came out about amiibo this week

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Is that Toys R Us started cancelling amiibo pre-orders and purchases

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Pretty much out of the blue

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
A big chunk of this was the Lucario amiibo pre-orders

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Which I believe, wasn't that the figure that's going to be exclusive to Toys R Us?

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't remember

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't keep track of which ones are exclusive where

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Because it's a big mess

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So, people have called Toys R Us to figure out what's going on

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They've been advised that Nintendo did a product delay

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And that amiibo are being cancelled as a result

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Until there is a clear indication of how much stock there's going to be to get in

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, that sounds like Nintendo

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Now there's speculation that this wave 3 might be held back until beyond February

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
To make sure there is enough amiibo figures to meet the demand

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Which is very high

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I can see that

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And once again, before I was kind of under the suspicion that it was an artificial shortage

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But maybe not anymore

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But then again, I just

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't know how hard these things could be to manufacture

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's a piece of plastic with an RFID chip in it

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I mean

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can't imagine it being that difficult

239
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
YYR says Nintendo should capitalize on the amiibo popularity

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
By actually delivering some new games and long ignored franchises

242
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Next year is going to be really interesting

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
To see, you know, instead of having to back end amiibo into existing ideas

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Which I think they had to do for a lot of games this year

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Even Smash Brothers to an extent

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think they did it well in Smash Brothers

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I still think that was something that was kind of added on late in development

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But next year as we start to look to games like Splatoon and Mario Maker

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's going to be very interesting to see how the amiibo work in the games from the outset

250
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Let's see, also some comments in our chatroom

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We have

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's see

253
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Act F saying that I had a Lucario amiibo preordered and got cancelled

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Kaijuto says I'm an adult

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I buy amiibos not to collect them

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I buy them to train them to fight

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I actually think, Kaijuto, while I certainly respect that perspective

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I don't think you're alone in that

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I kind of actually think

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I think more people are buying this not to use them with Smash Brothers necessarily

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If what I see on Twitter and all that is any indication

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Granted, that's my perception of the world

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But I just get the feeling that more people are buying these

264
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Just because they're Nintendo figurines than anything else

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't know, what do you think, Loki?

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think definitely that they would be buying them

267
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know, I've seen better Nintendo figurines

268
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I have some of the better Nintendo figurines in my son's room

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's kind of my thing

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
These are like, what, twelve bucks for a teeny tiny figure

271
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And I've seen better action figures that cost less than that

272
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It kind of bugs me that they're so expensive because of that

273
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Now by the way, Loki, this is kind of funny that you said that about the card

274
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Because I do want to throw out here

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That Miyamoto has actually addressed that

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
In an interview that he did with ABC

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He actually said

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We're not making promises for certain figures

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But the way amiibo is designed

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is that certain games can have amiibo specifically for that game

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Other games can take advantage of past amiibo

282
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That developers want to make their game compatible with

283
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
In the future, we have the option

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If certain amiibo figures are no longer available in stores

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
To release an amiibo in card form with the same functionality

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So they're out there

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's going to be a matter of time

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That someone's just going to hack that anyways

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And then you'll just buy a card

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And it'll be whatever amiibo you want

291
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't know

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I just

293
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm not getting into it

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It probably doesn't help that I don't have a Wii U

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But even if I had a Wii U

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't think I'd really want to buy these things

297
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It just seems like a big waste of money

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But you know what

299
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There's a lot of things I'd buy that are probably a waste of money to other people

300
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's true

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Whatever you want to spend your money on

302
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Jamie, I'm dying to check in with you and your perspective

303
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let me get to a couple other comments in chat first

304
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Kaijuto, I love this comment

305
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was burned as a kid when I wanted Star Wars toys

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And could never find them

307
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I had no idea grown men were buying them

308
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
To keep them in a bahox

309
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Sg100Matt says

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
They're Nintendo's beanie babies

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
People will collect the fuck out of them if there is a demand for them

312
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Jamie, you're no stranger to video game collecting

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You've done your own in the past

314
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But surely you've got to be looking at this going

315
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is big

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What do you think?

317
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Dan and I already decided it was a waste of money for us

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Really?

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And I don't need to have any in my cubicle now

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Because my neighbor purchased them and put them up on our cubicle wall

321
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I now have the never ending battle

322
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Between Red Rico and Link

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Now is that because you're not a Wii U owner at this time?

324
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That you don't really have an interest in amiibo?

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I probably wouldn't have an interest in it anyway

326
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Interesting

327
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I could have played Skylanders if I wanted to

328
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I could have played Disney Infinity if I wanted to

329
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I have a Rocket Raccoon

330
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's all I care about

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Which I have to thank Codeman for

332
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But um

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't really care

335
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I hardly play my DS anymore

336
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I've been playing lots of Dragon Age

337
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If there were you know

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Dragon Age amiibo

339
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Figures that I could

340
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Model

341
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I wouldn't even do that probably

342
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know if they had a

343
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Garrus figure that unlocked something

344
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
in the game you'd probably be on that

345
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
So you think this

346
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So I think I'm hearing this

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't want to put words in your mouth

348
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
But this is what I seem to be hearing

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Is that maybe you're shifting away

350
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And you've kind of been shifting for the past couple years

351
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Away from consoles more to PC

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Pretty much

353
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You know I um

354
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Actually right around the time I had my hand surgery

355
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah

356
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Was when I started making the shift

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Just because it hurt to hold a controller for too long

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Makes sense

359
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And um

360
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I was identifying my games

361
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Right

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Which was really Mass Effect and DA too for me

363
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Um

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't know

365
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Those are really more my thing right now

366
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't really want to

367
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't know and I'm also kind of

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Anti-competition these days too

369
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Because people are making competitions out of things

370
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They have no business being competition

371
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Or being competitive

372
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's back into the whole you know

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I just really

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I kind of look at the whole thing with a little

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Edge of disgust

377
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't care what you spend your money on

378
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But you could be doing better things

379
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Now

380
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
ActDeaf actually sent along a little

381
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Update to this story

382
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He sent me a private message being one of these people

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That actually preordered saying

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Toys R Us sent an email today to everyone

385
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That had their Amiibo preorders cancelled

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They're reinstating orders

387
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And letting others make another reservation

388
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
For Amiibos but Toys R Us said

389
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That they messed up the orders not Nintendo

390
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Very interesting little

391
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Follow up because I feel like I'm hearing

392
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
A conflict between what some of

393
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Their own customer service people were saying

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And this but again that's no

395
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Real surprise there that you know

396
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Something was different

397
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Way at the top than it really was

398
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
So hmm

399
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Anyway I'm sure this is just going to

400
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Continue over the next few weeks

401
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This whole Amiibo fever

402
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But me like

403
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm not willing to go camp

404
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Out at the store for two hours

405
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
To get one of these figures like

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't need them that bad

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I like them well enough I kind of want a Mega Man

408
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
One but I'm not going to fight like crazy

409
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
For one if I can't just go online

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And get it then I'm done and my understanding

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is if I haven't already preordered one I ain't

412
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Getting one I guess at this point so

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Eh we'll see like I'm just

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't have to have one that badly

415
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think they're cool like I do

416
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Really want the Mega Man one but

417
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Is my life going to be over

418
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If I don't get one? Nah

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Will I be jealous of friends that have

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Them and I don't have it? Not really

421
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Actually I think I've

422
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Kind of hit that point so

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Anyway alright

424
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's travel around and look at

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Our gaming weeks and the types of games that we

426
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Have been playing this week

427
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Dark Sakura you haven't been playing 3DS

428
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But what have you been playing?

429
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I should have been bringing my 3DS with me because I'm doing

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
A puzzle now but um

431
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm playing Dragon Age

432
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
A friend of mine

433
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Actually started playing

434
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Final Fantasy 14

435
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So I'll be playing that a bit more later

436
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Um

437
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So uh

438
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah pretty much just Dragon Age right now

439
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Um

440
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I am taking my sweet time

441
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
With it I've already talked to people who have beaten the game

442
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Several times over but

443
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I've been playing just a little bit after work

444
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Exploring, looking around

445
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You know making up banter

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
In my head

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
And I've really

448
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Been finding it a fun creative

449
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Outlet lately so

450
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm content to

451
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Take my sweet time with it

452
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Do you do a lot of mods with Dragon Age

453
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Or is there not a lot available yet?

454
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's funny that you say that there are

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's only one mod out there right now and it's

456
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
A camera mod

457
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I haven't put it in yet

458
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But basically BioWare

459
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Said well Frostbite's really

460
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Going to be difficult for other people to mod

461
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
They're not going to be able to do the same mods with this

462
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Like they're doing for Mass Effect 3

463
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Or for the previous Dragon Age

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And basically the entire modding community

465
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Has said oh yeah watch

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And they're working on breaking it

467
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Um the guy who did

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The uh

469
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The tools for uh Mass Effect

470
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Warranty voider I think is what his

471
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Name was um at least online

472
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Um has already started

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Working on uh tools to

474
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Uh go through the code

475
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
For uh Frostbite

476
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So I think it's only a matter of time

477
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We've already had people who have been able to rip

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The character models and have done

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Their own uh models for

480
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The characters but um

481
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well the good news is that

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
They practice on Frostbite with Dragon

483
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Age and that way when the new Mass Effect comes out

484
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
All these tools will be ready to go

485
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And I honestly think that the

486
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Oppression I've been getting from the BioWare folks

487
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That is sort of like huh let's see if they can do it

488
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You know

489
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Like we don't see how without

490
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
All this so let's see how

491
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Inventive you'll be and I

492
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Think that it's not necessarily an

493
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Active discouragement from doing it

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But of a we actually

495
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Just don't think it's possible type of thing

496
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So of course challenge

497
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Accepted

498
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Alright uh let's put her mic down

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
So that's it for her gaming week. Loki your gaming week

500
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Um really I just played uh

501
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

502
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Um I'm just

503
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You know finishing up my son wanted to play

504
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
A bunch during the week so

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
While he was just running around the city doing stuff

506
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I was busy knocking out all the

507
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Races and all of the um

508
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Little activities

509
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That I have to do to unlock all the characters

510
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And get 100% in the game

511
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Which brings me to a couple things

512
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
About this one some of the controls

513
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Are fucking terrible

514
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Like their flight controls I seriously

515
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Want to punch the guy in the face

516
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
They came up with their fucking flight controls in that game

517
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Cause it's just it's

518
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So god damn frustrating

519
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That it doesn't work right cause basically

520
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You tap the jump button twice

521
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
To go into like a flight mode or whatever

522
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then you would tap uh

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What was it circle twice or whatever to

524
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Get out of that and land

525
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But also X and

526
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Circle are you know

527
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
For elevation so X makes you go up

528
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Circle makes you go down

529
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So you can kind of get where I'm

530
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Coming at here first off the uh

531
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Up and down vertical movement

532
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And there is very sluggish so you have to

533
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Kind of hold it down but so if you're trying

534
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
To kind of fine tune it and get it

535
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
So that you're aiming at the right speed

536
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
A couple things happens either you tap

537
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
X too fast and so

538
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That sends you into like a kind of a

539
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Burst speed thing so you fly super fast

540
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And you can't get out of it really fast

541
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Either or you just

542
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Land on the ground because you hit

543
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Circle twice and you just fall

544
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Out of the sky so

545
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I seriously was like cursing this game like

546
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I fucking hate you stupid game I don't

547
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Want to play this thing anymore then

548
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They had certain races where they thought it would be

549
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A great idea to lock the

550
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Fucking camera in a really awkward position

551
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
While you were playing that race

552
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I seriously want to strangle people that were in charge

553
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Of the camera and the flight controls in that game

554
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The rest of the game is fine

555
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
A little buggy at times but

556
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Careful what you say on the internet Loki

557
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You want to strangle them with love and understanding

558
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And a better understanding of physics

559
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I just want to smack them upside the head until they realize

560
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The error in their ways I mean come on

561
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is like how many

562
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Lego games have you made so far

563
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I mean this isn't the first one

564
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Of flight in it and you've had

565
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Several Batman games

566
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Anger leads to the dark side

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And so

568
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You can't tell me that you haven't figured out that this is

569
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
And then here's the other thing too

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You have a controller with several buttons

571
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That are not being used at all

572
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But you decide to map

573
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The elevation and all this shit

574
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
On the two buttons

575
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Great that's good for kids to learn stuff

576
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But it's fucking impossible to be able to

577
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Just maneuver accurately through the game

578
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So that's really my only thing

579
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But now that I'm done with that

580
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
All the races and stuff

581
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
It's kind of a big relief

582
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Because now I don't have to do that crap anymore

583
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I just have to go through all the levels and get all the

584
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Clocks and everything so

585
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm very close to platinuming the game

586
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Which will be my first platinum

587
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
As much as it drives you crazy

588
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You're determined to platinum it

589
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
At this point I've already suffered through it enough

590
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So I need to platinum it

591
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room

592
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Over at live.vognetware.com says

593
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Little Josh gets sent home from preschool

594
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
For saying bullshit controls fucking work

595
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
What the fuck after throwing his Power Ranger

596
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Action figures into the air

597
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
No we were

598
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
The other day my wife got

599
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Inspired by watching

600
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It was Jimmy Kimmel or something like that on the internet

601
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And she was asking him what

602
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Bad words he knew and so he only knew

603
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Like stupid and

604
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Something like

605
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Something like poop I don't remember what it was

606
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Poopy head or something like that

607
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Those are the only two words

608
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That he could think of

609
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Probably for the best

610
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I have called the game stupid though

611
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And under my breath I'm like fucking

612
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah

613
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That's when you

614
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Walk out casually in the backyard

615
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Shut the sliding glass door and go

616
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Fuck

617
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
God dammit this game is good but like

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But seriously though one of the best

619
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Characters in the game though is squirrel girl

620
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Because she has like

621
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The most useless powers

622
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
She has one power where you charge it up

623
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And for no reason like squirrels run around

624
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Like they crawl all over her and then they kind of explode

625
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Off of her and she throws squirrels

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
At people as her attack she throws squirrels

627
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's like bungee ferret tossing but with squirrels

628
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know what I don't think it made our show

629
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
World tonight but I'm very excited for

630
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The Bravely Default sequel Bravely Second

631
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
They announced a cat girl

632
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Character like a cat girl class

633
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And so it's that involves cats

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
How can this be bad?

635
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
If she throws cats at people or whatever has cats do her bidding

636
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm all for it it's like a summoner

637
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But with cats? Heck yeah

638
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Sounds good

639
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I just want my party to be for cat people

640
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sounds good to me

641
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
So that was it I also tried to play a little bit more of

642
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I Am Bread and the game is really frustrating

643
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So I just pretty much stopped right away

644
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's like it's even worse

645
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Than like Surgeon Simulator for me

646
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I mean same people and it's just

647
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Like I can't figure out what I'm supposed to be doing

648
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
To get you know off the floor

649
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Once I hit the floor it's just like oh I'm gonna land on the skateboard

650
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And I'm gonna ride the skateboard over the counter

651
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And I'm gonna crawl up the wall

652
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And that just didn't happen because there's like a

653
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Grip meter and stuff and so the more you hold

654
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Down on the grip you eventually

655
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Lose grip so I

656
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm just so frustrated

657
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
At that game it's funny but I just

658
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't wanna play it

659
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Well that's it for your gaming week I will talk quickly

660
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I haven't even bought anything on Steam

661
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I've been very good for you so far I've been

662
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I've been good at not getting anything on the Steam sale

663
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yet either but I've been voting every day

664
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
To get my card and I did

665
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
What I disenchanted some of the loot

666
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Which was a brilliant idea on Steam's

667
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Part by the way to get people to just destroy

668
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Things in their inventory that they would otherwise sell

669
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I

670
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I disenchanted a bunch of crap

671
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
In my inventory like backgrounds I would never use

672
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And stuff like that and I bought like a pack of cards

673
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Or something I don't know so

674
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Yeah anyway let's see

675
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So my gaming week I've been playing more

676
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Final Fantasy 13 on PC

677
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
My partner Alan bought me

678
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
A brand new monitor for the holidays

679
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
So now I have two widescreen monitors

680
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That I'm using and this new one is bright

681
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And it looks great and it does

682
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Super resolution so I can play

683
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Final Fantasy 13 in these really

684
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Obscene graphic modes and I'm so happy

685
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The game has come a long way

686
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Once I got past all the bullshit bugs

687
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like the graphical issues from the initial release

688
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And you know the fact that it frameskips

689
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
If you don't have a controller plugged in like what the hell

690
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Once you get past all that it's so

691
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Beautiful on

692
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
PC and I'm

693
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm on like chapter 7

694
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So like I'm pretty committed

695
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
To this playthrough so

696
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm excited I've been having a good time with that

697
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And continuing to play some other games

698
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
That I've been playing off and on Final Fantasy 14

699
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Return to Diablo 3

700
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Continuing with Seasons

701
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Alan and I had a little squabble over

702
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Diablo 3 about two weeks ago so I kind of put it on

703
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Ice for a little while

704
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
But I went back to the game and I found a really

705
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I really like in Diablo 3

706
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
That you can just respec your character at any time

707
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
If you find that the build you're

708
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Using doesn't work for you

709
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
That's fine respec

710
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You can't even reroll the gear

711
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Thanks to Miriam the enchanter

712
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You can try to like I went from

713
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Ice mage to a fire mage

714
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And so I rerolled all the cold bonuses

715
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And now there are things like either fire bonuses

716
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Or crit damage and I'm doing

717
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Way more damage and I'm way more efficient

718
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'm having way more fun as a fire mage

719
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Now as opposed to the ice mage I was

720
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Playing and that's probably in part that I was getting

721
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
A bunch of fire mage drops

722
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
So I was like okay the game's trying to tell me something

723
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So I switched and now I'm

724
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Flying through torment 1 rifts

725
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Like they're easy so I have to even

726
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Bump up the difficulty a little bit so I'm having a lot of

727
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Fun with Diablo 3 again

728
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
New games I have played

729
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
One new game this week I did play

730
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
One brand new game this week that came out on

731
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
PlayStation 4 I think it was one of the only

732
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
New game releases this past week

733
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I decided to plunk down the $10

734
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
For a classic game

735
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
It's very hard to screw this game up

736
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And do something wrong with it

737
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Tetris I bought Tetris Ultimate which was

738
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Released on the PlayStation 4 this week

739
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And it is Ubisoft that made this port

740
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And um

741
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm gonna tell ya there's

742
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Some things I liked that they're trying to do with this

743
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You know they're trying to make Tetris more

744
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Social you know like make it more like a

745
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Social game which I get

746
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's where gaming's going so like apparently

747
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Some of my play sessions have been

748
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Ghosted and like Fifth Dream

749
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
In chat earlier was saying oh I was

750
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Playing against one of your ghosts earlier and I was like

751
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Oh shit I didn't know the game was recording

752
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Me like I sometimes what I'll do

753
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Is if I screw up too early I'll just

754
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Drop all the pieces you know and I'll just fill up

755
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The screen it's it's the rage quit of Tetris right

756
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You just eternally drop all your pieces and start over

757
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
So I'm like oh shit if Fifth

758
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Dream is playing one of my bots that just rage

759
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Quits that's not a lot of fun so it's good to keep in mind

760
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
There's a lot of different modes and yada

761
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Yada yada but here's the thing

762
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That really gets me about Tetris

763
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Ultimate

764
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
It's buggy like

765
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Bad buggy like

766
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Really bad buggy like

767
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
How the fuck did they release

768
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
This in its current state buggy

769
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And it's mostly

770
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
One major bug

771
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But that bug is

772
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Frame hiccups

773
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Now let us think about the game of Tetris

774
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Especially when you're playing

775
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
On level 11

776
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
In endless mode

777
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Is that okay for the game to suddenly

778
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Hang for even just three frames

779
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
While you're trying to rotate a piece

780
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Or drop a piece at just the right moment

781
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Absolutely not

782
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And it was to the point where I was like

783
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Did any QA happen

784
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
On this game at all because that would

785
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Have been noticed if it was played

786
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
On a real Playstation 4 maybe that's something

787
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That didn't show up on a dev PS4

788
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I get that but was this even play tested

789
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
On a real PS4 was it cause I'm not the only

790
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
One that's noticed no I saw was

791
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I unfortunately went to IGN

792
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
To watch like the couple you know

793
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Now they call it let's plays but it's not really

794
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
They had some issues with the game

795
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I guess they had to literally unconnect

796
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It from the internet in order to like drop

797
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Those frame skips or whatever

798
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And it to the point where it was like

799
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Taking a super long time to load

800
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Stuff and like there was even frame

801
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Skips during like the whole Ubisoft

802
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Logo and everything

803
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And to the point where like they're trying to

804
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Drop the piece and it was taking several seconds

805
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
To drop that piece and stuff

806
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And apparently they said yeah we tried this

807
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Even on a retail

808
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
System a debug system

809
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
On several different ones and it was still

810
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Having the same problems

811
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
So

812
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't know what's up

813
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
With Ubisoft man it's bad

814
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
When you can't even get Tetris I mean Tetris is

815
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Not that complex of a fucking game

816
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I think the power of the Playstation 4

817
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And from what I hear it's only the

818
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Playstation 4 version that's doing it

819
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I would think that the Playstation 4 can run Tetris

820
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Just I think it can

821
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Now 5th Dream says I was playing

822
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
It on remote play and I had no issues

823
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But then I don't play as fast as Rob's

824
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Ghost I'm gonna say you know I

825
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Was made aware of the IGN video via

826
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Twitter and it was

827
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
After I already bought the game and I was

828
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Playing it and I was like god damn it like

829
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Why is this game buggy and then I saw that

830
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Tweet come in because somebody retweeted it and I was like

831
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh okay it's not just me and I

832
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Watched the video now here's the weird thing

833
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I didn't notice it as bad

834
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
As they do and

835
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But that seems weird to me that there would be kind of

836
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That variance there but I didn't notice it

837
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
As bad but I definitely noticed

838
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It and it was definitely the point where

839
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm like Ubisoft

840
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You need to fucking fix your QA processes

841
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You need something like something

842
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Clearly is broken

843
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Because how many games is that

844
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Now that have gone out the door with very

845
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Obvious bugs in them

846
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Fix your

847
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Processes please

848
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
It's embarrassing

849
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It's Tetris

850
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
For god's sake Tetris

851
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I could play Tetris on an Apple

852
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
What was the very first it was made for

853
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The PS like PS2

854
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Like old school IBM basics

855
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Right was the original Tetris I'm talking

856
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm talking the guy in Russia

857
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I know right

858
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So the power of the Playstation 4

859
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Cannot handle Tetris

860
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Give me a break

861
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
A TI calculator could play Tetris

862
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Now

863
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I do have faith that thanks to

864
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I mean if I just sat here and bitched about it

865
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Nothing would happen but IGN's

866
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Got a lot more pull than I do I'm sure because

867
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Of them putting out that video the game will get

868
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
A patch and it'll be fine but it's like

869
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It's yet another one of those things

870
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Why did we have to wait for the patch

871
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I mean you release the game

872
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The next to last week of December anyway

873
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Would have delay until February

874
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Have killed you it's not like I was sitting

875
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Here going I can't fucking wait

876
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
For Tetris yeah like

877
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It was more one of those things where it's like oh Tetris

878
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Came out I like Tetris I'll get it

879
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I would have had the same reaction in February

880
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
After you fixed your shit

881
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh my god it just blows my mind

882
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Well that was the thing it was like a lot of people

883
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
When they bought it you know they're kind of

884
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
There's a few games Ubisoft has released that haven't

885
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Been that great that kind of little buggy

886
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You know but it's Tetris

887
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I mean how hard can Tetris be to program

888
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I mean it can't be that bad

889
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
YYR in chat says don't worry Ubisoft will patch

890
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
It in in a few days not to fix the game

891
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Breaking bugs but to put a face on the faceless

892
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
L block it's funny you say that because

893
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
In battle mode like you actually get

894
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Blocks that have mustaches on them and other

895
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Little things that happen

896
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Just cute little things that

897
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Have to do with the

898
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Battle thing it's like

899
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Playing Tetranet basically they basically

900
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So there are some cool things about this game

901
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
That basically you can play Tetranet and that

902
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Type of thing but you know again

903
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
When you have frame skip in a game

904
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That badly needs it like Tetris it's like it

905
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Ruins the whole fucking thing it doesn't matter

906
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
If they're doing all these other cool things to the game

907
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The game is ruined it's tainted

908
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Jason says that Tetris on the Playstation 4

909
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Doesn't look or act like Tetris on

910
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
TI NES or whatever

911
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
To which I say I didn't ask for them to make me

912
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
A fancier looking Tetris it's fucking

913
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Tetris I don't need it to have like

914
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Fucking you know

915
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Clouds in the background

916
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Or shiny blocks or whatever it's

917
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Fucking Tetris it doesn't matter

918
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And here I do

919
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Have one other this is a minor

920
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
More minor complaint about the game but it is

921
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
An issue I have with

922
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Tetris lately and I think

923
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The last round of Tetris games did this too

924
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And I don't understand this and that is

925
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What is the obsession with

926
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
T-Spins what is the obsession

927
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
With counting T-Spins

928
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And having achievements for T-Spins

929
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And getting T-Spins

930
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
As a statistic I don't understand

931
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Like

932
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
What I even had to look up like what

933
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
A T-Spin is and it's

934
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
By the way it's when you take the T-Block

935
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
And you rotate it in to fill a gap

936
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Like it's not you're not

937
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Dropping it to fill a gap you rotate

938
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It over to fill a gap that like

939
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Might be on the side or something that's what a T-Spin

940
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Is and it's like oh I

941
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Thought I was already doing that but yet my statistic

942
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
For T-Spin I guess sit at zero but it's

943
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Like I don't know I don't

944
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I don't get why that has to be

945
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Tracked the only T-Spin I'm aware of

946
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Is you know with Baloo and where

947
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
They're flying a plane and

948
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I guess that was Tailspin though

949
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So anyway

950
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
YYR in chat says yeah I think those are dumb

951
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Too and Alan Alchemy says the T-Block

952
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Is the most versatile block yet

953
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's the line blocks that I always tend to

954
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Put in my hold queue anyway

955
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The Nintendo DS version

956
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Of Tetris remains the definitive version for

957
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Me or the Game Boy if you want to go all the way back

958
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
To the Game Boy version that one too I think the

959
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
DS one is the best one out there and it still hasn't been

960
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Trumped on all these newer consoles

961
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Came out on 3DS as well

962
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
On 3DS but not this isn't the Nintendo version

963
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
With like the Mario

964
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
No this version that just came out from Ubisoft

965
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
No Nintendo did one on the DS

966
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Which certainly you could play on a 3DS

967
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But Nintendo did one on the DS that in my mind

968
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Is still the definitive version

969
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But maybe that has to do with the love

970
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Of Nintendo characters thing we talked about earlier

971
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Cause all that retro nostalgia is all

972
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Over that game but I even think without

973
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That it's still the definitive version I mean because

974
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's the Game Boy version but modernized

975
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And in many ways I think

976
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
If you said Rob the Game Boy version

977
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Is the definitive version I would be like

978
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You know I respect that angle

979
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That's a hard one to argue with

980
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The Game Boy and the DS ones are really neck and neck

981
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So anyway

982
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Alan Alchemy

983
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
In chat says everyone loves it when a T block

984
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Shows up unlike the square one

985
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That's like hello I'm here sorry I'm so fat

986
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Frown no the ones

987
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
It's the Z blocks to get me

988
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
The Z and the S block because

989
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I can never visualize

990
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Ok what's the jagged pattern

991
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Is this the one that fits the jacket on the right

992
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
This is the ones that you use to slide in

993
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah and I've used it that way too

994
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But do we count Z spins or S spins

995
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
No we count T spins

996
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Anyway, Jamie just rolled her eyes

997
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That makes for great radio

998
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Alright

999
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
SSJ100Matt says I came back in the middle

1000
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Of this discussion and my initial thought of

1001
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
T spin stats were stats of how many times

1002
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You spun the teacups at Disneyland

1003
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh I'd win that fucking game

1004
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Purple ones for life

1005
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It is not the teacups unless somebody barfs

1006
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Alright that's what I'm saying

1007
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
That's why you go in the purple ones they go faster

1008
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
At night

1009
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
They go faster at night for sure

1010
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Everything goes faster at night

1011
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Alright we're going to get into some news here

1012
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
In a minute here also more information

1013
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
On the VOG game jam coming up

1014
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
In part B we're going to kick

1015
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
This off tonight and

1016
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Us and Bobby Blackwolf and hopefully some of the

1017
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Other shows at VOG too teaming together

1018
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
To encourage everybody out there to

1019
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Create something dammit

1020
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
You know last week we had the guys from Cooking with

1021
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Unity on the show which I know Loki found

1022
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Very very motivating and I thought those guys

1023
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Were excellent motivators you know they've worked

1024
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
In the industry and my favorite

1025
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Thing out of that whole interview was when Max said

1026
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You know I just

1027
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Want you to make a game I want you to make a game

1028
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And I thought yes I want you

1029
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
To make a game too what can I do to help

1030
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Alright we've got a network let's do this

1031
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Let's do this VOG game jam

1032
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So together the

1033
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
OLR live audience tonight we're going to pick a theme

1034
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Through our tried and true list list

1035
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Mechanism so we're going to get to that in part

1036
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
B and that will be the theme for the game jam

1037
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
But you know what if you're not comfortable programming

1038
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
In Unity and you don't want to learn just yet that's okay

1039
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Use RPG maker

1040
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Use Twine

1041
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Use Commodore 64

1042
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Basic make a level in

1043
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Little Big Planet if you want or create

1044
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
A level in another game but just

1045
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Create something dammit that's all

1046
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
We want we want people to create

1047
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And get creative

1048
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So all we're going to throw you tonight is a spark

1049
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And we want you to run with it

1050
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And create a fire and who knows

1051
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Who knows sometimes

1052
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Big big games come out of game jams

1053
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So wasn't super hexagon born

1054
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Out of a game jam I could be wrong I don't remember there's

1055
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
A lot of stuff there's a lot of stuff that suddenly

1056
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You know goes from game jam to like

1057
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You know steam release and I'm not necessarily saying

1058
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
That that's going to happen

1059
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But it might so

1060
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Stay tuned

1061
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
So more info on that in part B

1062
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
For now quick housekeeping

1063
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
We will actually still be

1064
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Here throughout the holidays

1065
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
The holidays fall on pretty convenient days for us

1066
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Not so much for Hoard House but for us

1067
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So we will still be here next Sunday live

1068
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And the Sunday after the holidays will not be

1069
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Interfering with OLR scheduled this year

1070
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
However

1071
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I am foreseeing off in the future we will not

1072
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Be here January 18th

1073
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That's way off in the future so I'll be giving you

1074
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Reminders we're still determining if we're going

1075
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
To pre-record that week or what we're going to do

1076
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
We can't do an early show I'm going to be

1077
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Out of town I guess I'm

1078
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Okay to say this on the show I'm

1079
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Going to Seattle Alan and I are going to go to Seattle

1080
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Visit some friends of his that he's known

1081
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Online forever and never met so

1082
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I'm going to go to Seattle over Martin Luther King weekend

1083
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So I'm excited about that I haven't been

1084
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Up to Seattle in about five years but I love it up there

1085
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
And I can't wait to do all that touristy shit

1086
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Again Space Needle, EMP

1087
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Aquarium

1088
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
First Starbucks, Pikes Market I'm going to do all that shit

1089
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
So maybe

1090
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
If we rent a car maybe I can talk

1091
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Alan into let's just

1092
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Drive by Nintendo headquarters and see if I can see

1093
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Reggie I just drive by I got to

1094
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
After all these years I got to just drive by and wave

1095
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Or something see if I can sneak

1096
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Into the cafeteria who knows

1097
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Alright

1098
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So anyway more info on that to come

1099
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
When we get a little closer into January

1100
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Tigerclaw asks

1101
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
In chat will next week's OLR be a

1102
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Best of show I am thinking

1103
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
We will do something to cap off the end

1104
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Of the year us being

1105
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
OLR and haven't been around for so long

1106
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
We seem to do something different for the last

1107
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Show of the year every year I don't think we found our thing

1108
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yet but certainly we will be looking back

1109
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
On 2014 and talking about

1110
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Our favorite games of the year even

1111
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Though you know what guys we don't

1112
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Possibly have time to play everything

1113
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
We can't sit here and say this is the definitive

1114
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Best game of 2014 but we can't

1115
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Tell you our favorite games so we will at least

1116
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Go over that next week and I am still going back

1117
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And forth in my head there is two that I keep

1118
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Flip flopping so we will see

1119
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Anyhow

1120
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Let's get into some news after all that

1121
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Let's get into what is going on

1122
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
In the game industry this week not as busy

1123
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Of a week but there is still some stuff going on

1124
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
That is worth talking about right Loki? That's right

1125
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
So of course you know some of the big news

1126
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
This week had to do with Minecraft

1127
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And the announcement

1128
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Of Minecraft story mode a tell

1129
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Tell game series

1130
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And apparently it's going to be

1131
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
A separate game

1132
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Not necessarily an add on to Minecraft

1133
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But it's a separate game

1134
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That will be released on PC

1135
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Mac mobile devices and

1136
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Xbox and Playstation consoles they say

1137
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
The game they haven't really said

1138
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Too much about it yet other than you know

1139
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
They are not creating an official story

1140
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
For the main character Steve

1141
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But apparently it's going to have

1142
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Some sort of story that revolves around you know

1143
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
User created stuff

1144
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
So I don't know

1145
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You know to be honest

1146
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
They kind of already have this

1147
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's actually a mode you can set up

1148
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Your different worlds in I think it's

1149
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I forget the actual name of it's called

1150
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Like fantasy or something like that

1151
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But basically allows you you know someone to create

1152
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
A world in creative mode

1153
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And then basically to limit the amount

1154
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Of building

1155
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And breaking that you can do in it

1156
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And it has a lot of you know kind of narrative stuff

1157
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Based off of that

1158
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You can like you know set up events and things

1159
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But

1160
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Cool I guess I mean that'll be

1161
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Neat to check out

1162
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
When it comes out

1163
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
There's a lot of hate for this idea

1164
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Out there a lot of people are really pissed off about it

1165
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Don't buy it then

1166
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I kind of don't I don't get that though

1167
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Like I understand that okay well

1168
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
A Telltale Minecraft game is not going to be

1169
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Really Minecraft in the traditional sense

1170
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
But at the same time it's like

1171
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Telltale has kind of done really

1172
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Good things with a lot of the properties they

1173
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Have a story for

1174
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Minecraft is really not something that's been

1175
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Explored at all I don't I don't

1176
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Understand where the negativity is coming from other than

1177
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
It's something different I don't like

1178
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It I don't know

1179
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I think problem I don't see the problem

1180
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I just think they're immediately thinking that

1181
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh another Minecraft game

1182
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
After Microsoft bought a mode they must be selling

1183
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Out or something but

1184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Now maybe maybe it's Minecraft

1185
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
For saturation like that I could

1186
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Maybe see that because you know

1187
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Minecraft really is everywhere

1188
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But it's not just this video game

1189
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I mean you know

1190
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Go into target or anything like they've got

1191
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
All this Minecraft licensed shit everywhere

1192
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Like another game is really

1193
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Really the

1194
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Least of it but you know

1195
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I gotta say as much as

1196
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm not always really into like poking into

1197
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
People's personal business and all this gaming news

1198
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You know it's out there that Notch

1199
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Bought that mansion in Beverly Hills

1200
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
You see that? It was

1201
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Him and he outbid

1202
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Beyonce and Jay-Z

1203
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Like really

1204
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Really just think about that for a minute

1205
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
The monarchy

1206
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Of Beyonce and Jay-Z

1207
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Got outbid by some nerd

1208
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
For this mansion

1209
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I think that's absolutely hilarious

1210
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
It's kind of awesome

1211
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Probably did it for spite

1212
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You've gotta admit you gotta see Beyonce

1213
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Sitting there going, who is this nerd?

1214
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Just bought our house

1215
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
You know what though

1216
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Props to him

1217
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I saw that picture of him with his

1218
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Legs up with the whole like candy

1219
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Bar or whatever in the background and I was

1220
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Just like

1221
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
The only thing that picture is missing

1222
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Is a gigantic bong I think

1223
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But anyway not that I endorse that

1224
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But I'm just saying it seems to be the one

1225
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Thing that's missing

1226
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
With his kind of money

1227
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
He could just

1228
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's like the fucking Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory

1229
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Of bongs

1230
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
He can turn the pool into a giant one

1231
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Anyway sorry Loki I don't mean to digress

1232
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
He could build a fucking chocolate factory

1233
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Like out of Willy Wonka

1234
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
That's what I'd do with all that money

1235
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Wouldn't you? No

1236
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I just want an Oompa Loompa

1237
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I want it now

1238
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I want a golden goose

1239
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Daddy I want the goose

1240
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That lays the golden eggs

1241
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
And actually it was the squirrels

1242
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But anyway Loki

1243
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So then on top of that you know

1244
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
The Minecraft film has had a little bit of a setback

1245
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Apparently the director Sean Levy

1246
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Has left the project

1247
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Basically saying you know Warner Brothers

1248
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Asked me to develop

1249
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
How this might be a story

1250
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
For a movie because it's a non-narrative

1251
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Game and we came up with an

1252
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Approach that felt good but when they discussed

1253
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It with Mojang they were like

1254
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That doesn't sound like what we want

1255
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So

1256
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So yes unfortunately he couldn't really

1257
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Go from there

1258
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I don't know I'm not

1259
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Too terribly disappointed by that

1260
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Maybe

1261
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
We'll see something with this Telltale game

1262
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That's the direction he wants to go with it

1263
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Or something you know maybe the story that we see

1264
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Laid out here because honestly

1265
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
There isn't much

1266
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Of a story there

1267
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Alan does point out in our chat room over at

1268
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Fognetwork.com Alan Alchemy says

1269
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
The original Minecraft doesn't really have a story

1270
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But there is a long ass objective to find

1271
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Farm Endermen, farm ore

1272
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Go into the netherworld or hell

1273
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Go to the Enderplane, kill the Ender Dragon

1274
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Which most people don't even do they just fuck around and explore

1275
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Caves and make badass asses with roller coasters

1276
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
But if they wanted to explore that story

1277
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
About the Ender Dragon I'd be interested

1278
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
In it

1279
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I just think they need more to it it's kind of short

1280
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I mean it's kind of like oh we just put this there

1281
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Because people wanted an end to the game

1282
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I also

1283
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I would have a concern for

1284
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
The clock and I said this

1285
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Back when Microsoft bought Minecraft

1286
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I sort of feel like the clock on

1287
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Minecraft is ticking and I think the ultimate

1288
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Climax to this whole thing is going to be when

1289
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Microsoft inevitably releases

1290
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Minecraft 2 because you know they're going to

1291
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You know they're going to they release Minecraft 2

1292
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
And I kind of think that will be the beginning of the end

1293
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I just you know

1294
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I realize a lot of people might brand me a hater

1295
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
For thinking that or that I don't get it because there's more

1296
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
To it with all the licensing and all that

1297
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But I just kind of think the bubble is going to burst eventually

1298
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And then there's going to be because there will be another big

1299
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
New thing that everybody gets into

1300
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
That people can create and explore their own stuff

1301
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You know what I mean?

1302
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I'd be down for a Minecraft that ran better

1303
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I mean it's just all Java

1304
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Right now so I'd be fine you know running

1305
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
A little bit better but

1306
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Whatever it's all good

1307
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
And then of course you know with that the

1308
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Microsoft versions of the game

1309
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Are actually getting another update

1310
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
They have was it it's

1311
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
The 1.64 update

1312
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Now they're saying it's going to

1313
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Add horses because horses

1314
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Have been in the PC version for a while

1315
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
But you can actually get horses

1316
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You can even you know

1317
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Make a donkey you can put horse

1318
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Armor on them

1319
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
All sorts of fun stuff

1320
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Tame them and they're saying

1321
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
That along with it they're going to add

1322
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
New enemies

1323
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Bats, witches, wither skeletons

1324
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
And new fireworks

1325
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So it's kind of it's getting close to where

1326
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
The Xbox version is actually meeting with

1327
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Almost what the PC version is right now

1328
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So

1329
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I have to go back to the Xbox version

1330
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
At some point or

1331
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I may have to actually get one for the

1332
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
PlayStation 4 in that version

1333
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Alright

1334
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
The PlayStation 4 version is pretty good actually

1335
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
We'll get down with that. Alright moving

1336
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
On let's talk about you know and honestly

1337
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I have a hard

1338
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Time quantifying this next story

1339
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
As news because I really don't think this is

1340
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
News but sometimes we have

1341
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
To bring to the discussion

1342
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
What other people are talking about

1343
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Out there in the gaming world and that's where this

1344
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Next story falls into

1345
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Miyamoto obviously he did a big interview this week

1346
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
With ABC and there was a lot that came out of this

1347
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And one other thing that he said in this interview

1348
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Quote we're focused on providing

1349
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
A robust lineup of Wii U software

1350
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
For next year it seems like we've managed

1351
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
To do that this year and people are very happy with

1352
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
What we've done on Wii U which for the most part is pretty true

1353
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
For the time being our focus

1354
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Is on the Wii U hardware but Nintendo

1355
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
As a whole has groups working on ideas

1356
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
For new hardware systems

1357
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
While we're busy working on software for the Wii U

1358
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
We have production lines that are working on ideas

1359
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
For what the next system might be

1360
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And so what's the headline on every fucking

1361
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Game blog right now and every fucking tweet out there

1362
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Nintendo working on

1363
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Wii U successor

1364
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Because the little

1365
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
What they don't say in that

1366
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Is that everybody wants

1367
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Nintendo to move on from the Wii U

1368
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So let's hear about their follow up already

1369
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Click me, click me, click me, visit my site

1370
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I sort of think that's that

1371
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Unsaid piece there

1372
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Is that people, there's a lot of people

1373
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
That want to see Nintendo move on from the Wii U

1374
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Because they already wrote it off

1375
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I gotta say though Wii U has had a killer year

1376
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And I don't see

1377
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
How you can have a top 5

1378
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Games of the year and not have at least

1379
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
One Wii U title on it

1380
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Maybe if you're talking about your own personal list

1381
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
And you don't own a Wii U

1382
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I guess that's the way you do it

1383
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
But I can't see how you do if you are considering

1384
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Every single game that came out this year

1385
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I don't see how you have a top 5

1386
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
And you don't have at least one Wii U game on it

1387
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Like they've had a pretty good year in that regard

1388
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
So I still give them some credit

1389
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Wii U's got a lot of life left in it

1390
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
So if they don't bring out their next successor

1391
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Right away then no big deal

1392
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But here's the thing

1393
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
So that by itself

1394
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Not really a big deal

1395
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You know Sony's working on Playstation 5

1396
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's years and years away but they're thinking about it

1397
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Xbox working on Xbox 2

1398
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Or whatever they're going to do next right

1399
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
260 I don't know

1400
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Whatever the hell Microsoft decides to do next

1401
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
They're working on it

1402
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
They're brainstorming that name right now

1403
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Brainstorm really hard

1404
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Here's the thing

1405
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Here's what else Miyamoto said

1406
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It did nothing but add fuel to the fire

1407
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Since we first created Mario

1408
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
We have compared him to Mickey Mouse

1409
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I've always said Mickey Mouse evolved

1410
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
With each evolution in animation

1411
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
You saw Mickey Mouse each step of the way

1412
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
From early on I wanted Mario to be that character

1413
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
In the digital world

1414
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
So that with each digital evolution

1415
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
He was there to usher in the next era

1416
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I think that maybe when we release the next hardware system

1417
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You can look forward to seeing Mario

1418
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Take on a new role or in a new game

1419
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And a lot of people are taking that to say

1420
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
No more Mario until the next Nintendo system

1421
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But that's not really what I'm hearing in that quote

1422
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I don't know about you guys

1423
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But I'm just hearing in that

1424
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Mario is kind of the guy with the scissors

1425
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
That cuts the ribbon

1426
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
That says you know

1427
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
It's now open for business

1428
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Not necessarily that every Nintendo console

1429
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Has launched right out the gate with a Nintendo title

1430
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
But pretty close right

1431
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Super Nintendo had one

1432
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Nintendo had one at least here in America

1433
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Nintendo 64 had one

1434
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Gamecube had Luigi's Mansion

1435
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But Super Mario Sunshine

1436
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Wasn't that far from the get go

1437
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Wii U had new Super Mario

1438
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
The Wii

1439
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Is the only one I can think of

1440
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That didn't have a Mario title right out the gate

1441
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
But then you had some really strong Mario titles

1442
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Between the new Super Mario Brothers

1443
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
And Mario Galaxy of course

1444
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
A lot of people really loved

1445
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
New Paper Mario

1446
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
I like New Paper Mario

1447
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
But that's the other thing too

1448
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Is that Mario is so much more

1449
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
All these other things now

1450
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And so I think there's some people that assume

1451
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
That this means there will be no Mario game on the Wii U

1452
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But I just

1453
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I can't imagine

1454
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I cannot imagine

1455
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That Nintendo is not thinking about another game

1456
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
In the Mario Galaxy series

1457
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
They have to be

1458
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Those games were so good

1459
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And they were so different

1460
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And they were always critically lauded

1461
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I assume they sold well

1462
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Didn't they sell pretty good?

1463
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
First one did I'm pretty sure

1464
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Because they did make the sequel

1465
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
They've got to be thinking of a Mario Galaxy for Wii U

1466
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
I mean

1467
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Or even a pretty easy

1468
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Sequel to Mario 3D World

1469
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
You would think would be up on the agenda

1470
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I would think that would be a very

1471
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
In some ways Captain Toad might kind of be that

1472
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
But I digress

1473
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So I would think there's going to be Mario Galaxy games

1474
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I don't think this necessarily means that no more Mario

1475
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Can you imagine an open world Mario game

1476
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Done in the same style as that new Zelda game

1477
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Right?

1478
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I don't know

1479
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
To register participation for this week's episode

1480
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

1481
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Use the pass phrase

1482
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Chair

1483
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Let's see going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

1484
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Kaijudo says

1485
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Wii U is the shit

1486
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Anyone that hates on it has never really played it or owns it

1487
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The Wii U is an amazing system

1488
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Only haters are the people that want HD shooters

1489
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And Mountain Dew perks

1490
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Fuck those guys

1491
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
There was no Star Fox game on the Wii

1492
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
But we are getting one for the Wii U

1493
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So yeah Nintendo does skip some of their ideas sometimes

1494
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
You know what else was sorely missing

1495
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
From the Wii

1496
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
F-Zero

1497
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Act Def says

1498
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Super Mario 3D World is still an amazing game

1499
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And I wouldn't mind a Super Mario 3D World 2

1500
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Neither would I

1501
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I really kind of hope they do

1502
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And I'm okay with that if they just try to squeeze another game out of that

1503
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I'm sure it'll be great

1504
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Nintendo does a really good job

1505
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Of producing quality sequels

1506
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
YYR says

1507
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Nintendo has always been stupid about sequels though

1508
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Never more than one Smash game

1509
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Per platform per example

1510
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Wasn't it because those games take years and years and years

1511
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
For them to make

1512
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And that team was busy doing the Kid Icarus game

1513
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
On 3DS for a while

1514
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So that's why there was a

1515
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Big lull between Smash Brothers games

1516
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
If I'm not mistaken

1517
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Which I'm surprised they still haven't ported that over

1518
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
To like the Wii U

1519
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Maybe they just didn't do that well

1520
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They probably don't think it's worth the effort

1521
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I don't know, I don't know why

1522
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Because there is a lot of Kid Icarus love in Smash Brothers

1523
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I mean they made Palutena a character

1524
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Which was a little bit unexpected

1525
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But I think

1526
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
The studio that's making Smash

1527
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Obviously is a little partial to their own games

1528
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
There's also the fact that they have

1529
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Kirby, Meta Knight

1530
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And Dedede

1531
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
That's kind of a lot of Kirby in the game

1532
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Which I'm sure Act Def is probably sitting there going

1533
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I don't see a problem

1534
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Neither do I but I'm just saying

1535
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
In the big scope of things I'm surprised they have a lot

1536
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
From these three franchises

1537
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I'm surprised they haven't brought in more Donkey Kong

1538
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Country stuff like King Krule or something like that

1539
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I'm really surprised

1540
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
From the Kid Icarus franchise

1541
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
That the eggplant wizard didn't show up as a character

1542
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I would have thought the eggplant wizard would have been an awesome character

1543
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And that's kind of one that's been missing for a while

1544
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But maybe there's only so much you can do with that

1545
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
DLC

1546
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Yeah you never know, careful what you wish for right Rob?

1547
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Alright moving on

1548
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Let's get into something a little different with Dark Sakura

1549
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Well we do have

1550
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
A group

1551
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Are you familiar with the Electronic Frontier Foundation?

1552
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Of course

1553
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Yes they are

1554
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
A very very worthwhile group

1555
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
But they actually were celebrating

1556
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
National Crossword Day

1557
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Can I just say real quick

1558
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Cause this is relevant and important

1559
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
EFF I definitely recognize them

1560
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
They were one of the people fighting the podcast

1561
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
The EFF played a big part of

1562
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Fighting that fight

1563
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
So that I can podcast

1564
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
And you can podcast

1565
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Without somebody trying to say

1566
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
That they're owed money because

1567
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
They invented feed technology

1568
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I mean I don't get with it

1569
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So anyway the EFF was a huge part of that

1570
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Well anyway

1571
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
They have

1572
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
The official crossword day has happened

1573
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And so they put out a digital crossword

1574
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That you can download

1575
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's very cool

1576
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
It's actually a PDF

1577
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
And I'm gonna link it into our chat room

1578
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Or there's also

1579
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
An interactive version on

1580
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
GitHub

1581
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
But it's called 2014

1582
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
The year in copyright news

1583
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
So it's all copyright related stuff

1584
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So related back to

1585
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
2014 so

1586
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Thought I would share that with our listeners

1587
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's a very old school game talking about

1588
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Some new school ideas

1589
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
If you think about it

1590
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Crossword that's one of the oldest

1591
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Video games we have

1592
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
You know before there were

1593
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Video games I used to love and they still make

1594
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
These books and once in a while

1595
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
About once a year I will still buy

1596
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
One of these books to play

1597
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
On the airplane like while I'm flying

1598
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Across country or something and that is the

1599
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Variety puzzles

1600
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And games have you seen these books?

1601
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They have all the logic

1602
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Problems and crosswords and all this

1603
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm sure somebody in chat has to know what I'm

1604
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Talking about that's like

1605
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Gaming without a console

1606
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
For me that kind of leads into

1607
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
They still do your crossword in the paper every Sunday

1608
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
So yeah well every time I try

1609
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
To do the crossword on a flight or something

1610
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Somebody else has already done it

1611
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Jerks in ink

1612
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
In ink

1613
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I don't want to bring my own I wanted a complimentary one

1614
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Jeez Rob

1615
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Cheapo

1616
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Well thank you EFF for

1617
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Providing a different crossword with a message

1618
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
With a message

1619
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Loki

1620
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Alright so there's

1621
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Apparently a new project

1622
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
That Microsoft is working on called

1623
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Arcadia and it's thought to be

1624
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
A game streaming

1625
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Technology

1626
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Or service by the sounds

1627
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Of it and this is

1628
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I guess coming from

1629
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Some job openings that they have

1630
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
One for a cloud based operating

1631
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Systems group and one for listing

1632
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
A project called Arcadia

1633
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And they're saying that I guess

1634
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
It's similar to

1635
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I guess it's built off of the Azure cloud

1636
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And something that's supposed to replace

1637
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Microsoft's Rio game streaming tech

1638
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
To me it sounds a lot like

1639
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Technology that you would see with like

1640
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
The

1641
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Playstation streaming to

1642
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You know like the SharePlay

1643
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But like streaming to like the Vita

1644
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
That type of stuff and that's what they're saying

1645
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Like the listing they said

1646
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
The new operating systems group

1647
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
OSG streaming team is leveraging

1648
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
The cloud to bring premium unique experiences

1649
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
To Microsoft's core platforms

1650
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
These experiences will take advantage

1651
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Of the new geo distributed massive

1652
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Scaling service to redefine

1653
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
What is possible by today's services

1654
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Or today's devices

1655
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
The client team is building the user

1656
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Interface applications

1657
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Our user facing applications

1658
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Bridging the service and

1659
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Our team is small but growing

1660
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Dedicated to solving Microsoft's one

1661
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Biggest challenge in the creative fashion

1662
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
So they're saying that also

1663
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Possibly

1664
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Going to be streaming to not only like

1665
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Microsoft devices but iOS and Android

1666
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
That type of stuff so

1667
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Makes sense I think it would be kind of cool

1668
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
If they did something like that

1669
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
You know it seems to work

1670
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It's working out pretty well with

1671
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
You know Playstation right now and I know that

1672
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It hasn't quite gotten to the point where

1673
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
They can do it on well actually I take that

1674
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It has kind of gotten to the point where they

1675
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Can do that on Android devices because I remember

1676
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I saw that hack last week that they

1677
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Somehow got that working now where you can

1678
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Play your Playstation 4 games on your

1679
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Android tablets and stuff

1680
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So

1681
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Cool hey if I can find a way to

1682
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Game on the go you know and it works

1683
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Well over Wi-Fi I'm all down for that

1684
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Ever since Sony announced

1685
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Like Playstation now and SharePlay

1686
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I've been curious how Microsoft's going

1687
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Honestly I would like

1688
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And this is cool you know that you can do it

1689
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
On a mobile device but I would like to be able to do that

1690
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
On my laptop I would think that

1691
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
There would be a way they're going to stream it to PCs

1692
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Because you know

1693
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Microsoft does have that Windows tie-in

1694
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Can you imagine if you could stream your Xbox One console to a PC

1695
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
That would be really neat

1696
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
That would be fun

1697
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Because I would just take my laptop with me

1698
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
And Sony I'd love to do the same thing

1699
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
All my systems I'll just have them plugged in

1700
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And I'll just play them on my laptop

1701
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
If I'm down with that

1702
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Doesn't mean you'll be able to use a keyboard and mouse with everything

1703
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I don't want to but you know

1704
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I'm fine with using just the controllers

1705
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
But that would be really neat

1706
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
If you have the Xbox One in the living room

1707
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
And you could just stream stuff to your PC desktop

1708
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
And you could play the game

1709
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Using an Xbox One controller plugged into your PC or something

1710
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
That would be pretty cool

1711
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Anyhow maybe one game that you are

1712
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Streaming and still playing is

1713
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Destiny I see a lot of people actually

1714
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Streaming this on Twitch

1715
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Well you should get on that

1716
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Get on it because a lot of people

1717
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I knew that were playing it kind of stopped

1718
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And if you want me to play I'll still sign in and play with you

1719
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It's one of those things like

1720
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Especially once you get into the game jam stuff

1721
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's like I haven't really been

1722
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
You get to it eventually

1723
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The only reason I've been playing games at all

1724
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Is because I'm playing while my son is still awake

1725
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
It's not when I have free time or anything

1726
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
I can work on my own stuff

1727
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So I haven't really been playing when he's going to sleep

1728
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
But we'll see

1729
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Anyhow Destiny had a little

1730
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Minor patch this week

1731
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And the patch has to do with the expansion

1732
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
The Dark Below

1733
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Which I'm not going to buy until they slash the price

1734
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Which I know it's inevitable they'll slash the price

1735
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Of this because I kind of don't think

1736
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Everybody bought it

1737
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I mean I don't know maybe some sales numbers will come out and prove me wrong

1738
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But I know a lot of people that have either sold the game back

1739
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Or like I'm not buying this

1740
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Because there's not enough there

1741
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So very curious to see how that's going to affect things

1742
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
But anyway a patch did come out

1743
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
We tweaked some of the gear drop rates

1744
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
With Crota's End

1745
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Which is the Dark Below's raid

1746
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And more players will get equipment with their efforts

1747
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
So now raid gear in Crota's End

1748
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Starts at level 30

1749
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And this will help you on an upgrade path to level 32

1750
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
There's also a specific helmet item

1751
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And it will also spawn on normal mode now

1752
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And hard mode players have an additional chance

1753
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Of getting it as a drop

1754
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
There's also some issues regarding reputation gains

1755
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Hive shield functionality

1756
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Pocket infinity charging

1757
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So I'm going to be playing a lot of Destiny 2

1758
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
In a Destiny update that went live this week

1759
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
So you know

1760
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Despite the fact that I might feel a little more meh

1761
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
On Destiny now than when it first launched

1762
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
At least props to Bungie for staying on top of it

1763
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
And doing regular updates with the game

1764
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But I still am not a big fan of the fact

1765
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
That the raid content

1766
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Kind of

1767
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Or the new expansion content

1768
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Kind of gates some old things

1769
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Like you know the raid of the week

1770
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Is only in the expansion

1771
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So if you don't pay the $10 you can't do the same stuff

1772
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
That you were necessarily doing before

1773
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
A little silly to me

1774
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And I hope they consider

1775
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Some fixes with that

1776
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
If they haven't already to be honest

1777
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I haven't put the game in and played in a while

1778
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Maybe I will this week or if Loki ever tells me

1779
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Hey get on and play Destiny help me

1780
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Dark Sakura

1781
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Well we keep hearing about 38 Studios

1782
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
The group in

1783
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Rhode Island that didn't quite make it

1784
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And pissed off the entire state

1785
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I thought I really thought all that news

1786
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Was done with I thought we were past that now

1787
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I guess not huh?

1788
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Well it turned out that

1789
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
38 Studios board

1790
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Member fined for

1791
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Well it was getting fined for unregistered

1792
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Lobbying in Rhode Island

1793
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
That

1794
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Actually

1795
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
It was there's a hearing

1796
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Out there that says that

1797
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Thomas

1798
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Lobbyed state officials

1799
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And different politicians

1800
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
About the

1801
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Company and

1802
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But he wasn't a registered lobbyist with the secretary

1803
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Of state but that

1804
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Lobbying is what led to the loan

1805
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
That funded the company

1806
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
So dude's gonna get

1807
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Fined $2000 if he doesn't

1808
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Fill in the proper reports

1809
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So nope

1810
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
We haven't heard the last of them

1811
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
File your report or else

1812
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Or how about lobbying is

1813
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Stupid

1814
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Alright

1815
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Let's move on

1816
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
We're gonna travel around the world and check out

1817
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Some release dates and check out some things coming

1818
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
To a store near you although I think

1819
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
This segment might be a little empty

1820
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
This week I don't know Loki is there anything

1821
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
In the US? It is that time of year there is

1822
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Nothing coming out

1823
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Yeah unfortunately there

1824
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Is nothing coming out this week I mean

1825
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Tuesday in the states is what Christmas Eve

1826
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Eve as my sister calls it

1827
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
So yeah there's not really

1828
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I mean they don't normally put anything out around

1829
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
This time and even it's pretty dead

1830
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Up until March

1831
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
The only thing I can say is if you have

1832
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
You know your games with gold

1833
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Or if you've got

1834
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
PlayStation Plus don't forget to download the free

1835
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Games I know right now starting

1836
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
On the 16th they had SSX on

1837
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Xbox so I

1838
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Reminded myself today to go download that

1839
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Even if I may not play it or not I still have

1840
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Like money I gotta spend on there and I just

1841
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I honestly haven't been touching my Xbox in a long time

1842
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So I just have to

1843
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Figure out what I'm gonna

1844
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Buy for it I'm hoping

1845
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I hope I'll get an Xbox One at some point and I can

1846
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Just buy a digital game on that or something

1847
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
But yeah

1848
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Just unfortunately not a lot coming out until January

1849
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Alright well

1850
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Japan being a different culture has a

1851
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Different pattern with their releases and so we are

1852
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Seeing some releases in Japan this week

1853
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000

1862
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Looking at the last gen consoles

1863
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000

Nothing this week

1867
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000

Toad Treasure Tracker next

1869
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Year I didn't realize that game was not

1870
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Out in Japan oh never mind cause that's the Europe date

1871
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Not the Japan date oops

1872
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So gosh Japan doesn't get

1873
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
A Wii U game until

1874
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000

01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
In Japan let's quickly

1882
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Check the Vita and the 3DS

1883
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000

On the 3DS this week

1889
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Atelier Deco

1890
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
La Doll Collection

1891
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Looks like another title in the

1892
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I would say in the Atelier series but I don't think

1893
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
That is what this is at all this is just a doll

1894
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Dress up game coming out

1895
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
On

1896
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It's those dolls what

1897
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Jamie what do they call these dolls with the

1898
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Giant eyes that look like that one Lady Gaga

1899
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Video oh the Puleps

1900
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Yeah or the Blythe

1901
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Or the Puleps I think the Puleps

1902
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Yeah that looks like a Pulep

1903
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
So it looks like that kind of little dress up

1904
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Game there dress up and decoration

1905
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
On the 3DS I'm sure all of you

1906
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Are pre-ordering it right now

1907
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
How about Europe Dark Sakura?

1908
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Not a damn thing

1909
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Um it like gave me

1910
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Some games but didn't say when

1911
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So I'm just gonna throw off a few of them

1912
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Sure Cosmic Star Heroine

1913
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Uh Duelist

1914
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Habitat

1915
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
The Girl and the Robot

1916
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Some other stuff

1917
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Those are probably games that were

1918
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Announced for this year but never dated

1919
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So I'm thinking that's probably what it is

1920
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
We'll see I'm gonna put file that under

1921
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Bullshit so yeah

1922
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Nothing no games for you guys in the UK

1923
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Sorry you don't get to play anything

1924
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Catch up on your backlog shit

1925
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Get a Spectrum

1926
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

1927
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Speaking of the Spectrum just a couple more stories

1928
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Than the classic game of the week

1929
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Loki

1930
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
So um

1931
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You know I think we talked about this a while back

1932
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You know how the whole

1933
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Debate regarding

1934
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You know 1080p and upscale

1935
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
1080p and the whole you know

1936
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Oh this game's not really 1080p

1937
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's like 900p or whatever

1938
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yes I do remember this debate

1939
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
There was this lawsuit or

1940
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It was a class action lawsuit against

1941
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Killzone Shadowfall

1942
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And they were saying that you know

1943
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
It was false advertising because it wasn't a native

1944
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
You know 1080p

1945
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And so

1946
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Apparently the

1947
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Federal judge has ruled

1948
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I guess that a lot of the

1949
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Complaints have been dismissed

1950
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So there is

1951
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Only still one left I guess

1952
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
And I'm trying to see here I believe it

1953
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Was that they were saying

1954
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Um

1955
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Let's see here

1956
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Something I think that still has to do with

1957
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The native or the razor sharp

1958
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
1080p native resolution

1959
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Is false advertising

1960
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And they were claiming that it was blurry

1961
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
To the point of distraction which honestly

1962
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Looking at the screenshots and

1963
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Videos of seeing a Killzone it looked pretty

1964
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Good I just don't understand why people

1965
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Would be complaining about that game there's

1966
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Plenty other games that look like crap

1967
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Um

1968
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But yeah basically

1969
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
All but one argument

1970
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Basically that shouldn't agree that

1971
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
The negligent misrepresentation

1972
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Claim cannot stand in its current

1973
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
State as Ledor did

1974
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Not present a non economic

1975
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Loss such as personal injury or property

1976
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Damage yes he caused property

1977
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Damage because of the

1978
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
The lack of pixels burned

1979
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
My house down

1980
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Um yes

1981
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And so you know because of that you know

1982
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
They granted them 30 days to file an

1983
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Amendment complaint in which case they say

1984
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Um they can sufficiently

1985
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Alleged that he or other punitive class

1986
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Members suffered such non economic

1987
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Damages I just

1988
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I the whole thing just seemed to be

1989
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Kind of a grab for money in the first place

1990
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I just don't see this

1991
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I'd be surprised if that last

1992
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Bit doesn't get dismissed

1993
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Or if it does go to court that

1994
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
They still don't win I mean cause

1995
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I think they're just

1996
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Kind of stretching at this point trying to

1997
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I don't know if it ever

1998
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Says it's native 1080p anywhere

1999
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
On like any of the advertising

2000
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Hey Murica

2001
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Ah

2002
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Anyhow uh alright

2003
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I got a story about a series

2004
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That I know a lot of you like I like this series

2005
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
An awful lot it's pretty much all I use my 3DS

2006
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
For now that Smash Brothers is on Wii U

2007
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
And that game is Theatrhythm

2008
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And guess what Theatrhythm Dragon

2009
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Quest is going to be a thing

2010
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It was shown at Jump Festa 2015

2011
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Which was a big Square Enix festival

2012
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
That's going on right now

2013
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
We have some other stories about what came out of Jump Festa

2014
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
A little later on in the show

2015
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
But yeah Theatrhythm Dragon Quest is going to be a thing

2016
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Who knows if it will actually come out here

2017
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
In America that's the big

2018
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Question right now but Dragon Quest

2019
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Theatrhythm will come out in Japan on March

2020
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
26th of next year

2021
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Again no Western release yet confirmed

2022
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
For the game if they're going to do it

2023
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I would imagine they'd announce it at E3

2024
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
For a holiday release kind of like what they did with Curtain Call

2025
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
I don't know if this would be the type of thing

2026
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
That might be download only

2027
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Because I mean unfortunately over here

2028
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Dragon Quest is a little more niche

2029
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Especially when you consider

2030
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That there's probably going to be songs from Dragon Quest 10

2031
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
In it which wasn't even released here

2032
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
So I don't know but anyway there still

2033
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Will be field and event music stages

2034
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
That are in the game

2035
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
There will also be apparently a top down

2036
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Rock band type setup

2037
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
That will take the four lane battle

2038
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Layout that was found

2039
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
In the previous Theatrhythm games and

2040
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Turn it into something a little different there

2041
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
So again March 26th

2042
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
2015 is the big day

2043
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
For that in Japan I'm sure some people will

2044
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Be importing that

2045
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Also good news for Japanese owners of

2046
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call

2047
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Some more DLC

2048
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Was confirmed for Final Fantasy

2049
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Curtain Call now there was some

2050
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Stuff that you would expect in this game such as the

2051
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Ultima Battle music from Final Fantasy 14

2052
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Which is really good by the way

2053
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Hard to miss as well will be

2054
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Coming out but those songs are going to be

2055
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Free for two weeks when they come out in Japan

2056
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So that's pretty cool but also get this

2057
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
The opening titles and

2058
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Passionate rhythm from

2059
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Romancing Saga and Romancing

2060
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Saga 2

2061
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Saga Frontier will be getting a song in the game

2062
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The Meridian dance

2063
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
From Secret of Mana is going

2064
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
To be in Theatrhythm Curtain Call

2065
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And Chrono Trigger

2066
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Is getting a song

2067
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
In Theatrhythm Final Fantasy

2068
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Which many people

2069
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Were saying Chrono Trigger should just get its own

2070
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Damn Theatrhythm game

2071
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
But it's been so long

2072
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I don't know if that will happen

2073
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
No announcement yet if those

2074
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Songs will make their way over

2075
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
To the US I sure hope

2076
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
So I think a lot of

2077
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
People would really dig some

2078
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Of these songs in America

2079
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But we shall see

2080
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
What do we have to do for like DLC

2081
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
For Mario Kart 8 that's

2082
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Chocobo Racing

2083
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
What do we have to do for that?

2084
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Or hell just make

2085
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
A racing game. Shit it can't be

2086
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
That expensive they have the fucking Sanrio

2087
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Games that come out that aren't that great

2088
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Chocobo Racing is coming to Final Fantasy 14

2089
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
With the Chocobo breeding

2090
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Yeah but it's not Chocobo Kart Racing

2091
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
I understand that

2092
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
You're actually going to get to control your Chocobo though

2093
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
It's probably

2094
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
It's not going to be as robust as something that Mario Kart 8

2095
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
There should really be like a whole

2096
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Derby Owners Club type game

2097
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Like Final Fantasy where you're just sitting there

2098
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Like guiding on them

2099
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I know I'm sounding fanboy

2100
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And you know what sometimes I just can't help it

2101
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You made Polteri cry

2102
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
With Final Fantasy 14

2103
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
The fact that they're bringing Triple Triad into the game

2104
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And Chrono

2105
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Yes they're bringing Chrono Trigger into Final Fantasy 14

2106
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
No they're not

2107
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
It's not canon if it comes in there

2108
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
But can they get like the Golden Saucer up in there

2109
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
That's what it is it's coming in the next patch

2110
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's called the Manderville Gold Saucer

2111
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Is coming in the 2.5 patch

2112
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Before the expansion

2113
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
There's more

2114
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Fucking Hilda whatever

2115
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
The fuck is it

2116
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
They haven't said if it's part of the Hildebrand quest or not

2117
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I hate him

2118
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I love him you're a hater

2119
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I am a hater because he's stupid

2120
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I like his dad though

2121
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I don't know if it was Allen or Shane that suggested this

2122
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I think it was Allen that said this

2123
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That it could be that his

2124
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
No it was Shane because I think we were talking about Skype

2125
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
It could be his dad that owns

2126
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
The Gold Saucer

2127
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Or his mom

2128
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
His mom has not been seen in the story

2129
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Hildebrand's mom

2130
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
She could be the one that runs the Gold Saucer

2131
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
She probably got smart and left him

2132
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
So what was the new

2133
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
The new jobs that they added for 14?

2134
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
They announced

2135
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
This didn't make our show roll but yes they announced

2136
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
3 new jobs for Final Fantasy 14 that will be in the expansion

2137
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Dark Knight which is a new

2138
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Tank class it was not a tank in 11

2139
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
But it will be a tank class now

2140
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
They announced Astrologist which is the new healer class

2141
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Machinist

2142
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And Machinist

2143
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Is going to be the DPS class

2144
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I want to play an Aurra

2145
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Aurra is the new race

2146
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's new to Final Fantasy

2147
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
They look like Draenei but just not blue

2148
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
They're pretty

2149
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
They build mechs and stuff

2150
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
That would be pretty bad

2151
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Do you remember

2152
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Edgar in Final Fantasy 6

2153
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Why did they tell me this?

2154
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
That sounds so awesome

2155
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
They're going to actually use little

2156
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Drones too

2157
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Looks awesome

2158
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It's kind of like the Engineer class

2159
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Come to the dark side

2160
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Do the thing

2161
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Sorry Nellie

2162
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
That means

2163
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I'm not going to remake Mulan

2164
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
But I'm probably going to do a second character

2165
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Edgar is like seriously my favorite character

2166
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
From like pretty much all the entire series

2167
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
They have the most bad ass weapons

2168
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
This is why Final Fantasy 14

2169
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Is doing so awesome

2170
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And why the game continues to be awesome

2171
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
The reason why

2172
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Is they know that

2173
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And they're acknowledging that Loki

2174
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
They know that people love Edgar and that's why they're making

2175
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Machinist a class in the game

2176
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Just for the same reason they made a fucking Magitek armor

2177
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Something that you can actually get in the game

2178
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And ride around on

2179
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
It's that same type of stuff

2180
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I wouldn't doubt

2181
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
At some point they'll put the fucking Opera House from Final Fantasy 6

2182
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Somehow in the game

2183
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
They have Ultros

2184
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
With the old school battle music

2185
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
In the game so

2186
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
That's why the game is doing so well

2187
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I'm on that quest line right now

2188
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
They know what people like

2189
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
That fight is kind of a bitch

2190
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's harder than the Shiva fight

2191
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
You can teach me the mechanics before I try it

2192
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
You get turned into an imp

2193
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And you have to imp punch

2194
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
The other guy

2195
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Before he does his thing

2196
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Can you imp punch him in his

2197
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Imp junk?

2198
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

2199
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Nelly can't hear you Rob

2200
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
She's pouring sand in your car's gas tank

2201
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Probably

2202
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Alright you know what

2203
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Let's travel back to a time when games were a lot simpler

2204
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
You know they weren't

2205
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Just self referential

2206
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Although this game might have been a little bit

2207
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
It's the classic game of the week

2208
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Where Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault

2209
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
And find a game and she thinks

2210
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
You know what

2211
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Since there's no games coming out in the US or Europe this week

2212
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You go fucking play this game

2213
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
You do the thing

2214
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
You get Loki subbed

2215
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
To Final Fantasy 14

2216
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
And then you play this

2217
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Dark Soccer what is

2218
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
If you make your character by the way

2219
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
No that will never happen

2220
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I will just name my

2221
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I'll name him

2222
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Just after what I had in my other class

2223
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Alright

2224
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Here it is your classic game of the week Dark Soccer

2225
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I love love love this game and I'm so excited

2226
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It's finally a fucking

2227
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Classic game of the week

2228
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I picked a game that came out the year I graduated high school

2229
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Oh my god

2230
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Why do you insist

2231
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Is that your new thing you're going to come out here and go

2232
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I picked this game because it's now officially

2233
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Nine years old and so are you

2234
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
No Rob this is more than

2235
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Ten years old

2236
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
This is 20 years old

2237
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Remember I skipped my 20th high school reunion

2238
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
To play this game

2239
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Oh and the oven is preheated so we got

2240
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I better do this quick because Latkes

2241
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Oh yeah

2242
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Point blank also known as

2243
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Gun Bullet

2244
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I love that game

2245
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Or it's also been nicknamed

2246
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Gun Buddy

2247
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
It came out by Namco

2248
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
In the arcade Playstation

2249
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It's got a version on the DS

2250
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
But it first came out in 1994

2251
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
For the arcade and it is the first

2252
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Light gun game

2253
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
That Namco has ever done

2254
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Basically

2255
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It's a fucking light gun game

2256
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
But you have different types of

2257
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Quests that you have

2258
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And they're different puzzles

2259
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Like the one on the video

2260
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
That I'm linking here is actually one of the harder ones

2261
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Where it's a cut out shoot

2262
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That you go down a hall

2263
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And you have to shoot all the bad guys

2264
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And none of the civilians

2265
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
You got ones where you shoot

2266
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Different targets of a color

2267
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
You get

2268
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Different

2269
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Shoot all the balls

2270
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Yes

2271
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
You shoot the balls

2272
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And it's like Buster Brothers

2273
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
The way that the balls work

2274
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
You shoot them and they get smaller

2275
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
That would be so easy to make

2276
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's funny

2277
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
This game is so fucking good

2278
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I can't

2279
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
You have to also protect Dr. Don and Dr. Dan

2280
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
You have other challenges

2281
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Some things that have in common

2282
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
With police trainer

2283
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Different difficulty levels you have

2284
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Practice, beginner, advanced, and very hard

2285
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Because some people like it very hard

2286
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Determine how many stages

2287
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
That you have to finish

2288
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
To complete the game

2289
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
As well as their difficulty

2290
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And then you get four missions

2291
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
In each of those types of groups

2292
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
So you can do different ones

2293
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
In different orders

2294
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So you lose your lives by failing to complete your quota

2295
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Within your time limit

2296
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Or shooting a bomb

2297
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Or letting Dr. Don or Dr. Dan die

2298
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
When you have to protect them

2299
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Incorrectly answering questions

2300
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
By shooting the wrong answers

2301
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Shooting a cardboard civilian

2302
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Shooting a cardboard geisha

2303
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Failing to complete a quota

2304
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
For multiple life things

2305
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Letting meteors destroy the earth

2306
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Because that's always a day ruiner

2307
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Running out of bullets

2308
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Shooting incorrect differences

2309
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Letting aliens steal your shot

2310
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
And more

2311
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
So the things that you're

2312
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Gauged on is accuracy, intelligence, memory

2313
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Simulation, visual acuity

2314
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
And speed

2315
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So as far as the games that have come out

2316
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
In this series

2317
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
We have Point Blank, the first one in 1994

2318
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Or Gun Bullet

2319
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
As it's called

2320
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Point Blank 2, which came out as

2321
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Gun Body

2322
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Ghoul Panic

2323
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Or Baekhyun

2324
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Which was a haunted house theme

2325
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
In 3D graphics instead of the

2326
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Yes, the cat bug level

2327
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Yes, the cat bug level

2328
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Point Blank 3

2329
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Or Gun Ballina

2330
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
And Point Blank DS

2331
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Which was a

2332
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Uno no Tatsujin Gun Bullet Trainer

2333
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
But yeah, it actually

2334
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Like I said, it was an arcade release

2335
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
But then it came out on the Playstation

2336
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Which I've got versions of this that I cannot play

2337
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Because we can't use light guns on modern TVs

2338
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And the Playstation had

2339
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
The arcade mode included

2340
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
But it also had like an RPG mode

2341
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
And then it was recreated in Point Blank 2

2342
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
And then

2343
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
So basically the very last iteration that came out

2344
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Was in 2006

2345
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
With

2346
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Sorry, Point Blank DS

2347
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Or as I said, Uno no Tatsujin

2348
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Gun Bullet Trainer

2349
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
There you go

2350
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

2351
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
I really love this game, Point Blank

2352
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Available

2353
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
In the arcades

2354
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
So you know, on main cabinets everywhere

2355
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Or the more ethical way of

2356
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
On the Playstation, even though

2357
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
You're gonna have to get an old TV to play it on

2358
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
It reminds me, where the hell are my gun guns?

2359
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I wish they'd bring this back

2360
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Here's what you can do with the Morpheus

2361
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
That's what I want with the Morpheus

2362
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
The Move Controllers

2363
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
They had the gun controllers for that

2364
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
They had Time Crisis

2365
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
They had the Toy Story game on Wii

2366
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Which is a very similar type of thing

2367
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Well they also have it on the Playstation 3

2368
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Yeah, that's right

2369
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Yeah, I'm down with that

2370
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Come on Namco, it's been a

2371
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
It's been a long time

2372
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Hell, just bring it to

2373
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Well, I don't know if they could do it on Virtual Console

2374
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
But that'd be awesome on Virtual Console

2375
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Point Blank is the reason the CRT should never truly die

2376
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
YYR wants to point out

2377
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Shameless plug

2378
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
My game, Sharpshooter, on Xbox Live Indie games

2379
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Is basically Point Blank using the analog stick

2380
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Instead of a gun

2381
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Also crappy graphics, but the gameplay is there

2382
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Hey, you know what?

2383
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
YYR kind of planted the seed that led to this whole game jam idea

2384
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
That we're going to get into tonight

2385
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
So I have no problem plugging his stuff

2386
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
YYR

2387
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
YYR is doing the Lord's work

2388
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
In my opinion, between

2389
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Bungie ferret tossing and pixel shits

2390
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
So you know what? Plug away

2391
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Plug away

2392
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Let's take a break

2393
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
We're going to take a quick break, guys

2394
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
But when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio

2395
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Including the

2396
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
List tonight, guys

2397
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
The OLR

2398
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Bobby Blackwolf and other shows on the network

2399
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Are going to be teaming up to prevent

2400
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
To prevent, to present

2401
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Not prevent

2402
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
If we pick the wrong theme, it might prevent it

2403
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
But we are going to present

2404
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
The VOG

2405
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
game jam

2406
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And that is kicking off tonight

2407
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And I know some of you have your Unity windows up

2408
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Ready to go

2409
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
You just need to know the theme

2410
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So we are going to pick that theme when we come back

2411
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
After a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2412
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2413
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Live on this Sunday evening

2414
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
December the 21st of 2014

2415
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Episode number 580 of our show

2416
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Already in progress

2417
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
And a very happy

2418
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Whatever it is you celebrate this December

2419
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
It's Hanukkah

2420
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Right now

2421
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It's Hanukkah

2422
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
It is Hanukkah right now

2423
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
But this week also sees

2424
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
You know, Christmas

2425
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Which is kind of a big deal to some people

2426
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Which is kind of a big deal to some people

2427
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Kwanzaa, what else

2428
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Is Festivus this week?

2429
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
When is Festivus? I don't know

2430
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Ramadan, I don't know

2431
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Ramadan is in the middle of the year

2432
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
What is the other holiday I am thinking of

2433
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
This time of year

2434
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Solstice for some people

2435
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Saturnalia, which is today I believe

2436
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
What is the other big one this winter

2437
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
That is the Solstice, Yule

2438
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Hanukkah going on

2439
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Kwanzaa going on

2440
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Boxing Day

2441
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
That's the day after Christmas

2442
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It's like Black Friday in Canada

2443
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
But instead of trying to kill each other

2444
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
They all push each other and apologize

2445
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Sorry, sorry

2446
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Sorry

2447
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Try to get that crockpot

2448
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Anyway

2449
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Let's move on

2450
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And try to get into

2451
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Some more gaming news

2452
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And we are going to start off with some rapid

2453
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Fire news, Loki

2454
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Which is kind of cool

2455
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Even though we don't technically have our first

2456
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Female character in a Grand Theft Auto

2457
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Game, unless you can count

2458
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Grand Theft Auto online

2459
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Now, Payday 2 is getting its first

2460
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Female gang member

2461
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
In some new DLC

2462
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Her pseudonym is Clover

2463
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And I guess she is joining

2464
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Joining in on the

2465
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Heist scene

2466
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Also they are going to have a unique weapon

2467
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Called the Shillelagh weapon

2468
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
The Shillelagh, so is she Irish?

2469
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
She is Irish

2470
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And there is also a new mission

2471
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I guess called the Diamond Heist

2472
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
They will try to swipe

2473
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I guess you would try to swipe the

2474
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
World's most famous diamond from a

2475
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Heavily guarded museum

2476
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
So the Diamond Heist

2477
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
DLC, that would be $7

2478
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And then

2479
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I guess $5 for the character pack

2480
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So

2481
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
That's pretty cool

2482
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Definitely looks like

2483
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
She would fit right in with Grand Theft Auto

2484
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Or Payday 2

2485
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I have to check out Payday 2

2486
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I got Payday 1

2487
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I got it free when they had it on there for a little bit

2488
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I miss chocolate Paydays, those were delicious

2489
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
And then of course

2490
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto

2491
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Grand Theft Auto 5, they kind of do stuff

2492
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
For the holidays every now and then

2493
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I haven't played my game

2494
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Recently yet, but I know they are

2495
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Going to have snow

2496
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
In Los Santos, so you can check that out

2497
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
But they also have Festive Surprise

2498
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Update

2499
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Which is going to add

2500
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
A lot of Christmas and holiday themed

2501
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Things, including

2502
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
They've got brand new weapons

2503
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Also Christmas sweaters

2504
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Had scarves, they had a mask that looks like

2505
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
A gingerbread man that's kind of creepy

2506
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
A penguin mask

2507
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
They are also going to have some

2508
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
New Year's stuff

2509
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Including a fireworks launcher

2510
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Rocket ammo again, just like

2511
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Last year

2512
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Hot Rod, Christmas Rat Loader

2513
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Slam Van

2514
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Oh, proxy mines and a

2515
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Homey Missile Launcher were added to the game as well

2516
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
And of course, all that is free

2517
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
So go check it out

2518
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And to go with that

2519
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
They've been

2520
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Heists have been promised for Grand Theft Auto Online

2521
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Forever now

2522
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It was supposed to have been out around the time

2523
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
That Grand Theft Auto Online launched

2524
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And this week they had a new trailer

2525
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
For heists that are going to be coming early

2526
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
2015

2527
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
And it looks pretty awesome

2528
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Definitely going to

2529
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
They even kind of poke fun at it a little bit

2530
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
In there talking about

2531
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Kind of a little bit of a delay

2532
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
But it's showing off different types of missions

2533
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It can go on

2534
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Breaking people out of jail

2535
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
And all sorts of

2536
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Bank heists and that kind of stuff

2537
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Looks pretty cool, should be coming to

2538
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Platforms early next year

2539
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Hopefully sooner than later

2540
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Alright

2541
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Let's see here

2542
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Last but not least

2543
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
More DLC for LittleBigPlanet 3

2544
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I guess it would be for everything

2545
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Because

2546
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I think those characters are interchangeable

2547
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
But they're going to have

2548
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Frozen characters

2549
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Making their way to

2550
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
LittleBigPlanet

2551
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Oh, hooray

2552
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
They're going to be able to have

2553
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Elsa, Anna, Sven, Kristoff, and

2554
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Marshmallow in the medicine man skins

2555
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Which can be purchased for

2556
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
$1.99 a piece or in the whole

2557
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Costume pack which would include

2558
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
The exclusive Olaf skin

2559
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
For $5.99

2560
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And they're going to be releasing

2561
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
A winter creator kit for free to go along with that

2562
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Look, I love Disney

2563
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
And I'm sure this is fine

2564
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I have not seen Frozen

2565
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I don't know how the fuck I never saw it

2566
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
I so rarely get out to movies anymore

2567
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I just never saw Frozen

2568
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
But the more and more overexposed Frozen gets

2569
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
The less and less I want to see the damn movie

2570
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Because I'm just like, stop

2571
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
There's like an entire

2572
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Archive of Disney everything

2573
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
And it's still everything Frozen

2574
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Like half of Disneyland is Frozentown

2575
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Right now

2576
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Why can't it be all like, you know, I don't know

2577
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Wreck-It Ralph or Big Hero 6

2578
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Yes, exactly

2579
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Exactly

2580
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Alright, anyhow

2581
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
There is more news coming out of the Jump

2582
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Festival over in Japan

2583
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Including a new trailer for Final Fantasy

2584
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
XV that showed up

2585
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I'm very excited about this game

2586
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Even though, I got to admit, seeing the English

2587
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Voice acting in the game, I'm a little bit worried

2588
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Because it wasn't exactly

2589
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
The best, but well

2590
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It was better than Destiny's

2591
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So we'll see

2592
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
So this game will be coming out

2593
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I'm assuming they're trying to make it for holiday

2594
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Next year, especially with the demo coming out

2595
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
So we'll see if it makes it

2596
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
But other notable things in the trailer

2597
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
They showed a Titan summon

2598
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
In the trailer and it looked amazing

2599
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
He was gigantic

2600
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And it looked like he was about to step on one of the guys

2601
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
That was pretty cool

2602
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
And they revealed that they're going to have Sid

2603
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
In the game, of course, but this time Sid is a woman

2604
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Named Sydney

2605
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
And Sydney is an engineer

2606
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
And she has a bit of an accent

2607
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
And she introduces herself as Sydney

2608
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
And they call her Sid for short

2609
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Why not?

2610
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Anyhow, they

2611
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
Also have announced

2612
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Not Square, but Nintendo has announced

2613
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
That Duck Hunt will be coming out to the Wii U

2614
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Virtual Console

2615
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
We talked about that a while ago

2616
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I think that news just came out this week

2617
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
That it's officially coming out to the Virtual Console

2618
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It's dated now

2619
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Oh, they have the date now?

2620
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Christmas Day

2621
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
When they were talking about Smash

2622
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
They mentioned Duck Hunt

2623
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
But I don't think they had a date yet

2624
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Well now it has a date

2625
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So it's December 25th is the day that it's coming out

2626
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I have no idea how that is going to work

2627
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
With the light gun

2628
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I'm assuming it's using the Wiimote as the controller

2629
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Maybe tapping the gamepad would be kind of cool too

2630
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
But I doubt it

2631
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Neat

2632
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Don't forget, there's also the whole

2633
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Many people remember the Duck Hunt part

2634
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But it's also the clay pigeon shooter thing

2635
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
They have in there too

2636
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
The original game that the whole thing was based on

2637
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
But anyway

2638
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Also coming out on the 25th

2639
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Of this month

2640
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
The same day

2641
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Shantae and the Pirate's Curse

2642
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Is finally coming to the Wii U

2643
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
And I know some people have been awaiting this game

2644
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It's been out on the 3DS for a little bit

2645
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
But of course the Wii U version will have

2646
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
HD character portraits

2647
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Off TV play

2648
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Classic Controller Pro

2649
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And Wii U Pro Controller support

2650
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
And he's a very talented individual

2651
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
So I'm sure a lot of people will be checking out Shantae

2652
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
And hopefully enough people buy this game

2653
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So that the Nintendo

2654
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
E-Shop can say, Shantae, you stay

2655
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Alright

2656
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
And one more little quick announcement here about

2657
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Killer Instinct

2658
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Of course the free to play fighting game on the Xbox

2659
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Riptor

2660
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Is making its way to Killer Instinct this week

2661
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And December

2662
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
17th was the day that Riptor hit the game

2663
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I guess that was

2664
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
A little bit earlier or whatever

2665
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Anyhow, the new design is similar to the old design

2666
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
For Riptor

2667
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
There you go, some extra little

2668
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
New high definition features on

2669
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Riptor

2670
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
A game which I will certainly check out whenever

2671
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
I finally get around to getting an Xbox One

2672
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I thought I would buy it this holiday

2673
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
But

2674
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Sadly didn't get one in time

2675
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
For the big holiday

2676
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Alright, Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?

2677
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Rescued the latkes

2678
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Alright

2679
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
They look well done over there

2680
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
They are done, they have to cool off a little bit

2681
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
D-U-N

2682
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Well, first of all for the holidays there are

2683
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Some freebies going on

2684
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
And some happiness to be had

2685
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
So first of all

2686
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
The

2687
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
There's a game called

2688
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Enter the Gungeon

2689
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike

2690
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
They are both free on Steam right now

2691
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And

2692
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Especially in the Fork Parker game

2693
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
You get features like

2694
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Snow Helicopter, Dope Beat

2695
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
Ethics

2696
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Reverse Monetization, Hot Tubs

2697
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Falling

2698
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
And Ropes

2699
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
So there you go

2700
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Next up, Capcom though

2701
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Is going to be delisting

I do too

2725
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Alright

2726
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Bummer about those games

2727
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Getting delisted but I guess it makes sense

2728
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
With all the licensing and so forth

2729
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Well one thing we don't plan on delisting from this show

2730
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Anytime soon is the chance for you guys

2731
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
To have your say in a segment we call

2732
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
The Fugal Question of the Week

2733
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
You take the words

2734
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Facebook and Google Plus

2735
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
And slam them together and you get

2736
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Fugal

2737
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And we're going to ask our community a question

2738
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
As we do every week

2739
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
And this week has to do with

2740
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
The video game jam

2741
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
That we are starting tonight

2742
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
The video game jam kicking off tonight

2743
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
We want all of our awesome listeners

2744
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
To create something, dammit

2745
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
And so we're asking you

2746
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
What should the theme be?

2747
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
So I don't think Loki has finished his list yet

2748
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And I don't think Dark Soccer has finished her list yet

2749
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Finished, started, you know, same thing

2750
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Alright

2751
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Bobby hasn't finished his list yet

2752
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I don't know

2753
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Or maybe he has

2754
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
So we want you guys to have your say

2755
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
On what should be on the list

2756
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
So here it is, some of the answers from Facebook

2757
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
We have some answers here on Facebook

2758
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Such as Hitstun

2759
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Who says three colors

2760
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Should be the theme

2761
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
And Hitstun wants to remind us that

2762
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Food and rotation

2763
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Are also things that were submitted

2764
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
On the comments to last week's episode

2765
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I believe boobs was also submitted

2766
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Twice as the theme

2767
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
So you got three colors

2768
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Food and rotation

2769
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
You know why I like three colors?

2770
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Because it reminds me of the old school computer monitors

2771
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Although I think technically that was CMYK

2772
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
I think were the colors that it could do

2773
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Black is technically not a color

2774
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Alright

2775
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Let's see, Milton H says

2776
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Theater

2777
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Theater should be the theme

2778
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Alright we'll see, we'll see

2779
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Fifth Dream suggesting unicorns

2780
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I think I brought that one up earlier in the show

2781
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Unicorns, that would be a lot of fun

2782
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
And Raginator

2783
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
In typical Raginator suggestion

2784
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Says either explosive projectile diarrhea

2785
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Or ginger pubes

2786
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Oh Raginator

2787
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
And we only have one answer

2788
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
One lone answer over on Google Plus

2789
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
And it's actdeft suggesting

2790
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
And I like this one

2791
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
How about hats?

2792
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Well how about hats?

2793
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Alright

2794
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
There it is, some of the suggestions from you guys

2795
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
We will see what makes the list here

2796
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
In just a little bit

2797
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
But we have a few more stories for you guys

2798
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Before we get to that list list

2799
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Alright so

2800
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Let's talk a little bit about

2801
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Let's see here

2802
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Steam

2803
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
So the Steam Controller

2804
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Still not out yet

2805
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
But it's been going

2806
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Undergoing several revisions

2807
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
And the newest revision of the Steam Controller

2808
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Actually kind of is unveiled

2809
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Based off of

2810
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
An image that was in the Steam Client Beta

2811
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
And it shows now

2812
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Where the

2813
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
You know how they kind of have those

2814
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Crazy circle

2815
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Touch pad things that were

2816
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
The analog sticks

2817
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I remember last time that they added

2818
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Actually an analog stick to the controller

2819
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Now there's a d-pad where one of those

2820
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Circle pads is

2821
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Or I guess it's still part of the circle pad

2822
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
But there's like some sort of d-pad

2823
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Cross mark on it

2824
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
So I don't know

2825
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
It's more and more becoming like an

2826
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Xbox 360 controller

2827
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
As time progresses

2828
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
It's just slowly

2829
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Evolving into like an Xbox

2830
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Controller or like a

2831
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
New pro controller or something

2832
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
But uh

2833
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
I don't know

2834
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
It'll be interesting to see

2835
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
What that looks like when it's actually released

2836
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Hell it'll be interesting to see what these

2837
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Scene boxes look like when they're actually released

2838
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Yeah won't it have been a year

2839
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Since they were announced

2840
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
When we finally get around to the CES

2841
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Has it only been a year?

2842
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I think CES was when they announced it

2843
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Whoa why is our outro playing

2844
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Sorry about that it's not over yet

2845
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Be quiet Jason

2846
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
My fault sorry

2847
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
Um so yeah I'm not sure

2848
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Um

2849
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I'm surprised it's only been a year

2850
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
But it's taking

2851
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Taking a long time I guess

2852
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
I don't know

2853
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Definitely less excited about

2854
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Them kind of taking over as like a console

2855
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Though the buzz

2856
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Is kind of dropped off

2857
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Completely

2858
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I think I don't know

2859
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Alright one more story for you guys

2860
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And this has to do with

2861
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
World of Warcraft

2862
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Which I've been playing a little bit thanks to the new

2863
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Expansion and some updates were

2864
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Finally posted this week I was curious when they were

2865
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Going to finally talk about what their first

2866
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Major patch will have for

2867
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Warlords of Draenor and they finally talked a little bit about that

2868
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
But

2869
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
You know it doesn't really matter what else the note said

2870
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Because

2871
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
A lot of people very interested

2872
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
In one of these points that was

2873
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
On the blue post that was made about this

2874
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
About potentially adding

2875
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
A subscription currency

2876
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
And they're comparing this

2877
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
To the Plex currency in EVE Online

2878
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And what would happen is that you could buy

2879
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
And sell game time tokens

2880
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
For in game gold

2881
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Saying quote our current thought on this is that

2882
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
It would give players a way to use their surplus

2883
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Gold to cover some of their

2884
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Subscription cost while giving players

2885
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Who might have less play time

2886
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
An option for acquiring gold

2887
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
From other players through a legit

2888
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
And secure system

2889
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
So this is going to cause a lot of people to perk up

2890
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
When the world's biggest MMO

2891
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Which a lot of people have been saying should go

2892
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Free to play already

2893
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
When they're talking about possibly

2894
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Funding subscriptions through

2895
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
In game gold

2896
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Now granted it's not going to be like you just pay the gold

2897
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
For the subscription there still has to be that exchange

2898
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Of currency but this will

2899
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
In some ways combat

2900
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
The third party market that's out there

2901
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
For gold buying

2902
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And they tried to do this before with a pet

2903
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
They sold a pet on the marketplace

2904
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
But it was something that would be tradable

2905
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
And you could actually sell it on the market boards

2906
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
And what was interesting is that the market kind of

2907
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Bottomed out on those pets really fast

2908
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And so people bought them and

2909
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
They wouldn't sell for a lot of gold in game

2910
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
So it would be very interesting to see what happens

2911
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Because when you're talking about subscription fees

2912
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I mean that is literally the life blood of a game

2913
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Much different than the pet so it's going to be very interesting

2914
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
To see how that plays out

2915
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
But would you be interested

2916
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
In playing Final Fantasy XI if you could pay for your subscription

2917
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
In Gil?

2918
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
It's hard enough to earn Gil in the game

2919
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I don't know if I'd want to

2920
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I ain't sure, why not

2921
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
But I don't know if I'd want to do that

2922
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Just drop the subscription down to like

2923
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Five dollars a month or something

2924
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Something ridiculously cheap

2925
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I don't know, even twelve bucks is not a lot

2926
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
But it's been that for a long time

2927
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Why would they drop it down that low

2928
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
When people are still paying what's out there today

2929
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Why would I pay twelve dollars for that

2930
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
When I can, isn't it like twelve

2931
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Or fourteen dollars for fourteen

2932
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I don't know what the subscription fee is

2933
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
I honestly can't remember either

2934
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
It's something around that but like why would I pay

2935
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Twelve when I can pay

2936
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
You can also do like the multi month thing

2937
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
And all that other stuff so

2938
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Yeah

2939
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I don't know

2940
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Alright well it is time ladies and gentlemen

2941
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Get ready because the

2942
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
VOG Jam

2943
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Kicks off right now

2944
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
With a segment that we

2945
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Call Listless

2946
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
And I will explain it to you guys here momentarily

2947
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
But we have to get an old buddy of ours here

2948
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
On the line to play Listless with us

2949
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Tonight so I'm going to hope that he is standing

2950
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
By ready to

2951
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Share the themes and ideas with us

2952
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Hello Bobby are you there

2953
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
I'm here what's up

2954
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Hey I should have said Atlanta

2955
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Are you there? Did you always say Sacramento

2956
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Or are you guys there?

2957
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
How are you doing my friend?

2958
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I'm doing good

2959
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Are you excited about the game jam?

2960
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I'm very excited

2961
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Me too, what is exciting you about this in particular?

2962
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
That I actually will have a reason to open up Unity again

2963
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Have you opened up Unity

2964
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Since Flappy Vog?

2965
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Nope

2966
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And why not?

2967
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Time

2968
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And inspiration

2969
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
You're going to have to make time for the

2970
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
And Bobby Blackwolf and do we know if any

2971
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Other shows on the network have joined in on this?

2972
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I don't know

2973
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
But is the video game jam

2974
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
But the nice thing is about those words video game

2975
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
You got V, O, and G in the word

2976
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Haha wink wink nudge nudge right?

2977
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
We created something dammit

2978
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
That's right we want everybody to create something

2979
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Alright so let's go over the rules

2980
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Here's the way it's going to work

2981
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Let me stop the Listless music

2982
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Because we're not ready to get quite into Listless yet

2983
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
But let's go over the rules of the competition

2984
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Well it's not really a competition

2985
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Everybody joins in, it's a participation event

2986
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
But here's the way it works

2987
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
It is open for your submissions

2988
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Around this central theme

2989
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And you can make a game in Unity

2990
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
You can make a game in RPG maker

2991
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
You can make a level in LittleBigPlanet

2992
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
You can do a pen and paper game

2993
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
If you want to scan it as a PDF

2994
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Whatever works

2995
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
We want you to create something dammit

2996
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And the only question we're going to ask

2997
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Is did you try

2998
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Did you try

2999
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
And that's a very subjective question

3000
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
And Jamie will be the ultimate judge

3001
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Of the can you try or did you try department

3002
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Because we don't want somebody just sending in

3003
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Like a piece of paper that says

3004
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
You know frame one frame two

3005
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
You know what I mean

3006
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
You gotta try a little bit with this

3007
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
But we realize everybody has different skill sets

3008
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
So we want you guys to try

3009
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And the theme should tie into

3010
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Whatever it is that you put together

3011
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Lightly or heavily

3012
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
It's up to you

3013
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
You're going to submit your completed

3014
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Game jams to the following

3015
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Address jam

3016
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
As in grape or jelly

3017
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Jam at vognetwork.com

3018
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
You can send those emails jam

3019
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
At vognetwork.com

3020
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
And with a link to your finished product

3021
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Now Bobby vognetwork.com

3022
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Can actually host

3023
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Some of the finished products right Bobby?

3024
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Right so what I'm offering

3025
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Is because I've already got kind of a

3026
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Thing in our backend system that we run

3027
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
That I created for VOG

3028
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Is so if your game

3029
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Can be run in a browser

3030
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Which is either Unity Web Player

3031
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Which uses its own plugin

3032
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Or if it's Flash

3033
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Or if it's HTML5

3034
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Something that can be run in a browser

3035
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
And you don't have space for it yourself

3036
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I'm willing to host it

3037
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
On vognetwork.com for you

3038
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It'll actually appear in our drop down

3039
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Because we have that arcade menu item

3040
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
In our top drop down it'll actually appear in there

3041
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
People can go in there and play it

3042
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
And essentially what I'll do

3043
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Is I've created a forum

3044
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
A sub-forum on our very

3045
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Not used forums

3046
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
At vognetwork.com

3047
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Right up near the top about the video game jam

3048
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
And I'll put technical specifications in there

3049
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
As to what you need to send

3050
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
We're also willing to host your file

3051
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
For you

3052
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
So that way you don't have to worry about

3053
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Too much about like a Mega account

3054
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Or a Dropbox account

3055
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
We'll host the file on our servers as well

3056
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
If you just want to distribute the zip file

3057
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And have people install it that way

3058
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
My only

3059
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Rule on this

3060
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
And this is not censorship

3061
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
This is because I don't want to have an awkward

3062
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Conversation with our web host

3063
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
That hosts VOG

3064
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
No supreme gore and no supreme

3065
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Sex and nudity

3066
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
You could still do that

3067
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
We're just not gonna host it

3068
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
If you really want to make a porn game

3069
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Go for it and I will totally play your porn game

3070
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
However you just have to host it on your own server

3071
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
So I just want to make that clear

3072
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
We gotta keep all the super porn

3073
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
And the super gore off of our own server

3074
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
But if that's what you want to submit

3075
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
You know what, more power to you

3076
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Just create something dammit

3077
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Alright

3078
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
This is gonna be so much fun I can't wait

3079
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
So there is a forum and people can actually collaborate on that forum

3080
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Like I know Dark Tetsuya in our secret forum

3081
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
He actually put together

3082
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
A brilliant list of all these possible ways you could make a game

3083
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
And Dark Tetsuya if you're listening

3084
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Go to that new forum right now

3085
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
And like copy paste your post cause it's great

3086
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
So

3087
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Kaijuto says no sex I'm out

3088
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Hold on we didn't say no sex

3089
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
We just said we're not

3090
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
You need to go hook up at someone else's place

3091
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
That's what we're saying

3092
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
You can still submit it

3093
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I'm just not hosting it on my website

3094
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That's right you gotta have your hook up

3095
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Somewhere else

3096
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Preem sex and nudity

3097
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
What if we leave off the sour cream and diced tomatoes

3098
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Oh stop oh you

3099
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Fifth Dream says can it be

3100
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Can it just be HTML

3101
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Sure create something dammit

3102
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Is it a game?

3103
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Oh there you go

3104
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Oh deadline

3105
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
You have until

3106
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Drum roll please

3107
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
You have until January 11

3108
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Three weeks from tonight

3109
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
To submit your finished product

3110
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Tonight that we will start the evaluation process

3111
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
It's probably gonna go on throughout the week

3112
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
And when I say evaluate just mean

3113
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
We're gonna play your game and we will

3114
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
We're gonna give it a fair review and a mention here

3115
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
On the show but we will be a lot

3116
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Nicer if you're worried that we're gonna

3117
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Make fun of your game or talk negative about your game

3118
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
No that's not what we're here about

3119
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
We are here to promote and encourage people

3120
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
To create so we promise we will

3121
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Only say positive things about your game

3122
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
And keep the whole thing positive

3123
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
We wanna encourage people to create things

3124
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
And we'll live stream some of that

3125
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
And some of the prizes

3126
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
For participating you're gonna get some

3127
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Special VOG network loot

3128
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Which comes with points that you can only get if you

3129
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Participate in this

3130
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
OLR will also be donating

3131
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Five mystery prize packs

3132
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
Five tangible mystery prize packs

3133
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
To random participants

3134
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
And that is it

3135
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
There is not gonna be any judging as far as first

3136
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Second or third place because we just wanna say

3137
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Create something dammit but we may still

3138
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Give out some special acknowledgements

3139
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
As need be

3140
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
So I think I covered everything right Bobby?

3141
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Yeah basically

3142
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
That's pretty much it

3143
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
I would say what like 5 PM Pacific

3144
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Like when our show starts

3145
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Sunday night that's when submissions should be closed

3146
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Yeah 5 Pacific 8 Eastern so we can read them

3147
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
All out on Bobby's show

3148
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Just like their chatters

3149
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
And you can be in teams that's perfectly

3150
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Fine you can even collaborate on the forums

3151
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
And stuff YYR brought up a good point

3152
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Maybe you know people should do status updates each week

3153
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Just so we can kinda keep tabs on it

3154
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Absolutely Because I could be mean

3155
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
And just submit flappy vog

3156
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
If it fits the theme

3157
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
If it fits the theme

3158
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
And the theme I might suggest in a moment here is anything

3159
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
But flappy vog

3160
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And preferably no copyrighted

3161
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Works Oh yeah yeah try to stay away

3162
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
From the copyrighted stuff

3163
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
We ban them from the theme submissions

3164
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Now a lot of people asking about

3165
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
What qualifies as supreme gore

3166
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Or sex and

3167
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Tiger class says if the game has colorful language

3168
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Is that allowed? Yes because our shows

3169
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Have colorful language that's fine

3170
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And as far as supreme gore and sex

3171
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
If your game is called like

3172
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Decapitation corpse fucker

3173
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Then you know it's probably not

3174
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Gonna be okay for the game jam

3175
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
To be hosted on our site

3176
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
We did have decap attack on

3177
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
I know I know look just use

3178
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
We're talking about hosting you can make whatever you want

3179
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
If it's like that it can't be hosted

3180
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
On the site and I will be the

3181
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Supreme dictator on what gets hosted

3182
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Or not I will be like steam

3183
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
And if I say that I'm not

3184
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Gonna host it then I'm not gonna host it

3185
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
And but you can still put it somewhere else

3186
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
But again I want to really

3187
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Encourage you guys to think outside

3188
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Those don't get hung up on the

3189
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Sex and gore good god people

3190
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
There's so much more out there

3191
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
It's just Raginator and if you yeah if you want

3192
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
To do sex and gore go for it just

3193
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
On your own server that's all just

3194
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Get your own dropbox account or whatever so there it is

3195
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
YYR in chat says

3196
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Decapitation corpse fucker theme noted

3197
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Alright

3198
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Well let's talk about how list list works

3199
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Cause it's been it's been quite some time

3200
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Since we played list list here on the show

3201
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
So I know not everybody may have heard this so this is the way it's gonna work

3202
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
You guys listening live

3203
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Get to vote on this as this unfolds

3204
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So here's how it's gonna work

3205
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
We have compiled all of our answers

3206
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
As well as some of the answers we've seen you guys post

3207
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Into a list of three

3208
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Items a piece

3209
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
So each of us will put an item up on the list

3210
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
That's gonna leave us with a list of twelve

3211
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Then comes the very hard part we go around

3212
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
The room and we each remove one

3213
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Item from the list hey it's tough

3214
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
But it's a scientific process it has to be done

3215
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
No host can have their list

3216
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Decimated so if

3217
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
If somebody gets

3218
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Two answers eliminated from their list the third

3219
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Answer gets immunity

3220
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
So through that process we'll be left with a list of

3221
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Eight that you guys will vote on

3222
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

3223
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
So right now you're gonna see that pop up on the board

3224
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
If you happen to be listening to the show

3225
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
You're gonna see that pop up on the screen

3226
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
What should the video game jam theme be

3227
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
And you can watch the list creation

3228
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
As it unfolds

3229
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
We are gonna let our guest go first tonight

3230
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000

3231
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Bobby what is your number three

3232
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Position even though it doesn't really matter for this

3233
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
But we still say three two one what is your number three

3234
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Answer for what should the video game jam

3235
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Theme be

3236
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Okay well first thing I wanna say is that you have to be

3237
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Logged into vognetwork.com to see

01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000

Drums or drumming

3246
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I see so a little bit of percussion freaks there

3247
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Drums or drumming

3248
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Just because you have a personal

3249
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
You have a personal interest

3250
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
In this right

3251
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Alright but just keep in mind guys

3252
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Tycho drum masters already been done

3253
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Alright drums or drumming

3254
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Let's put that on the list

3255
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Alright up next tonight

3256
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Loki, Loki what is your

3257
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Number three answer

3258
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Not entirely original

3259
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But I used a random generator

3260
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
So for some of these

3261
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
But some of them are pretty good

3262
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So the first one I had was

3263
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Buggy game

3264
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
To win you have to work around the bugs

3265
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Or die trying

3266
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
That was one of my alternates

3267
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
A buggy game

3268
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Interesting

3269
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Can I think of like

3270
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
What was that game

3271
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Rom check fail

3272
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Or something like that

3273
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
No but I think especially in light

3274
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Of the year we've had and what I just complained

3275
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
About at the beginning of the show with Tetris

3276
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And everything I think it's kind of funny

3277
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
That now the intention would be to make

3278
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
A buggy game I like that that's cute

3279
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Alright a buggy game let's add it to the list

3280
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Alright I'm up next with my

3281
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Number three answer

3282
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
My number three answer tonight

3283
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
You know gosh I've been kind of going back and forth

3284
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
A little bit with the ideas

3285
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
And originally

3286
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
I was going to put one called

3287
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Revive the arcade on the list

3288
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
But the more I was thinking about it

3289
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I was kind of like ah I don't know if that

3290
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I think that might be too specific

3291
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I'm not sure if everybody would get that so I'm going to

3292
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And chatters this way

3293
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
You guys can't say you didn't have your say of this

3294
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I really like the idea

3295
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Of three colors so I'm going to go ahead and add that

3296
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
To the list because I think that's going to encourage

3297
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Some retro stuff but not necessarily

3298
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Because there's a lot you could do with three colors

3299
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Concept so I like that idea so much

3300
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I'm going to put it on my list in the number three spot

3301
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Alright DarkSakura ladies

3302
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Last what is your

3303
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Number three answer

3304
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Typography

3305
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Typography okay

3306
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
The font fan in you

3307
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Wants typography so

3308
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Mavis Beacon teaches typography

3309
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I don't want it to be like

3310
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
A word game

3311
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
I just want typography

3312
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
To be a theme

3313
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
A theme in the game

3314
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Alright I like that let's add it on the list

3315
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Alright there it is the number three answer so far

3316
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
A buggy game three colors and typography

3317
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Alright let's add four more

3318
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
To the list as we get the number two answers

3319
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Bobby Blackwolf

3320
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Alright so my second theme

3321
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Know when to quit

3322
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Know when to quit

3323
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Interesting again another very

3324
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Kind of vague answer because

3325
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I don't know why but my mind instantly

3326
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Went to well I don't know if I should even say this

3327
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Because I don't want to steer the game so you know what

3328
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I'm not even going to say what my mind instantly went to

3329
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
I think it's the same place everybody else's would go

3330
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
That's the beauty of it

3331
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
That is the beauty of it you guys

3332
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
See my other answers are very like silly

3333
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
But you guys have these like really in

3334
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Depth thought provoking things where's the dick and

3335
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Fart jokes tonight Rage Nator is going to stop listening

3336
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
You guys alright know when to quit

3337
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Let's put it up on the list I could have said twat but that's banned

3338
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
That's right that just leads to

3339
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Super porn alright

3340
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Loki let's get

3341
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Your number two answer

3342
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
My number two answer is everything you know is wrong

3343
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Now that song is stuck in my head

3344
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Interesting everything you know is

3345
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Wrong oh gosh

3346
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
So kind of like take you put like a classic game

3347
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
In there but have it play completely different

3348
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Oh I love that idea

3349
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Well that's one don't don't don't uh don't tilt

3350
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
What happens I'm just saying give me an example

3351
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I like that idea

3352
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Oh that's a good one everything you know is wrong

3353
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I like that alright

3354
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
It is on the list

3355
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Next up my answer my number two

3356
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Answer I've decided now I thought about

3357
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
What games do I really want to see

3358
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
What do I want to see people make

3359
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
And the game I would like to see the

3360
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
VOG faithful create

3361
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Is I want to see them make a game called

3362
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Or involving

3363
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Jamie joins the circus

3364
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
What?

3365
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Jamie joins the circus

3366
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
What?

3367
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
No

3368
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
But circuses are fun

3369
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
It could be a freak show

3370
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
I'm afraid of clowns

3371
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Oh that's a good tidbit to know

3372
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
So maybe Jamie joins the circus

3373
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
To eliminate the clowns who knows

3374
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
They just need to die

3375
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Alright there it is Jamie joins the circus

3376
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
My number two answer and now it is on the board

3377
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Alright DarkSakura

01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
What is your number two answer

3379
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
MS Paint

3380
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
MS Paint

3381
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Okay oh boy

3382
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I fear what might happen if uh

3383
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
MS Paint

3384
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I will also throw Corell Dral in there

3385
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
As long as it's the 16

3386
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Color lack of tablet

3387
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Poor drawing

3388
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Alright

3389
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
It's MS Paint

3390
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
MS Paint or Corell Draw I like that one

3391
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Alright it is on the list this is gonna be hard for the

3392
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Elimination round tonight this is gonna be so hard

3393
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Alright uh here we go

3394
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Number one answers from everybody

3395
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Here it is

3396
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
The last one to put on the list Bobby Blackwolf

3397
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
I'm torn between two

3398
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Cause I wrote down a bunch

3399
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
But I'm gonna go ahead and say

3400
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Programmer Art

3401
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Programmer Art

3402
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
That's almost like MS Paint

3403
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
But it's a little bit better than MS Paint

3404
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Almost

3405
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
But is it?

3406
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
It's just different I guess

3407
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Alright

3408
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Programmer Art

3409
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Alright the number one answer from Loki

3410
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
What is it

3411
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
See I had two thoughts on this

3412
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
And one thought though is if I did that

3413
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
That that might win

3414
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And I don't want that to win actually

3415
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
But I just would like to

3416
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I'll keep that as an honorable mention I guess

3417
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
But um I'll just stick with also one of the ones

3418
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
That came up on the random generator

3419
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Unwanted Powers

3420
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Unwanted Powers

3421
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Would that be about the Sony Network TV show coming soon?

3422
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
It could be

3423
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
It could be alright

3424
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
We're gonna add that to the list

3425
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Unwanted Powers there it is

3426
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Alright my number one answer

3427
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
You know what you guys enjoyed the Jamie Joins the Circus

3428
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Answer so much

3429
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I thought we would do another one

3430
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Involving some VoG personalities

3431
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
And so my number one answer tonight

3432
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Bobby and the Banhammer

3433
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Is my number one answer

3434
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
What no reaction from Bobby?

3435
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
That's Flappy VoG right?

3436
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
It could be

3437
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
No submitting Flappy VoG though

3438
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Alright there it is on the list

3439
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Bobby and the Banhammer

3440
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Alright here we go

3441
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Dark Sacra

3442
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Last chance for people to have their items on the list

3443
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Dark Sacra what is your number one answer?

3444
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Ink

3445
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Ink

3446
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Alright you've got a very designed mindset tonight

3447
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Ink is your final answer

3448
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I do because I like to challenge people to think outside of

3449
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I want to

3450
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Ink

3451
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Specifically black ink

3452
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Excuse me

3453
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
So do you want to know my

3454
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Answer that I've

3455
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Forgone

3456
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
What was that?

3457
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Oh my god

3458
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
How did we not get President Cat on the list?

3459
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Because it would win

3460
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I don't want it to win

3461
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
You don't want it to be that easy

3462
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Bonus points for throwing in President Cat

3463
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Bonus points for any

3464
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
You know what though? You could do

3465
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
President Cat for any of these other things

3466
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Yeah I was going to say even though this isn't graded

3467
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Bonus points to

3468
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Any OLR, Bobby or

3469
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
VoG references that you work into these games

3470
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I mean like think of something vague

3471
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Like three colors of typography

3472
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
You could totally do like a President Cat game out of that

3473
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Alright

3474
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
You want to know some of my honorable mentions that I threw out?

3475
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
So I also

3476
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
And I actually used the same random theme generator

3477
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Just because I just clicked it like a thousand times

3478
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
And picked out my favorites

3479
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Losing to win

3480
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Delayed reaction

3481
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Please enter your name

3482
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
And recurring dream

3483
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
And then actually the buggy game

3484
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Was the other one

3485
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Oh funny

3486
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Alright so here it is and be thinking about

3487
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
What is going to be eliminated because it's going to

3488
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Happen it's got to happen it's part of the process

3489
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Y'all the elimination round here is the list as it stands

3490
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Right now

3491
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Drums or drumming? Know when to quit

3492
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Program or art?

3493
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
A buggy game

3494
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Strong, unwanted powers

3495
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Three colors

3496
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Jamie joins the circus

3497
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Bobby and the ban hammer

3498
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Typography, MS Paint or Corel Draw

3499
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
And black ink

3500
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Alright

3501
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Here it is the part none of us want to do

3502
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
But we have to it's science people

3503
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
It's science

3504
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

3505
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Bobby Black Wolf

3506
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
You know when I'm looking at these

3507
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I'm trying to get something that's

3508
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Not so straight

3509
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Like a game jam a good game jam theme shouldn't

3510
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Be something that's so straight forward

3511
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Or so linear

3512
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
You know like where it really constrains

3513
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
People so I am going to eliminate Jamie

3514
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Going to the circus

3515
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Thank you but now I have to think of another one

3516
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Oh come on you could have done like

3517
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Just a regular circus theme

3518
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Or something and just put Jamie as a character

3519
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
In it that would have been easy

3520
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Easy come on they did

3521
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Circus on the Atari 2600 boo

3522
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Alright whatever

3523
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
It is stricken from the list

3524
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
And you're a jerk alright

3525
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Loki you're next

3526
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

3527
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Only because I'm not creative enough right now

3528
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
To understand how I'd even incorporate

3529
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
This in there I'm sorry Jamie

3530
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
I'm gonna have to take off typography

3531
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Oh typography

3532
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
And there's some concepts are beyond people

3533
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Hey I'm fine with that

3534
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
You know I gotta admit

3535
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I kinda wanted to do like a text adventure

3536
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Typography is a tricky one Jamie

3537
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
It's a tricky one

3538
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
I will tell you though I did have an idea

3539
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Of making a game

3540
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Where the landscape is made out of text

3541
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Okay

3542
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Actual words

3543
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Well you could do it in three colors

3544
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Or one of these other ones we'll see

3545
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
That's okay I'm probably gonna stick with my first idea

3546
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Alright cool

3547
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
For now though we've got to eliminate

3548
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
A couple more from the list oh shit it's my turn

3549
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
And I have to ask myself which of these

3550
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Is not worthy of the list

3551
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Um I am going to

3552
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Eliminate I'm gonna take a

3553
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I'm gonna do a revenge strike on Bobby

3554
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And I'm gonna take off one of his answers

3555
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Cause again this is one of those ones

3556
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Like most of these I instantly had an idea

3557
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
In my mind but I couldn't think

3558
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Of one for programmer art

3559
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I'm sorry I have to eliminate that from the list Bobby

3560
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I'm okay with that

3561
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
But we're gonna call that a revenge vote

3562
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Alright what do we have left

3563
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
What do we have left Dark Soccer wants to know what's left

3564
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Loki has a fully intact list

3565
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
But Loki's list is a buggy game

3566
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Everything you know is wrong and unwanted powers

3567
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
And we also have drums or drumming

3568
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
No when to quit

3569
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Three colors, Bobby and the band hammer

3570
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
MS Paint or Corel Draw

3571
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And black ink

3572
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I actually

3573
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Am gonna go with everything you know is wrong

3574
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Just because that Weird Al song is stuck in my head

3575
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
And I would make

3576
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I would make a Weird Al game

3577
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
And I would be so distracted so

3578
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Alright well this

3579
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
You know what

3580
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
The list worked out alright

3581
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
This is the nice politically correct

3582
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Positivity list because each

3583
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Person had one answer removed

3584
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
That's the way we like to see it happen

3585
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
So there it is

3586
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
It is now up to you guys

3587
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
How many people can say they've had their answer removed because of Weird Al?

3588
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Same

3589
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Well for me about that is that there's actually a game

3590
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
That's done by some local Georgia developers

3591
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Who once it comes out I'm gonna have them on my show

3592
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
It's called Default Dan

3593
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
And the entire premise of the game

3594
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Is that it looks like Mario except

3595
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
The enemies are good and the coins

3596
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Kill you

3597
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
It's basically it's everything you know is wrong

3598
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
It's basically that and that's all I would be able to think of

3599
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
If I was working on that theme

3600
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Alright so fair enough fair enough

3601
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
And to be fair also with the programmer art

3602
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I kind of thought it was really similar to the MS Paint answer

3603
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
And it hit some points out in chat too

3604
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
That makes me think about another idea that I did have to suggest

3605
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
What's that? Power down

3606
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
If you want to see a perfect example of programmer art

3607
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Check out this week's Cooking with Unity

3608
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
This on Monday

3609
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
They made a snowman

3610
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Out of primitives in Unity

3611
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
That is programmer art right there

3612
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Alright well it is in your hands now folks

3613
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000

And your number 2 is your second click answer

3618
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Your votes are weighted

3619
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Number 1 gets more points than number 2

3620
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
So vote now at live.vognetwork.com

3621
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
And a little later in the show we're going to tabulate it up

3622
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
And reveal the big theme

3623
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
For the first VoG game jam

3624
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
I'm excited I think

3625
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I think some people's heads are turning already about some of these

3626
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
In fact I think some people are going to be pissed if one of these doesn't win

3627
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
I'm just

3628
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I'm excited I can't wait

3629
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
But again if the theme you like doesn't win

3630
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I still think you get bonus points

3631
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
For incorporating two or more of these

3632
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Into your jam or any other long running joke

3633
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
So get creative people

3634
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Get creative

3635
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Alright Bobby before I let you go anything else you want to add to this?

3636
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
No good luck

3637
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And I look forward to playing everybody's game

3638
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Alright me too I look forward to it

3639
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Bobby I wish you were here to eat latkes with us

3640
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I wish I was there too

3641
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I'll throw one at you

3642
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Yes I'm throwing you some applesauce right now

3643
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Thanks guys

3644
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Bye my friend take care

3645
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Alright part 2 of this list was to come up

3646
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Shortly in the show

3647
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Place your votes now

3648
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Please vote or die

3649
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Meanwhile we've got some more segments to get back to

3650
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Including the mail bag

3651
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
So Dark Sakura is going to dive into the mail bag

3652
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
She's going to find some emails that she believes are worthy of reading

3653
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
So do my favorite Eddie Izzard quote

3654
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
It's a little sticky

3655
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Alright

3656
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
We have a email

3657
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
A email one singular email

3658
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
One

3659
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Alright

3660
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Or as I learned recently

3661
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
The way to say it in Hebrew is echad

3662
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Alright

3663
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Fair enough

3664
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Hi OLR I wanted to give kudos to the nice

3665
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Bunch of guest talks you've had in recent shows

3666
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
They were very fun and informative

3667
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
If I may I would like to suggest

3668
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Someone to interview on the show

3669
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
YouTube personality

3670
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Ryan Letourneau

3671
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Aka Northern Lion

3672
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
He's Canadian that's all you need to know

3673
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Sign him on and an email

3674
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Anyway Ryan is best known for his long running

3675
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Play series of The Binding of Isaac

3676
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Though he has played through some other

3677
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Notably difficult games such as Europa

3678
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Universalis 4

3679
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Spelunky FTL

3680
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
And XCOM Enemy Unknown

3681
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
On top of that he hosts

3682
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Live streams with friends a few times a week

3683
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
And also offers quick impressions on games

3684
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
That have just released or are still in the works

3685
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Typically more with indies than AAA games

3686
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I think it would be interesting to know

3687
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
What it's like for Ryan to play video games

3688
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
To entertain others for a living

3689
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
When did it seem

3690
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Viable to attempt this

3691
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
And how risky was it to try

3692
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
What sort of difficulties has he faced nowadays

3693
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Why don't you just interview him dude

3694
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Interview him for us

3695
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
And send us the recording

3696
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Has he faced any criticism

3697
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Over his livelihood were there any unwelcome surprises

3698
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Or cool perks to have come up since he began

3699
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
What would he recommend to others

3700
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Who want to start their own channel

3701
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Yeah I bet he'd answer these questions if he emailed him

3702
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
But in all seriousness

3703
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
I appreciate the referral

3704
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
At first I was like well there's a lot of people that do let's play videos

3705
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
What makes

3706
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Kind of what I didn't get from this

3707
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Email was what makes this guy

3708
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Unique

3709
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Why do you want this particular individual on the show

3710
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Because I don't know the guy

3711
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
He sounds like you really like him

3712
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
I'm just curious like what it is

3713
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
That really makes this guy unique

3714
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
But then I did hear in the email

3715
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
It appears he makes a living off doing this

3716
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
So that is unique not everybody can do that

3717
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
So this guy's doing something right

3718
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Well there's more to the email

3719
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
These are just some things I'm curious about

3720
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
And I'm sure OLR can come up with

3721
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Other interesting questions given the opportunity

3722
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Even if Ryan doesn't get on the show

3723
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I want to give my thanks for having my suggestion

3724
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Read on air

3725
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Or can I just bribe you all three

3726
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
You like bribes involving tacos right

3727
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
That'll work but latkes are kind of winning me over tonight

3728
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
From the nasty canasta

3729
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
We need to bust into that pie

3730
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
We need to have a new segment just called pie

3731
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
We do need to bust into that pie

3732
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Let's make it happen

3733
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
We are done with late emails

3734
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
It's going to be a celebratory pie

3735
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
For when we have our

3736
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
VOG game jam theme determined

3737
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Which by the way now is the time where I say

3738
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Last call for listless votes

3739
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Get your butt logged into the site

3740
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
And vote

3741
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Last call for those votes

3742
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Alright

3743
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week

3744
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
It's after the mailbag segment

3745
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
You have to give your FU

3746
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
DarkSakura your FUs of the week

3747
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Um

3748
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
FU to the lingering bits of the plague

3749
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
That I had last week

3750
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
That make my lungs hurt

3751
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Getting out of my wonderful codeine syrup

3752
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
And um

3753
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
FU to not having a

3754
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Tron pinball table

3755
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Those are pretty rad

3756
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I played one a couple days ago

3757
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Nice

3758
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I saw on Facebook

3759
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I saw them just for you Rob

3760
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I was wondering where the hell you were that had a table

3761
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
It was a private party right

3762
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Why wasn't I invited

3763
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
It's a private party

3764
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I'm awesome

3765
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
And then we went to the pinball party

3766
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
I know like 20 people that work at little cat

3767
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Why wasn't I invited

3768
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I should have been somebody's date

3769
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Next year you'll be my plus 2

3770
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Awesome

3771
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
Loki your FU of the week

3772
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Um

3773
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Just to go back to what I was saying before

3774
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
FU to telltale games for

3775
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
I'm sorry not telltale

3776
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Travelers tales

3777
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Fuck them

3778
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
For their really shitty flight controls

3779
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
And lego marvel super heroes

3780
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I swear to god

3781
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
That game would have been awesome

3782
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
But that right there kind of really pisses

3783
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
Me off

3784
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Thankfully the races

3785
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
Because it's a game meant for kids

3786
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Are really fucking easy

3787
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Uh the driving races

3788
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
But uh yeah fuck those flight controls

3789
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
They're fucking terrible

3790
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Alright my FU of the week

3791
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
First one goes to the fact that I wasn't invited to the low cap party

3792
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
No

3793
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
The second FU of the week is the fact that

3794
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Of um

3795
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Of all the trainers in our company

3796
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
All of them

3797
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I'm the only one that has to work next week

3798
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
And I have a class

3799
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Monday Tuesday

3800
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
No not Wednesday

3801
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Monday Tuesday next week

3802
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I have to teach and then I have to teach the next week too

3803
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Every day that isn't technically a holiday

3804
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
With the new year involved

3805
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
But you know what at least I like my job

3806
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
But still it always sucks when you have to work

3807
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
So that's awesome

3808
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Dar soccer is complaining that she has to work on Christmas

3809
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
But you're Jewish

3810
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Alright

3811
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Alright anyway they can't hear you

3812
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
You're not on mic

3813
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
She's too busy slicing up this amazing pie

3814
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
That I can't wait to dig into

3815
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
So let's do a couple more stories

3816
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Then we're going to reveal the listless winner

3817
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
And then we're going to get into your calls

3818
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
So let's do it

3819
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Uh Loki

3820
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
So Humble Bundle everybody is pretty much familiar with that website

3821
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
The process behind it

3822
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
You buy a game for whatever price you want

3823
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
And part of that money goes to charities

3824
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And part of it goes to devs

3825
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And Humble Tip and all that fun stuff

3826
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Well they've raised a lot of money since launching that site

3827
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Back in May 2010

3828
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Over 50 million dollars

3829
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
For charity since that first sale

3830
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
And they've even

3831
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Raised was it 100 million dollars

3832
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Towards developers

3833
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
So that's pretty awesome

3834
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
And um

3835
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
They're saying the very first Humble Bundle

3836
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Raised $400,000 for charity

3837
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
$200,000 each for

3838
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
EFF and Child's Play

3839
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
And um

3840
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Just

3841
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
That's just amazing

3842
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
All this money going to these awesome charities

3843
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
And um

3844
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Hell even

3845
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
They're not the only site out there now

3846
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Now they have all these other bundles that go to

3847
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Different charities

3848
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
I'm kind of curious to see how much money

3849
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
You know sites are kind of injecting

3850
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
To these great causes

3851
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
So uh awesome

3852
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Although I gotta say though

3853
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I'm starting to run out of gains

3854
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
To purchase on their site because

3855
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
A lot of them seem to be repeating

3856
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
And I have a lot of leftover Steam keys

3857
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I don't need anymore copies of Fez

3858
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Please no more copies of Fez

3859
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Alright

3860
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
And one more story I have for you guys

3861
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
And this is

3862
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
This is tough to report on

3863
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
But in the same way it shows the

3864
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Good side of the gaming community

3865
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
And the last official news story

3866
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I wanted to have because you know it's

3867
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Been kind of a rough year in some ways in the gaming

3868
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
World and there's been a lot of

3869
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Very heated

3870
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Intense and sometimes

3871
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Downright personal debate that's been going

3872
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
On out there so I like

3873
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
It when gamers can band together for something

3874
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
That's good

3875
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
And um

3876
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Unfortunately the situation is awful

3877
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
The situation is not so good

3878
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
And uh it has to do with Final Fantasy

3879
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
14 but I just want to say

3880
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Because I know you're all going to go fanboy

3881
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
But hold on I'd be reporting on this even if it wasn't

3882
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Final Fantasy 14 this is just kind of the first

3883
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Big case that we've seen in Final Fantasy

3884
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
14 and this has to do with a

3885
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Reddit post that was posted on the Final Fantasy

3886
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Subreddit last night where

3887
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
A free company leader

3888
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Put a new permanent rank on a friend

3889
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
That they were informed was going to be

3890
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Passing away literally within

3891
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Hours and there was a little

3892
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Screenshot that was posted over to Imgur

3893
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
That noted that

3894
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Codex Valda

3895
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
And I hope I said that name right Codex Valda

3896
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Would be the immortal siren in this

3897
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Particular free company

3898
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
And that alone

3899
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Is pretty cool but what really happened next

3900
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Was really amazing and

3901
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
You know the player

3902
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Behind the character

3903
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Only 29 years old

3904
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
And passed away the other night

3905
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Codex unfortunately he did pass away due to

3906
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Complications from renal failure which is another

3907
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Word for kidney failure

3908
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
And it was one of those things where they knew

3909
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
He needed a new kidney and it was

3910
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Kind of a surprise that this happened

3911
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I mean because

3912
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Yeah they had like a donor lined up

3913
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
You know this was just one of those

3914
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
And I think they even said one in a

3915
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Million situations where unfortunately

3916
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
It was that one in a million

3917
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
So Codex did unfortunately

3918
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Pass away but the side of this

3919
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Is good I mean that part's obviously not good

3920
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
And very tragic but the side of this

3921
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
That's really great is that

3922
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
This really just created this

3923
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Spontaneous outpouring of

3924
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Support in the game and it started with

3925
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
One or two people just kneeling

3926
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
With their characters in front of the house

3927
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
And staying logged in and kneeling

3928
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
And then that slowly grew on the Gilgamesh

3929
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Server too I think they said it was up to 80 people

3930
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
At one point and more and then it was spilling

3931
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Onto other servers in the same

3932
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Housing district people kneeling and being respectful

3933
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
And I saw some people

3934
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Took out their fairies as scholars

3935
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
And actually spelled out the guy's name

3936
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Codex with their fairies as a bit

3937
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Of a tribute and I just thought

3938
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
You know I was like this is

3939
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
The type of stuff why

3940
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I love games and why

3941
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I love MMOs was that the community

3942
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
You know put all their shit aside

3943
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
About you know so and so doesn't heal

3944
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Fast enough in a dungeon or whatever put all

3945
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
That stuff aside to take a moment out

3946
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
To recognize one of

3947
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Their own community that was gone way too

3948
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Soon and I just you know and this this story

3949
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Has been gaining a lot of steam on like you know

3950
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Kotaku did a story on it and so it's

3951
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Spreading to other places as well and I just

3952
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Thought this is a great example

3953
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Of the community recognizing

3954
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
One of their own and I do hope the final fantasy

3955
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
14 developers I know they're busy with the

3956
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Japanese fan fest right now I hope the

3957
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
14 developers kind of notice this and maybe

3958
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Will consider doing an NPC

3959
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Tribute and I realize you can't

3960
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Do a tribute for each and every person

3961
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
That played final fantasy 14

3962
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
That happens to pass away

3963
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Just like they can't do that in wow or whatever

3964
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
But for particularly invested people

3965
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
And for particularly people

3966
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
That seems very tied into the community

3967
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Where the community sort of you know

3968
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Spontaneously comes together for something

3969
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Like this I really hope that the 14 developers

3970
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Do some type of official

3971
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Recognition of support for codex

3972
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
And you know

3973
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I'm so sorry for codex's friends

3974
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
And families that this happened but

3975
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Just know that there are literally

3976
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Hundreds and thousands

3977
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
And thousands now of

3978
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
People who are remembering this

3979
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Particular player because you know

3980
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
What we all love this game as

3981
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Well anyway

3982
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Let's see fifth dream in chat says there was a

3983
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Get together tonight on mcgarthomer I put off some

3984
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Fireworks I'm very sad I missed it

3985
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
I had to do this show though but I'm glad

3986
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I could at least mention it on the show

3987
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Act F says the gaming community

3988
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Can be amazing when it tries to

3989
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
And dungeon buster says indeed

3990
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
And I think that is a fantastic note

3991
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
To end on but I do want to point

3992
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Out as joan under matt also says the guy's real

3993
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000

Played games with him for several years

3995
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
So a moment of

3996
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Silence please for codex

3997
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000

You want to call us to tell us about what you're

02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Going to do for

02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Theme that's right guys it is time

Winner

4011
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Of tonight's game jam

4012
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
So here it is the

4013
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Theme for the game jam I'm just waiting

4014
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
For it to pop in right now the votes

4015
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Are being tabulated right now

4016
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
And we're going to reveal the winner

4017
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
And we're actually going to I'm going to go ahead and reveal

4018
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
What got really close and

4019
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Didn't quite make it I'm going to reveal that

4020
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
As well so I'm just waiting

4021
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
For those answers to pop in

4022
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Which they should any minute

4023
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Oh this is embarrassing do I have to reload

4024
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Maybe I do

4025
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
This all is automated

4026
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Behind the scenes

4027
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
No I don't want you to resend data that you already

4028
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Hold on I'm going to try this one more time

4029
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
I think I remember something about you have to be on the page

4030
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
For a minute before it pops in

4031
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I might need to

4032
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Actually make it live

4033
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Set it on fire

4034
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Uh oh

4035
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Did you break it? No I didn't break it

4036
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Hold on I'm going to try making it live again

4037
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Just not answer but we'll see if that fixes it

4038
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
It's been so long since I've done this

4039
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
That I forget how to make it show me the

4040
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
I just I know what the winner was

4041
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
New theme everything's broken

4042
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Hey a buggy game wins

4043
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I do know which one was on top

4044
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,000
But I was hoping to name the other two as well

4045
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Bobby says I broke it

4046
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Re-check answerable I think

4047
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Alright we're going to make this answerable again

4048
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Hold on

4049
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Let's see what happens

4050
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
This is going to be so funny you guys

4051
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
There it is fine

4052
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
It's going to be so funny

4053
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Number three answer

4054
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
The number three theme

4055
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Just missed it, missed it by that much

4056
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
MS Paint or Corel Draw

4057
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Very close

4058
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Number two answer

4059
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Bobby and the Ban Hammer

4060
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Missed it by that much

4061
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
And the number one

4062
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
The winner this

4063
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Year or maybe we'll do this every six months

4064
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Who knows

4065
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
This first

4066
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
VOG game jam's theme will be

4067
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
And how appropriate

4068
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
A buggy game

4069
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Is the winner

4070
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
A buggy game is going to be the theme

4071
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
There it is

4072
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
A buggy game

4073
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
The theme for the first ever

4074
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
VOG game jam

4075
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
How appropriate when I broke

4076
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
The whole fucking website trying to see the answer

4077
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
So there it is

4078
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Alright

4079
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Thank you everybody for voting and participating

4080
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Wait to see what you guys

4081
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Come up with and again

4082
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Just especially after the rant

4083
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I went on earlier this evening

4084
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
And everything else that's been going on in the gaming industry

4085
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I think this is a perfect fit, I really do

4086
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
A buggy game

4087
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Yeah, new earth defense force game

4088
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Oh is that, that's what you

4089
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Really wanted

4090
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
That was your way of getting copyright in there without it

4091
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Alright

4092
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Nice

4093
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
You can't copyright killing chain insects

4094
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Alright

4095
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
I would never do that, maybe

4096
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Alright, anyhow

4097
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Let's see, and some folks talking

4098
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
About what they were going to do for Bobby and the

4099
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Banhammer, Act F says

4100
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
A card game similar to Cards Against Humanity

4101
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
But trying to get a card

4102
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Or comment to get you banned

4103
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Oh man, we should

4104
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
I should have let people submit for the top

4105
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Three, that would have been awesome to see, but we'll see

4106
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Alright, a buggy game

4107
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
There it is

4108
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Chat says, all the bugs

4109
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
And Hitstun says, I hope you guys like

4110
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Exploitable game mechanics

4111
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Yeah, that's going to be hard programming that in

4112
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
But, we'll see

4113
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
I don't know, when I hear

4114
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
A buggy game, I think of

4115
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Like, actual bugs

4116
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Like, why can't a buggy game be like

4117
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
Why can't it be Frog Fractions?

4118
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Is this Frog Fractions 2?

4119
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
This was all a ruse for Frog Fractions 2

4120
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Oops

4121
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Alright, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

4122
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
So there we go

4123
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
VXJ6V says, number 2 can be done in the spring

4124
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
Well, you know what? It depends on

4125
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
How the participation level is

4126
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
This time, so again, when you're finished

4127
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
With your theme of

4128
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
A buggy game

4129
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
You're going to submit that to Jam

4130
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
At OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4131
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
The deadline is January 11th

4132
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Not that I'm going to stop you from

4133
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Submitting after that date

4134
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
And I don't think Bobby would be opposed to

4135
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Putting things on the site that come in after the date

4136
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
However, if you want to earn one of the participation

4137
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Prizes, if you want to earn one of the loot

4138
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
And you want to earn that official recognition

4139
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
You've got to be done by January

4140
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
11th. Get to work

4141
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
A buggy game

4142
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Alright, once again, the Skype line is open

4143
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype

4144
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

4145
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Last minute stories, Loki?

4146
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Oh, I haven't even been looking

4147
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
You're too excited about the buggy game

4148
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I've seen some good examples

4149
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Of some really funny buggy ideas

4150
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Like another game jam didn't do this

4151
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Did they?

4152
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I don't think so, but no

4153
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
I still like to think, even if another game jam

4154
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Did it, we would still be the first

4155
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
That says, you can create

4156
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Anything, you're not limited to

4157
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Unity, you can do anything

4158
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
You want. Yeah, usually game jams

4159
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Will be like, you program it

4160
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
You can use Unity, you can use whatever

4161
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
But it has to be a program

4162
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
You can't just make a card game

4163
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Or a board game, or whatever

4164
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
No, I've seen some good examples

4165
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Of just, usually in the

4166
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Unity subreddit

4167
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Where they'll be showing

4168
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
There's this one guy who actually does

4169
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
A lot of development on there

4170
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
He posts updates and stuff

4171
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Of things he's working on

4172
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
And the last couple of ones that he put up there

4173
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
Is some bugs that he had in the game

4174
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
That he coded something slightly wrong

4175
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
And it was a hilarious result

4176
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Kind of gives me ideas

4177
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Alright, well our phone lines

4178
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Are not really lighting up

4179
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
So, here's me stretching

4180
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Trying to fill time

4181
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Let me go to the Twitter

4182
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I'm trying to eat this pie, you guys are making me

4183
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Fill time, I'm not able to eat this pie

4184
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
This upsets me

4185
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Anyway, I'm going to go to Twitter

4186
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Yeah, tweet the thing

4187
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Let's see, Eric RPG

4188
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Sent a tweet with a link

4189
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Let me pull up this link and see what this is all about

4190
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Again, if you want to call us on Skype

4191
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

4192
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Or our telephone number

4193
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

4194
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Let's see

4195
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
We got sent a story by Eric RPG

4196
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
To a story on

4197
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Siliconera, which says

4198
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Queen Victoria blasts through Martian mines

4199
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
In Rock Boshers DX

4200
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
On PS4 and PS Vita

4201
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
So this is a game

4202
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
That has, I guess, cross-buy

4203
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
And cross-save support

4204
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
A 10-stick puzzle shooter set on Mars

4205
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Starring Queen Victoria

4206
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
That is pretty fucking random

4207
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
But I like that, I like games that are really random

4208
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
It stylizes

4209
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
If you were playing it on a ZX Spectrum

4210
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I like stylistic games

4211
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
That's really cool

4212
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Alright, now our phones are lighting up, it was just a little delayed

4213
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Let's get to it

4214
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4215
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Hey guys, it's Jason

4216
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Hey Jason, wow, are you at the office?

4217
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I was going to say, that's a huge background back there

4218
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Oh my gosh, I didn't realize you were back in San Francisco

4219
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
When are you coming to visit?

4220
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
That's a good question

4221
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I've actually been super busy

4222
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
Obviously, I haven't been talking about it with you at all

4223
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I understand, I understand

4224
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

4225
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
There was a topic that you guys were talking about earlier

4226
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
And Go figured that as soon as I

4227
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Clicked, I hit

4228
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
A hit call, the particular topic

4229
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Completely slipped my mind

4230
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
The actual game

4231
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Oh, Tetris

4232
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Tetris, Tetris on the PS4

4233
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Like, I've been in these

4234
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Kind of conversations before, and I always

4235
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Am completely motivated to chime in

4236
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Because, like, I just

4237
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I'm not a

4238
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Full time developer, I never have been

4239
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
And so, it's like, I don't

4240
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Always have the way of really explaining these things

4241
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
But, being

4242
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Who I am, being the person

4243
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Knowing what I know

4244
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
And being in these kinds of situations, like, I have to

4245
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Defend developers

4246
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Because

4247
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Delaying the game to get it right

4248
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Like, development

4249
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Ah

4250
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
You never know what you need

4251
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Until you don't have it

4252
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
You never know what you need until you've lost it

4253
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
There's an old thing in IT

4254
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Where if everything works great, you don't even know

4255
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
You have assisted men, it's when things go wrong

4256
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
But you're, you know, breathing down their neck

4257
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Because things have to get taken care of

4258
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
All of those kinds of things

4259
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Extend to development as well

4260
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Like, what was

4261
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
This is maybe a bad example for Tetris

4262
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
But what would have happened

4263
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
What happens when any game is delayed

4264
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
People don't defend developers

4265
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
They jump down the throats of

4266
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Especially in the case of Tetris

4267
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
This game isn't difficult

4268
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
No

4269
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
The design and theory and everything behind Tetris isn't difficult

4270
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
But that doesn't mean that

4271
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Implementations

4272
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
First game of its kind on its generation

4273
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
New tools

4274
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
New libraries, new engines

4275
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Yes, Tetris is a simple shaped game

4276
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
But there is so much more detail

4277
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
That goes into it

4278
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Which is literally what the act of development is

4279
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
And it just

4280
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I just don't like deriding developers

4281
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I know I've done it myself

4282
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
I just don't like deriding developers

4283
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Period

4284
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I understand that to a point, Jason

4285
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
And I think sometimes when we have issues with games

4286
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
A lot of times it's not even necessarily

4287
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
The people working on the front lines

4288
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Who are the quote unquote problem

4289
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
And I think in a case where

4290
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
A game gets released buggy

4291
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Specifically like Assassin's Creed

4292
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
And that whole debacle

4293
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I really think that is just pressure

4294
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Where the developers needed more time

4295
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
To make it happen

4296
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
And they were denied from up above

4297
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Absolutely

4298
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
That is a really significantly good example

4299
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Because that was just

4300
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Blatant and absurd

4301
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
The issue is, Jason

4302
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
It's the same company

4303
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
And now it's Tetris

4304
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
And so that's showing me a pattern

4305
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
And that's kind of worrisome

4306
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
And I do understand that when games get delayed

4307
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Everybody gets really pissed off

4308
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
But at the same time, you know, in Miyamoto

4309
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Or somebody had said this a long time ago

4310
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
If a game gets delayed, if it's good

4311
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
People will never remember that it was delayed

4312
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
And I think to some extent

4313
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
That really is true

4314
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
And I know at least we here at OLR

4315
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
At least I like to think so

4316
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Whatever the delay is

4317
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
But after seeing so much crap like this happen

4318
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Like when The Witcher 3 got delayed a few weeks ago

4319
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
It was what, like the second delay

4320
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
You know what, I don't want Witcher 3 coming out

4321
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
And being broken

4322
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
If they have to delay it two more months to get it right

4323
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Then cool, do it

4324
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
I was gonna say exactly the same thing

4325
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
That Bonds did

4326
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Half-Life 2 was delayed significantly

4327
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
At least two or three times

4328
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
And along the way there was also the legendary

4329
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
E3 hack that leaked significant

4330
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Half-Life 2 content to everybody

4331
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
And you can guarantee this is why

4332
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
They don't even announce Half-Life 3

4333
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
They'll announce it when it

4334
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
No, seriously, they're gonna announce it when it's done

4335
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
And ready to go

4336
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
That's why when we joke around that Gabe needs to come out

4337
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
At E3 and go

4338
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Half-Life 3 is on Steam right now and drop the mic

4339
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
That's no joke

4340
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
That's how it's gonna fucking go down

4341
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Absolutely

4342
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Yeah, I just, it's kind of

4343
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
The way that it was being presented

4344
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
The way that people have learned

4345
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
To talk about these kinds of incidents

4346
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
That just, they're just great on me

4347
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Because, you know, blame

4348
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Blame the developers, blame the testers

4349
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
They're the go-to

4350
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Because they are the face of the game

4351
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Shy of like the CEO of the company

4352
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Or something like that

4353
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
But nowhere in that discussion at the start of the show

4354
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Did anything like businessy

4355
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Get discussed

4356
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
It was the fault of the developers

4357
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Period when it was being discussed

4358
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
And that's the kind of stuff

4359
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
That's the part of it that really disappoints me

4360
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Is that that is the go-to

4361
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Vocabulary for everybody to talk about

4362
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
When there's a good chance that

4363
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
A ton of developers or testers

4364
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Had brought up saying

4365
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
These things are problems

4366
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
But for business, political

4367
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Possibly technical people

4368
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Downplaying things

4369
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Oh, three frames gone isn't bad?

4370
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Well, that person has never heard of speed running before

4371
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
And knows the technical obsession

4372
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
With the level that people go to

4373
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
If I gave the impression that I was solely placing

4374
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Blame on the developers for the Tetris debacle

4375
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Then I apologize

4376
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
But I think what I kind of meant to say

4377
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Is that the development on this game clearly wasn't finished

4378
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Whose fault is that?

4379
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Probably management's

4380
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
And more so that I

4381
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
It's not even really the developers that I blame

4382
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
It's a lack

4383
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Of QA

4384
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
And I think that's an okay thing to say

4385
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
There's a complete lack of QA

4386
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Or this would have been caught

4387
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
It's not something that happens on level 5

4388
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
On Tuesdays

4389
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
When you're maybe connected on a shoddy Comcast connection

4390
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
When this happens

4391
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
No, it happens to everybody

4392
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
If you just play a normal game

4393
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
And that's where I'm like

4394
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
The funny thing is I can actually kind of see

4395
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I can envision that some of those same arguments

4396
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
Happen business-wise

4397
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
It's Tetris, we know this franchise

4398
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
We've done it before

4399
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Why are these problems problems?

4400
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Because the tools don't remain

4401
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
The same between generations

4402
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
And even years

4403
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Two games of an iteration

4404
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
In the same generation things can change entirely

4405
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
I actually don't get so bothered by the whole

4406
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
But it's Tetris, it should be easy to do

4407
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Type of argument

4408
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
It's Tetris, but it's Tetris on the PS4

4409
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
And there's certain expectations

4410
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Of what PS4 games should have in them

4411
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Especially with this whole

4412
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Social era we live in

4413
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
And game sharing and all this stuff

4414
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
There's

4415
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Hiccups are killing me

4416
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
There's certain expectations

4417
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Where I don't think it's as simple as

4418
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
You just put the Game Boy version of Tetris on the PS4

4419
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I think there is a certain

4420
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Greater expectation than that

4421
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
I'm actually not going to be

4422
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
One of those people that says, oh it's just Tetris

4423
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
But I am going to say, oh it's just a

4424
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
QA department

4425
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Well that's halfway there

4426
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
So I guess I can give you at least that much

4427
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Alright, fair enough. Hey, you thinking about

4428
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
participating in the game jam?

4429
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I

4430
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Because it doesn't have to just be

4431
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Like a classically programmed game

4432
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
That opens the door for me, like I said

4433
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
I've never been a full time programmer

4434
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
There were a couple of concepts that did kind of cross my eye

4435
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And my number one vote

4436
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Matched the winner, so

4437
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
There are definitely ideas

4438
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
But with traveling back home

4439
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
And all that kind of stuff, we'll see

4440
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I certainly would like to, but we'll see

4441
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
I understand, well you know the golden rule is

4442
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Even if it's not the totally fleshed out game you wanted to build in Unity

4443
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Create something, dammit

4444
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Alright, Jason, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in some more calls

4445
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
But take care buddy, we miss you

4446
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
You too, thank you

4447
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:40,000
By the way you guys, Jason has an epic fucking beard growing on his face now

4448
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
I saw that beard when it was a little bit

4449
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
But getting to see that on Skype via the video, that is epic

4450
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
That is an epic beard he's got there

4451
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Alright

4452
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype

4453
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4454
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I'm going to leave it open for a couple minutes to see if something can get through here

4455
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
I did see at least one other caller trying to get through

4456
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
So I want to give them another chance to try to get through

4457
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And we will see what happens

4458
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Oh, I do see another call coming through

4459
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Let's get to it

4460
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4461
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Let's do Zaku there

4462
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Zaku, you are really loud, get a little ways away from the mic

4463
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
And tell us what's on your mind

4464
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Oh, nothing much, just celebrating

4465
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
The end of my birthday

4466
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
And the start of the 30s for me

4467
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Well, happy freaking birthday

4468
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
My god, you're 30 years old

4469
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Yep, 30, the big 3-0

4470
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
How old were you when you first started listening to this show?

4471
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Oh, I'd say about 19

4472
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Oh my god

4473
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
I can't, I can't, I quit

4474
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
We're done

4475
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
The last OLR everybody

4476
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Have fun with that game jam

4477
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
We won't be here when it's done

4478
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

4479
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Happy birthday, Zaku

4480
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Yep

4481
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
You know what, 30s aren't as bad as everybody says it is

4482
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
30s is actually kind of awesome

4483
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Everything's better

4484
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
And less stupid

4485
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
Everything's better

4486
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
It's like Logan's run where after a certain age

4487
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
The light in the palm of your hand

4488
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Blinks and you have to take that ride

4489
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Into that other magical place

4490
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Obviously

4491
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Where they kill you off at that certain point

4492
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
But I digress

4493
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
I guess the point is

4494
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
To the young folks

4495
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I'm pretty much a dinosaur

4496
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
You know, senior citizen at that point

4497
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Oh, whatever, you know what, the thing they don't realize

4498
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Is that sex is better in your 30s

4499
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
TMI, I don't care

4500
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Speak for yourself

4501
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Oh wow

4502
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
TMI, I don't care

4503
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I don't care

4504
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Alright, well I don't think you called in

4505
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Just to talk about your birthday

4506
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
What else is on your mind, my friend?

4507
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Just catching up on the gaming

4508
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
That I'm trying to do right now

4509
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Apparently

4510
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Recently

4511
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Dovetail, the folks who

4512
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
You know, the folks who brought us Train Simulator

4513
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
They recently released

4514
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Microsoft Flight Simulator on Steam

4515
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
And apparently

4516
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
As much as I, you know

4517
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
The fact that I managed to jump on it a few months before

4518
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
That thing was announced

4519
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
It's like, whether or not

4520
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
There's any life left

4521
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
In that whole flight sim market

4522
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
And I mean, after the

4523
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
You know, the past few months

4524
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
After getting hooked on it

4525
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
And spending dozens of dollars on

4526
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Third party add-ons for it

4527
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Mainly like commercial airliners

4528
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I mean, is it

4529
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Is, you know, the point is

4530
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Whether or not there's still room

4531
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
For something like that

4532
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Given the fact that it's almost like

4533
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Ten years removed from where

4534
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
From the height of the game

4535
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Um, I think

4536
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Especially with flight sims

4537
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
There's gonna kind of always be an audience

4538
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
For that, you know, and they did

4539
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
They just released that game on Steam

4540
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Like, just came out, but you know

4541
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
If you look at Steam and the simulator

4542
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Like, okay, let me tell you

4543
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Let me tell you a little story

4544
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
There's another simulator game that I see all the time

4545
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
On Steam, and I'm always sitting there going

4546
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
People actually play this game

4547
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
And it's Farming Simulator

4548
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Is the name of the game, okay, Farming Simulator

4549
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Okay, right, and it's up there all the time

4550
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
Okay, so when I'm at E3

4551
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
And we're doing the whole thing where it's like

4552
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
We're gonna live, you know, cover E3

4553
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Ask us questions on Twitter, da da da da da

4554
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
I get a question from, like, Germany

4555
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Out of the blue, from some person

4556
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Because I posted a random picture

4557
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Of me in front of something funny

4558
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
At the Farming Simulator booth, and the guy was like

4559
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
You have to tell me everything about Farming Simulator

4560
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
What's the game like, is it playable?

4561
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
What's in the game? You gotta tell me everything about Farming Simulator

4562
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
You'd be surprised, there's a lot of people that are interested in that game

4563
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Fuck, Farming Simulator, really?

4564
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
It's on, like, console, Maximum Games

4565
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Is the one that's been distributing that

4566
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
And I seriously talked to the guy that's the head of the company

4567
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
When I was working at my old job

4568
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
And he would tell me stories about

4569
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
How well that game's selling

4570
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
It's, like, their best-selling game

4571
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
So there are people that eat that up

4572
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
And look at all those other simulators that they have on Steam

4573
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
There's, like, a ton of them

4574
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
But, yeah, I mean, they have

4575
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
DCS World, which has, like, the

4576
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Fighter jet simulator

4577
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Which is essentially, like, a chore

4578
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Not to belittle

4579
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
The fact that certain flight sim

4580
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Add-ons, like, you try starting

4581
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Up a triple seven from

4582
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Dark, from cold to dark

4583
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
All the way up to the point where it's taxing

4584
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I think it's, like, I need

4585
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Clip notes for that

4586
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Zaku, I think there still absolutely is an audience for Flight Simulator

4587
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
I mean, you express interest in it

4588
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
And you're just 30 years old

4589
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
You're still young, there's still room for

4590
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Tons of Flight Simulator games

4591
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Even though maybe the audience is a little different

4592
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Is what it is

4593
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Because I remember a day when I was younger

4594
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
When I was 19 years old or what have you

4595
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I remember when Flight Simulator games

4596
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Were oftentimes kind of the benchmark

4597
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
For new hardware

4598
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Like, when new things would come out on PCs

4599
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
It always seemed to be, like, a Flight Simulator game

4600
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Was one of the first things to come out

4601
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
To really show off the graphics

4602
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
And the capabilities of the systems

4603
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
And I think that's changed Zaku

4604
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I think Flight Simulator games

4605
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Have turned more into people that are

4606
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Enthused about

4607
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Amateur flight or what have you

4608
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Or as the enthusiasts of the genre

4609
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Right, and the thing is

4610
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
You're talking about

4611
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
FSX, which is almost a decade old

4612
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
That still runs on DirectX 9

4613
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Meanwhile, you have

4614
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
X-Plane, the latest version

4615
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
X-Plane 10, which

4616
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
Apparently, it's a little slightly better

4617
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
In terms of graphics, but

4618
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
The only thing that's close to

4619
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
You know, to actually matching

4620
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
You know, a modern

4621
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
The only thing close to a modern day

4622
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Flight Simulator right now is PrepR3D

4623
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
And that's a professional

4624
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Version of FSX that

4625
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Lockheed Martin puts out for real pilots

4626
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
But I guess

4627
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
With Dovetail now at the helm

4628
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Whatever future Flight Simulator

4629
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
Game they're going to make is obviously

4630
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Not going to be called Flight Simulator

4631
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
But it's going to be, in essence, a spiritual

4632
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Successor of that franchise

4633
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
And hopefully it will bring the graphics into

4634
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
This decade of

4635
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
You know, modern computing where you could

4636
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Just take advantage

4637
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Completely advantage of a modern PC

4638
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Instead of just doing everything in a single

4639
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Core, you take

4640
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
You exploit multi-core

4641
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
And high-end video processing

4642
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
To essentially

4643
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
And more importantly, 64-bit

4644
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
So that you can actually

4645
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
You know, you can run a game like FSX

4646
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Which is very intensive for

4647
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
A ten-year-old game which is not optimized

4648
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
And you could essentially run it

4649
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Like, you know, you could take advantage of new hardware

4650
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
That's available today

4651
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Right

4652
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Yeah, and hopefully

4653
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
As I said, it was on sale

4654
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
For five bucks a couple of days ago

4655
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
When it first came out

4656
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
I'm kind of skeptical on getting

4657
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Re-buying it again on Steam because apparently

4658
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
You can't activate your existing keys on it

4659
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
You have to buy the game again

4660
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Nice

4661
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
I'm not too sure, other than the fact

4662
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
That you can now play online

4663
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Multiplayer again

4664
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
It's a wait-and-see approach in terms of

4665
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
How it will actually

4666
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Perform with the existing

4667
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Third-party add-ons that I have on it

4668
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Well, you know, I do

4669
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
I do want to see the game in motion

4670
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I hope some people are livestreaming it

4671
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Because I do want to see, I haven't really looked at a

4672
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Flight simulator game in a while and I bet

4673
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
I bet they're still very

4674
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Pretty to look at and so forth

4675
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
Yeah, if you tweak the

4676
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
I mean, with FSX right now

4677
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
You could definitely tweak a lot of the files

4678
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
There are many ways to make it look good on

4679
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
On modern PCs for

4680
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
For almost a ten-year-old game

4681
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Even like DirectX 10, which wasn't

4682
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Officially supported, it was a preview

4683
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Back then, there are plugins that allow you to fix

4684
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
The DirectX 10 issues

4685
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
That were rampant in FSX

4686
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
And essentially looks a lot better than

4687
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Than running it on, you know,

4688
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
DX9

4689
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
I guess there has been folks

4690
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Streaming on Twitch for

4691
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
FSX, but until I get a new

4692
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Video card that allows me to stream through

4693
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Nvidia, I'm probably gonna

4694
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Yeah, it'll be a while before I

4695
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Do any livestreaming of that

4696
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Fair enough, alright my friend, I gotta let you go

4697
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
But thank you for the FYI, Flight Simulators

4698
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
They're out there, check them out

4699
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Alright, take care my friend

4700
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Have a good one, you too, bye

4701
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
And congrats on hitting 30

4702
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Even though you've been listening to this show since you were 19

4703
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Which means I'm

4704
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Also that old

4705
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Alright, Rob

4706
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
What? Deal with it

4707
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
No, actually, you know, and like

4708
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
I told Zaku, actually my 30s have been

4709
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Pretty fucking awesome, and considering the fact

4710
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
That I had, uh

4711
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
You know, I was really, really sick when I was 29

4712
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
It actually made me very thankful to turn 30

4713
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
So, you know, alright

4714
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
1877 game OLR, username on

4715
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, now the phones are

4716
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
Lighting up, they were slow earlier, but now it's

4717
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
They just fill right up

4718
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4719
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Uh, this is YYR

4720
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Hi Aaron, how are you?

4721
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Hey YYR, how you doing?

4722
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Well, I'm

4723
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Trying to formulate an idea

4724
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
For this new game jam

4725
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Thing that we've all laid out

4726
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Tonight

4727
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
So far the best idea I have

4728
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Going off Jason's

4729
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Phone call a little bit ago

4730
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Was, uh, come up with

4731
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
A plan to develop

4732
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
A game in five weeks

4733
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Yeah

4734
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
And don't test it

4735
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
And then release it

4736
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I mean, it works for Ubisoft, right?

4737
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
That's right, so the game

4738
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
It's gonna be meta, it's gonna be a game about

4739
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Making a game

4740
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
Uh, oh, well

4741
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Well now we have another thing entirely

4742
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
No, he's saying basically

4743
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
To develop a game, don't test it

4744
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Okay, I thought that was his idea

4745
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Okay, in the game you're gonna make a game

4746
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Okay, nevermind, I was going too meta with it

4747
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Okay, I get it

4748
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Wow, you're really thinking about this

4749
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
I am, I am, well you know what, there's a part of me

4750
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Not that I want to give away everything I'm doing

4751
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
But I'm actually thinking of going with the very literal

4752
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Interpretation of the word and doing a game about

4753
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Bugs

4754
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
Not giving Loki

4755
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Not giving Loki his Earth Defense Force game

4756
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
But I don't see why you can't do a game about bugs

4757
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Well, I mean, I'll admit

4758
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
You know, as soon as the theme was chosen

4759
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I turned to my fiance

4760
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Sitting on the couch next to me and I said

4761
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Alright, let's do something with spiders

4762
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
But, uh, I don't know if I'm

4763
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Actually gonna go with spiders

4764
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I just, I would

4765
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Love to do something that was both figurative

4766
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
And literal

4767
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
I also don't want to go beyond my

4768
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Means, you know, one

4769
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Person, three weeks

4770
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
And a keyboard

4771
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
I mean, basically though

4772
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Three weeks does sound like a lot

4773
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
I'll warn anybody, I mean

4774
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
First of all, I want to super encourage

4775
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Everyone, as many people as

4776
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
Possible to get in on this

4777
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
But I also want to warn people that

4778
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Game development really is

4779
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
A time sink, it will take

4780
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Longer than you would expect to do

4781
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Well, pretty much anything

4782
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
So don't wait for

4783
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Two and a half weeks and then say

4784
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Alright, yeah, let's throw something to get now

4785
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
The way I figure it's always three times longer

4786
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
So just plan something for a week

4787
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
And it'll take you three weeks

4788
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Also, one big reason

4789
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
We're starting it now is that we know a lot of people

4790
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Have time off for the holidays

4791
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Now granted, a lot of you spend time with family

4792
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
But there's also a lot of you that have a lot of free time right now

4793
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
So we really want to start it before the holidays

4794
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
And then run it really all the way through

4795
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
The holiday period, so

4796
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
Yeah, this is probably the best time of year to do it

4797
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
I think, I mean, any time's a great time

4798
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
To develop a game, but this is probably

4799
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
As good as we could do as far as

4800
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Time for everyone

4801
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Absolutely, as many of you guys

4802
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Listening as possible, whether you're

4803
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
Listening live on the podcast, anything

4804
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
Go ahead and make something, because

4805
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
You're going to enjoy it

4806
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
I think you will

4807
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
And some folks in chat saying

4808
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
Let's see, they're talking about the meaning of the word bugs

4809
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
And Darth Tetsuya says, so you can do a game about

4810
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Bugs, that I think I can work with

4811
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
However you interpret the rules

4812
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
You can do anything you want

4813
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Around that theme of buggy game

4814
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
How do you interpret that?

4815
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Because, I don't know, maybe you want to do a game about

4816
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Amish people and have it be about a horse and buggy

4817
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
You could do it!

4818
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
You know, SSJ100 Matt did bring

4819
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
That up earlier in chat

4820
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
Amish Racer 2000

4821
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Why not? Come on

4822
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
You could do a game with horses and buggies

4823
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
Look, I just gave somebody a concept right there

4824
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Alright, now I've got to think of something new

4825
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
Perfect

4826
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Alright, well YYRA, I'm so excited

4827
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I think we're done here

4828
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
I'm so excited to see what you come up with

4829
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Alright

4830
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
I'm sorry, you've broken up a little bit, what happened?

4831
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I just wanted to say I am so excited to see what you come up with

4832
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Oh, yeah, well I'm excited too

4833
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
Because I'll tell you, at this point my slate is blank

4834
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
I really have no idea

4835
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
I'm with you

4836
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
You have just as much of an idea as I do

4837
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Alright

4838
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Well, I've got to think too

4839
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
I will come up with something

4840
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Me too, I think I know how I'm going to do it

4841
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
I just need to know what story I'm going to tell, so we'll see

4842
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Alright

4843
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
I've got some serious thought into this over the next day or two

4844
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Alright, good luck my friend, take care

4845
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
I'm very excited, and I'm looking forward to

4846
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
what everyone else puts out as well

4847
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
So, yeah, pick up your keyboards

4848
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
or game controllers or whatever you're using

4849
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
and get cracking, this is going to be great

4850
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Do it, create something dammit

4851
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Yup

4852
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Alright, take care my friend

4853
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Enjoy your weekend, your holidays

4854
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
and everything else

4855
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
You too

4856
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Take care, bye

4857
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
I know I'm going to enjoy the rest of those latkes

4858
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
that are sitting over there waiting for me to eat

4859
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
I'm so excited

4860
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Alright, oh man, you filled me so, like even Alan

4861
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
messaged me earlier, do I even need to make dinner tonight

4862
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
or have you pretty much filled up on crap

4863
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
and I'm like, I filled up on crap

4864
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
but it was really good crap

4865
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
I'm taking some of the cookies with me

4866
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
unless Becky has some when I get to our house

4867
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Alright, well

4868
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
I do want to thank everybody

4869
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
who called in tonight, if you did not call in

4870
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000

in the first VOG game jam

4879
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
your forum is apparently already up Loki

4880
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
so for people to discuss

4881
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Yeah, I posted even there's some

4882
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
tools that I found on one of these

4883
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
game jam tip sites, so I

4884
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
just copied and pasted that

4885
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Awesome, awesome, I'm really gonna

4886
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
try to spend time to do this

4887
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
I'm the type that will procrastinate

4888
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Come up with an idea quick

4889
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
because that could take a while

4890
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
It could, it could, alright well

4891
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
that is about gonna do it, Loki checking in

4892
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000

4893
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Alright, well then

4894
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
that brings us to the end of the show

4895
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Thank you guys so much for listening

4896
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
Thank you for supporting independent radio

4897
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
All we ask

4898
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
you know, tell a friend or two about the show

4899
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
you know, we don't have this big budget

4900
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
we're not IGN

4901
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
we can't put a big video out there that everybody sees

4902
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
of our buggy Tetris experience, we can only

4903
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
tell you about it, so please

4904
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
tell a friend or five about the show and help spread the word

4905
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
about independent broadcasting, and most of all

4906
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000

4909
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
content, I was gonna mention this real quick

4910
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000

02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000

No, sorry

4913
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
It's kinda cool, there's a British company

4914
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
apparently Liberty Games that made

4915
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
a pinball table that's an

4916
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
internet meme pinball table

4917
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
it has a bunch of internet memes in there

4918
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000

I wanna play that, that sounds awesome

4923
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Ah, that could've been the theme, internet memes

4924
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Ah, yeah, that would've been

4925
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Oh well, next time, the sequel

I gotta get working on my game, I guess

4944

Alright, get cracking, get cracking
