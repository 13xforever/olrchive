7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week Sony brought us the re-release of Final Fantasy 7 in glorious HD quality, upscaled, and ported. Uh, thanks?
20000	27000	But that's not all, we'll have more from the award show, plenty more news, your comments and calls right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this December the 7th of 2014 with the 578th episode of our show.
46000	57000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food. With my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura.
57000	59000	I haven't had any food today.
59000	61000	Oh my gosh, how are you going to go for three hours without food?
61000	63000	We're going to get food before we leave.
63000	65000	No. Dan, go get me food.
65000	73000	This is not going to be pretty. Uh oh, wait a minute. If you're talking to Dan, that must mean Dan the man is here in the house today joining us.
73000	75000	I gotta go get food.
76000	80000	Dan will be leaving, actually. So Dan, any final thoughts for us?
83000	84000	No.
84000	85000	How are you doing, Dan?
85000	86000	Good.
86000	87000	Good, yeah? Awesome.
87000	88000	I can hear a feedback click every time I turn the mic on.
88000	95000	Yeah, you don't have to turn the mic on and off. Don't worry about it. I do it over here. If I have to mute you, I just push a little button over here and it shuts Dan down.
95000	96000	You can't silence me!
96000	97000	Which will be all the time.
97000	100000	Oh, you're so loud the internets can hear me. On Jamie's mic.
100000	104000	Alright. Also, I have to introduce, of course, every week here with us, Techmaster Loki.
104000	105000	Hello.
105000	106000	How you doing, Loki?
106000	107000	I'm okay.
107000	108000	Yeah?
108000	109000	Yeah.
109000	110000	Good morning.
110000	111000	Afternoon.
111000	116000	So, yeah, if you guys aren't aware, we're taping at a special time today, or broadcasting, whatever you want to say.
116000	123000	We are live at noon on Sundays. We've been saying for the past couple weeks what we were going to do. We're live at noon today.
124000	134000	This will rebroadcast at the normal time at VOG Network, six o'clock. So if you're listening at six o'clock, wondering why the chat room seems emptier than usual, it's because, oops, you forgot we were going to do the earlier time today.
134000	141000	But we're rebroadcasting. And then, of course, our podcast listeners all get the same thing that they're used to, the show delivered on the podcast feed for you guys.
141000	147000	But we do still have the chat over at live.vognetwork.com and folks chatting away.
147000	155000	Some folks in chat talking about tea. Dungeon Buster saying, time for tea and crumpets. I guess because of the earlier hour. It's noon tea here.
155000	163000	Or, in Loki's case, noon sandwiches. Because the sandwich place you'd love to go to was actually open today. Oh, not tea, Red Bull. I see.
163000	165000	Of course, this is Loki we're talking about here.
165000	167000	Who's calling me on my phone?
167000	169000	Yeah, who'd be calling you? Don't they know you have a show?
169000	171000	No, they don't.
171000	175000	All right. That is a loud, loud ringer for sure. All right.
175000	184000	Anyway, the joys of doing live radio. Phones going off. People showing up. It's all good. You guys showing up in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
184000	186000	Yeah, I don't have the chat room yet.
186000	187000	You don't have the chat room yet.
187000	190000	Because I just got this a few days ago.
190000	192000	Yeah, you have a new toy that you brought to the studio with you.
192000	194000	I have a 13-inch MacBook Pro.
194000	195000	Yeah?
195000	197000	Because I go for the superior machinery.
197000	200000	Is that one with the pretty retina and all that stuff?
200000	201000	Yeah, it's retina.
201000	204000	Nice. I bet pornography looks beautiful on that thing.
204000	209000	Twat and 2000 DPI. I don't know.
209000	214000	Awesome. Well, how did you Christian it? What was the first thing you had to do on it?
214000	218000	The first thing I had to do was set up the internet.
218000	219000	Yeah.
219000	224000	Really, that was about it. Well, actually, I had to do a system update, which was fine.
224000	231000	I had to make sure that all the stuff that I normally see going on with Yosemite wasn't happening.
231000	232000	Right.
232000	236000	And I have a perfect computer. I have named her Edie.
236000	241000	Have you done any gaming on it? Oh, wait, gaming on a Mac.
241000	244000	Did you not see the post I made on my Facebook?
244000	247000	I'm just giving you crap. Calm down.
247000	249000	I have both fractal and transistor.
249000	250000	Oh, nice. Okay.
250000	251000	So, playing through those.
251000	253000	Yeah. And there's more and more stuff, to be fair.
253000	256000	There's more and more stuff, especially, I think, thanks to Steam in large part.
256000	258000	You know, kind of putting things out there on Linux and Mac.
258000	260000	There's more and more and more stuff showing up.
260000	265000	A lot of the stuff on the Steam store, by the way, is available through the app store.
265000	266000	Okay.
266000	267000	That's where I got transistor and fractal.
267000	268000	Nice.
268000	272000	Borderlands is on there. All the Borderlands games.
272000	273000	Bioshock.
273000	276000	If you beat something on Steam PC, or, sorry, not beat something.
276000	280000	If you bought something on Steam PC, don't you automatically get it on Steam Max?
280000	282000	Like, if you log into your library, you'd be able to download whatever?
282000	283000	I do, indeed.
283000	284000	Yeah, that's good.
284000	288000	I was going to say, but if you buy it on the Mac store, you don't get the trading cards.
288000	290000	They don't have trading cards on Macs?
290000	293000	No, no, not if I buy through the app store.
293000	296000	Oh, got it.
296000	300000	No, not on, you know, Mac on Steam has trading cards.
300000	303000	And you don't get achievements, Steam achievements, or whatever they call it over there.
303000	304000	It's achievements.
304000	306000	I get smug superiority.
306000	308000	And that's very important.
308000	312000	Speaking of smug superiority, let's talk about this for our kickoff topic.
312000	319000	This was a really crazy, busy week, considering that usually this time of year is very, very dead
319000	322000	because all the games have already been released.
322000	327000	A lot of game developers are not even really working during this period because their games are out.
327000	330000	And so, you know, this is the time of year where they actually get their time off
330000	335000	before they're putting in their 10- and 12-hour days again to ship whatever game is coming in 2015.
335000	337000	Usually things are awfully quiet.
337000	342000	But we've had an insanely busy week in news.
342000	345000	Like, it's almost been like a winter E3.
345000	351000	And that's in large part to the Game Awards happening this week and, of course, Sony's PlayStation Experience.
351000	354000	Which the PlayStation Experience seemed like it was more of like a...
354000	358000	They had actual presentations versus just like, oh, here's some Sony games.
358000	362000	Yeah, they're doing panels and things like that, too.
362000	368000	Like, they are really turning it into their own, like, I don't want to say their own Penny Arcade Expo,
368000	370000	but in a way, it's kind of what they're doing.
370000	373000	I mean, it's probably a little smaller right now, but it's the first year.
373000	375000	But we'll talk more about the PlayStation Experience a little later.
375000	377000	Obviously, there's these very two distinct events going on.
377000	382000	But I want to talk first about the Game Awards because it is the thing that happened first on Friday night.
382000	387000	I don't know how many of you guys actually watched or maybe watched on the back end or whatever.
387000	390000	I forgot that it was on that day, so I had to go back.
390000	394000	And all I did was kind of skim through YouTube and went and watched all the trailers
394000	398000	and then skimmed through it some more trailers and then caught up to live and that was it.
398000	403000	Well, you guys know if you listened to the show a few weeks ago, I was really skeptical about the Game Awards,
403000	405000	especially how fast they were trying to put the whole thing together.
405000	408000	I was like, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of time here.
408000	411000	But I actually did end up watching most of it.
411000	414000	I watched two... It was kind of long.
414000	417000	It was a three-hour show, and I watched the first two hours,
417000	421000	and then Alan needed me for something else, so I stopped.
421000	427000	And I missed the best part, so I had to go back and watch it on YouTube the last hour.
427000	433000	I kind of did what you guys skimmed through the last hour to watch all the Zelda Wii U gameplay, which was huge.
433000	439000	Yeah, I gotta say, Zelda on Wii U, which they showed at the Game Awards, that does look really hot.
439000	442000	It was very interesting the way they presented it, though,
442000	450000	because they filmed Miyamoto playing on a television, but they never showed a direct feed of the TV.
450000	453000	It was always showing what was on the TV.
453000	455000	And I'm not sure why they chose to do it that way.
455000	462000	Perhaps that was to prevent such a scrutiny eye to pick out the little things in the interface.
462000	465000	I don't know. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with that.
465000	469000	But yeah, they were showing it all off the little TV instead of a direct feed.
469000	473000	But still, however they decided to show it, it looked great.
473000	476000	Dan, did you get a chance to see this footage yet of the Zelda Wii U?
476000	477000	I have not.
477000	480000	Oh, you gotta check it out at some point. It looks gorgeous.
480000	484000	You can definitely see where maybe the Skyrim, because we've heard this before,
484000	487000	that they're being influenced by Skyrim a little bit,
487000	492000	and you can kind of see that even in the little bit that they showed with the gigantic world map,
492000	496000	being able to place a marker where you want to go, get on your horse,
496000	500000	and ride to the marker and kind of kill things along the way.
500000	503000	They're doing a lot of that in this new Zelda game, and it looks interesting.
503000	505000	It looks like it's going to be really rad. I'm excited.
505000	508000	I've been playing something very similar to that called Dragon Age.
508000	511000	Freeform questing in Zelda.
511000	513000	Maybe. They didn't say anything about...
513000	515000	For the first time since, like, what? Zelda 1?
515000	518000	Well, they didn't say anything specifically about how questing would work,
518000	521000	so we can only infer that. We don't know that for sure,
521000	525000	but I would think there would at least have to be side quests, you would think.
525000	527000	But I don't know. I mean, there's still a lot to be determined.
527000	530000	That wasn't really what they were talking about with the reveal.
530000	534000	But anyway, Nintendo really did kind of dominate the game awards.
534000	537000	I mean, there was some Sony and even Microsoft presence as well,
537000	541000	but Nintendo took a lot of the awards. Game of the Year, though, they didn't.
541000	544000	They did not get Bayonetta 2, which a lot of people expected.
544000	550000	Dragon Age 1 Game of the Year, which I get that, having played most of those nominees.
550000	552000	Game of the Last Couple Weeks.
553000	555000	Well, here's the thing. A lot of people are complaining, like,
555000	558000	how could you give Dragon Age Game of the Year when it's only been out two weeks?
558000	561000	But you guys are forgetting. These critics have been playing them.
561000	563000	All those people that were on the jury.
563000	565000	Whatever. The sponsor paid the most.
565000	568000	Well, I heard about that too.
568000	571000	I mean, really. Really. It's like, oh, it's been out for, like, 13 seconds.
571000	573000	It's Game of the Year.
573000	575000	Yeah, and I...
575000	577000	Well, admittedly, it is a pretty hot looking game.
577000	580000	I haven't played it, but I've watched it over Jamie's shoulder a lot,
580000	582000	and I've been like, damn.
582000	584000	And I saw a lot of people complaining on Twitter, and I was just kind of like,
584000	587000	Bayonetta 2 is a great game, don't get me wrong.
587000	590000	And if it had won, I couldn't have been upset.
590000	595000	But I feel like the people criticizing Dragon Age for winning haven't really played it.
595000	597000	So, whatevs.
597000	600000	But I mean, I can also see an argument that Bayonetta 2 is a better game. That's fine.
600000	604000	But I just don't think there would be such anger if you've actually played Dragon Age
604000	607000	and you kind of go, oh, this game is really, really, has a lot of depth to it
607000	609000	and extremely well done storytelling.
609000	614000	But the 16 people who are playing Bayonetta 2 realize how great it is.
614000	617000	I hope it's sold better than that. I really do.
617000	619000	They deserve it. They deserve a great success.
619000	624000	Platinum is awesome. I mean, they make great games, but...
624000	626000	And you can't feel...
626000	630000	Going single platform on Bayonetta was probably not the best call.
630000	635000	I have a hard time feeling bad for Nintendo when Nintendo did win Developer of the Year.
635000	638000	They got what? Sports Game of the Year for Mario Kart 8.
638000	640000	Because that's really a sports game.
640000	642000	Well, it's considered sports and racing.
642000	644000	It's the best sports slash racing game.
644000	648000	Okay, whatever. But anyway, they did pretty well for themselves.
648000	652000	They got best fighting game for Smash Brothers on Wii U as well, right?
652000	654000	So, I mean, they did pretty well.
654000	656000	But there weren't that many fighting games out this year.
656000	659000	And they were nominated twice for Smash Brothers.
659000	663000	They had two spots. Smash Brothers 3DS and Smash Brothers Wii U.
663000	665000	Come on.
665000	668000	I kind of think the awards themselves are sort of...
668000	671000	I don't want to say meaningless, but I think...
671000	674000	No, no, no. Meaningless is probably an accurate term.
674000	679000	I think the community and Twitter and so forth is making it to be a much bigger deal than it really is.
679000	685000	I mean, again, it's a group of 20 people who voted on what they believe the best game of the year is.
685000	693000	And there's such diversity in the gaming world that I would not want to listen to just what one person or even one group of 20 people feel is the best game.
693000	700000	It sounds kind of weird for me to ask this since I've had the exposure to your guys' program that I've had over the last 100,000 years.
700000	707000	But do you guys do a Game of the Year, like an Orange Lounge Awards, anything like that?
707000	714000	Because the truth is, the things that you guys called Game of the Year would be just as meaningful as whatever they called Game of the Year.
714000	716000	That is the point exactly.
716000	724000	I think the Game of the Year that any 20 people grouped together would call Game of the Year is just as meaningful as what these guys end up picking as Game of the Year.
724000	726000	That is exactly the point.
726000	732000	Usually, the last show of the year will kind of try to do like a, what was your top three sort of thing.
732000	739000	And it can kind of vary from year to year because also, we are not paid to do this full time.
739000	743000	Nor is most podcasters you're listening to their show unless it's tied into a major website.
743000	745000	We're not paid to do this anytime.
745000	752000	So most of the people that are talking about their Game of the Year haven't played everything that have come out in that year.
752000	757000	And I always kind of put that disclaimer out there as like, this is my personal Game of the Year from what I've played.
757000	763000	And there's also some years where I don't get around to the games of 2013 till 2014.
763000	766000	Well, and it used to be like, think of it this way, right?
766000	771000	So it used to be that there were, what, a dozen video game magazines that had some sort of relevance.
771000	775000	You know, you had your EGM's, your game pros, your video games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
775000	778000	And you had several editors and they would all do games of the year.
778000	788000	And you know, you could actually at that point have probably had a consensus of industry professionals who could probably put together a fairly meaningful Game of the Year.
788000	791000	You know, instead each magazine would just do their own.
791000	799000	So now, what was it, Spike TV, was that 10 years ago they started doing their Game of the Year awards or the Spike TV Video Awards?
799000	806000	But that's all just so super commercial that you know that it's just sponsorship money talking, baby.
806000	816000	And as much as I'm kind of saying some what could be construed as negative things about this awards ceremony, I actually thought it wasn't as bad as we all feared it was going to be.
816000	818000	It was fairly decent.
818000	825000	Sure, there were a lot of things that could have been done better, but for as rushed as that whole thing had to have been, I thought it was pretty decent.
825000	830000	And a lot of that, Dan, is because that commercialism, a lot of that was really sucked out of it.
830000	839000	You didn't really have the actors that were forced out there on stage and pretty men and pretty ladies who probably played Candy Crush Saga and that's it.
839000	845000	You had a lot of people up there on the stage that were actually like game developers and game players.
846000	855000	I think one moment that kind of put a bow on all that was when Trey Parker won the award for best voice acting or whatever they called it.
855000	859000	He won the award for best voice acting for all those voices he did in the South Park game, right?
859000	865000	So he got up there on the stage and he said, only at the video game awards could I beat Kevin Spacey for an acting award.
867000	872000	And he raised the trophy and walked off the stage. Kevin Spacey wasn't even there.
872000	876000	So I thought that was kind of one of the moments to sort of sum the whole thing up.
876000	878000	So I thought from that standpoint they did really well.
878000	889000	But I'm going to tell you my favorite, favorite thing, the thing I loved most of all, the thing that, oh my god, I would have watched three hours of nothing but this and they need to do it again next year.
889000	899000	Kudos to whoever got Ken and Roberta Williams to come out of hiding and take the stage at the video game awards to accept their award for gaming icon.
899000	901000	That was awesome.
901000	919000	And if you don't know who Ken and Roberta Williams are, you really need to go back and do some gaming history research because pretty much every amazing 80s and 90s point and click adventure game that came from Sierra On-Line Entertainment or even other companies was inspired by something that Ken and Roberta Williams did.
919000	922000	And they left the game industry in the late 90s.
922000	927000	I think Phantasmagoria was the last game that Roberta Williams was really intimately involved with.
927000	931000	She might have produced one of the later King's Quest games but Phantasmagoria was kind of the last one.
931000	933000	And things in the industry started to shift.
933000	943000	We had a phase where we were getting away from adventure games and so they kind of left the industry at that time because people weren't really playing those kinds of games anymore.
943000	948000	And they have really disappeared from the public eye and they rarely make public appearances.
948000	951000	I think they've been spotted once or twice in the past decade.
952000	964000	So to see them come out on stage and the audience really... I'm so happy that the audience was cheering and screaming and we love you and all that stuff and not like, who dis?
964000	974000	Thank you, video game audience, for knowing it's so important who Ken and Roberta Williams were and making them feel welcome because I kind of hope it might convince them to try something else.
974000	978000	I don't know but if they want to retire forever, they certainly deserve it.
978000	980000	They've done so much for the industry.
980000	982000	That was seriously my favorite part.
982000	991000	I know that seems like one little thing but that gave the whole thing so much more cred, in my opinion, to see that.
991000	993000	I was very, very, very happy with that.
993000	996000	Did they come to get bought and disassembled by EA or Activision?
997000	1002000	I believe it was Universal, then Vivendi, then Activision.
1003000	1005000	So it's kind of a chain of events.
1005000	1006000	A free level disassemble there.
1006000	1012000	Yeah, exactly. And I think it was the Universal acquisition that didn't... because it's kind of what King's Quest VIII turned into.
1013000	1019000	But looking at the footage from the new King's Quest game, that kind of surprised me because the new King's Quest does not appear to be a point-and-click adventure at all.
1019000	1029000	It appears to be something a little more like... I don't want to say like Dragon's Lair but it's definitely more like... I get that more like cartoony 3D adventure sort of gist from it.
1029000	1035000	It looks really good and to hear Roberta Williams go, I want to play this. I've seen it and I want to play it.
1035000	1040000	That alone makes me go, all right, I'm going to listen to you because you know what you're talking about.
1040000	1043000	She's like, and there's two L's in Williams on the check.
1044000	1045000	Yeah, right.
1046000	1051000	DungeonBuster says in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says,
1051000	1054000	Seeing Ken and Roberta Williams on stage is my favorite moment from the award show.
1054000	1058000	ActDev says, Activision probably considering the King's Quest reimagining.
1058000	1063000	Oh yeah, that was... I mean, getting them out there to unveil the trailer was certainly a huge part of it.
1063000	1072000	DungeonBuster says, They're so incredibly private after they left that all anyone has really seen from them is the occasional text blurb or short form interview.
1072000	1078000	Alan Alchemy says, Their presence gave so much more legitimacy to the show over anything Spike did.
1078000	1085000	I... without sounding like a fanboy, although I guess if I'm going to fanboy for anything, it's going to be Ken and Roberta Williams.
1085000	1089000	It's always a good idea to pander to the 40 year old audience.
1090000	1097000	Well, that's why I said thank God the audience did know who they were and was cheering and made them feel the love.
1097000	1104000	Because if you enjoy The Walking Dead, which was the game of the year a couple of years ago, right?
1104000	1108000	A lot of what you see in that game, you can thank Ken and Roberta Williams for. Let's be real.
1108000	1114000	Every... it's like every adventure game owes its origins to either Ultima or King's Quest.
1114000	1115000	Every single one of them.
1115000	1116000	Everyone.
1116000	1123000	So, you know, if people don't understand who they are, I mean, it's understandable because they've stepped out of the limelight. They don't make games.
1123000	1126000	The truth is game creators are fairly underappreciated.
1126000	1128000	And when they do become rock stars...
1128000	1129000	Especially in that age.
1129000	1137000	Right. When they do become the rock stars of game creation, then they normally get a little too full of themselves and they try to make a Daikatana and it kills them.
1137000	1138000	Yeah.
1138000	1139000	So, you know.
1139000	1147000	But yeah, I mean, speaking of King's Quest or Ultima, next year if they want to get Lord British on stage, just let him talk for three hours because Lord knows the man could do it.
1147000	1149000	I would be totally fine with that as well.
1149000	1153000	Yeah, because, you know, you just want to hear Garriott talk about how fucking great he is.
1153000	1155000	And that he's an astronaut.
1155000	1164000	I went to his panel at Dragon Con and listened to him talk about his fucking mansion for like an hour and it was worth every minute of my time.
1164000	1166000	It was worth every minute of my time.
1166000	1167000	Garriott is like...
1167000	1168000	The man's a fucking genius.
1168000	1170000	I'm the best motherfucker that's ever lived.
1170000	1172000	And yes you are. Yes you are.
1172000	1176000	Did you ever see the documentary that he did talking about his mansion?
1176000	1177000	Lord British.
1177000	1179000	Just like showing all the secret passages and stuff?
1179000	1180000	No, I did. I need to watch that.
1180000	1181000	You need to watch that. It's pretty awesome.
1181000	1182000	Yeah, I do. I do. No, he talked about it.
1182000	1184000	It's called Lord British. I'm so great.
1186000	1188000	Alright. So, anyway.
1188000	1190000	Although. Although.
1190000	1191000	Although.
1191000	1196000	He is responsible for that really shitty Facebook game that had to play.
1196000	1197000	I get over it.
1197000	1198000	Although.
1198000	1200000	I'm sorry. I'm not getting over it.
1200000	1202000	Listen. You're better than this.
1202000	1205000	You don't need to have a garage sale game on Facebook.
1205000	1208000	And Tabula Rasa. I understand. I understand.
1208000	1213000	But the man's allowed a few stinkers in his decades long great career.
1213000	1214000	Anyway.
1216000	1220000	He made a terrible RPG when he was a teenager when nobody else was making terrible RPGs.
1220000	1222000	Give him some slack.
1223000	1228000	As much as I'd love to just talk about people I love from 80s and 90s computer game development.
1228000	1230000	I do want to get back into some of the other stuff.
1230000	1233000	I just want to mention one other thing that I thought was really weird about the award show.
1233000	1236000	Okay. So, it was a video game award show, obviously.
1236000	1238000	Although, there was lots of trailers.
1238000	1243000	I mean, it was really three quarters trailers and new game presentation and like a quarter awards.
1243000	1246000	So, one thing that was really awkward is that, you know.
1246000	1250000	Jeff Keeley would be talking to somebody like Reggie Fils-Aime and he'd be like.
1250000	1252000	So, tell us about what Nintendo's doing. And then he'd be all.
1252000	1256000	And by the way, congratulations because you won developer of the year. Here's your trophy.
1256000	1262000	Like, it was very much like I purposely brought you over here to kill two birds with one stone.
1262000	1264000	And get you to pimp something and then hand you a statue.
1264000	1267000	Like, that happened a lot throughout the whole awards presentation.
1267000	1269000	That was kind of weird.
1269000	1274000	But at the same time, the freaking thing was three hours long and kind of needed to be cut back.
1274000	1276000	So, they needed to cut some corners.
1276000	1279000	So, I'm not sure where that happy balance is.
1279000	1281000	I actually think they might have done.
1281000	1283000	And this is going to sound really weird.
1283000	1285000	They might have done too many world premieres.
1285000	1289000	And I think they really should have focused on the stuff that was really new.
1289000	1291000	You know, things like the Tacoma trailer.
1291000	1294000	But I like a third trailer for No Man's Sky.
1294000	1296000	And yes, I understand it's the same thing every time.
1296000	1299000	Don't let me start it on No Man's Sky.
1299000	1304000	I have had it officially with flying through fucking space.
1304000	1307000	Okay, here's the problem with No Man's Sky that I'm seeing right here.
1307000	1310000	And I'm going to tell you, here's my worry about this game.
1310000	1313000	I think it's going to be fucking boring.
1313000	1316000	Because it looks really amazing that you can visit all these planets and stuff.
1316000	1318000	And there's somewhat different things on there.
1318000	1322000	I think I'm going to get so bored so fast with that game.
1322000	1323000	And that's what I'm worried about.
1323000	1326000	It's like they haven't really shown what you do other than exploring new things.
1326000	1328000	Okay, I was bitching about that on Twitter.
1328000	1330000	And of course, Bobby jumped in and said,
1330000	1332000	Well, Rob, look at this YouTube. It's all right here.
1332000	1333000	And he leaked me this YouTube.
1333000	1337000	And sure enough, there was a 14-minute GameSpot had done a preview or something
1337000	1340000	where they actually showed some of the gameplay and the fact that,
1340000	1342000	yes, those ships do shoot things.
1342000	1347000	And you can explore the planets and all this stuff.
1347000	1349000	So there is a game in there.
1349000	1353000	But these trailers we keep seeing don't really show any of that.
1353000	1356000	I still want to buy it, but I just think I'm going to get bored with it really fast.
1356000	1359000	Seriously, when I saw it again at the PlayStation experience,
1359000	1363000	I was like, all right, this is now past bordering on pretentious.
1363000	1367000	And I understand I'm probably pissing people off with what I'm saying
1367000	1370000	because some people are very excited for that game.
1370000	1373000	And I understand it's more of an indie company and all this stuff.
1373000	1377000	But I'm just like, you guys, at these big, big, big awards shows,
1377000	1379000	they have shown the same thing three times.
1379000	1382000	So I really need to see some...
1382000	1384000	It's essentially the same trailer, just different planets each time.
1384000	1385000	And yeah, that's cool.
1385000	1388000	Okay, here's my example.
1388000	1390000	Here's my example and why I'm concerned.
1390000	1395000	Because there was another game almost ten years ago at this point
1395000	1397000	that was very big on this whole,
1397000	1403000	we're going to go from the smallest of smallest of micronisms
1403000	1405000	to getting bigger and bigger.
1405000	1410000	And then it's going to be a civilization and you take over the world and all this stuff.
1410000	1412000	Do you guys know what I'm talking about?
1412000	1413000	I know what you're talking about.
1413000	1416000	I'm talking about Spore. Remember?
1416000	1419000	And there was a lot of good ideas in Spore as well,
1419000	1423000	but ultimately the game felt like a collection of mini-games.
1423000	1426000	So if you want to know why I'm sitting here giving No Man's Sky a hard time
1426000	1428000	for doing the same thing over and over,
1428000	1432000	it's because I've played Spore and I feel like I've kind of been here before.
1432000	1436000	So I just want to see a little more about how do those littler parts
1436000	1438000	make the big thing function?
1438000	1442000	Because that's a very important part of the game, if that makes sense.
1442000	1448000	I would love nothing more than for this game to come out and blow my fucking mind
1448000	1452000	and be like, I really shouldn't have given this game such a hard time on all those trailers
1452000	1453000	because this game is fucking amazing.
1453000	1456000	I would love nothing more than for that to happen.
1456000	1461000	But right now, since I haven't played it, I can't really say that yet.
1461000	1464000	All I can say is, okay, I've seen the same,
1464000	1466000	it's been the same joke three times.
1466000	1468000	It's like an episode of this show. Come on.
1468000	1471000	So there you go. That's my thoughts on No Man's Sky.
1472000	1475000	I go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1475000	1478000	DungeonBuster says, I'm excited for it, but I understand where Sky is coming from.
1478000	1482000	Raven's Dolphin says, that concert was something, just show the game.
1482000	1485000	Static 68 is cool, but show off the game, it's just colorful and whatever.
1485000	1489000	Let's see, Tigerclaw says, No Man's Sky seems way too ambitious.
1489000	1491000	I hope they deliver in the end. Yeah, me too.
1491000	1494000	EB says, oh, Spore was such a disappointment, right?
1494000	1499000	But there was so many, I mean, and it's really hard to figure out where that game went wrong
1499000	1501000	because there were so many good ideas in it.
1501000	1503000	But I think at the end of the day, it felt like a bunch of little mini games.
1503000	1505000	It just didn't feel cohesive.
1505000	1507000	It didn't feel cohesive. Yeah, exactly.
1507000	1509000	I think that was a big problem with it.
1509000	1511000	Those comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
1511000	1513000	Alright, so that's the Game Awards in a nutshell.
1513000	1515000	Anything else you guys want to say about it?
1515000	1517000	I didn't watch it.
1517000	1524000	I didn't think that the Dragon Age Inquisition thing was as clever as the Mass Effect thing last year.
1524000	1528000	Oh, with the little Conan O'Brien spots where he's saying,
1528000	1530000	so what do you do in this game? Question dragons?
1530000	1533000	Some of that was a little silly.
1533000	1536000	I get that Conan O'Brien does these hilarious- Even the introduction thing.
1536000	1538000	Yeah, I know.
1538000	1541000	It was a little, I hate to say it, but if they could have cut something,
1541000	1544000	maybe that's something they could have cut was those little Conan O'Brien bits
1544000	1546000	because they did get a little grating.
1546000	1551000	But, Dar Sakura, do go back and watch for Ken and Roberta Williams
1551000	1555000	because I literally got verklempt watching them get on stage.
1556000	1559000	I was at this thing called work.
1559000	1561000	So, even though I skimmed all of it-
1561000	1563000	There's this thing called YouTube.
1563000	1568000	I didn't notice that they had anybody calling gamers nerds or anything like that.
1568000	1570000	Like, I think it was Joel McHale was doing last year.
1570000	1571000	Yeah, yeah.
1571000	1574000	You know, gamers are nerd, you know, basement dwelling.
1574000	1576000	No, none of that.
1576000	1580000	Thank goodness they've realized that, hey, those jokes aren't funny anymore.
1580000	1584000	And they never really were that funny to begin with.
1584000	1587000	I mean, it's like, okay, yeah, you're the first person to make the reference
1587000	1590000	that gamers live in their mom's basements and play video games all day
1590000	1592000	and don't get exposure to the sun.
1592000	1594000	It's like, oh, wow, that's the first time I've ever heard that joke.
1594000	1597000	Do you remember when I came back from the very first GamerX
1597000	1600000	and I was a little critical of Pandora Boxx, who's the famous drag queen
1600000	1603000	who was on RuPaul's Drag Race because she was making those same type of jokes
1603000	1607000	at GamerX, and I was like, know your audience.
1607000	1612000	Hello, you know, those jokes are really cheap and it wasn't funny at all.
1612000	1616000	It's kind of funny, but it's a very similar sort of thing.
1616000	1618000	I just compared a drag queen to Joel McHale.
1618000	1620000	I'm okay with that, totally okay with that.
1620000	1622000	All right, anyway.
1622000	1624000	Great job, sir.
1624000	1626000	Let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games
1626000	1629000	that we have been playing this week, and then we can get into some news.
1629000	1631000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1631000	1635000	Actually, for all the work I've been doing, it was pretty busy.
1635000	1639000	I played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition, and I've managed to get almost back
1639000	1643000	to where I was in about 10 hours less gameplay,
1643000	1647000	plus I'm a higher level than when I left off, so I'm doing okay.
1647000	1651000	And I've been playing Fractal because I freaking love Fractal.
1651000	1654000	I got a...
1654000	1657000	Fractal seems to be like your Tetris of sorts.
1657000	1660000	It's like the old go-to puzzle game you can always rely on for a good time.
1660000	1662000	It requires a lot of thought.
1662000	1663000	Yeah.
1663000	1665000	How do you play it then?
1666000	1669000	Get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich.
1669000	1673000	I don't even care if this isn't our house, but make me a sandwich.
1673000	1676000	Speaking of pretentious...
1676000	1679000	Um...
1679000	1682000	I've just been playing a few things then.
1682000	1684000	Okay, I'm just giving you crap.
1684000	1686000	I've played some Bejeweled.
1686000	1687000	Yeah?
1687000	1688000	That's...
1688000	1690000	What else did I play, though?
1690000	1693000	I played something else because I picked up something through one of the...
1694000	1696000	Stupid sales...
1696000	1698000	Oh, yeah, I played more Mountain.
1698000	1700000	Game is so stupid.
1700000	1702000	But, like, I'm gonna spin the mountain for a minute.
1702000	1704000	Okay, I'm done.
1704000	1705000	Awesome.
1705000	1706000	All right.
1706000	1709000	Oh, yeah, and Dan got me Knights.
1710000	1711000	Oh, Sonic.
1711000	1714000	Was that in the Sega Humble Bundle?
1714000	1715000	The Sega Humble Bundle.
1715000	1717000	Nice. Very cool.
1717000	1719000	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1719000	1720000	It was okay.
1720000	1723000	Yeah, I played really only two things this week.
1723000	1725000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
1725000	1728000	A lot of it because my son's actually playing it now.
1728000	1729000	It's hilarious.
1729000	1732000	He actually knows how to play games now.
1732000	1738000	Back from when, oh, I used to put Grand Theft Auto on and he'd sometimes hit the gas and drive straight.
1738000	1744000	Now he can actually control a character using the analog stick and stuff and walk around the city and do things.
1744000	1746000	How far he has come.
1746000	1749000	So I've been playing a lot of that.
1749000	1751000	Just trying to unlock things.
1751000	1760000	So now I figured out how to get to the part of the helicarrier where I can actually unlock the Deadpool bricks to give you, like, multipliers and stuff.
1760000	1765000	And so I'm trying to get some of that done so I can unlock more characters and all that stuff.
1765000	1771000	So I played a ton of that this week, which is surprising because I have Grand Theft Auto 5 that I haven't really touched much of.
1771000	1772000	That's surprising.
1772000	1774000	Well, not really.
1774000	1776000	Because Grand Theft Auto 5, I've played a ton of it already.
1776000	1781000	And so basically I'm playing the same game again, whereas Lego Marvel Super Heroes, I've never played through it before.
1781000	1785000	So I can see why I'm more interested in this right now than I am Grand Theft Auto 5.
1785000	1792000	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, I got really excited for a minute because I thought that that game was going to be on sale this weekend.
1792000	1794000	Because they were saying something at the Game Awards.
1794000	1798000	Go on Steam and all these Game of the Year things are going to be on sale.
1798000	1802000	So you go on Steam and sure enough, you can get, like, the South Park game for what, like, 15 bucks?
1802000	1804000	18 for the entire thing.
1804000	1806000	Right, but Grand Theft Auto, not on sale.
1806000	1807000	No.
1807000	1809000	Well, it's not out yet on PC.
1809000	1811000	Oh, that's right. Well, even pre-order or whatever.
1811000	1813000	In January.
1813000	1818000	I thought maybe it was PlayStation 4 then. Maybe they said something about PlayStation 4 because they were like, oh, it'll be out on Play...
1818000	1819000	Yeah, no, I saw that.
1819000	1820000	And there's no sale there either.
1820000	1825000	Yeah, they do have the thing for the PlayStation Experience stuff on there, but yeah, they don't have it.
1825000	1827000	Sorry, I got that. Lots of sales. I got that twisted in my head.
1827000	1835000	Then it was the PlayStation Experience sale and they said go online, there's a bunch of stuff on sale, and Grand Theft Auto 5, they, like, showed the logo and I was like, yes, I'll finally get it.
1835000	1839000	But they are going to still, they're doing their holiday sales still, but it's still week one.
1839000	1844000	It's been week one for, like, a week and a half now, so I'm waiting for them to switch it up.
1844000	1849000	Very, very, very, very close to buying Wolfenstein and New Order.
1849000	1855000	I may do that today. I don't know. I'm that close because it's 50% off right now, but we'll see.
1855000	1862000	Anyway, so yeah, I was surprised. I was kind of playing that more than anything, but once again, it's a new game to me.
1862000	1864000	And surprisingly, there's a lot to do in it.
1864000	1870000	I actually was reading some, they're talking about, you know, I was reading through some of the facts and stuff.
1870000	1879000	They were saying that it's very similar to Lego Batman 2, so I have to see if that's, I don't think that was on PlayStation 4, so I may have to check that out, though.
1879000	1880000	That sounds interesting.
1880000	1882000	But it's a fun game. I'm having fun with it.
1882000	1886000	The humor's good. I mean, that's kind of what I enjoy about it. It's pretty funny.
1886000	1893000	And then the other game I played, very briefly, but I'm running into a problem because it is early access and it's still buggy.
1893000	1900000	And one of the known bugs is that the controls don't work well with my gamepad on Windows 8.1, but it's a game called I Am Bread.
1900000	1907000	And it's a game from the folks that brought you Surgeon Simulator.
1908000	1917000	And you know, Surgeon Simulator has a very unique control style. Well, this is just the same. A little bit different.
1917000	1924000	You use the, on gamepad, you use the shoulder buttons and the triggers to move your toast.
1924000	1931000	So each corner of the bread, or I'm sorry, your bread, and you're trying to become toast.
1931000	1938000	So you're a piece of bread trying to become toast. Simple premise, but you have to move across a room in order to get there.
1938000	1948000	And so each trigger controls a corner of the bread. And so you stick, you know, one side down and you kind of tilt with your analog stick.
1948000	1955000	And you stick the next side down, you kind of roll around. But you have to be edible, so you can't like roll through things that might get you dirty.
1955000	1960000	And in the same time, you're also destroying the house because, you know, it's just hard to control.
1960000	1966000	Gaming is so strange right now. She's been playing a game about a mountain. You've been playing a game about bread.
1966000	1970000	Somebody created an OLR dream game about shit. Actual shit.
1970000	1972000	Pixel shit.
1972000	1976000	This is just, this is a very interesting time in gaming, is it not?
1976000	1977000	It's a funny game though.
1977000	1979000	No, it sounds great. It sounds great.
1979000	1986000	But that's it. I mean seriously though, think about it. The premise of this game can be some, you are a piece of bread that's trying to become toast.
1986000	1988000	That's the premise of the game.
1988000	1992000	What do all three of those things I have in common have?
1992000	1994000	Bread that eventually leads to shit?
1994000	1995000	No, it's just the fact that...
1995000	1997000	And you can poop on a mountain.
1997000	2006000	It's just the fact that all those things are like these very obscure concepts, original concepts, but that could be still very simple in execution.
2006000	2016000	But it's funny because it's so hard to control. It's just like, it's the same appeal that you have with Surgeon Simulator where, you know, of course you're fucking stuff up.
2016000	2022000	You're dropping the drill in the guy's face because you can't maneuver your hand well with the keyboard and mouse.
2022000	2024000	So this is kind of the same thing.
2024000	2030000	I'm gonna have to try to do it with keyboard and mouse I guess because I can't, they don't have a workaround yet.
2030000	2036000	The problem is with the gamepads that the triggers are backwards.
2036000	2044000	So instead of pulling down the triggers to have it where you kind of grab the ground, you have to let them go so they're reversed.
2044000	2047000	And so it's kind of hard to train your brain to do that right.
2047000	2051000	I wish they had a way just to flip the axis on it, but they don't.
2051000	2054000	So there's unfortunately no workaround for it yet.
2054000	2058000	But maybe a joy key type thing will fix it.
2058000	2061000	But right now they're working. It's early access, it just came out.
2061000	2064000	So I think I have a story about it later on so we'll talk about it.
2064000	2066000	But it's funny.
2066000	2070000	Well it sounds like you're not the only one that's being tempted by these sales going on.
2070000	2072000	I'm looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2072000	2078000	Fabrice is in our chatroom saying, I bought Wolfenstein yesterday, didn't have time to play it though, but that'll be something for tomorrow.
2078000	2084000	Well already there's free, I downloaded Injustice and I haven't got a chance to play that yet.
2084000	2087000	Yeah but a Playstation Plus perk is a little different than actually purchasing.
2087000	2088000	It's so many games though!
2088000	2097000	Seriously, my digital library on Playstation Network is starting to get, it's not as bad as Steam because that would be a lot more money.
2097000	2101000	There's not as many discounts there, but it's getting pretty big.
2101000	2106000	It's just like, I'm never going to play these games, but I'm downloading them just in case!
2106000	2113000	Sony's trying to compete a little more with dropping games to a really, really low price to make them more appealing.
2113000	2114000	There's a lot of stuff on sale right now.
2114000	2117000	I buy digital a ton on there, it's just so convenient.
2117000	2123000	Instead of going to the store and buying stuff on sale, or use games, which I probably should.
2123000	2126000	Alright, let me talk about my gaming week real quick and then we'll go over to Dan.
2126000	2133000	I actually don't have a lot of new stuff because the only real new stuff I played, I played Ultimate NES Remix on the Nintendo 3DS which just came out on Friday.
2133000	2134000	What?
2134000	2135000	What?
2135000	2137000	Yeah, it's 30 bucks.
2137000	2138000	I gotta get it.
2138000	2140000	Yeah, I can get my DS if you want to check it out.
2140000	2143000	It's the only reason I've even close to wanted a Wii U is NES Remix.
2143000	2146000	So now that it's on the 3DS, fuck the Wii U.
2146000	2155000	And so, yeah, it's kind of a greatest hits compilation, but they finally got leaderboards on every level which is kind of a nice thing to see.
2155000	2160000	I only played like 30 minutes or less of the game so I don't really feel comfortable giving the thing an entire review.
2160000	2168000	But if you already own it on the Wii U, you might want to just think carefully about buying it on the 3DS as well because there's not really a lot of new stuff.
2168000	2174000	Except for the fact that they have, I don't know what they call it, like Ultra Super Mario, or like Super Fast Mario Brothers or something.
2174000	2181000	Which is basically an emulated version of Super Mario Brothers, but with the speed turned up to like 500%.
2181000	2185000	So you're like running super fast.
2185000	2188000	So does the time go that fast too?
2188000	2191000	Yes, so you have to be very fast to get through the levels.
2191000	2193000	Gotta go fast, gotta go fast.
2193000	2197000	And there's also like, they have the championship mode.
2197000	2200000	Sorry, just because of what we're talking about here.
2200000	2204000	I know we were not going to talk about it because at least I don't think we're going to talk about it.
2204000	2210000	But that Mario Maker looks pretty awesome though.
2210000	2212000	It does.
2212000	2214000	You know, I wasn't really giving it much credit before.
2214000	2216000	I'm like, wow, that does look pretty sweet.
2216000	2221000	Their last trailer that they did was really like, ooh, that's some pretty cool stuff there.
2221000	2224000	It's going to be like Little Big Planet for Super Mario Brothers.
2224000	2228000	This is the game a lot of people have been wanting, so I'm excited for that.
2228000	2238000	So I also played just a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, which very much struck me as, wow, EA has definitely this multiplayer model.
2238000	2246000	Because this looks very similar with the whole opening the packs and stuff as Mass Effect multiplayer had, and as I'm seeing in the Dragon Age multiplayer.
2246000	2249000	But I didn't really play enough of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare to tell you much more.
2249000	2253000	But I imagine a lot of you are playing it this week, and we'll get into why later on.
2253000	2256000	Otherwise, some of the same stuff I've been playing.
2256000	2259000	I'm up to level 97 on World of Warcraft Warlords of Draenor.
2259000	2262000	Alan and I have been playing more Diablo III.
2262000	2265000	We got to level 70 on his seasonal, which is nice.
2265000	2271000	So Alan got his transmog gear for season one, and now I have two level 70s in seasonal.
2271000	2273000	Because I have an addiction.
2273000	2274000	Yeah, all on PC.
2274000	2276000	I do have a level 70 on PS4, though.
2276000	2278000	But there's no seasons on PS4.
2278000	2284000	And there never will be because you're not always connected on PS4, and people have already figured out how to hack the game.
2284000	2288000	So they're not going to do it because they know people will cheat.
2288000	2291000	Because the game is not always online.
2291000	2292000	Who cares?
2292000	2293000	I know, I know.
2293000	2298000	So yeah, that's really it for my gaming week.
2298000	2305000	More Final Fantasy XIV, a little bit of Dragon Age, more Geometry Wars III, which I awfully still enjoy quite a bit.
2305000	2309000	Was able to beat the second boss in that, and now I'm making my way through the green stages.
2309000	2314000	When I'm not playing some of the retro stages in the game, but that game is a lot of fun as well.
2314000	2315000	That's my gaming week.
2315000	2317000	Dan, how about you? How was your gaming week?
2317000	2320000	I've done very little gaming this week, unfortunately.
2320000	2327000	I did buy the Humble Bundle for Sega, and I played Sonic Generations for the first time, and I played Sonic in the All-Stars Racing.
2327000	2334000	And actually what happened was I bought the Humble Bundle for Sonic All-Stars Racing, and then they re-released it with Generations.
2334000	2337000	So I bought it again so I can get Sonic Generations.
2337000	2341000	But it's an opportunity to give money to my favorite charity, Sega.
2341000	2346000	So, there you go. Most of the other stuff I gifted to Jamie.
2346000	2348000	Fair enough. That works.
2348000	2352000	I probably could have given you a Sonic Racing since I already bought it.
2352000	2358000	I seriously am swimming Steam codes in my Humble Bundle library that I just have duplicates of.
2358000	2362000	Why don't you just pay some in chat? Be like, here guys, thanks for listening.
2362000	2366000	They may not work internationally, though. That's the only thing I'm worried about.
2366000	2370000	We are fortunate we are joined by people in time zones that usually can't tune into the show.
2370000	2373000	I think it should be fine. I think that they don't.
2373000	2374000	One way to find out.
2374000	2375000	Yeah, let's do it.
2375000	2377000	Let's see what happens.
2377000	2381000	Alright, so that is it for all our gaming weeks.
2381000	2384000	Let's get into some quick housekeeping. Don't forget to follow us on Facebook.
2384000	2386000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
2386000	2388000	And Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2388000	2392000	Orange Launch Radio will be returning live at its normal time next week.
2392000	2394000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
2394000	2398000	Sorry for that. Some people have told me, I like the noon time better.
2398000	2403000	Sorry guys, it's just that we have to kind of make a lot of rearrangements to do the show earlier.
2403000	2406000	We can't move the show to noon ourselves every week.
2406000	2409000	But don't forget the show is podcast and the great thing about that,
2409000	2412000	you can listen to the podcast whenever you damn well please.
2412000	2416000	I know some people that don't listen to the show until Saturday.
2416000	2418000	Because that's when it's convenient for their schedule.
2418000	2420000	So, you know what, that's the great thing.
2420000	2422000	Or some people binge listen to O-L-R too.
2422000	2425000	They're like, I gotta catch up on a month worth of O-L-R.
2425000	2428000	So I'm gonna play M-M-O's and listen to O-L-R literally all day.
2428000	2431000	I've had people tweet me that before and I think that's really awesome.
2431000	2437000	And I don't mind being in the background while you're grinding wolf pelts
2437000	2439000	and whatever you need to get in your M-M-O.
2439000	2443000	It's okay, I was listening to Mist in History when I'd go to the gym.
2443000	2449000	I would learn about Crazy King Ludwig and lose calories.
2449000	2452000	I listen to What's the Tea with RuPaul and Michelle Visage.
2452000	2456000	Because it keeps me laughing and gets me going.
2456000	2458000	I don't do podcasts, but I do...
2458000	2460000	Wait, you don't do podcasts?
2460000	2464000	Well, listening to podcasts. I don't really listen to podcasts too much,
2464000	2467000	but I do watch the web series, which, as you probably saw,
2467000	2469000	I'm trying to get them on the show, so hopefully soon.
2469000	2471000	Just have to get them to commit to a day.
2471000	2476000	Yeah, nice. I should give a plug, because they're always good about plugging us
2476000	2479000	to some of the other shows that some friends of mine do,
2479000	2482000	because I do listen in the car a lot to GameBui.org,
2482000	2484000	which today is Captain Spike's birthday, by the way.
2484000	2488000	I listen a lot to Koopa Club, which we were talking about our game of the year,
2488000	2490000	which depends on what group you are.
2490000	2493000	I can already tell you Koopa Club will name Bayonetta 2 their game of the year,
2493000	2495000	because they love Nintendo that much over there.
2495000	2498000	Video Game Realness probably will also name Bayonetta 2.
2498000	2500000	There are also big Nintendo fans over there.
2500000	2505000	Game Bar, there's lots of great other shows I listen to as well.
2505000	2509000	I would like a Wii, but I just can't justify buying one without my wife getting mad.
2509000	2512000	You never know. You never know. They might even...
2512000	2520000	So family, if you buy me one, then that's okay, because then I can get one.
2520000	2524000	All right, let's get into some news.
2524000	2528000	We're going to get into the news for the week, of which there was quite a bit,
2528000	2532000	thanks to PlayStation's event, and even without that,
2532000	2535000	there was still a lot of stuff going on. It was a very busy week.
2535000	2539000	It was interesting. So this week, there was a couple announcements
2539000	2541000	from Capcom regarding Street Fighter.
2541000	2545000	One being, of course, that Capcom is bringing Ultra Street Fighter IV
2545000	2548000	exclusively to PlayStation 4 this spring.
2548000	2551000	They're saying that the port of the game will come with all the costumes
2551000	2555000	that have been made available so far via DLC.
2555000	2558000	No firm date has been given yet to when we can expect that.
2558000	2565000	But on top of that, not only are people on PlayStation 4 getting Ultra Street Fighter IV,
2565000	2568000	they are also getting Street Fighter V.
2568000	2575000	That's right. Street Fighter V has been announced as a PlayStation 4 and PC exclusive.
2575000	2581000	And before you think, hey, that they did the same thing with Tomb Raider on Xbox One,
2581000	2584000	I'm just going to wait until the exclusive period is done,
2584000	2589000	they made sure to clarify that, in fact, as Adam Boyce said,
2589000	2595000	PlayStation 4 will be the only console this game ever appears on.
2596000	2599000	I don't think you get much clearer than that.
2599000	2604000	Well, until Super Street Fighter V. Or Street Fighter V Turbo.
2604000	2607000	Or Street Fighter V Turbo Ultra Mega.
2607000	2613000	Yeah, I'm not holding out that they're not going to have six or seven different re-releases of the game.
2613000	2617000	I think a big thing to consider why Microsoft didn't get this game,
2617000	2619000	and I'm not trying to hate on Xbox One.
2619000	2623000	Xbox One, I don't think there's any reason why Xbox One doesn't deserve the game.
2623000	2626000	However, exclusives are a part of the industry.
2626000	2630000	This is why Mario doesn't show up on PlayStation 4.
2630000	2633000	You know, what would Nintendo have for their Wii U if they didn't have exclusives?
2633000	2637000	So exclusives are just a part of this industry, and wheeling and dealing and all this stuff.
2637000	2640000	However, there's another huge factor coming into play,
2640000	2643000	which is why the Xbox One got shut out of this,
2643000	2649000	and that is the cross-platform play between PC and PlayStation 4.
2649000	2651000	That's huge.
2651000	2654000	And we all know that Microsoft, for whatever reason,
2654000	2659000	has chosen to exclude themselves from these types of cross-plays.
2659000	2664000	Which is weird, because they used to do that back in the early Xbox 360 days.
2664000	2667000	Xbox One could have Final Fantasy XIV.
2667000	2672000	Square Enix wanted to do it for Xbox One, but they would not run separate servers for Microsoft.
2672000	2680000	So, in a way, although I think at the end of the day Sony and Capcom have an arrangement,
2680000	2686000	Capcom is a Japanese company, the Xbox One is a non-factor in Japan right now.
2686000	2689000	As much as that might, you know, sting to hear, it's the reality.
2689000	2691000	Xbox One's a non-factor in Japan right now.
2691000	2693000	It makes this relationship make a lot of sense.
2693000	2697000	But at the same time, this is going to put a lot of pressure on Microsoft,
2697000	2702000	because I think there's going to be a perceived notion that a big reason why the Xbox One didn't get this
2702000	2704000	is because it doesn't support the cross-platform play.
2704000	2709000	And I think if you are hoping that Ultra Street Fighter V, or whatever the fuck they call it,
2709000	2713000	will come to Xbox One, that wall will have to drop.
2713000	2717000	So this is going to put a lot of pressure on Microsoft to reverse that policy.
2717000	2721000	And I'm going to predict, I'm going to be one of those guys making predictions,
2721000	2728000	this is, that's mine, this is going to be one of those things that they come out at E3 next year
2728000	2731000	and say that they're going to drop the wall.
2731000	2737000	I'm actually going to go so far to predict they're going to announce Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox One next E3.
2737000	2743000	And this will be their big, we are no longer requiring that Xbox One have their own isolated servers.
2745000	2746000	So, we'll see.
2748000	2750000	I still think they're all full of crap.
2752000	2755000	Well, what do you guys think of the Street Fighter V reveal?
2755000	2759000	Because I'm seeing a lot of people, I mean, there's definitely two camps.
2760000	2764000	There's definitely some people that are very, very, very excited to see it.
2764000	2768000	But there's some people that are like, it looks a lot like Street Fighter IV.
2768000	2771000	It does look a lot like Street Fighter IV, just with more particles.
2771000	2776000	I like how the stages are, though, where they're busting through the wall and it's kind of extended out.
2776000	2778000	I think that's something that...
2778000	2780000	Mortal Kombat.
2780000	2781000	And Justice.
2781000	2783000	And Justice I know did that.
2783000	2786000	But I want to say that I think King of Fighters had that as well.
2786000	2788000	Yeah, way back in the day, yeah.
2789000	2792000	And that was special when it was done in Mortal Kombat II.
2792000	2795000	Or, no, actually, I think even Dead or Alive did that.
2795000	2797000	I don't know, they've all done that at this point.
2797000	2799000	But it looked different.
2799000	2801000	It's something that's separated, I guess.
2801000	2804000	I still feel like what we got.
2804000	2810000	I think that gameplay trailer that we got was an apology from Capcom for the whole thing leaking a day early.
2810000	2814000	Because Yoshinori Ono looked a little surprised.
2814000	2816000	He was kind of taken by surprise because the guy was like,
2816000	2818000	oh, we do have some gameplay footage to show.
2818000	2820000	And he was kind of like, oh, okay.
2820000	2825000	He's so adorably cute and he's skipping over to see what's on the phone.
2825000	2826000	I love that guy.
2826000	2828000	Anyway, so he kind of looked a little surprised.
2828000	2830000	And I think that was probably Capcom's apology.
2830000	2833000	Because that Street Fighter V trailer had leaked a day early.
2833000	2837000	That took a lot of wind out of the PlayStation Experience keynote sales.
2837000	2841000	There was a lot of other good stuff at that keynote.
2841000	2843000	I'm not saying it was a bad keynote or anything.
2843000	2847000	But that Street Fighter V unveil, exclusive on PlayStation 4.
2847000	2849000	Imagine if they were able to keep that a secret.
2849000	2852000	That would have been a huge moment for that room in Vegas.
2852000	2853000	Huge moment.
2853000	2856000	And so to kind of have that knocked away, they needed something to make up for it.
2856000	2859000	So I think Capcom gave them the gameplay as an apology.
2859000	2861000	But I think it's so, so early on.
2861000	2863000	I think it's just too soon to tell.
2863000	2866000	I think there's many, many more layers to be peeled back about this game.
2866000	2869000	So I think it's definitely too early.
2869000	2872000	I mean, right now, yes, it looks quite a bit like Street Fighter IV.
2872000	2876000	But I'm still hopeful that we're going to see more of the differences as time goes on here.
2876000	2877000	That's for sure.
2877000	2879000	I want another Marvel vs. Capcom.
2879000	2882000	Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2882000	2884000	Dungeon Buster says,
2884000	2886000	Street Fighter IV is still going strong.
2886000	2888000	Seems a bit too soon for a new one.
2888000	2892000	Well, it did come right after that talk about Ultra Street Fighter IV.
2892000	2895000	Yeah, Ultra Street Fighter IV would be in the spring.
2895000	2897000	I'm guessing this would be coming out in fall.
2897000	2902000	Actually, maybe even late summer, I'd guess.
2902000	2904000	Because I know Capcom tends to release stuff at weird times.
2904000	2911000	They like to use August or October usually for their releases like this.
2911000	2916000	Well, I think 2015 is generous.
2916000	2921000	I think there's a distinct possibility Street Fighter V not till 2016.
2921000	2923000	Honestly.
2923000	2924000	Who cares?
2924000	2928000	No, seriously, who cares? We're going to get new Mortal Kombat next year.
2928000	2930000	We're going to have Ultra Street Fighter IV.
2930000	2933000	Oh, yeah, I think it's alright.
2933000	2936000	Can we get new PlayStation All-Stars? I'd be down with that.
2936000	2938000	Maybe I'm in the minority there.
2938000	2940000	I think you might be.
2940000	2944000	Moving on, speaking of Steam, we've talked a little bit about Steam tonight.
2944000	2949000	Steam came out with some big news independent of all these other events going on the weekend.
2949000	2953000	Steam unveiled Steam Broadcasting this week.
2953000	2960000	Steam Broadcasting will allow you to stream your gameplay to friends, strangers, and any Steam user
2960000	2964000	without having to use open broadcast software any other time.
2964000	2966000	It's built into Steam.
2966000	2971000	So if you start playing and you hit the broadcast button, you can broadcast your gameplay.
2971000	2976000	You can also, and this is a pretty neat thing, you can also keep your streaming private.
2976000	2981000	So if you only want to stream to a handful of people, you can do that.
2981000	2987000	So this is very interesting, is that Steam is now throwing their hat into the broadcasting ring.
2987000	2992000	And it's very important to note, this is not Steam sending a signal to Twitch or Ustream.
2992000	2994000	This is Steam broadcasting within Steam.
2994000	2999000	There's also quite a few limitations right now, such as you can't use a webcam with this,
2999000	3004000	or any type of custom layers, or things that people like to do on Twitch.
3004000	3007000	It's just the gameplay and your voice.
3007000	3011000	So it's even kind of behind where the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are at with the streaming.
3011000	3014000	Well, they do have a chat window, I think, as well.
3014000	3016000	They do have a chat window. They do have that.
3016000	3019000	But it's all still early. I mean, again, it is in beta.
3019000	3024000	But it is very interesting to see Steam throwing their hat into the ring.
3024000	3029000	I think a lot of us have been saying for some time it would be nice to see Twitch get a little bit of competition,
3029000	3031000	because competition is going to make things better.
3031000	3037000	And Hitbox isn't really taking off, and Ustream is really not good for game streaming.
3037000	3042000	If Steam wants to come up with another U2, I'd be down with that.
3042000	3044000	Oh, yeah, that would be awesome.
3044000	3055000	See, I've been noticing that the various streaming services out there are really, I'd say, finding different niches to cater to.
3055000	3065000	Like Ustream and Livestream both seem to be a combination of artists doing stuff and political activism.
3065000	3069000	Yeah, Ustream seems to be also more for concerts and entertainment type events.
3069000	3072000	I mean, I do realize the PlayStation 4 streams to Ustream.
3072000	3078000	But if you look, like, filter Ustream and look at what people are broadcasting on Ustream,
3078000	3082000	and it's almost all playroom streams, because they can't go to Twitch.
3082000	3088000	And what do people do on their playroom streams? Talk shows and showing titties.
3088000	3093000	Now, Twitch actually did respond to this whole thing, so I wanted to mention this real quick.
3093000	3097000	The VP of Marketing, Matthew DiPietro, I hope I said that right, said,
3097000	3102000	We are huge fans of Steam and work with Valve regularly on various events and product integrations.
3102000	3108000	While Steam's broadcasting solution and the Twitch platform are very different things with vastly different feature sets,
3108000	3112000	it's really validating to see a company like Valve embrace streaming in this way.
3112000	3117000	Live video is the future of social connectivity for gamers, and this is another proof point.
3117000	3119000	We wish them the best of luck.
3119000	3126000	So that was a statement that was like, well, we don't want Valve to not let people stream on Twitch anymore,
3126000	3132000	although that really can't happen, I mean, you can't filter a game out of Twitch very easily,
3132000	3134000	so I don't think that would really happen.
3134000	3138000	But they are trying to say, like, this is very different from what we've got going on at Twitch.
3138000	3140000	These are two very different things.
3140000	3144000	And to be fair, he's right, they are very different things.
3144000	3151000	You know, you can't get Steam broadcasting right now on your iPhone or on the PlayStation 4.
3151000	3153000	You can't do that yet.
3153000	3161000	Now, would this be a very logical thing to build into the iOS and Android app that Steam already has for the future?
3161000	3162000	Absolutely.
3162000	3165000	Ooh, they could do that on iOS and watch me play Bejeweled all day.
3165000	3170000	Would this be an easy thing for them to integrate into the Steam box in the future?
3170000	3172000	Absolutely.
3172000	3179000	So, again, very early beta, I think there is a lot, lot more to come from this.
3179000	3180000	We shall see.
3180000	3181000	Let's move on with some more news.
3181000	3183000	DarkSakura.
3183000	3187000	Well, to jump into a little bit of piracy talk, argh.
3187000	3188000	Argh.
3188000	3193000	Well, there was an app that was on the Google Play Store for Pirate Bay.
3193000	3197000	And Google's like, nope, took it down.
3197000	3206000	It was basically, it took down not just the Pirate Bay, but it took down Pirate Bay Proxy, Pirate Bay Premium, Pirate Bay Mirror, and Pirate App.
3206000	3218000	And basically, they just are like, we are not going to have anything related to torrenting at all involved in our service.
3218000	3233000	And the official reason for removal on the thing says violation of intellectual property and impersonation or deceptive behavior provisions of the content policy, please refer to the IP infringement and impersonation policy, help article for more information.
3233000	3245000	So, basically, the Pirate Bay Proxy developer who goes by Gavin said he was disappointed because they didn't do anything to other browsers.
3245000	3249000	Well, they weren't, let me start over.
3249000	3252000	They weren't doing this to other places.
3252000	3255000	He said that the app was no different than Firefox or Chrome.
3255000	3261000	But in this case, because it was specifically for Pirate Bay is why they took it down.
3261000	3266000	It's not like the Google Store doesn't have a piracy problem all their own, but I digress.
3266000	3267000	Yeah.
3267000	3271000	It's, I mean, what could these apps have really done?
3271000	3278000	Is it more of like a image thing where Google just doesn't want to be affiliated with it because of the image?
3278000	3280000	Well, some of them, like, it depends.
3280000	3289000	Like, some of them I know that you can download, like, torrents for actual, you know, APKs and stuff like that so you can download the actual apps from it.
3289000	3292000	I guess I'm just naive because I didn't think you could do all that crap on your phone.
3292000	3294000	Yeah, you can do BitTorrent on your phone.
3294000	3301000	They haven't blocked the app for people who've already gotten it because, I mean, over 900,000 folks have used it.
3301000	3308000	Wouldn't a lot of folks, though, that might be into using a site like the Pirate Bay, wouldn't a lot of them kind of know how to sideload apps, though?
3308000	3313000	They would. It's more of a convenience thing. It's like, oh, I want to download Angry Birds now.
3313000	3323000	I mean, I don't know why you would do BitTorrent. I mean, you can just download something like that, you know, other ways that's maybe a little bit more direct, but I don't know.
3323000	3325000	Yeah. It's just there.
3325000	3334000	But, I mean, at the end of the day, it does no company good to say, oh, we're going to embrace you, people that love piracy.
3334000	3340000	So, that's why they had to distance themselves from it. I think at the end of the day it's an image thing more than anything.
3340000	3346000	So, that's that. But I would like to see how Google Play is going to tackle some of their other piracy problems.
3346000	3349000	But anyway, let's move on. Loki.
3350000	3369000	All right. So, apparently, even though it's been out for over a year now, Target in Australia has, at least now, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not exactly sure when Grand Theft Auto 5 released in Australia, but I would assume it's around the time that it came out in North America.
3369000	3375000	But I'm making an assumption there. So, if that's the case, then, yes, it's been out for about a year or over a year.
3375000	3390000	So, now it's being taken off the shelves of Target because, you know, basically saying we've been speaking to many customers over the recent days about the game and there is a significant level of concern about the game's content.
3390000	3397000	We feel the decision to stop selling Grand Theft Auto 5 is in line with the majority of our customers.
3397000	3404000	Basically, they're saying that there's feedback from customers about the game's depictions of violence against women.
3405000	3416000	Which I don't get that because I've played through the game 100% and there's not really exact instances where you're targeting women in the game.
3416000	3423000	Aside from, oh, you can run around and beat up anybody and there just happens to be women walking around as well as men.
3423000	3428000	Which I think that's equal opportunity defenders if you ask me. I mean, but whatever.
3429000	3439000	And also, Grand Theft Auto is Grand Theft Auto. You don't go into that experience thinking, like, oh, it's gonna be, you know, happy Hello Kitty, Friends Forever type of stuff.
3439000	3448000	Yeah, I don't understand. So, you think it's okay that, okay, so you think it would be okay to, like, say, have it where you can't hurt women but you can kill men or something? You think that's fair?
3448000	3449000	No.
3449000	3457000	That's exactly what I'm saying. You can maim anybody in the game, including wildlife.
3457000	3458000	Silence for all.
3458000	3472000	You know, you can beat up a deer if you want. I mean, so, I don't know, I just think it's kind of ridiculous at this point why that now, like a year after it's been selling, that, oh, it's bad.
3472000	3475000	Well, speaking of piracy, this just encourages it.
3475000	3486000	And on top of Target, Kmart has joined Target in taking up Grand Theft Auto 5 off their shelves. To which I say, there's still Kmarts?
3486000	3488000	Yeah, it was that one near my old house.
3488000	3498000	Are they, like, time capsules in Australia like they are? Do we have anybody else? The time in Australia is gonna be awful right now for this new show, but I'm curious in general if anybody's listening over there on the podcast.
3498000	3510000	Is, are there Kmarts in a time capsule like the ones over here? Because I would say, did Kmart even have Grand Theft Auto 5 in the first place? Like, aren't they still selling, like, you know, Sega Genesis at the Kmarts in Australia?
3510000	3523000	They've Grand Theft Auto, like, one, three, San Andreas. They've taken San Andreas off the shelves because they think it's the same game. I don't know, I think it's a little ridiculous.
3524000	3540000	Yeah, there's violent, there's, you can do violence against women, but there's not, like, a mission that says, oh, go kill these women. It's, like, there's a mission where you're torturing somebody who's a man, but, I mean, no one seems to be having to, you know, taking offense to that, but, oh, but, you know.
3541000	3558000	I'm gonna say one thing. True equality, which should be the actual goal of feminism here, means it goes both ways. You can't have, oh, well, we don't like that just because of how women are treated and that when every character is treated the same way.
3558000	3567000	It'd be one thing if it was a disproportionate number of actual missions in game that were considered belligerent toward women.
3567000	3583000	Well, and I kind of think, I don't know, I get the feeling we're focusing too much on the women versus men aspect in this conversation because I think Australia as the territory has a history of kind of being oversensitive with a lot of video games.
3583000	3594000	I mean, they tend to ban a lot of stuff. They ban Mortal Kombat over there. They've banned, I know they've banned other games as well because it seems like every few months on this show we're talking about such and such game isn't available in Australia.
3594000	3599000	I don't know. I think they banned that a long time ago before they had that R18 rating or whatever that they have now.
3599000	3603000	I heard that wasn't really stopping games from not happening over there, though.
3603000	3606000	I don't know. I think it's ridiculous.
3606000	3619000	This tells me that there's a very, like, you know how we have people in the US, ultra sensitive, conservative people that want to govern. And I'm not saying if you're conservative, you're bad. Listen, hear me out here.
3619000	3627000	It's a certain set of conservatives that want to police morality. We have that here, right? I think Australia probably has a lot of that, too.
3627000	3633000	And since maybe they've failed because of what you're talking about, the rating system, this is their new approach.
3633000	3642000	Contact retailers and get the games pulled off the shelves and use these clips of beating up on women as an example. That's what it is.
3642000	3658000	My friend that lives in Adelaide was telling me that there actually is a really crazy conservative environment right now, especially, I mean, if you look at the I don't know if you paid much attention to the overall political environment in Australia right now, but their PM's a dick.
3658000	3660000	Yeah.
3660000	3671000	And there are a lot of people who are just sort of taking it as a license to be extra conservative because that's the way that the government is going.
3671000	3681000	There are certain areas out there that will really try to to crack down on just anything that isn't fitting the conservative norm.
3681000	3685000	And so I think that's also another contributing factor to why this is going on.
3685000	3696000	Yeah. And then, like, you know, to be fair, it is, you know, this retailer's choice to do that. And also to be fair, if you live in Australia, I'm sure they've got a God.
3696000	3704000	I don't even consider Kmart a decision, a choice anymore for buying video games, but like Target, I guess could be.
3704000	3710000	But there's plenty of other choices out there if you want to buy that game at retail and how you can buy digitally as well.
3710000	3717000	So I wouldn't say that these two retailers taking off shelves is necessarily dooming.
3717000	3730000	But I mean, remember, like Wal-Mart over, you know, in the United States, you know, taking music, you know, they've taken different albums off the shelves because of, you know, lyrics and stuff like that.
3730000	3738000	So I could see that they want to position themselves in a certain way to their customers and fine, then just don't do business with them if you don't like it.
3738000	3746000	And I think that's fair since, you know, it's not like that the whole country is banning the game. So you've got options.
3746000	3758000	All right. Well, let's move on and talk about one event at the PlayStation Expo that many are saying is the troll event of the year.
3758000	3766000	The biggest troll that's happened all year. So, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this, but let me set the stage here.
3766000	3776000	So Square Enix gets on the stage at PlayStation Expo and says, well, we're celebrating, you know, 20 years, and I'm summarizing here, we're celebrating 20 years of the PlayStation.
3776000	3784000	And you know, it's been many, many years since this game came out and the Final Fantasy 7 logo comes out on stage or comes up on the stage, right?
3784000	3794000	And he says, so it's time that we bring Final Fantasy 7 to the PlayStation 4. And I don't know about you guys, but I did the gay gasp.
3794000	3803000	When he said Final Fantasy 7 on PlayStation 4, I did, I did, I did that because I was like, oh, it's happening. Like, this is, this is like the really happening, right?
3803000	3813000	That, that infamous Final Fantasy 7 remake that we've been, you know, saying Square needs. And I realized there's Final Fantasy 7 haters out there that are like, move the fuck on with it.
3814000	3824000	But you have, you can't, you need to shut up because we don't care. You can't ignore, there's a large amount of people who want to see Final Fantasy 7 get remade, just like four got remade and three got remade.
3824000	3829000	Or even just a style of Advent Children because Advent Children is fucking amazing.
3829000	3836000	Right? So when they said Final Fantasy 7 was coming on PlayStation 4, and then the crowd goes wild, right? They're like, whoa.
3836000	3842000	And I'm sitting there at home going, you know, like, oh my gosh, this is really happening. Heavy breathing.
3842000	3852000	I know, right? Yes. Heavy breathing, cat picture, right? You know, so, um, and then they show the, the miasma in like the, the high definition, the live stream.
3852000	3865000	And I'm sitting there like, they're going to show, you know, everything in HD, right? And then they show the Final Fantasy 7 in a little tiny window and I'm like, okay, they're just showing the original game, right?
3865000	3880000	And then they're going to show what it looks like now. Nope, it's still the original Final Fantasy 7 because it's just the original Final Fantasy 7 as it was ported to the PC with the slightly up-res textures and the slight differences.
3880000	3890000	That's right. It's a PC. Okay. So Final Fantasy 7 ported to PC, ported to PlayStation 4. That's what was announced.
3890000	3892000	And the entire audience.
3899000	3903000	F you! You son of a bitch!
3903000	3923000	Now, now, now that's not the biggest troll ever. I mean, after all, Mega Man being in Marvel versus, was it Marvel versus Capcom? No, uh, Street Fighter X Tekken. That was the biggest troll of them all. I'm sorry. Yeah.
3923000	3928000	Or the fact that there was even going to be a Tekken X Street Fighter was a pretty big troll.
3928000	3929000	Yeah, that's hilarious.
3929000	3940000	Remember, that's... It still could happen. That was the tweet I wrote, by the way, when they announced Street Fighter 5 exclusive for PlayStation 4. I said, don't worry Xbox and Wii U, you can have Tekken X Street Fighter.
3940000	3956000	But yeah, it's just... I won't buy it. I already have it on PC. Not playing it on PC because, you know, it's in my Steam library. But I just don't see a reason to buy a shitty port of a game. I'm sorry. No, I won't buy it.
3957000	3968000	I'm sure it'll look alright on PlayStation 4. It'll look alright! It looks alright on PC, but no, I'm not buying it. You can buy Final Fantasy 7... Well, I guess you can't buy it for PlayStation 4, because the...
3968000	3979000	It better be fucking dirt cheap, then it better be like 8 bucks on there, not like, $29.99. It'll carry the Square Enix tax. It'll be $19.99. Fuck that. Ain't buying it.
3980000	3986000	Do they think that we don't have access to the internet and we just don't realize that, you know, it's just a port of the PC title?
3986000	3998000	Well, let's give Square Enix a call. Oh! I'm hearing yes. They just replied yes. That's what we believe. Alright. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3998000	4011000	Well, back to a little bit of politics. There is a Senator, Ron Wyden, who's a Democrat from Oregon, who has put in a bill to ban the use of backdoors to circumvent encryption.
4012000	4022000	As in, not just computer encryption, but encryption on phones, other devices, any type of digital data. It's called the Secure Data Act.
4022000	4030000	It'll basically prevent the government from telling manufacturers that they have to provide a way to decrypt personal data for investigations.
4030000	4041000	Meaning that it's not just to be protection from other people, but protection from the government, from snooping, as it were.
4041000	4056000	But the thing is, that would also, of course, apply to, I believe, justice cases. But at the same time, we already started having this go on when Apple said that the iPhone 6s, they were not going to allow any external access for decryption.
4057000	4074000	I think it's actually a really positive step in the case of user advocacy. But, I mean, we're probably going to see this expand to, you know, maybe people's VITAs or DSs, or, you know, for people who crack their own devices, their encryption is going to be protected.
4074000	4081000	Very interesting. Do you think this has a chance of actually passing?
4081000	4097000	I think there's going to be some pretty hardcore lobbying against it. I think anything has a chance, as long as people think with their morality instead of their wallet.
4098000	4112000	Well, I mean, I know we've heard a lot about, like, the government is asking Facebook for all these records and Yahoo, and didn't somebody told them no? Was it Apple that told them no? Somebody said that they came out and told the government no.
4112000	4115000	I know Apple did for the iPhone 6 encryption.
4116000	4135000	So, but, very interesting. We'll see what comes of this, because I don't think anybody likes the idea of the government being able to snoop on them, but I also get the double-edged sword of, well, but then there's those, you know, one bad person out of 10,000 that we need to be able to hear those conversations.
4135000	4141000	So, I don't know. It'll be very interesting to see what develops from this. It'll be a very controversial issue, I'm sure.
4142000	4151000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of video games coming out near you soon. Loki, if anything, this might be a very empty week.
4151000	4159000	Yeah, it would be nice if, you know, we had websites that actually had release dates now, but some certain websites decided to remove that information.
4159000	4160000	There's nothing else left.
4160000	4161000	Yeah.
4161000	4163000	I know of one thing in the US this week. I know of one thing in the US.
4163000	4176000	Well, there's not really any retail releases, I don't think. I'm getting there, but, yeah, I want to say that last week was pretty much the last set of releases that we had for this week as far as retail goes.
4176000	4183000	I want to say, I think Game of Thrones is this week, but I don't think that was retail. Maybe that was last week. That was last week.
4183000	4185000	I think Game of Thrones is already out, but maybe that was last week.
4185000	4186000	Yeah, that was last week.
4186000	4189000	Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris, I know.
4189000	4201000	Oh, that's right, they're doing a retail release of that. I forgot. Yeah, so they have that coming out. That's pretty much it. I don't think there's anything else. Like I said, I'm trying to get there, but I don't see anything. In fact, actually, here we go.
4201000	4207000	Yeah, I don't see anything coming out.
4207000	4209000	Right, yeah, it's going to be a slow week.
4209000	4214000	Unless you want some Assassin's Creed hoodies, in which case, then, yes, there's lots of those.
4215000	4224000	It's more of a digital distribution week, then, with Lara Croft, and I think Suikoden 2 gets its big hyped release this week. I know a lot of people were very happy to hear.
4224000	4236000	Yeah, it was Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris, and apparently they are doing Lara Croft and the Guardian of Lights getting a disc release as well.
4236000	4238000	Oh, I'm sorry, no, that's not good.
4238000	4240000	It would make a lot of sense if the two of them were kind of bundled or something like that.
4241000	4247000	This is all digital. Is Tetris Ultimate coming out this week, it looks like? Yeah, Tetris Ultimate is coming out digitally.
4247000	4249000	Neat.
4249000	4253000	I don't see what else here. This is all digital shit.
4253000	4266000	Yeah, okay, so here we go. So Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris coming out, retail, and then, if digital, I guess, Destiny's expansion, the Dark Below is coming out now.
4267000	4280000	What else was there? That Tetris game on, looks like, PlayStation 4, and that's it. That's it.
4280000	4288000	Alright, let's travel to Japan. Believe it or not, they have a lot of stuff still coming out this week, including, I love this, this is a limited edition PlayStation 4.
4288000	4297000	People losing their minds here over that 20th anniversary PlayStation 4, but over in Japan, they're getting a Dragon Quest Metal Slime PlayStation 4.
4297000	4305000	And that's coming out this week, and that looks really cool. It's like a little actual metal slime on the box, and, oh gosh, that looks really cute. I want one of those.
4305000	4309000	Unfortunately, it's going to cost me $800 if I want to import it, so maybe not.
4309000	4311000	You don't want that bad.
4311000	4313000	Yeah, I don't want it that bad, exactly.
4313000	4319000	But there are some games as well. Grand Theft Auto 5 gets its release in Japan this week. JoySound TV Plus also gets its Japanese release.
4319000	4324000	Need for Speed Rivals Complete Edition, which I'm assuming that means it includes all the DLC, is this week.
4324000	4331000	Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou with Power Up Kit comes out in a regular and a treasure box this week.
4331000	4335000	So, that is out on the PlayStation 4.
4335000	4341000	Going over to the Xbox One. The Xbox One has Grand Theft Auto 5 this week. That is really its only release.
4342000	4345000	Seeing if there's still things on the PlayStation 3 this week. There are.
4345000	4350000	Shining Resonance from Sega is out this week on the PlayStation 3, as is Assassin's Creed Rogue.
4350000	4354000	Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou. Hajime no Ippo the Fighting.
4354000	4364000	Ryu Ga Gotoku 1 and 2 HD Edition gets a price reduction, as does Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 gets a price reduction as well.
4364000	4368000	So, some games getting discounts there on the PlayStation 3.
4368000	4373000	Looking at the Wii U this week? No, but you have Sonic Tune on December 18th.
4373000	4378000	And on the PlayStation Vita this week, we have Sengoku Hime 5.
4378000	4383000	Earth Defense Forces 2 Portable V2 comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
4383000	4387000	Yeah. Not gonna import it?
4387000	4395000	No, I don't have a Vita anymore. So, no. Although, the new Earth Defense Force game may be.
4395000	4401000	Grisaia no Rakuen la Iden de la Grisaia comes out this week.
4401000	4406000	And the Portable V2? I think that's just a remake of the last one that they put out.
4406000	4411000	Because they did have a portable, was it 20? Well, it was over here.
4413000	4417000	Yeah, it was a portable 2017 V2, I think. I don't remember what it was called.
4418000	4423000	Now, next week in Japan, big, big release on December 13th.
4423000	4427000	Yokai Watch 2 Senuchi comes out next week.
4427000	4430000	And this series, pretty big deal over in Japan.
4430000	4432000	I can't wait till we get it.
4432000	4434000	Yeah, so that's a really big release on the 3DS.
4434000	4440000	So, even though things are slowing down here, this is a big week in Japan for releases.
4440000	4443000	Moving on to Dark Sakura and the UK releases.
4443000	4448000	On the 9th, we have Star Wars The Old Republic Shadows of Revan on PC.
4449000	4454000	On the 11th, we've got BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend on PC.
4454000	4456000	Rune Factory 4 on 3DS.
4456000	4459000	And then on PC and Mac, we have The Talos Principle.
4460000	4465000	On the 14th, it's Halo Spartan Strike on Windows Phone and PC.
4467000	4468000	That's it.
4468000	4473000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4473000	4474000	But first, Loki.
4474000	4481000	So, thanks to the PlayStation Experience in celebrating 20 years of the PlayStation.
4481000	4490000	EA has decided to be generous and give away free games for the length of the PlayStation Experience.
4490000	4495000	So, ending tonight, December 7th at midnight.
4496000	4499000	They're going to be giving away, or up to that.
4499000	4504000	They're going to be giving away on PlayStation 4 Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.
4504000	4509000	Mirror's Edge on PlayStation 3 and Need for Speed Most Wanted on the Vita.
4509000	4513000	And those are going to be free on the PlayStation Store during that time.
4513000	4516000	So, if you haven't done it yet, go ahead and download those.
4516000	4521000	Or, at the very least, go on the Sony Store online and just mark them all to download.
4522000	4524000	That way you have them for the future.
4524000	4527000	I'm not sure if you need PlayStation Plus to get them.
4527000	4529000	I know I had that, so I don't know.
4529000	4531000	Which Need for Speed Most Wanted is it?
4531000	4533000	It's the one that was on the Vita.
4533000	4535000	I don't know. It must have been the new one.
4535000	4537000	Yeah, I think it's the new one.
4537000	4538000	It's the new one, but it's only on the Vita.
4538000	4540000	It's like the old school PS2 version.
4540000	4541000	Yeah, I know.
4541000	4542000	That guy's awesome.
4542000	4543000	No, that guy's confusing.
4543000	4545000	Yeah, it's the new Most Wanted.
4545000	4549000	And sadly, a lot of the podcast listeners, it's going to be too late by the time you hear this.
4549000	4556000	But hopefully, I mean, hopefully you guys are tapped in enough to the game blogs and Twitter and so forth that you already heard about this and got your games flagged for download.
4556000	4557000	What do you guys think, though?
4557000	4561000	It's a very interesting, I mean, EA has no real need to do this.
4561000	4564000	The interesting thing, though, I will throw this out there.
4564000	4570000	I mean, Mirror's Edge, I really feel like a lot of people already own that game one way or another.
4570000	4574000	And EA does have a sequel they want to create awareness for.
4574000	4576000	Plants vs. Zombies.
4576000	4578000	Has a lot of microtransactions.
4578000	4582000	Microtransactions and to be honest, I was not interested in buying that game ever.
4582000	4586000	So it looked OK, but it was like it never was.
4586000	4589000	Oh, when I get a PlayStation 4, I'm totally going to buy this game.
4589000	4591000	No, that never happened.
4591000	4597000	Again, I don't want to review something based on only like 30 minutes, but it's not exactly the type of game that's, you know, get me like super excited.
4597000	4602000	It's not as awesome as it's supposed to be, like team portraits, too, with plants and zombies.
4602000	4604000	Yeah, sort of, sort of.
4605000	4609000	So, but yeah, they can still make the money from microtransactions and so forth.
4609000	4613000	So not that I'm trying to belittle what's going on here, because, you know, free games are a good thing.
4613000	4619000	But I don't think the risk factor or how much EA is going to lose in this is necessarily a huge, huge deal.
4619000	4623000	Because I think what they lose in Garden Warfare sales they'll make up for is people...
4623000	4626000	I think Mirror's Edge is like 10 bucks now on the PlayStation Network, so.
4626000	4629000	And Most Wanted, well, but it's probably...
4629000	4633000	Yeah, I don't think a lot of people are seeking out that game anymore, you know, so there you go.
4634000	4639000	As far as Mirror's Edge goes, though, is by somehow you have still missed this game time and time again,
4639000	4641000	do go get it now that it's free.
4641000	4644000	I mean, at least check that one out if nothing else.
4644000	4646000	If you got a PlayStation 3, which a lot of you do, it's just...
4646000	4650000	Just market download. I mean, what's it going to hurt you?
4650000	4651000	Exactly.
4651000	4655000	ActDef says, I got the free game, but no space in my Vita memory card.
4655000	4659000	Well, at least if you have it flagged on your account, you can always download it when you get a bigger memory card.
4659000	4664000	Because that's the interesting thing, is that the price of the system keeps dropping, but the memory cards are still expensive.
4665000	4666000	Anyway.
4666000	4669000	That's because they still use their stupid proprietary memory cards.
4669000	4670000	Yeah, right.
4670000	4674000	Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the end of this segment.
4674000	4678000	And that is a Wii U game that EA was working on.
4678000	4683000	And speaking of EA, they're giving away these free games, but the Wii U is getting nothing.
4683000	4689000	Because here's the deal, EA was working on SimCity for the Wii U.
4689000	4694000	That's right, EA's recent SimCity release was at one point being planned for the Wii U, but...
4694000	4697000	Which joke should I make? I don't know.
4697000	4699000	It ended up being cancelled.
4699000	4702000	Was it because it didn't support online very well?
4702000	4705000	Well, we don't know why the game was cancelled, ultimately.
4705000	4707000	Or because the game was just not good?
4707000	4711000	It could be because the Wii U's not tapped in online.
4711000	4713000	Or because they have a hate boner for the Wii U?
4713000	4716000	I don't know. Maybe the Wii U's didn't sell enough?
4716000	4719000	SimCity didn't have enough inertia to really justify the Wii U release?
4719000	4720000	I don't know. We'll never know.
4720000	4727000	They haven't said why it was cancelled, just that some things leaked out about that it was something that was being planned at one point.
4727000	4728000	SimCity on the Wii U.
4728000	4734000	Which, I don't know if you guys ever played SimCity 2000 on PlayStation 1.
4735000	4741000	But I think the only time SimCity really worked well was the original on the Super Nintendo.
4741000	4745000	And that's because Nintendo kind of put their own little magic on it.
4745000	4749000	You know, they did their own little thing to it to make it a little more controller friendly.
4749000	4753000	But those games really require a mouse and keyboard to really play.
4753000	4757000	However, the touchpad I think could have really made up for a lot of that.
4757000	4763000	So it's kind of too bad we'll never get to see how it could have executed on the Wii U.
4763000	4766000	Because I bet it could have been pretty good.
4766000	4768000	So, we'll never know.
4768000	4772000	But there you go. SimCity was a thing that was being working on for Wii U.
4772000	4775000	And was ultimately cancelled.
4775000	4781000	Well, not cancelled and running strong week after week after week is the classic game of the week.
4783000	4788000	Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault, take a walk down memory lane and find a game that she thinks,
4788000	4791000	Hey, you guys should be checking this out right now.
4791000	4794000	The classic game of the week.
4794000	4797000	Dark Soccer, what is this week's classic game of the week?
4797000	4804000	The classic game of the week is a game that came out on the ZX Spectrum in 1984 called Deus Ex Machina.
4805000	4811000	And I wanted to pick something on the Spectrum since we didn't get the system over here.
4811000	4815000	We've got our UK listeners today, our European listeners.
4816000	4818000	This is actually a really weird game.
4818000	4822000	Basically, it does have an amazing voice cast though.
4822000	4828000	It has Ian Drury, it has Jon Pertwee in it, as in we knew him as the Third Doctor.
4829000	4833000	Quite a few people and including the composer Mel Croucher.
4833000	4835000	The music in this game is really good too.
4835000	4842000	It's basically a game that you cover the life of a defect that grows inside of a machine.
4842000	4845000	From conception through growth, evolution and death.
4845000	4850000	And it's sort of based off the seven ages of man from As You Like It.
4851000	4853000	The game is...
4854000	4856000	It was really, I think...
4857000	4866000	Well, it got lots of great reviews, but it wasn't necessarily anything that people knew what to make of right when it came out.
4866000	4870000	It was really odd and then people didn't know how to sell it either.
4870000	4873000	So it was, at the time, only mail order direct to the public.
4874000	4878000	Pirated a whole lot and the game's now got this massive cult status.
4879000	4882000	Visually today, it's really not a lot to look at.
4882000	4885000	In 1984, this is pretty crazy go nuts.
4886000	4888000	And you start off like the level that we're looking at.
4888000	4890000	Now you follow its DNA formation.
4890000	4893000	Then you follow watching the embryo grow.
4893000	4896000	Then you follow it through childhood and everything.
4896000	4901000	And it's quite a bit out there.
4901000	4903000	Even today, it's quite a bit out there.
4903000	4910000	But I think that if this game were to be remade today, I mean, it'd probably be nothing to run it.
4910000	4912000	But it would still be one of those...
4912000	4915000	It reminds me of a lot of indie games that you see today.
4915000	4917000	So that's why I think it's really...
4917000	4921000	It's a big influential on, I think, a lot of our indie gamers.
4922000	4929000	There was a reimagining of the game in 2010 that went under Deus Ex Machina 2.
4930000	4932000	And the same director, everything.
4932000	4934000	And it had Christopher Lee as the programmer.
4935000	4937000	The main character in there.
4938000	4941000	But I don't know if they ever actually finished it.
4943000	4946000	I didn't see anything about it if it was actually finished.
4946000	4952000	But the game was listed as one of the 1,001 video games you must play before you die.
4953000	4954000	And so there you go.
4954000	4956000	It's really trippy and it seems like...
4956000	4959000	So the whole voice acting thing was like...
4959000	4963000	It wasn't because these old computers couldn't play CD quality.
4963000	4964000	It was off cassette.
4964000	4967000	So you would play this cassette while you play the game.
4967000	4968000	That's so weird.
4969000	4973000	But it's that way you get, though, the whole experience together.
4973000	4976000	So that means everything that you're actually doing in the game has to be timed.
4976000	4979000	And if I'm right, actually, I think that the game played off the cassette.
4979000	4980000	I would want to say.
4980000	4981000	Interesting.
4981000	4982000	Yeah.
4982000	4984000	What a neat little concept.
4984000	4985000	Yeah.
4985000	4989000	So, I mean, for its time, definitely innovating.
4989000	4990000	Yeah.
4990000	4991000	So that's the game I picked.
4991000	4992000	All right.
4992000	4993000	There it is.
4993000	4994000	Your classic game of the week from the Spectrum.
4994000	4995000	Deus Ex Machina.
4997000	4998000	Very obscure choice.
4998000	4999000	I like that one.
4999000	5000000	All right.
5000000	5002000	Well, that is going to do it for part A of the show.
5002000	5003000	Oh, wait.
5003000	5006000	And it's not related to the Deus Ex series.
5006000	5007000	This is completely different.
5007000	5008000	Yeah, it has nothing to do with the newer series.
5008000	5013000	Which I do recall that the reason why they couldn't call Deus Ex anything more than that
5013000	5015000	was because of copyright on this game.
5015000	5020000	Well, guys, we have to, before we actually get to our break here,
5020000	5023000	we actually have some breaking news.
5023000	5024000	This is an envy.
5024000	5025000	All right.
5025000	5026000	So let's get to.
5026000	5027000	No, it's not.
5027000	5028000	It's O-L-R.
5028000	5029000	We have some breaking news.
5029000	5032000	This is not happy breaking news, actually.
5032000	5035000	This is kind of crappy breaking news and very unfortunate.
5035000	5039000	But Ralph Baer, the father of video games known as,
5039000	5042000	he has passed away at the age of 92.
5042000	5043000	That's a good run.
5043000	5044000	Yeah, it's a great run.
5044000	5047000	So, you know, but if you don't know the name,
5047000	5051000	he actually was called the Thomas Edison of the home TV game
5051000	5054000	in Popular Electronics magazine in 1980.
5054000	5057000	And that's because he created the Odyssey,
5057000	5061000	which was really the first home video game system,
5061000	5066000	the patent being filed in 1970 and released by Magnavox in 1972.
5066000	5070000	You can thank Ralph Baer for home video game consoles.
5070000	5072000	I just don't like that they insult you.
5072000	5077000	Plus, Nolan Bushnell totally stole the idea for Pong from him.
5077000	5078000	So there it is.
5078000	5081000	It's also the first home light gun game.
5081000	5085000	An add-on for the Odyssey called Shooting Gallery was Ralph Baer's as well.
5085000	5090000	His contributions were recognized by receiving the National Medal of Technology
5090000	5094000	by then President George W. in 2000.
5094000	5098000	And then he was named President of the National Medal of Technology
5099000	5103000	by then President George W. in 2006.
5103000	5105000	Also created Simon.
5105000	5106000	Did he really?
5106000	5107000	Yep.
5107000	5108000	I did not realize that.
5108000	5110000	Yeah, the story behind that is really cool.
5110000	5115000	Atari made a game called Touch Me and Baer saw it and then made Simon.
5115000	5119000	And it was the biggest seller of 1978.
5119000	5121000	So to make up for getting Pong ripped off from him,
5121000	5125000	he quickly ripped Touch Me off from Atari.
5125000	5126000	There you go.
5126000	5127000	Well, there you go.
5127000	5130000	A tip of the hat and pouring out the 40 to Mr. Ralph Baer.
5130000	5132000	Rest in peace.
5132000	5135000	Okay, we're going to use this opportunity to take a break.
5135000	5138000	But we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5138000	5139000	Don't go anywhere.
5139000	5141000	The Fugu Question of the Week, some rapid-fire news,
5141000	5143000	your emails, of which there are a lot tonight,
5143000	5145000	Twitters and live calls.
5145000	5148000	We will still take live calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
5148000	5150000	right after this.
5157000	5160000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,
5160000	5163000	episode number 578 in progress,
5163000	5166000	live at a special time at vognetwork.com.
5166000	5169000	We're taping a little early today because Dark Sakura
5169000	5172000	and I have some plans in the Bay Area this evening.
5172000	5176000	So it's this recurring thing that's been going on for years and years.
5176000	5179000	And every year we miss it because we always do an OLR.
5179000	5183000	So we said, you know what, this year, let's do two birds with one stone.
5183000	5186000	We'll be able to make this gathering and we'll do an earlier OLR.
5186000	5189000	Because once every few months, probably actually it's more like every six months,
5189000	5192000	we like to do an earlier show just so people in different time zones
5192000	5195000	are able to participate as well because it is the show, of course,
5195000	5197000	where every gamer has a voice.
5197000	5200000	I really wish we could do a different time for everybody every week,
5200000	5203000	but unfortunately we have our own personal lives to juggle.
5203000	5204000	I'm sure you can understand.
5204000	5208000	But that's why we have the podcast, which you can check out at iTunes,
5208000	5211000	Stitcher Radio, TuneIn.
5211000	5213000	There's millions of places to check out podcasts.
5213000	5216000	You can also just listen to it directly at either orangeontradio.com
5216000	5218000	or vognetwork.com. Take a pick.
5218000	5221000	Lots of great ways to catch up with the podcast every week.
5223000	5226000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio
5226000	5229000	at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, stop.
5229000	5232000	All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.
5232000	5235000	Lots of other news going on this week. Loki.
5235000	5238000	All right. So this is kind of cool.
5238000	5242000	Some of the announcements that they're making during the PlayStation experience
5242000	5247000	included some games that are getting ported over to different platforms,
5247000	5251000	including Broken Age and Day of the Tentacle,
5251000	5255000	the special edition coming to PlayStation 4 and Vita.
5255000	5259000	So no idea what's special about the special edition for Day of the Tentacle,
5259000	5262000	but I love Day of the Tentacle, so I'll probably have to buy it.
5262000	5268000	And then they're also saying that on top of that,
5269000	5272000	Gang Beasts, I guess, is coming to PlayStation 4 as well,
5272000	5275000	which actually is a pretty fun-looking game.
5275000	5280000	And, you know, I guess, what else here?
5280000	5282000	No, that's it so far.
5282000	5285000	So, yeah, that was during their keynote that they announced those.
5285000	5286000	No timeframe.
5286000	5289000	I'm super excited for the Day of the Tentacle.
5289000	5292000	I thought of you when they announced that, actually.
5292000	5295000	I'm down, so that should be awesome.
5295000	5299000	And then, actually, the game I was trying to play during break,
5299000	5302000	but my expat or thing is not working correctly.
5302000	5308000	It's a game called I Am Bread, and it just released on Steam Early Access.
5308000	5313000	It's from Bossa Studios, who did Surgeon Simulator,
5313000	5316000	and if you want a game that just is really weird and silly,
5316000	5318000	then this is probably going to be up your alley.
5318000	5319000	I think it's 15% off right now.
5319000	5322000	I think it's like $8.99 instead of $9.99 or something.
5323000	5327000	And, basically, the premise of the game is you're a piece of bread,
5327000	5333000	and you control the bread by holding down different corners of the bread.
5333000	5334000	Kind of like QWOP.
5334000	5336000	Yeah, it's sort of like QWOP.
5336000	5339000	It's very difficult, I guess.
5339000	5344000	You get used to it, but it's difficult to control, I guess, on purpose.
5344000	5346000	But, yeah, each corner is a different key,
5346000	5350000	and then you have to kind of hold those corners down
5350000	5354000	and provide momentum using the analog stick or mouse or keyboard,
5354000	5359000	and you have to move across the room to get toasted,
5359000	5362000	and you're graded on a few different things,
5362000	5366000	including edibility and deliciousness,
5366000	5370000	and you also break things while you happen to be doing that.
5370000	5377000	So the way they put it is like a piece of bread apparently trying to toast itself,
5377000	5379000	and it's a lot of fun.
5379000	5381000	So I took it as early access.
5381000	5382000	There are issues with the game, though.
5382000	5385000	I did run into the problem, as I mentioned before,
5385000	5389000	where my gamepad doesn't work with it because it's Windows 8.1 right now,
5389000	5391000	so that doesn't work too well.
5391000	5393000	That's why I was trying to get the keypadder thing to work
5393000	5395000	so I could assign keys to it.
5395000	5397000	But I tried it with keyboard, and it works okay,
5397000	5398000	although then I got on the floor,
5398000	5400000	and my edibility started dropping really fast.
5400000	5403000	I was like, ah, I need to get to the counter,
5403000	5406000	except I'm very awkward with that game,
5406000	5408000	and so I started moving in the opposite direction.
5409000	5411000	But check it out. It's pretty cool.
5411000	5414000	And then if you're a fan of Yakuza,
5414000	5418000	and definitely there's a lot of rabid fans out there of Yakuza,
5418000	5426000	Yakuza 5 is going to be coming to North America on PlayStation 3.
5426000	5431000	Apparently they're saying that Yakuza 4 and Yakuza Dead Souls
5431000	5436000	will also be now on PlayStation Network starting this week as well.
5436000	5440000	But that's a big deal for people wanting the Yakuza series
5440000	5442000	to come over to North America.
5442000	5446000	So, pretty awesome that that's going to happen.
5447000	5452000	I bet Deakman, who is an integral part of our orangeonitrader.com website,
5452000	5455000	I could hear him fangirl screaming when they announced the Yakuza 5.
5455000	5456000	Absolutely.
5456000	5459000	There was a lot of fangirl scream moments out of that
5459000	5464000	between either Day of the Tentacle or Suikoden was another big one.
5464000	5466000	You know, Suikoden 2 is finally happening.
5467000	5469000	There's a lot of great, great moments.
5470000	5472000	Alright, moving on.
5473000	5476000	This probably isn't as scream-worthy, but it still is kind of neat.
5477000	5484000	You can get some, I guess, faceplates is what they would be for the PlayStation 4.
5484000	5487000	You can get these for $25 a pop.
5487000	5491000	The Order 1886 or LittleBigPlanet faceplates.
5491000	5493000	They're available on the Sony store right now.
5493000	5496000	And you can actually pop them on to your existing PlayStation 4.
5496000	5498000	So it's not going to change the way the entire thing looks,
5498000	5502000	but kind of like the front half, you can change how that looks.
5502000	5505000	Yeah, it looks like the part that's over the disk drive kind of on top.
5505000	5508000	You know what's funny is I actually looked at my PlayStation 4 the other day
5508000	5510000	and I'm like, wow, it's upside down.
5510000	5513000	It's on its side, but it's the wrong way.
5513000	5515000	The PlayStation logo is upside down.
5515000	5518000	I never realized that that thing could pop off so easy.
5518000	5520000	But apparently it's designed to do that,
5520000	5522000	so you can get a new faceplate and just pop that right there.
5522000	5524000	Or is that, I haven't replaced the hard drive.
5524000	5526000	Is that where the hard drive is maybe?
5526000	5528000	Oh, maybe. That could be it.
5528000	5531000	So PlayStation 4 faceplates are a thing.
5531000	5533000	That'll be happening.
5533000	5534000	This is neat.
5534000	5539000	Deep Silver is going to be auctioning off the real life Saints Row Genki Mobile,
5539000	5542000	which there's a little picture of it circulating around the internet.
5542000	5544000	And it's available on eBay.
5544000	5550000	And it was starting at $7,500 even though this vehicle has 80,000 miles on it.
5550000	5553000	I don't know who the hell would drive this out in public.
5553000	5556000	I'm not entirely sure it's street legal either.
5556000	5560000	Yeah, so this might just be something you aim at your neighbor's house.
5560000	5562000	I don't know what the practical purposes would be.
5562000	5565000	The cool thing though is that cannon in the back actually does work.
5565000	5567000	It fires t-shirts, right?
5567000	5570000	Yes. I would fire tons of t-shirts.
5570000	5572000	Things like that have been done before.
5572000	5575000	Well, so here's the thing. It started at $7,500.
5575000	5579000	It's up now to $7,700.
5579000	5581000	You got like one or two people interested.
5581000	5585000	Three bids so far actually. Three bids on this so far.
5585000	5588000	I would like to know what the hell somebody's going to do with this.
5588000	5593000	But if you would like to get in on this, it's going to end Saturday at 9 a.m.
5593000	5595000	So you still have a good five days.
5595000	5599000	So podcast listeners, if you have $7,000 or $8,000 sitting around,
5599000	5601000	send it to us here at Orange Tons Radio.
5601000	5606000	We will make better use of it than buying a t-shirt cannon.
5606000	5608000	It worked better when Gorillaz did it.
5609000	5613000	If you're a real big Saints Row fan that you're ruling to drop $8,000,
5613000	5617000	if you were ruling to drop $8,000 on the GameCube mobile,
5617000	5623000	just save that and you could drop a significant less portion of that
5623000	5628000	on a bunch of the shoes, the clothing, all that shit, the games,
5628000	5631000	and still have several thousand dollars left over.
5631000	5633000	Yeah, you could go to Party City on an $800 budget
5633000	5635000	and probably decorate your own pickup truck and all that.
5635000	5637000	Yeah, I was going to say, you can DIY that.
5638000	5641000	In fact, you know, maybe for like $1,000,
5641000	5643000	OLR will come out and decorate your vehicle.
5643000	5646000	Nope, nope. I won't come out for $1,000.
5647000	5648000	All right.
5649000	5652000	As long as you can cover the travel as well.
5652000	5657000	Anyhow, Sony Santa Monica Studio announced some things
5657000	5661000	that they are preparing at the PlayStation Keynote the other day,
5661000	5664000	including Fat Princess Adventures, which, you know,
5664000	5666000	if you're into Diablo, Gauntlet, that type of stuff,
5666000	5669000	Fat Princess Adventures looks very similar to that sort of thing.
5669000	5674000	Whatom was a game that they showed that really made no sense at all.
5674000	5677000	But when you consider that it's coming from Keita Takahashi,
5677000	5681000	that's right, the creator of Katamari and Noby Noby Boy,
5681000	5683000	then it makes sense why it did make sense.
5683000	5687000	Which, by the way, was it just me or was he drunk when he was on stage?
5687000	5688000	Because there's this gif around.
5688000	5690000	I noticed this too when it was happening live.
5690000	5694000	He's like literally stumbling around in a circle while he's on stage
5694000	5696000	trying to watch what's going on.
5696000	5698000	It's very... I hope he's all right.
5698000	5699000	You know what?
5699000	5701000	I hope he was just really nervous.
5701000	5703000	Can you imagine a Katamari game, though,
5703000	5706000	with the amount of particles that the PlayStation 4 can handle?
5706000	5707000	I know, right?
5707000	5710000	He's probably not interested in revisiting it, but...
5710000	5712000	I don't care if he's interested.
5712000	5713000	Goddamn it, make me another one.
5713000	5718000	And again, that series really has never been as good as the original.
5718000	5719000	Anyway...
5719000	5722000	Or make another strange game like Noby Noby Boy,
5722000	5723000	where you eat your own butt.
5723000	5732000	I actually was still playing Noby Noby Boy on my phone for, like, years.
5732000	5736000	Now, did you notice, though, that Wadam is kind of one of those names
5736000	5738000	that is the same if you flip it upside down?
5738000	5741000	So I wonder if that's kind of the gist of the game.
5741000	5743000	What's the word? A palindrome?
5743000	5746000	Yeah, because the M, if you flip it upside down, is a W.
5746000	5748000	So if you flip that word...
5748000	5749000	Oh, yeah.
5749000	5750000	It's like the same thing.
5750000	5752000	So kind of a double whammy.
5752000	5755000	Yeah, maybe there's a meaning in there somewhere.
5755000	5757000	I don't know. Who knows?
5757000	5759000	Anyway, another strange trailer that they showed,
5759000	5762000	What Remains of Edith Finch.
5762000	5765000	There's a bunch of short stories around a cursed family.
5765000	5769000	The trailer was very ambient and kind of horror film-ish.
5769000	5773000	So I like, though, that there's all these kind of, like, original ideas coming out.
5773000	5777000	We're not just talking, like, you know, here's, you know,
5777000	5779000	part seven of this ongoing series.
5779000	5781000	I mean, there's room in the world for those games, too.
5781000	5783000	There's ongoing series called Final Fantasy.
5783000	5785000	Yeah, right?
5785000	5787000	I mean, there's room in the world for those games, too,
5787000	5789000	but I like that we're seeing a lot of new concepts, as well.
5789000	5793000	So we'll see more about these games at a future date, I'm sure.
5793000	5795000	Some people, I think, play in this stuff at the Expo.
5795000	5798000	I wish we had had somebody lined up to call into the show today,
5798000	5800000	because the Expo's going on right now.
5800000	5801000	Somebody could have called in, but...
5801000	5802000	We had some people going, too.
5802000	5804000	I only know, like, one listener out there,
5804000	5806000	and a friend of mine on Twitter's out there, too,
5806000	5807000	but they're probably playing games.
5807000	5809000	They don't want to stop for 20 minutes to talk to us.
5809000	5810000	I understand.
5810000	5812000	I don't take it personally.
5812000	5813000	Very hard.
5813000	5815000	DarkSakura.
5815000	5817000	Well, there's one thing that we like.
5817000	5818000	It's SNK.
5818000	5820000	Whoo!
5820000	5824000	So they are going to be bringing more games from the EOGO catalog
5824000	5826000	to the PlayStation Network,
5826000	5832000	starting off with Metal Slug 3 for PS4, PS3, and PS Vita.
5832000	5835000	It's also the upgraded version, like we saw on Steam,
5835000	5838000	with the online multiplayer and leaderboard, whatever.
5838000	5842000	And then they are polling fans to see what we want next.
5842000	5846000	So the 15 candidates we've seen...
5846000	5847000	Twin Star Sprite...
5847000	5849000	Twiggle Star Sprite, sorry.
5849000	5851000	Neo Turf Master, Sengoku 3,
5851000	5853000	Gairo, Mark of the Wolves,
5853000	5856000	Samurai Shadow on 5 Special, and Last Blade II.
5856000	5859000	My vote would be for Last Blade II, because that game's fun.
5859000	5861000	So, good on that.
5861000	5863000	We also have The Legend of Zelda,
5863000	5865000	Symphony of the Goddesses,
5865000	5869000	is on the Master Quest Tour in 2015,
5869000	5874000	meaning that they're going to be going on a worldwide tour to play Zelda music.
5874000	5880000	And it's done to celebrate the upcoming release of Majora's Mask on the 3DS.
5880000	5883000	They're going to be...
5883000	5888000	It looks like just a handful of locations on this tour.
5888000	5891000	It kind of looks like it is really whirlwind.
5891000	5894000	Nothing really near us, but we've got a few Canadian ones.
5894000	5896000	We have a few...
5896000	5899000	We have also just a few over in Europe,
5899000	5904000	and we have one in Hawaii, one in Tokyo.
5904000	5907000	Who did none near us? Because I would have wanted to go.
5907000	5911000	Couldn't be bothered to roll through San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose,
5911000	5913000	I don't know, Silicon Valley.
5913000	5917000	I don't see any in California. That's what I was looking over.
5917000	5919000	So I guess we have to go to Texas.
5919000	5920000	No, thank you.
5920000	5922000	No, thank you. Not on purpose.
5922000	5924000	I could go visit Travis, give him some shit.
5924000	5925000	Let's just go to Toronto.
5925000	5926000	All right. That'll work.
5926000	5928000	Oh, the Video Game Realness guys are out in Toronto.
5928000	5930000	We could go to Montreal.
5930000	5931000	That's right. All right.
5931000	5937000	So anyway, last but not least, we have Shovel Knight News.
5937000	5938000	Yay, Shovel Knight.
5938000	5941000	It sold 300,000 copies.
5941000	5948000	Yay. Not bad for kind of a quiet little game there, right?
5948000	5952000	But Shovel Knight's fun, and it's one of the Kickstarter games,
5952000	5958000	and it's Kickstarter made four times what they asked for,
5958000	5965000	which ended up being a total of $311,000.
5965000	5967000	So not bad.
5967000	5968000	Not bad at all.
5968000	5971000	Did you see the little bit out of the PlayStation experience where...
5971000	5973000	I haven't touched our PlayStation anything in ages.
5973000	5974000	No, no, no, no.
5974000	5976000	On the announcements that came out the past couple days,
5976000	5978000	well, Shovel Knight's coming to PlayStation was the big thing,
5978000	5982000	and they're doing an extra stage or something because Kratos is a boss in it now.
5982000	5984000	So that'll be interesting.
5984000	5985000	Interesting.
5985000	5986000	Yeah.
5986000	5987000	That's a good word for it. Interesting.
5987000	5989000	Yes. So we'll see how that plays out.
5989000	5993000	Also interesting, every week, you guys lend your voices to the show
5993000	5997000	in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.
5998000	6000000	Thanks, Mario.
6005000	6007000	We go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
6007000	6009000	You throw those words together, you get Fugal.
6009000	6012000	And every week we ask a question of our communities,
6012000	6015000	and we read our favorite answers here on the show.
6015000	6018000	And tonight our question was all about the Game Awards
6018000	6020000	because we were curious, you know?
6020000	6022000	Did you guys watch it? Did you check it out?
6022000	6025000	So our question was, did you watch them?
6025000	6027000	And if you did, what did you think they did well,
6027000	6029000	and what do you think they could do better?
6029000	6033000	And if you didn't watch, what's something they could do to get you to watch?
6033000	6037000	Fabrice starts us off over on the Facebooks saying,
6037000	6042000	Didn't watch. I wasn't very interested in another top three show that drags along.
6042000	6044000	It did drag a little bit.
6044000	6046000	I'm not sure how they could super tighten it up,
6046000	6049000	but it did drag a little bit, so I don't blame you.
6049000	6051000	But you can watch The Highways on YouTube, I guess.
6051000	6053000	Andy R. said, Didn't watch.
6053000	6057000	I was driving to the PlayStation Experience during that time.
6057000	6060000	Good enough excuse, I suppose.
6060000	6064000	LowCatFrog responds and says, I don't watch award shows.
6064000	6066000	Even this one I would not have watched.
6066000	6069000	Everything I watched is streamed, no TV.
6069000	6071000	Well, LowCatFrog may not have got the memo.
6071000	6072000	This actually wasn't on TV.
6072000	6074000	This was something that was only available on streaming,
6074000	6077000	so somehow you missed it. I don't know.
6077000	6080000	Fifth Dream. Okay, now we've got somebody who did watch them
6080000	6082000	because Fifth Dream says I did watch them, and I was actually pretty impressed.
6082000	6085000	So many award shows are just embarrassing, but this one wasn't.
6085000	6088000	It had a nice mix of industry people, world premiere footage,
6088000	6090000	and musical performances.
6090000	6092000	It wasn't without hiccups, but they were pretty minor.
6092000	6095000	The industry icon award being presented to Roberta and Ken Williams
6095000	6096000	is a pretty great moment.
6096000	6098000	Overall, I actually enjoyed the show.
6098000	6102000	And Red The Haze says, I watched while I played a game on my Vita.
6102000	6104000	It was definitely a step in the right direction.
6104000	6106000	It did have a lot of awkward moments,
6106000	6108000	but it wasn't as bad as the older Spike VGAs
6108000	6111000	that were targeting non-gaming audiences.
6111000	6115000	I think those comments last two really sum it up for me as well
6115000	6118000	because, you know, I think it was a step in the right direction.
6118000	6120000	I think it's a very good way of putting it.
6120000	6123000	But let's go over to our Google Plus page
6123000	6126000	because we have some comments there as well.
6126000	6131000	And over on Google Plus, we have
6131000	6134000	At Deft replies and says, I watched later that night,
6134000	6136000	and the tribute to Ken and Roberta Williams
6136000	6138000	was probably the best thing about the whole thing,
6138000	6140000	and the music segments were spectacular.
6140000	6142000	The whole ceremony has lots of room for improvement,
6142000	6144000	both in presentation and technical stuff,
6144000	6145000	but overall it was enjoyable.
6145000	6148000	I could probably do with less advertising from publishers
6148000	6152000	and more actual recognition to the industry as it deserves.
6152000	6154000	Redtertainment says, I didn't watch them,
6154000	6157000	but I find it hard to watch things on the internet while I'm at work.
6157000	6160000	I've heard general mocking of the game awards,
6160000	6163000	but as we all know, gamershateeverything.com.
6163000	6165000	If I could change anything, I would change the fact
6165000	6169000	that I couldn't easily watch it on my TV after the fact.
6169000	6171000	Perhaps being able to download the show on iTunes
6171000	6174000	or watch via streaming like Hulu or Netflix.
6174000	6177000	And then Alicia L. follows that up over on Google Plus saying,
6177000	6179000	yes, put it on Netflix.
6179000	6181000	So some people wanting to have a little more on demand.
6181000	6185000	I believe it is on YouTube, but I know YouTube...
6185000	6186000	It is on YouTube.
6186000	6188000	It is on YouTube, but that...
6188000	6190000	I mean, YouTube is and isn't accessible
6190000	6193000	depending on where you're at and what device you're carrying, so...
6193000	6196000	But that's how I watched the hour that I missed at the end there,
6196000	6199000	and the ultra important Ken and Roberta Williams tribute,
6199000	6201000	which is really the thing you most need to see.
6201000	6205000	And to be fair, wouldn't that be hashtag gamershateeverything these days?
6205000	6207000	No, there's actually a website that Bobby registered some time ago
6207000	6209000	called gamershateeverything.com,
6209000	6212000	and you go to it and it says, do gamers hate everything?
6212000	6213000	Yes.
6213000	6214000	There it is.
6214000	6215000	There you go.
6215000	6216000	That's it.
6216000	6217000	Just like the whole...
6217000	6219000	They do that type of website for everything.
6219000	6221000	There's, you know...
6221000	6222000	Is Half-Life 3 out yet?
6222000	6223000	Is Half-Life 3 out yet?
6223000	6225000	You know, is there a Steam sale?
6225000	6226000	Things like that.
6226000	6230000	So anyway, let's move on with some more news.
6230000	6231000	Loki.
6231000	6232000	Alright.
6232000	6238000	So, you know, definitely there's at least some love from Sony for the Vita,
6238000	6244000	and they're kind of trying to show that with more releases coming to it.
6244000	6249000	And so, some big name games are actually scheduled to be coming that way,
6249000	6252000	including the Banner Saga, which is pretty awesome,
6252000	6254000	Suicoden 1 and 2,
6254000	6258000	Super Time Force Ultra,
6258000	6261000	Towerfall Ascension,
6261000	6264000	Octodad, The Dadliest Catch,
6264000	6266000	Resident Evil Revelations 2,
6266000	6268000	and more.
6268000	6276000	So they're saying also that, I guess, they've already got ports of Geometry Wars Dimensions and Bastion
6276000	6278000	coming to the Vita as well,
6278000	6280000	but at least they're going to be supporting with more games.
6281000	6286000	And Resident Evil Revelations, that's supposed to be coming out spring of 2015.
6286000	6288000	So, not bad.
6291000	6295000	Yo, it was nice to see the Vita getting a little bit of attention.
6295000	6299000	I wonder how the Vita TV's doing, or that PlayStation TV's doing.
6299000	6302000	I'm curious as well, because it was very curious.
6302000	6305000	There were some things in that Sony event that they didn't talk about.
6305000	6309000	I mean, granted, the thing kind of started to go on a little long anyway,
6309000	6315000	and for me, overall, the last 30 minutes really lost steam compared to the first hour 30 minutes.
6315000	6317000	So, they needed to end it.
6317000	6320000	But there were some things they didn't really talk about at all, and that Vita TV is one of them.
6320000	6324000	Like, they didn't mention it, the whole keynote, and I really thought that was an extra chance.
6324000	6326000	Maybe it's just not doing that well. I don't know.
6326000	6327000	I don't know.
6327000	6330000	Maybe they'd rather you buy the regular Vita.
6330000	6334000	The other thing that surprised me, PlayStation Now was not talked about at all.
6334000	6337000	You know, that thing that's been in beta for a year or whatever,
6337000	6341000	they didn't really give any updates or any announcements that, oh, more games...
6341000	6343000	It's only been like a few months.
6343000	6346000	It feels like it's been longer. I think it's only been public a few months.
6346000	6347000	No, maybe.
6347000	6352000	Because they were giving away the codes at E3, and even before that, it was something that some people had.
6352000	6356000	Because before it was on the PS4, I think it was on the PS3?
6356000	6357000	Yeah.
6357000	6360000	Yeah, I mean, it's been testing for a while.
6360000	6363000	So, I'm surprised there were no updates on that either.
6363000	6368000	But I'm happy to see that, you know, for people that invested in the Vita, or will be investing in the Vita TV,
6368000	6373000	and maybe that's why it's time to talk about it, they are showing, like, here's how we're going to support it.
6373000	6376000	Not a lot of exclusives.
6376000	6380000	I mean, there was a couple in there, but, you know, all right.
6380000	6384000	At least as an alternative in portable gaming.
6384000	6392000	Well, for people that don't own a PlayStation or an Xbox, maybe you finally are checking out Final Fantasy XIII on the PC.
6392000	6399000	Or maybe you checked out Final Fantasy XIII on the PC with the assumption that, oh, it would run better, it would look better.
6399000	6403000	And then we're shocked to find out that, oh, the graphics are locked down.
6403000	6411000	You can play either in full screen 720p, or you can play in a window that is not going to take up the whole size of your desktop.
6411000	6415000	And many people were really pissed off with the limited graphic options in the game.
6415000	6417000	Well, some good news.
6417000	6421000	Square Enix has posted an announcement on their forums over on Steam saying,
6421000	6425000	the Final Fantasy XIII team has been working hard to improve your experience on Steam.
6425000	6437000	We're happy to announce that custom resolutions, 720p, 1080p, and graphic options will be added into the game from December 11th will be the date of that patch.
6437000	6441000	Except they've already been hacked into the game by other people, but now they're just doing it officially.
6441000	6442000	Now it's just official.
6442000	6450000	And this is very interesting, because I can't think of many times in gaming's history where we've talked about now being patched into our game.
6450000	6452000	Graphic options.
6454000	6458000	The graphics are literally being patched in after the fact.
6459000	6461000	You don't hear that a lot these days.
6461000	6462000	We're now giving the option to change the resolution.
6462000	6463000	What's that?
6463000	6465000	We're now giving the option to change the resolution.
6465000	6471000	Oh my gosh, I can't believe it didn't handle full screen windowed like Final Fantasy XIV does.
6471000	6474000	It's like there's other Square Enix games that'll do it.
6474000	6476000	But it's because it's just an emulator or something.
6479000	6483000	I think it's a fast and easy port is what they're doing, clearly.
6483000	6485000	You don't say!
6485000	6488000	A fast and easy port of a Final Fantasy game!
6488000	6494000	Like, I don't know, a Final Fantasy game that we might be heading towards the Playstation 4.
6494000	6498000	You don't say that they do fast and easy ports of their Final Fantasy games.
6498000	6500000	That's shocking to hear.
6500000	6505000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, Square Enix late to the party with PC standard settings.
6505000	6508000	Quote, sorry, here are the doors for your car.
6508000	6512000	That's kind of what Final Fantasy XIII is missing right now on PC.
6512000	6513000	It's kind of unfortunate.
6513000	6516000	I won't buy XIII II or Lightning Return.
6516000	6521000	They are making literally the least amount of effort possible to do this stuff.
6521000	6524000	Well, you know what, though? It did finally bite him in the ass.
6524000	6527000	Because a lot of people complained about this in a lot of negative Steam reviews.
6527000	6529000	They were really pressured to fix this shit.
6529000	6531000	I'm glad they're doing it.
6531000	6535000	I hope they're pressured to make a remake of Final Fantasy VII that's not a port of the old PC version.
6535000	6540000	I can understand that a little more, though, because there's a difference there, Loki.
6540000	6546000	Because this XIII, we're saying, is admittedly a Playstation 3 emulator that Square's running their own internally.
6547000	6552000	It may not literally be a Sony Playstation 3 emulator, but it's able to use the same code.
6552000	6554000	It's a fast and lazy port, right?
6554000	6556000	That's what they're doing over here.
6556000	6560000	But to give you the Final Fantasy VII you want, that's not going to be a fast and lazy port.
6560000	6563000	They're going to have to go back and redo all of the textures in the game.
6563000	6565000	You know, it's different.
6565000	6569000	Well, I feel so bad for them then.
6569000	6572000	As they're rolling around in their pools of money.
6573000	6578000	If only we had 3D models of the Final Fantasy characters that were in high resolution.
6578000	6581000	You know, something that might be considered movie quality.
6581000	6588000	If only we had made a movie with Final Fantasy VII characters in several locations that were featured in Final Fantasy VII.
6588000	6592000	Hmm. That would be very convenient for us to make a game out of.
6592000	6596000	Or perhaps we use similar models to, I don't know, make some Vita games.
6596000	6599000	Or not Vita games, Playstation Portable games.
6600000	6601000	You know.
6601000	6605000	Or maybe everybody just moves the fuck on and lets Final Fantasy VII go.
6605000	6607000	Because it was okay to start with.
6607000	6609000	But it wasn't that great.
6609000	6611000	We don't listen to Dan for a reason.
6612000	6614000	You know it wasn't that great.
6615000	6616000	It was that great.
6616000	6619000	Oh yeah, you loved Eris. I remember that. That was like one of your favorite characters ever, right?
6619000	6621000	I'm going to stab that bitch in the face again.
6624000	6625000	Alright.
6625000	6627000	In the face.
6627000	6630000	You know, Jaime, I think you need to let it go.
6630000	6633000	Let it go, let it go.
6633000	6635000	That's what I was saying.
6635000	6637000	You know, it didn't make the show roll tonight.
6637000	6644000	But they did register, was it, they have the rating or whatever in Europe for the Sing Star or Frozen.
6644000	6647000	That did make it into the show roll and that was my story.
6647000	6648000	Oh, I'm sorry.
6648000	6652000	I was helping Jaime out there with a transition, Loki.
6652000	6653000	God dammit.
6653000	6654000	Read the show roll.
6654000	6656000	Nah, I don't want to.
6656000	6659000	Alright, well I don't need to talk about it then. Oh well.
6659000	6660000	Sing Star or Frozen. There we go.
6660000	6664000	Don't throw a fit. What else? There's got to be more to it than that.
6664000	6666000	It just has a rating out for it.
6666000	6670000	It says it's going to be published by Sony on the PS3.
6670000	6673000	And that it's going to have all the songs from Frozen in it.
6673000	6679000	And basically they confirmed that yes, it's going to be out and a complete PS4 version as well.
6679000	6682000	But they don't have any other information on it.
6682000	6684000	It's not out yet and I already hate it.
6684000	6688000	Frozen is getting as annoying as Final Fantasy 7. It's just taken 17 less years to do it.
6688000	6693000	But that's okay though. They're going to make as many sequels as Final Fantasy 7 received for Frozen as well.
6693000	6695000	Yeah, they already are working on the sequel.
6697000	6700000	Frozen 2. Re-frozen.
6700000	6702000	It's not just the whole...
6702000	6704000	She won't let it go.
6704000	6707000	Like, did you hear about Disneyland? They're finally getting rid of the Mad Tea Party.
6707000	6709000	Which, you know, good riddance.
6709000	6713000	But they're not bringing it back for, or they're not doing it to bring back Electronica.
6713000	6715000	They're going to do a Frozen party.
6715000	6719000	They're turning the Muppet 3D theater into a Frozen sing-a-long theater.
6719000	6721000	And there's all this like, it's like, okay...
6721000	6723000	Oh, you mean the dance thing?
6723000	6725000	I thought you were talking about the teacups. I was like, fuck you!
6725000	6727000	No, no, no, no, no. The dance thing.
6727000	6730000	No, no, it's just like, enough! Enough! Frozen!
6730000	6736000	What about Brave? What about Big Hero 6? What about any other movie you've released?
6736000	6738000	Have you seen the licensing for Frozen?
6738000	6740000	Yeah, no, they ain't getting rid of that shit any time soon.
6740000	6745000	Or why are you making like, a Toy Story 4, when you could be making an Incredibles 2?
6745000	6746000	I mean, seriously.
6746000	6747000	They are making an Incredibles 2.
6747000	6750000	I know, but it's not coming quick enough!
6750000	6755000	Instead, I get another Toy Story, which I don't fucking want to see another Toy Story.
6755000	6757000	Toy Story's awesome! What the fuck is your problem?
6757000	6759000	This is what surprises me, though, about this whole thing.
6759000	6762000	SingStar is that, you know, Sony, Siri...
6762000	6764000	Wait, Disney has their own game development thing.
6764000	6766000	Why did they license it over to Sony?
6766000	6768000	Because they don't want to do it anymore.
6768000	6769000	They don't want to do their own...
6769000	6771000	Disney didn't have a game development thing anymore.
6771000	6775000	They sort of do, but they don't want to deal with it anymore.
6775000	6780000	I can't remember, I'm thinking maybe LucasArts here, that they only want to do licensing now, but...
6780000	6781000	I was like, somebody's making...
6781000	6782000	And that's good, because...
6782000	6787000	But I don't think Disney's SingIt did really well for them, so they probably don't want to continue on it.
6787000	6792000	That they'd rather just, once again, license out the stuff to someone else that wants to do it, and just get paid the...
6792000	6796000	So, if it bombs, who cares? We got our licensing fee, so whatever.
6796000	6802000	And Disney does have something, because, yeah, there's that Star Wars iPhone game that Disney made that's doing very well, and Disney Infinity.
6802000	6809000	But I think there was one branch of Disney, the studio that made Split Second and so forth, I think that is what you're thinking of.
6809000	6811000	But Disney's real big.
6811000	6813000	Black Rock Studios, I think, remember?
6813000	6814000	Yeah.
6814000	6819000	They brought out a bunch of developers and closed them and dismantled them and ruined them.
6819000	6823000	I didn't know Disney was still in the games business. At least I was hoping they weren't.
6823000	6825000	They're in the Disney Infinity business.
6825000	6829000	And then, of course, iPhone and Android is a good fit for the Disney stuff.
6829000	6831000	But, yeah.
6831000	6835000	SingStar, though, I don't know if you've checked it out, but now you don't need microphones to play SingStar anymore.
6835000	6839000	I don't know if you know that. It's free on PlayStation 4, I think.
6839000	6841000	That's just called singing.
6841000	6846000	Yeah, you don't need a microphone anymore, because you download an app to your smartphone.
6846000	6850000	And through the network, the smartphone sends the scoring over to the device.
6850000	6857000	It actually works out stupid well. I've actually downloaded it and sang some songs.
6857000	6859000	And, of course, it was ABBA.
6859000	6868000	No, because, okay, rant time. You can't import the stuff that you have on disc onto the PlayStation 4 versions.
6868000	6871000	So my SingStar Queen and SingStar ABBA are worthless.
6871000	6878000	But the other stuff that I downloaded, I don't know who did it, but I somehow have three Britney Spears songs
6878000	6880000	and two Spice Girls songs on my SingStar library.
6880000	6882000	So I was able to download those to my PlayStation 4.
6882000	6884000	Well, that list of suspects is pretty short.
6884000	6891000	And via my cell phone, you know, it was your wife that made me download Whitney Houston songs, by the way.
6891000	6894000	Well, don't give in to her demands.
6894000	6896000	So I can sing into my phone,
6896000	6899000	The greatest love
6899000	6901000	Yeah, I can sing into my phone.
6901000	6903000	And he was holding the phone up to his face when he did that.
6903000	6905000	That's right, because that's how it works.
6905000	6907000	And then it scores me, and I fail.
6907000	6909000	Never get trophies, and then rage quit the game.
6909000	6911000	Well, you can also play Just Dance for free that way, too.
6911000	6913000	Yeah.
6913000	6915000	But why would you?
6915000	6917000	Why would you?
6917000	6919000	Yeah, to your point, it is just singing.
6919000	6924000	It's like on these cable and satellite networks they have,
6924000	6929000	Hey, we have hundreds of channels that are garbage, but some of them are karaoke.
6929000	6934000	And you can pull up karaoke songs on demand and sing to them.
6935000	6937000	For free.
6937000	6939000	Let's move on with some more news, Loki.
6939000	6944000	Alright, so PlayStation 20th anniversary.
6944000	6952000	So now it's time to release a slightly different color, PlayStation 4, and charge more for it than we could for any other color.
6952000	6959000	That's right, the 20th anniversary PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Grey, or whatever the hell they're going to call it.
6959000	6962000	They're making 12,300 of these because it's such a random number.
6963000	6971000	And you can buy one for $500 pre-orders now, and it includes also a grey camera and DualShock 4.
6971000	6976000	But you're paying $500 for a system that's actually $400, so you're an idiot.
6976000	6983000	Here's the deal. I would actually buy that if, when you start it up, it makes the PS1 noise.
6983000	6985000	That would be pretty awesome.
6985000	6987000	That would be fucking amazing.
6987000	6989000	Well, there's that theme.
6989000	6991000	Don't well me. I'll kill you.
6991000	6993000	PlayStation 4, well, Dan.
6993000	6996000	Well, Dan. Dan, food.
6996000	7001000	Actually, for the last two weeks, it's been like, Dan, computer. Dan, computer.
7001000	7004000	Dan, PlayStation.
7004000	7010000	And on the PlayStation 4, they have that free theme, the PS1 classic theme, and it does play the classic boot up.
7010000	7013000	So when you turn it on, it does that. See, that would be just about worth it.
7013000	7015000	There you go. You saved yourself $500.
7015000	7017000	I don't have a PlayStation 4.
7017000	7018000	Well, that's $100.
7018000	7020000	You can download that to any PlayStation 4.
7020000	7024000	So far, I've saved myself $400.
7024000	7029000	Yeah, but wait a minute, because Jamie's got a new laptop, so you didn't save that much money.
7029000	7032000	Discount.
7032000	7036000	Oh, and here's a quick update in case you were interested in purchasing one.
7036000	7037000	It's sold out.
7037000	7038000	It's sold out.
7038000	7040000	It's sold out in like two seconds.
7040000	7041000	Mel got one.
7041000	7043000	Two seconds or 12 hours.
7043000	7044000	It took that long.
7044000	7047000	And it has like the little, it has the original logo on it too.
7047000	7048000	It does.
7048000	7052000	So people were having issues, like their servers were crapping out.
7052000	7056000	I don't doubt that people are going to scalp these, but whatever.
7056000	7057000	I don't remember.
7057000	7058000	You're, I don't know.
7058000	7063000	They should have acquired your gamertag or something to at least filter some of these people that scalp.
7063000	7066000	They should not make them limited.
7066000	7068000	That's a great idea too.
7068000	7070000	Just sell as many as people are going to buy.
7070000	7071000	That's a great idea.
7071000	7074000	What, are you allergic to money or something?
7075000	7080000	Especially if you consider that if all the sales stuff we're hearing out of black Friday's to be believed,
7080000	7083000	Xbox one's outselling PlayStation this holiday.
7083000	7086000	And it should include a copy of Ridge Racer.
7086000	7088000	Ridge Racer.
7088000	7091000	I'm telling you, they put out a decent Ridge Racer game on PlayStation four.
7091000	7092000	I'd buy it.
7092000	7094000	They could have thrown in like Vib ribbon.
7094000	7097000	Like I'm trying to think of the PS one stuff they've actually put on PS four right now.
7097000	7098000	Oh no.
7098000	7101000	That's supposed to be on PS four, but not yet.
7101000	7102000	I don't know.
7102000	7105000	I guess they don't have PS one games playable on PlayStation four.
7105000	7107000	Delicious irony.
7107000	7108000	Delicious irony.
7108000	7111000	I can play them on my PlayStation three.
7111000	7116000	They still don't have that PlayStation one technology emulating on the PlayStation for you.
7116000	7117000	Crazy stuff.
7117000	7118000	All right.
7118000	7122000	Well, here's something you'll be able to play on your PlayStation four, whether it be 20th anniversary or not.
7122000	7124000	Eventually it's Kingdom Hearts.
7124000	7126000	Is that Mickey Mouse holding a lightsaber?
7126000	7130000	It is Mickey Mouse holding a lightsaber in this little picture, but that's not, that is not a.
7131000	7135000	I want to say that's probably Disney infinity, so don't go crazy now.
7135000	7136000	It probably is.
7136000	7143000	Cause if you unlock, if you unlock all the characters or I'm sorry, purchase all the characters, then you get a lightsaber.
7143000	7144000	Yeah.
7144000	7145000	Anyway, that's all of the money.
7145000	7147000	This is about Kingdom Hearts three.
7147000	7155000	And here we go again with some wank going around that Kingdom Hearts three will be including star Wars and Marvel characters.
7156000	7159000	This is because of some statements that was made by the co-director of the game.
7159000	7166000	Tai Yasue who said, quote, yeah, I can't go into specifics, but there's a lot of new Disney stuff and we have our plates full.
7166000	7167000	There's a lot to consider.
7167000	7171000	We're looking at all of Disney, the new ones as well.
7171000	7173000	They have a lot of pull and drop.
7173000	7178000	It's like, I can't go into details, but motherfucking star Wars and captain America are going to be in this shit.
7178000	7180000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7180000	7181000	That means fucking frozen.
7181000	7184000	There's going to be fucking frozen in Kingdom Hearts three.
7184000	7185000	That's what it means.
7185000	7191000	Sorry to burst your bubble people, but frozen yet again, we'll be coming to Kingdom Hearts three.
7191000	7193000	I don't really have a problem with that.
7193000	7197000	Because I want to see Sora run around in Lederhosen.
7197000	7201000	So are we going to have like the gummy ship taking on TIE fighters and shit like that?
7201000	7203000	Because that would actually be excellent.
7203000	7204000	No, because that's what people want.
7204000	7205000	Oh yeah.
7205000	7209000	So is there going to be a lazy port of a PC version that they're going to do for this?
7209000	7210000	No, no.
7210000	7212000	That'll be the final fantasy level.
7212000	7216000	I think Kingdom Hearts three will be pretty awesome, but see, he didn't say anything about Marvel and all that stuff.
7216000	7219000	I think that meant frozen.
7219000	7223000	That's what I take it to mean is that it's like frozen and maybe the Pixar stuff.
7223000	7225000	I think the Pixar stuff would be awesome.
7225000	7226000	Wally.
7226000	7227000	Why not?
7227000	7228000	But you're not even the main character.
7228000	7230000	The main character is Sora.
7230000	7231000	Toy story or the incredible-
7231000	7233000	That was last week.
7233000	7234000	Just up.
7234000	7237000	It'll be just a world where you cry for 30 minutes through the whole thing.
7237000	7239000	It'll be great.
7239000	7240000	So there you go.
7240000	7242000	More wank about Marvel and Star Wars.
7242000	7245000	More wank dies and everyone's depressed.
7245000	7246000	Don't get me wrong.
7246000	7253000	I would love that if it would come out to the PlayStation four in Kingdom Hearts three.
7253000	7254000	I just don't really see that happening.
7254000	7255000	That's all.
7255000	7256000	All right.
7256000	7259000	Let us go to our next segment, which I believe is the mailbag.
7259000	7267000	And every week Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag and dives in head first and tries not to drown in there with all the emails.
7267000	7270000	But she's going to pick out a few emails that she believes are worthy of reading on air tonight.
7270000	7275000	If you want to send us an email, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do that.
7275000	7277000	Dark Sakura, what is awaiting us in the mailbag tonight?
7277000	7280000	My first email comes from Robert M.
7280000	7283000	And it says Minecraft VoG server.
7283000	7287000	I admit I'm entirely guilty of being inactive on the server.
7287000	7290000	But I hope one factor doesn't enter into the decision to close it.
7290000	7300000	When 1.8 launched, all one got when seeing the VoG server on their list was a big red X and alert that the version of craft bucket being used is no longer compatible.
7300000	7303000	Hence the most recent inactivity.
7303000	7309000	Of course, the cost of updating everything to chase the game's updates isn't worth it for the rest of the population you have been getting.
7309000	7311000	I fully respect the decision.
7311000	7313000	I just wish there had been a survival server.
7313000	7315000	Fun fact.
7315000	7319000	All Minecraft mobs, including villagers, are basically gender neutral.
7319000	7321000	Also, mushrooms.
7349000	7351000	I just feel like I'm wasting my time.
7351000	7353000	Don't inherit the job.
7353000	7359000	No, it's just I want it to be on another server.
7359000	7364000	They have, for example, I think it's PC Gamer or something like that.
7364000	7366000	They have their entire website has a server.
7366000	7369000	And there's a ton of people on there because there's a ton of people to go there.
7369000	7374000	And it's a lot easier to, you're always going to have people online.
7375000	7384000	Whereas ours, we had quite a few people on the list to get in, but you'd be lucky to see somebody playing for a few hours.
7384000	7388000	It just wasn't as hard to coordinate stuff.
7388000	7393000	Minecraft's one of those games that I kind of gravitate to when there's not a lot of other big stuff going on right now.
7393000	7397000	So now is just not the time of year for Minecraft because there's so much other games out right now.
7397000	7401000	Minecraft's that thing I'll visit in March when I'm like, oh, I've kind of finished these other games.
7401000	7403000	And oh, remember Minecraft? That's fun.
7403000	7405000	So that's just me anyway.
7405000	7407000	Next email.
7407000	7408000	Next email.
7408000	7409000	Howdy peoples.
7409000	7413000	It starts off with a link about Winnie the Pooh being banned from Polish playgrounds.
7413000	7425000	Your discussion from last week about gender identity of Toad and Toadette reminded me of a story that broke recently about a Polish city council discussing Winnie the Pooh.
7426000	7438000	This is the discussion that reflected the city council's fundamental misunderstanding of the characters being discussed as well as the nature of and definitions of hermaphroditism and homosexuality.
7438000	7446000	I'm wondering if the people who think negatively about gender expression in Mario games don't suffer from the same fundamental misunderstanding.
7446000	7456000	I think that we can all agree that if you are thinking deeply about the sexuality and gender expression of characters in children's programming, that you need to rethink your priorities.
7456000	7457000	Also conservative...
7457000	7458000	Well, but...
7458000	7459000	Have you even been on the internet?
7459000	7462000	But talking about Bert and Ernie being gay is okay, right?
7462000	7464000	Yeah, because they're totally.
7464000	7468000	Also, conservatives need to do their fucking research before they talk about shit.
7468000	7470000	Stay black. Retertainment.
7470000	7474000	This message has been brought to you by Pixel Shits 2, projectiles of exercise impediment.
7474000	7475000	Trainer.
7475000	7477000	Did he say to stay black?
7477000	7478000	Yes.
7478000	7481000	I actually like that guy's email now, but before I thought it was totally lame.
7481000	7487000	People will come on every week and say that ever since you did that on the show, Dan.
7487000	7490000	I have been the trendsetter.
7490000	7492000	You're supposed to say it to Ranma.
7492000	7500000	So, yeah, I think some people are way overthinking, especially when it comes to the children's books and stuff.
7500000	7502000	It's just... I don't know.
7502000	7503000	Take it away, gay!
7503000	7504000	Yeah.
7505000	7512000	The nice thing is that kids don't have that problem. Parents have that problem.
7512000	7513000	That's right.
7513000	7515000	Adults overthink shit.
7515000	7517000	And parents pass it on to their kids.
7517000	7519000	And they don't just let it go.
7519000	7522000	Let it go. Let it go.
7522000	7524000	It just doesn't go away.
7524000	7529000	I'm coming to Kingdom Hearts 3 with Sora and Goofy.
7529000	7531000	That was good.
7531000	7532000	Thank you.
7532000	7533000	Did you practice that all night?
7533000	7534000	Yes, I did.
7534000	7535000	Good job.
7563000	7579000	I think most would agree the classic example of this would be NES's Super Mario Bros., the popularized side-scrolling, or PS1's...
7579000	7581000	But didn't invent it.
7581000	7587000	Final Fantasy VII and the lavish production quality standards that most RPGs attempted to replicate in its wake.
7587000	7589000	But is shallow and lame.
7590000	7593000	In Dan's opinion.
7593000	7598000	It is. It wasn't even the deepest Final Fantasy game when it came out.
7598000	7599000	Here we go.
7599000	7602000	That's just the question. And Dan doesn't get to answer.
7602000	7604000	Yes, you do.
7604000	7606000	The defining game of the generation.
7606000	7611000	I feel like we tackled this question on a previous episode and had a real in-depth conversation on it.
7611000	7621000	And I want to say, and Dark Tetsuya knows this show better than I do, it was either the week before the Wii U launched or the week before the PlayStation 4 launched.
7621000	7623000	We did a show.
7623000	7624000	Did we do a list list about it?
7624000	7625000	I think so.
7625000	7633000	So you might want to go back in the archives because I feel like we had a discussion about the past generation of games as we were transitioning from one generation to the other.
7633000	7638000	But to humor the question because it is a good question and opinions can also change.
7638000	7644000	I haven't sampled necessarily as many games from the last generation a year ago as I have now.
7644000	7651000	But I would still say, and this is probably what I would have said on the other show, the defining game of the last generation, absolutely in my opinion, was Wii Sports.
7651000	7653000	Wii Sports is the defining game of the generation.
7653000	7655000	And for a multitude of reasons.
7655000	7664000	Not just because of what it did for the Wii and the fact that the Wii was the number one system in sales of the last generation solely on the back of Wii Sports.
7664000	7665000	Really.
7666000	7671000	But the fact that it brought motion control into what we see now in games.
7671000	7676000	Although it's kind of turned into this rock band, guitar hero oversaturation.
7676000	7680000	Now it's only dance games that seem to really use it and so forth.
7680000	7682000	It led to the Wii condom.
7682000	7685000	Right. Yeah, yeah. The breaking of the TVs.
7685000	7692000	But it also got, and this is very important, there's more than just the motion control why I say Wii Sports.
7692000	7698000	It got a lot more people playing games that weren't playing games already.
7698000	7702000	Which is, you know, when we talk about the Wiis being in retirement homes and things like that.
7702000	7709000	That's a theme that's carried on into this generation as we talk about now mobile gaming, Candy Crush, Farmville, yada yada.
7709000	7710000	There's that.
7710000	7714000	And also the simplicity of Wii Sports.
7714000	7716000	This is building on something Loki said earlier.
7717000	7723000	If you have a basic concept, that's really all you need to have a really awesome game.
7723000	7727000	And Wii Sports really feels like something that could have been done by an indie developer.
7727000	7728000	It really does.
7728000	7734000	So I think for all those reasons, Wii Sports was the defining game of last generation.
7734000	7735000	But that's my opinion.
7735000	7736000	Loki, I don't know if you have an opinion.
7736000	7738000	Grand Theft Auto IV.
7738000	7740000	Grand Theft Auto IV is awesome.
7740000	7742000	Was it the defining game of the last generation?
7742000	7750000	Last generation? I'd say the last generation of the defining game would have been Grand Theft Auto V.
7750000	7753000	But that was just Grand Theft Auto.
7753000	7754000	It was awesome!
7754000	7757000	It is awesome, but it's Grand Theft Auto with better graphics.
7757000	7760000	Grand Theft Auto IV is pretty good.
7760000	7763000	I don't know, as far as games that really kind of did something different.
7763000	7766000	Yeah, I guess Wii Sports would be pretty good.
7767000	7775000	The whole Wii in general was pretty good just because it was completely different at the time of everything that had been out there.
7775000	7777000	You play with controllers, now we're going to do motion controls.
7777000	7782000	And it kind of worked, as opposed to the iToy or something like that.
7782000	7784000	That didn't really work too well.
7784000	7786000	So I think it was neat.
7786000	7790000	Too bad that people at retirement homes don't buy games.
7791000	7796000	And people that bought the system unfortunately don't buy a lot of games either.
7796000	7798000	And so that's where they lost the support.
7798000	7804000	It was an underpowered system that they didn't want to embrace HD in a time where HD was becoming popular.
7804000	7807000	If only they'd put a supermarket sweep game on the Wii.
7807000	7814000	If only they had a system that was as powerful as the Xbox 360 that had motion controls at that time.
7814000	7816000	But now we have the Wii U and that's that.
7816000	7820000	But now our systems are even more powerful and they're stuck in the same fucking situation again.
7821000	7826000	Dan, I'm sure this is a thought that keeps you up late at night. What would you say is the defining game of the last generation?
7826000	7828000	Five bucks, Jamie was going to say Mass Effect.
7829000	7831000	I was going to say Mass Effect 3 for one thing.
7832000	7835000	No, I actually have a reason not just because of the game, it's because of the shit that went on around the game.
7836000	7851000	About having the fans speak up and voice their disappointment to such a degree that the company would bend over backwards and make DLC that would fix those problems in their point of view.
7852000	7857000	And then throw out the total, oh by the way here fandom, here's a cookie for the Citadel DLC.
7857000	7864000	I think that it was the first situation where they really, really took to heart what people were saying.
7865000	7867000	Dan, to be fair, I think she makes a damn good point.
7868000	7869000	Oh no, I just knew that she would say Mass Effect.
7870000	7872000	But I think her rationale makes sense because...
7873000	7876000	Oh absolutely, I wasn't saying it's not rational. Mine is kind of similar.
7877000	7881000	If the internet had existed when Final Fantasy 7 came out, they would have had to change the ending there too.
7882000	7883000	Maybe, I don't know.
7884000	7885000	Alright, anyway.
7885000	7887000	And Square would have been like, fuck the internet! Moving on.
7888000	7889000	They still do say that.
7890000	7892000	What, you guys want Final Fantasy 7 again? No, we don't want money.
7893000	7898000	I would say, strangely enough, I'd say Call of Duty 4. The first Modern Warfare.
7899000	7913000	Which you think, oh it's just another FPS, it just had better graphics, which is true, but it essentially redefined every FPS that came after and made FPSs the dominant genre for the rest of the generation and carrying over into this generation. It's almost ridiculous.
7913000	7918000	Well, have you guys seen, they've just put this out for Dragon Age Inquisition, the cinematic tools.
7919000	7929000	Which had come based on the Call of Duty cinematic tools where people are actually doing whole machinima movies using Call of Duty and its engine.
7930000	7937000	All the later ones because of the scope of the levels and all of the hidden things and just how well developed they are.
7938000	7948000	Rageinator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the Wii didn't need a supermarket sweep game, the Wii needed a Matlock vs Golden Girls fighting game. With fatalities.
7949000	7950000	Matlock would have kicked ass in that.
7951000	7952000	Matlock would have kicked ass.
7953000	7954000	Oh no, Sofia's pretty mean.
7955000	7961000	Robert M. in chat says, what was one of the first popular indie titles? Minecraft. And you could make a case that Minecraft was a defining game.
7962000	7971000	So what you're essentially saying is that you're looking for a TV Land, Injustice, Gods Among Us type of game. TV Land, Gods Among Us.
7972000	7977000	They move around in the car 54 where are you car and listen to the monkeys play the background.
7978000	7979000	Dibs on the maid from the Jeffersons.
7980000	7981000	Lawrence.
7982000	7985000	Lawrence was awesome. She epitomized sassy black lady.
7986000	7987000	Archie Bunker yo!
7988000	7989000	So there's more to the email.
7989000	7995000	Wait real quick, real quick. Robert M. says, I'd say to answer my own persistent question, probably Braid and or Cave Story.
7996000	7998000	Act F says, Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
7999000	8000000	So the rest of the email?
8001000	8002000	Yes.
8002000	8013000	With that said, my pick is Demon Souls for PS3. The fact that you can lose all your progress by dying twice in a row and not reaching your blood stain was a revelation to me and made every single encounter in the game an intense fight for survival.
8014000	8017000	Also the obscure take on multiplayer and PvP was something I'd never seen before.
8017000	8023000	This game may not have been the peak of the series, but it was a solid foundation that created the framework for each game to follow.
8024000	8026000	Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 and the upcoming Bloodborne.
8027000	8032000	It's a game I'll always look back fondly on and one I compare most action adventure RPGs to now.
8033000	8035000	Your turn go. We already went haha.
8036000	8045000	So for those of us, by the way, who remember life before checkpoints and safe states and all that, remember when dying in any game three times in a row meant you lost all your progress?
8045000	8047000	Yeah. Yeah. Right? Like Battletoads?
8048000	8050000	Any game. Oh, and I'm starting from the beginning.
8051000	8052000	Ghouls and ghosts? Yeah.
8053000	8054000	Anyway.
8055000	8057000	The source of many, many profane statements.
8058000	8059000	Golden9007.
8061000	8067000	PS, I've been listening to you guys for over nine years and have loved every minute. Keep up the good work and happy holidays. That comes from Tonic Vision.
8068000	8069000	Wow.
8069000	8070000	Thank you, Tonic Vision.
8070000	8072000	That's amazing. Nine years. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Dance.
8072000	8074000	I haven't even been wanting to do the show that long.
8075000	8077000	Wait, somebody's been listening to this show for nine years. Can you believe it?
8078000	8079000	Morons.
8082000	8083000	I mean, hi.
8084000	8085000	I'm going to set you on fire.
8086000	8087000	PUNNING!
8088000	8090000	Alan Android in our chat says Gary's Mod or Journey?
8091000	8093000	Like Journey Escape? That was on 2600.
8094000	8096000	No, no, no, no. Journey, the adventure, you know, PlayStation 3.
8097000	8105000	I think that game came a little late to really define the generation. I think we have yet to see what that's going to really inspire moving forward.
8106000	8108000	I think Journey just threw it all for a loop.
8109000	8111000	I think in a way. So anyway.
8112000	8113000	I do agree with Gary's Mod.
8114000	8118000	Good email. Even if I did say, I think we had this discussion before, we probably didn't have Dan there. So now Dan's.
8119000	8120000	Probably not.
8121000	8122000	Alright.
8123000	8124000	Last email.
8125000	8128000	Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle series turtle.
8129000	8132000	I'll start out by saying that I firmly believe in voting with my wallet.
8133000	8140000	And in the spirit of that belief, I almost never buy PC games day one, mostly because of the recent acceptance of publishers releasing broken games that they plan to patch later.
8141000	8145000	Now why would I want to play through half a game with lots of bugs before it gets patched?
8146000	8148000	I want my experience to be as enjoyable as it can be.
8149000	8152000	And don't get me started on early access, AKA, pay the beta test.
8152000	8157000	Let's take Far Cry 4 as an example. I planned on buying that game immediately upon release.
8158000	8169000	But a week before, Ubisoft released bonked Assassin's Creed to the populace and now I don't want to support them at full price.
8170000	8173000	I have no problem waiting three to six months for all the patches and a Steam sale.
8173000	8184000	So my question, if enough PC gamers waited on the games to be patched and bought them on sale later on, would some game companies reconsider building games for the PC platform?
8185000	8190000	I want to send a message, but I also don't want the developers to negatively retaliate to said message.
8191000	8193000	I just want a working game. I look forward to your thoughts.
8194000	8196000	As always, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.
8196000	8208000	I agree with the concept of being able to vote with your wallet and kind of rejecting a lot of these broken games.
8209000	8216000	I mean, I literally just reported five stories ago on a game that was released on PC that's broken and they're having to patch in graphics.
8216000	8228000	And that's, you know, that's not okay. And I think we do have to sometimes resist that gut reaction to buy things until we know that they're working because clearly that expectation is no longer there.
8229000	8231000	The games have to actually be working in order to be sold.
8232000	8238000	Maybe Nintendo was onto something way back in the 80s when they used to have that seal of quality. Remember that? The Nintendo seal of quality?
8238000	8247000	Not that it necessarily made the games good to carry the Nintendo seal of quality, but at least you know they weren't super fucking broken.
8248000	8254000	Maybe a little broken, but not super fucking broken. Do we need some type of seal of quality standard back in the industry?
8255000	8262000	Do we need a Steam quality badge or a GOG badge? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just throwing ideas out there.
8262000	8277000	This is not a new problem. Even before the easy patches and the broadband internet and all that, in the 90s, in the 80s, you can go out and buy a game from your PC and you can go through the install process and it was going to be broken.
8277000	8296000	It was much, much more unusual on consoles because consoles were managed not just by the publisher, but they were managed by, like, to get a game to go through Nintendo, you had to submit it to Nintendo and they'd send it back and they'd submit it to Nintendo again and they'd send it back and submit it to Nintendo again before they finally said...
8297000	8299000	And you had to submit to Nintendo on your knees. You can only do three games a year.
8299000	8306000	And then they would do it, you know, and Sony was the same way on the PlayStation and Microsoft's the same way on the Xbox. Nobody does that on the PC.
8307000	8322000	Now you've got a question of games being so big budget and patches being so easy to put out there that, you know, Assassin's Creed is, I think, kind of the watershed of the issue because it's a huge title at this point in time.
8323000	8325000	It was hugely anticipated.
8326000	8327000	Huge fan base.
8327000	8337000	There were tons and tons of people who had already kind of been up in arms about it because the developers were all, uh, yeah, we can't put female models in it, so just deal and everyone was already pissed.
8338000	8346000	And then they booted the launch, which at least shows us that they were fucking serious about not being able to put their female models in because they could barely put their male models in.
8346000	8359000	But yeah, it just ended up being, I think that it's going to be finally kind of the breaking point where hopefully, like you were saying, vote with your wallet. Tell Ubisoft to eat a dick.
8360000	8367000	Don't give them your next game at full price. Let them figure it out. And if they lose the revenue, they'll get more serious. I agree.
8367000	8378000	Don't buy games until you're satisfied that they're going to be good. And when they lose their revenue, then they'll be like, oh, maybe we should be a little more conservative with that release date.
8379000	8389000	And I'm definitely understanding of glitches that are kind of not necessarily something that you'd normally run into, but like when the whole face is missing off of somebody and it's like, come on, you should have seen that testing.
8390000	8398000	Yeah. Well, and then it's like, you know, and Assassin's Creed has a lot of very devoted, very hardcore fans. There's a lot of people who are going to give that series money by default.
8399000	8413000	It's like the people, okay, the people who went and saw Star Wars Episode One because it was Star Wars and you have to go see it and then Jar Jar Binks comes on screen and your childhood is being ruined right in front of your eyes.
8413000	8423000	Why Lucas? Why, why, why? Assassin's Creed was the episode, Assassin's Creed Unity is the Episode One of the series in some ways.
8424000	8426000	You know what the coolest thing about Episode One was?
8427000	8428000	The pod race.
8429000	8432000	No. The lightsaber battle that happened in the parking lot waiting for the movie.
8433000	8436000	The fact that Greg Proops is one of the commentators during the pod race is the coolest part of Episode One.
8437000	8438000	I love Greg Proops.
8438000	8442000	But yeah, no, I do think that this is going to hopefully make a fundamental change.
8443000	8444000	Yeah.
8445000	8450000	Especially, at least to Ubisoft at exactly what releasing an unfinished game is going to get you.
8451000	8453000	Who are they going to pick on? Last year it was EA over the whole Mass Effect.
8454000	8463000	Look at EA though. I mean, perfect example of how someone that's kind of, or a company that's sort of learned from their mistakes, you know, with Battlefield 4 and that mess that was there online.
8463000	8469000	You know, and now they've kind of taken things a little bit different. They gave Dragon Age Inquisition more time and that turned out great.
8470000	8473000	And now they're giving Battlefield Hardline more time and we'll see.
8474000	8476000	Right, and so it seems like EA is making the adjustments.
8477000	8483000	EA's problem though, almost more than just like we're releasing a ridiculously broken program, is literally always their DRM.
8484000	8492000	I think we need a list list here at some point for 2015 because, you know, like we said, EA usually has, or EA was fucking up a couple years ago.
8493000	8502000	Ubisoft's been fucking up this year. I think we need to do the 2015, the 2015 prediction, big video game company fuck up that we predict for 2015.
8503000	8504000	Activision.
8505000	8506000	Yeah, but not just necessarily the company, but what will the fuck up be?
8507000	8508000	No, no, I'm with him. Activision.
8509000	8510000	Well, that's a very logical conclusion.
8511000	8512000	It's sort of a verb and a noun.
8513000	8514000	Activision.
8515000	8516000	What's going to be fucked up in 2015?
8517000	8520000	Activision. How are they going to do it? Activision. Booyah.
8521000	8525000	I would like to get into a little more of like the how. How is it going to fuck up?
8526000	8527000	Activision.
8528000	8529000	What?
8530000	8531000	They're going to do something with Call of Duty. I don't know.
8532000	8538000	I liked Advanced Warfare somewhat. I mean, it's just, I think that it's starting to trend downwards.
8538000	8542000	I mean, Ghost, no one really liked. Advanced Warfare is a little bit better, I think, than Ghost.
8543000	8544000	But next year, I don't know.
8545000	8550000	I'm going to put it out there. We'll do the listless officially at some point. We don't have time for it tonight.
8551000	8554000	But I'm going to go out on a limb and say Sony is going to make the big fuck up next.
8555000	8559000	I think Activision is too easy. Sony's coming off a couple really, really good years.
8560000	8564000	They've had some really good years. I think it's time for a really good fuck up.
8564000	8571000	Well, Sony, the Sony Pictures division, even though it's separate from the game side, that's going through a pretty big fuck up right now.
8572000	8580000	No. EA's fourth quarter, we're due for, I think, was it Titanfall 2 maybe? Maybe we'll see that.
8581000	8586000	You know, Sony really only fucked up once. It was a big fuck up with the PlayStation 3.
8587000	8593000	Kind of that whole generation if they just deleted it. But the PlayStation 1 was a giant hit. The PlayStation 2 was the giantest of hits.
8594000	8597000	PlayStation 3 was even successful if you gave it, what, 10 years.
8598000	8604000	You're forgetting about another, Sony had more than one fuck up. They've had plenty more than one because you're forgetting about the Sony hack that happened on PlayStation.
8605000	8609000	Well, that's part of the PlayStation 3. That's part of the PlayStation 3. Like the whole PlayStation 3.
8610000	8611000	The PSP Go was a fuck up.
8612000	8616000	PSP Go was a fuck up. But I'm just saying, Sony's only, but PSP Go was a small fuck up.
8618000	8619000	There are some people...
8620000	8621000	Because it was, you know, portable.
8621000	8626000	There are some people that still stand for the PSP Go. Like I do have a couple friends that are like, the PSP Go's not that bad, it was just ahead of its time.
8627000	8628000	It was really easy to steal games for.
8629000	8630000	The Xperia Play.
8631000	8632000	Anyway, alright.
8633000	8634000	Well that was no.
8635000	8639000	Oh my god, Raginator actually has a pretty good idea. Like sometimes Raginator's jokes aren't funny, but this one actually kind of is.
8640000	8647000	Raginator says, OLR should hold its own annual award show and make one category the biggest fuck up of the year.
8648000	8649000	I love it.
8649000	8650000	The Fuck Up Awards.
8651000	8652000	Winner!
8653000	8655000	No, no, no. One category. You don't have to have the whole thing based on something.
8656000	8657000	No, you need to have a whole thing based on something.
8658000	8664000	Here's the problem. We gotta walk a fine line. Because I don't want to be that show that's just, the gamers hate everything.
8665000	8673000	The jaded, I hate everything, cynical gamer stuff. Like I kind of think if that's your angle, then you shouldn't be doing a show on games in the first place.
8673000	8680000	I'm sorry if that's going to be a shots fired comment for some of you, but if you carry your back on the fact that you're a cynical gamer, then get a new fucking hobby.
8681000	8682000	Why are you looking at me, Rob?
8683000	8684000	I'm not just looking in that direction.
8685000	8687000	I'm not cynical. Jaded. Fair.
8688000	8697000	At the end of the day, no matter what negative thing we say here on OLR, we talk about fuck ups and all that stuff. I love video games. We all love video games here at OLR, even on their worst days.
8697000	8707000	So my thing is that if we're going to do an award show based around fuck ups or whatever, I still want the overall message to be, we do love video games though, but goddamn, stop fucking up.
8708000	8716000	Should be like the Orange Lounge Radio listless. Have the whole thing, all the categories be done in that manner and then have everybody vote on them.
8717000	8720000	Maybe. We'll have to think that one through a little more. We'll talk to our people.
8721000	8724000	Did I miss the joke that listless is like listless? Is that intentional?
8725000	8726000	Yes, totally.
8727000	8732000	Listless carries over. It's the one segment that has persisted since my college radio show.
8733000	8735000	How come I never heard that term mentioned before today?
8736000	8737000	I don't know.
8738000	8739000	God damn.
8740000	8741000	This is how old that segment is.
8742000	8743000	I need to quit sniffing glue.
8744000	8746000	Dan, you ready for this? This is how old that segment is. My ex-girlfriend named it.
8747000	8748000	Damn.
8752000	8755000	On that note, I think we're all done with emails, right, Jamie?
8755000	8756000	Oh yeah, we're done.
8757000	8758000	Gorgeous.
8759000	8760000	I don't care if we're done. We're fucking done.
8761000	8762000	We are so done.
8763000	8764000	I can't even.
8765000	8766000	So let's then, clearly, if we are unable to even anymore.
8767000	8768000	I so cannot.
8769000	8771000	The even awards, because some days we just can't even.
8772000	8775000	All right, it is time for the FUs of the week.
8785000	8787000	Here is punishment.
8788000	8790000	This is fucked up.
8792000	8797000	FU to randomly spraining or pulling my hip, whatever the crap I did to it.
8798000	8802000	Because I was a little sore earlier. Now I'm in a lot of pain.
8803000	8804000	So FU to that.
8805000	8806000	Feel better.
8807000	8808000	Logie?
8809000	8810000	Um, I guess.
8811000	8815000	Um, I don't know. FU to my cat, maybe?
8816000	8820000	She woke me up again early this morning. I hate her.
8821000	8822000	Well, just because of that.
8823000	8825000	She's fine. Then she's also messing with the tree.
8826000	8827000	Trying to bat at it.
8828000	8829000	I thought you said Canada.
8830000	8832000	No, I don't hate Canada. Canada's not knocking on my door early in the morning.
8833000	8834000	Don't live in the right neighborhood.
8835000	8836000	I guess not.
8836000	8838000	So, I don't know. That's all I've got. I'm not really mad.
8840000	8842000	Let's see. My FU of the week.
8843000	8844000	Actually, things are pretty... FU to yard work.
8845000	8846000	Yard work sucks.
8847000	8849000	And there's a reason I don't do it very often.
8850000	8852000	But we finally decided, you know, there's a lot of leaves on the lawn.
8853000	8854000	We should probably do something about that.
8855000	8856000	So we did something about that the other day.
8857000	8862000	And so FU to the fact that after I, you know, made my back sore, my legs sore during yard work.
8863000	8864000	That today, lawn's covered in leaves again.
8864000	8866000	That's why you have to wait until the leaves are on the ground.
8867000	8868000	Or until it floods and your neighbors are like,
8869000	8870000	Hey, you know, we should probably rake those leaves up.
8871000	8872000	Because it keeps blocking the gutters and the street flooded.
8873000	8874000	And so that was my week.
8875000	8876000	Yeah, right.
8877000	8878000	Or you just need to mow.
8879000	8880000	I just told Alan, I said, can't we just mow them over with the lawn mower?
8881000	8882000	Can't we just get the lawn mower?
8883000	8884000	Nope, nope. I know that logic. I've tried it. It doesn't work.
8885000	8886000	It just makes the leaves smaller and harder to pick up.
8887000	8888000	So it's just... it's not...
8889000	8890000	Yeah, but once they're all mulched and chopped up...
8891000	8892000	Exactly. Leave them... Exactly.
8892000	8893000	Leave them there. It's going to make your lawn even better.
8894000	8895000	Because they're going to, you know, they're just going to rot away into a soil.
8896000	8897000	Your lawn needs it.
8898000	8899000	No. They fucking stay there for a whole goddamn year and get covered with more leaves.
8900000	8901000	It doesn't work. I've tried it. I've tried... I have a mulching mower.
8902000	8903000	I went over them several times.
8904000	8905000	That's the problem. You need to not have a mulching mower.
8906000	8907000	You need a mower that just picks the shit up.
8908000	8909000	Dan, do you have any for you this week?
8910000	8911000	Uh, no. Everything is good.
8912000	8913000	I have nothing that I'm upset about.
8914000	8915000	Everything is awesome.
8916000	8917000	Everything is good.
8918000	8919000	Everything is good.
8920000	8921000	Everything is good.
8922000	8923000	Everything is awesome.
8924000	8925000	You need to say F you to my hip.
8926000	8927000	F you to Jamie's hip.
8928000	8929000	Alright.
8930000	8931000	Jamie is flipping me the bird.
8932000	8933000	F you to Jamie's bird.
8934000	8935000	Um, I love this. Some people...
8936000	8937000	But you love the cat.
8938000	8939000	There's some people in the chat room trying to help us flesh out ideas for the OLR award show that we could do.
8940000	8943000	Act deft, suggesting the fuck up of a lifetime achievement award.
8944000	8945000	That is a great idea.
8946000	8947000	I don't know if it has to be lifetime because there's always going to be bigger fuck ups.
8948000	8949000	No, because I'm thinking...
8949000	8953000	For like a fuck up icon type of award, like Jack Thompson should be the first inductee.
8954000	8955000	Like fuck up of a lifetime.
8956000	8957000	Engage.
8958000	8959000	The Engage would be a great nomination.
8960000	8961000	Or maybe not necessarily Engage, but side talking.
8962000	8963000	You know, I don't...
8964000	8965000	That should be kind of a fuck up.
8966000	8967000	No, no. You were right. The Engage.
8968000	8969000	Yeah, the Engage is a good fuck up of a lifetime.
8970000	8971000	You know, the Engage was a misunderstood...
8972000	8974000	Not a good system, but a misunderstood system.
8974000	8978000	Now the Game.com, that was a fuck up of a lifetime.
8979000	8984000	I like where this is going. You guys are smart in your chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
8985000	8986000	And you don't hear that very often.
8987000	8988000	No, I love our listeners. You stop.
8989000	8990000	Well, you can love them all you want.
8991000	9000000	Alright. Moving on. Loki, let's get some more news and then we'll take your calls pretty soon here at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.
9000000	9008000	Okay, so there was this issue with Nintendo and Philips over, I guess, this patent for virtual body control device.
9009000	9016000	And apparently they've resolved their dispute by signing a licensing agreement with Philips.
9017000	9023000	And I guess per the agreement, Nintendo and Philips will cross license portions of each company's patent portfolio.
9024000	9026000	This is a really old story, right?
9027000	9028000	No. This is...
9028000	9029000	It's about the CDI and like Mario Brothers.
9030000	9036000	No, no, no. Stop. No. Yeah. I can see the whole reason they came down the agreement. It's like, really? You're going to sue us?
9037000	9039000	Look what you did to Mario and Zelda on the Philips CDI.
9040000	9045000	But in good news, Philips will be making the Nintendo Wii U CD-ROM next year.
9045000	9056000	Anyways, so I guess, yeah, this was from back in 2011. They had a notice because of this patent, the virtual body control device.
9057000	9062000	And then there was another one, user interface system based on pointing device.
9063000	9066000	I love these very, very generic patents. That's fantastic.
9066000	9077000	And apparently that second one was used for the Wii, Wii U and DS consoles and other most interesting tech and cameras.
9078000	9085000	But, I don't know. Yeah, so yeah, really, they should be paying Nintendo for what the fuck they did to Zelda.
9086000	9090000	So Philips is so far gone at this point, they're patent trolling? That's sad.
9091000	9094000	They deserve it for what they did to Zelda, though.
9094000	9100000	All right. Well, you know what? Speaking of money being thrown around aimlessly, this is crazy.
9101000	9104000	So I think last week we probably talked about this. You know those little Amiibos?
9105000	9107000	Nintendo's new niche they're trying to get into are these little Amiibo.
9108000	9114000	And there was a misprint or a mispressing of some of the Amiibo for Samus.
9115000	9122000	And there was a Samus floating around out there that had two arm cannons, which if you know Samus, she does not have two arm cannons. She has one.
9122000	9123000	But that's awesome.
9124000	9126000	Yeah, it looks awesome, because that looks like Samus.
9127000	9129000	It's awesome until she falls on the ground and she's like...
9130000	9132000	Tips over because the guns are too heavy and the Amiibo won't stand out.
9133000	9134000	But Samus doesn't have that problem, she'll just turn into a ball.
9135000	9136000	Yeah, good point.
9137000	9142000	But the dual gun Samus looks amazing because that's what she should look like in the movie trailer.
9143000	9144000	Like as she's walking out with the fire, like the two guns on the side.
9145000	9146000	Incidentally, Metroid Prime 4.
9146000	9163000	Yes, right? But anyway, so somebody bought one of these Samus with the two gun figures at Best Buy and sold it on eBay $2,500 to buy a Samus Amiibo phone.
9164000	9168000	Now that's not exactly accurate. He did include a regular Samus Amiibo with it.
9168000	9178000	So really, if you look at it, they're only $1,250 a piece. And that right there is only, what, $1,000 premium on each?
9179000	9193000	It was bought at Best Buy for $13. And the seller was asked on Reddit if he'd considered keeping the Samus Amiibo or donating it to a museum or donating it to Nintendo.
9194000	9195000	He's like, fuck no, I want money.
9195000	9204000	Yeah, he said, the thought had not crossed my mind. However, if approached by Nintendo, I probably would have. I was considering hanging on to it to sell at a later date if the value increased.
9205000	9213000	However, with the high level of interest shown at the time when I posted it, I thought I'd go ahead and sell it now in case the value went down or a whole tub of them was discovered at a later date.
9214000	9221000	Meanwhile, Nintendo's got a warehouse full of these that they're pissed off at the manufacturer for and they're just like, wait a minute, these things are worth $2,000 a piece?
9221000	9231000	Hate this guy all you want? He's fucking smart. I'm sorry. That's the most American thing I've heard of, what he just did.
9232000	9236000	The only thing that would have been more American is he was eating one of those KFC bowls at the time.
9237000	9247000	That's awesome. The thing is, it's not like he bought something that was unusual and he bought them up and then has trotted them out on eBay.
9248000	9255000	He found something that was a one-off and someone said, probably, you know, I want it. Someone's probably worth something and he threw it out there to see what he could get.
9256000	9263000	It wasn't like he threw it up there for like a $2,500 buy it now. I mean, you know, more power to him. It's not like he's playing a slimy game.
9263000	9268000	He probably at the very least, he's going to make his money back and what he purchased it for it.
9269000	9277000	I get this more than the ET cartridges. At least the Samus doll wasn't thrown away and dug out of a landfill.
9278000	9279000	But it was thrown away by Atari.
9280000	9286000	I'm sure Atari's thrown a lot away. Do you want like a stick of gum that Nolan Bushnell once chewed? Is that a value?
9287000	9288000	Yes.
9289000	9294000	Actually, then again, one of the coolest Christmas presents I ever got.
9295000	9296000	Stick of gum?
9297000	9303000	No, a friend of mine got me index cards that were actually used on the 1970s match game that had questions on it.
9304000	9305000	There you go.
9306000	9308000	Richard Dawson might have touched those.
9309000	9313000	Right? And so that's why I'm like, okay, actually this is one of the coolest presents I've ever gotten in my life.
9313000	9317000	So anyway, Charles Nelson Reilly might have spit on it.
9318000	9323000	Maybe. He might have had like skin cells from Betty White.
9324000	9330000	Anyway. Okay, so there we go. That is it for the news tonight, which means we are ready to go to the Skype line.
9331000	9334000	We're ready for your calls. So now's your chance. Time zones don't usually get to participate.
9335000	9339000	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, if you'd like to talk about anything we've talked about tonight.
9339000	9346000	PlayStation Experience, the Game Awards, Steam Broadcasting, anything. It's been a very busy week.
9347000	9351000	I will turn to Loki real quick and see if there's any last minute stories while we wait for those calls to come in.
9352000	9353000	Nope. No. No, they are not.
9354000	9357000	No, they are not. Well, luckily we have a call coming in so at least we can get to that.
9358000	9359000	And we will take this call now.
9360000	9361000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9362000	9363000	Do you see me?
9364000	9365000	I do. Is that Ravenstaufen?
9366000	9367000	It is Ravenstaufen.
9367000	9372000	Oh. Amiibos. Hey, wait. That Samus only has one gun. It's less cool.
9373000	9374000	I know. It's only worth $1250.
9376000	9381000	I got so much stuff in here, man. I mean, I went crazy. Like bipolar crazy.
9382000	9388000	I heard a rumor, and this is still rumor status, but you held up that Villager amiibo. You might want to keep that in the packaging.
9389000	9394000	The rumor I'm hearing, Villager, Marth, and Wii Fit Trainer already discontinued.
9395000	9396000	Oh, I already have? I have all of them.
9397000	9398000	How many of those things have you bought, sir?
9399000	9401000	All of them. I bought all of them for that reason.
9402000	9403000	I want a Villager.
9404000	9405000	Every single amiibo.
9406000	9411000	Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. Sorry. Let me go get them. Yeah, I got the Marth one, you're saying. I got them all, man.
9412000	9413000	Pikachu, Marth.
9414000	9422000	Just so you know, Nintendo is proud of you. You've completely bought into the marketing and bought them all.
9423000	9424000	That's right.
9424000	9426000	Because consumerism always wins for me.
9427000	9430000	How does it feel to be a consumer whore for Nintendo?
9431000	9436000	I am a consumer whore. I admit it, but yes, I've been keeping a few in the box.
9437000	9443000	But yeah, to that day, just like that guy, you said it, Dan. You said, nothing wrong with that, and then when the day comes, cash in.
9444000	9445000	That's right.
9446000	9450000	Like I said, it's not like you bought them all on the shelf and you're trying to sell something that some five-year-old wants.
9450000	9459000	That's true. Just saying, it will happen because someone will go out there and say, maybe Rob will go like, I want Wii Fit Trainer. Guess who has it?
9460000	9470000	Actually, I do kind of want Wii Fit Trainer, but I wish they'd had, I mean, you know, I just, I prefer male Wii Fit Trainer because of, you know, some of my...
9471000	9472000	It's all good.
9473000	9474000	Yeah, exactly. If you're going to wear a skin tight outfit, I prefer...
9474000	9480000	I want to see, like, someone make a mod of those, like, fat Wii Fit Trainer. That'd be hilarious.
9481000	9486000	Why not? Alright, so I don't think you just called in tonight to talk about your various collection of amiibo.
9487000	9493000	God, no. No, no, this is, uh, I wanted to talk about the VGAs some more if I could. Not the VGAs, but the Game Award.
9494000	9496000	Did you check out who won Trending Gamer?
9497000	9500000	Uh, that was the one that Total Biscuit won, right?
9501000	9503000	That is so weird, because guess who else was on there?
9504000	9505000	PewDiePie!
9506000	9511000	Yeah, and he's, he's super famous, huh? Here's, I'm gonna, Raven's Dolphin, can I be honest with you in the listenership for a minute?
9512000	9513000	Yeah, please.
9514000	9518000	This is gonna really surprise some of you guys. You ready? I didn't know who any of those people were. I didn't know who any of them were.
9519000	9527000	And I, I do, I do have a familiarity with PewDiePie because I see his articles on Yahoo about how he's the biggest YouTube celebrity out there.
9527000	9541000	So I'm not gonna say like, oh, I'm so hipster, I don't, but I watched maybe two minutes of one of his videos and I was like, alright, I've seen this a million times on Twitch and various channels and I would just rather watch my friends than these guys.
9542000	9545000	I'm like Total Biscuit, I mean, he seems to be, you know, interesting, but that's about it.
9546000	9548000	I don't, I don't know any of those guys and I don't know a thing about him.
9549000	9559000	Well, I was ready for, you know, oh geez, this guy got 30 million people, it's going to PewDiePie, it's going to him, it's going to him, and they said Total Biscuit. I went like, this thing's saved, thank God.
9560000	9571000	I went like, I don't know, I don't know the 30 million people, but they seem quite a, I mean, like I said, I'd rather have a chat room full of 100 smart people than have 30 million blah people.
9572000	9573000	Yeah.
9573000	9579000	PewDiePie's videos are annoying. I can't understand why people are so into...
9580000	9584000	Wasn't his big thing, he got big because he did the scary games and would scream really loud?
9585000	9588000	He got big because of the scare cam. The scare cam was his invention.
9588000	9603000	I don't, you know, just, I can't, I mean, maybe I haven't watched enough of a sample of the material, but man, it's just really just, you try to watch his videos and it's just like, oh, it's 30 million people want to watch video games played by the world's most annoying person. This is totally sweet.
9604000	9615000	The viral phenomenon is very strange because it's very interesting who goes viral and who doesn't. I mean, look at us, we've been doing this fucking thing for 12 years and we're not a big show by any means.
9616000	9625000	There's still a lot of people out there that listen to a lot of podcasts, have no idea. There's been a gaming podcast for 12 years, but I'm okay with that because like you hit the nail on the head.
9625000	9635000	We're fortunate here at OLR that the people we do bring in are all pretty cool and the people that have bad attitudes tend to leave pretty quickly and I'm totally okay with that.
9636000	9641000	You hit the nail on the head, the 100 cool people outweighs 30 billion trolls, you know what I mean?
9642000	9644000	Dozens and dozens of hardcore fans.
9645000	9646000	That's right.
9646000	9664000	Like I said, I watch you guys and you guys are pretty genuine people. Everyone's been chasing that dollar and don't get me wrong, I chase the dollar too, but my first thing when I consider Tekken Games is the first goal is to not make the dollar first, but to make the community happy.
9664000	9687000	Yes. And you know what, I'm not slamming on these guys. Congrats to them, they did something right, they caught that viral wave. I'm happy for them, I am. I'm not familiar with their work because the great thing about the internet is that anybody can do this, so I prefer to just, there's plenty of content out there with friends and other indie people that I know that do stuff that keeps me busy.
9688000	9696000	One other thing, me, Hitstun and everyone else, we're on InstagibTV, no relation, but we do our thing on there and people are liking it.
9698000	9700000	Awesome. That's just a plug, right?
9701000	9714000	For both of us, yeah, like I said, we do our direct capture thing and we do our help thing, but I'm not concerned about like, oh man, one day I'll be 30 million because those 30 million will be hanging on every word you're saying.
9715000	9725000	That's true. And yeah, if PewDiePie says the wrong thing, there's going to be like a hate campaign on Twitter and all that stuff and I'm kind of glad on one hand that we don't have to deal with a lot of that yet.
9726000	9735000	I mean, I fear the day when one out of context thing I said in 12 years of broadcasting goes fucking viral. I mean, that is a fear we have to kind of live in a little bit.
9736000	9739000	Yeah, we're not that far above the radar for that to happen.
9740000	9741000	Hashtag I hate Rob.
9741000	9749000	Maybe. Who knows? Who knows? Go into our chat. I'm over at live.vognetwork.com. Martan is in our chat saying, you're right, Rob. You are the trending gamer, aw shucks.
9750000	9756000	And Fabrice says Sky is the mother of all social gamer celebrities. The drag mother, perhaps.
9757000	9758000	And how? You bet at stream.
9761000	9763000	Alright, Ravenstauff, anything else? Any other plugs?
9763000	9770000	One last thing I want to say. I want to say thanks for doing an early stream. Your stuff, when I do my stuff, is around your stuff.
9771000	9783000	So I'm never around to like to be a witness to a live broadcast and I want to say thank you for doing. I know this is for the international listeners, but I like that you're taking chances and saying, alright, three o'clock people.
9784000	9790000	Because I was listening to your last show, playing Halo, doing my thing. We're like, I'm going to join. I'm going to join. I'm going to join. I'm going to join.
9790000	9793000	And I'm glad that you did it. Thank you for making me a part of it.
9794000	9801000	It was for anybody who could be here. In all honesty, it was really so that we could go to dinner somewhere else tonight. But usually the early hour doesn't work for us.
9802000	9805000	So I'm happy it worked to get some other people in. Because we do want to be the show where every gamer has a voice.
9806000	9815000	Yeah, I appreciate it. I just want to say thank you and have a nice night. And Jamie, congrats on the MacBook. I am too poor for a MacBook.
9816000	9821000	Trust me, we'll talk. It took me a bit of doing.
9822000	9823000	So is she.
9824000	9825000	Take care, my friend. Bye.
9826000	9831000	1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. But the Skype line is lighting up with more calls, so let's get to it.
9832000	9833000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9834000	9836000	Hi, it's Fabrice.
9837000	9839000	Fabrice? Oh, this is one of our listeners in Belgium, isn't it?
9840000	9841000	Yeah, that's right.
9841000	9849000	What is up? Welcome to the show. I'm so excited that we get different people on tonight. I mean, I love the people that we hear from every week, don't get me wrong.
9850000	9853000	But I love that we mix it up a little bit tonight. Well, how are you, my friend?
9854000	9856000	Well, I'm fine. Thanks for doing the show.
9857000	9860000	You're welcome. Thank you for calling in. What's on your mind tonight?
9860000	9866000	Well, nothing really. I'd really like to call to say thank you for doing the show for so long.
9867000	9874000	So I've been through a rough time last couple of months, so you've kind of helped me get through it.
9875000	9880000	Wow. I'm blown away by that. You're welcome first.
9881000	9892000	And that's always the compliments that carry the most weight to hear people say that, like, I was having a shitty day and you took my mind off of it for three hours.
9893000	9900000	And I'm just like, that's such a huge compliment. Like, you don't even know. Because I know I have those shitty days.
9901000	9906000	I know how it makes me feel when somebody can kind of take me out of that mood. So thank you so much. That is such a huge compliment.
9906000	9914000	And thank you for telling us that because it just motivates us to go another 12 years. Right, Dan? Want to go for 12 more?
9915000	9920000	I guess. I ain't got nothing to do. I'll show up once every six months or so.
9921000	9923000	Go ahead.
9924000	9934000	Yeah, well, I'd like to tell that I miss the Sega that used to live a long time ago. I really miss their arcade games.
9934000	9936000	We do too.
9937000	9947000	Anybody with taste does, sir. I miss the Sega games. Well, at least there was that Sega Humble Bundle. I mean, is that kind of stuff open to the international crowd? Were you able to pick up that Sega Humble Bundle?
9948000	9952000	Yeah, but I already own most of those games.
9953000	9958000	Well, yeah, that happens too. That's like when they're giving away Mirror's Edge for free and you're like, oh, but I already own Mirror's Edge. Oh well.
9958000	9964000	Or Injustice is the PlayStation Plus game of the month. Oops, sorry about that. Oh well. That happens.
9965000	9974000	When they finally release the game again, you know, I buy it day one because they only release a couple of games a year anymore. So yeah.
9975000	9983000	Yeah, that's true. Sega's only going to put out a few things a year. Well, actually, I was hearing not so good things about the latest Sonic game on the Wii U.
9983000	9990000	I'm hearing it's Sonic 06 bad, and that's not good. That's really not good to hear. Yeah, it's pretty bad.
9991000	9993000	Yeah, I didn't even bother playing it.
9994000	9998000	I just want to see more outruns and Space Harriers and stuff like that, and it's gone.
9999000	10004000	Well, they have that one game that's supposed to come into the Wii U that was a Kickstarter, that 90s racing game or whatever. I forget what they call that.
10005000	10008000	Oh yeah, but that wasn't really, that was some personalities from Sega.
10008000	10010000	Not another 90s racer. That's what they should call it.
10011000	10016000	It wasn't even that. It was just a game done in the style of like Daytona USA and Sega Rally.
10017000	10018000	I don't know if it ever came out.
10019000	10020000	It's not out yet, but it looks good.
10021000	10024000	No, it's been postponed for like a year and a half now.
10025000	10027000	Of course. That's what happens to games. Of course that's what happens.
10028000	10032000	Yeah, they had all the trouble with the AI of the other 40 cars on track.
10033000	10034000	Oh my gosh.
10034000	10036000	And it's like, really, how hard can it be?
10037000	10040000	You know, you've made like a thousand games like this, you know?
10041000	10045000	Well, no, this was an indie guy that was doing it. It was someone that was making it in Unity or whatever.
10046000	10047000	Oh, that's cool.
10048000	10049000	Did you say it was going to be 40 players?
10050000	10055000	The thing that bugs me most about Sega right now is what's going on with Phantasy Star, because they refuse to release that shit in the US.
10056000	10060000	Like, Japan just got Phantasy Star Nova on the Vita, and I really want to play that, and it's like a Vita game, right?
10060000	10066000	And they're, nope, not coming out in the US. Nope. Unless there's a surprise announcement at E3 or something.
10067000	10070000	It's very frustrating. But at least we're getting you Cruise of Five, I guess.
10071000	10074000	And you've got to wonder why Sony's not on that. Why Sony's not just like, hey, Sega.
10075000	10076000	Yeah, right?
10077000	10081000	Let's make it worth your while, because in Japan, Phantasy Star is what's keeping that shit running.
10082000	10084000	That's the reason there is a Vita.
10085000	10087000	Let's get your nose out of Nintendo's butt and put it in ours.
10087000	10095000	Exactly. See, I'm upset because Phantasy Star hasn't been Phantasy Star since, like, the days of the Genesis.
10096000	10102000	You know, I would love to have a Phantasy Star game that's an RPG and not like its weird little quasi-MMO.
10103000	10110000	But MMOs today owe a lot to Phantasy Star Online. Like, Phantasy Star Online defined, you know, we're talking about generation-defining games.
10111000	10115000	Phantasy Star Online is a generation-defining game of its day.
10115000	10122000	Sure. Yeah, there's no doubt that it's the first kind of online adventure. Yeah, it was a big thing.
10123000	10124000	But I would love to see a Phantasy Star game.
10125000	10131000	Dungeon Buster, in your camp over at our live chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, I'd really like to see another Phantasy Star in the same vein as Phantasy Stars 1 through 4.
10132000	10133000	It'll probably never happen, but I can always hope.
10134000	10138000	I would love to see real localizations of Generation 1 and Generation 2, which were on PS2.
10139000	10143000	I played a fan translation of Generation 1. It was awesome.
10143000	10147000	Yeah? Awesome. Well, Fabrice, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?
10148000	10150000	Yeah, well, you know, Shenmue 3.
10151000	10152000	No kidding, huh?
10153000	10155000	Yeah. It'll probably never happen, but you know.
10156000	10157000	No, no.
10158000	10164000	Well, never say never, because who ever thought that we would finally get Final Fantasy VII on the PlayStation 4? And here we are!
10165000	10166000	We did it! We did it, everybody!
10167000	10169000	Shenmue 3 is more important than Final Fantasy VII.
10169000	10179000	I actually agree with you there. Honestly, coming out of the PlayStation Expo, this is the first time this has ever happened, and some people have been waiting decades for this.
10180000	10184000	People walked out of the PlayStation Expo more excited for Suikoden than they were for Final Fantasy.
10185000	10187000	Do you know how long some people have been waiting for this day?
10188000	10189000	What, for Suikoden?
10190000	10192000	People were more excited about Suikoden news than Final Fantasy news.
10193000	10194000	Right, they're doing a new Suikoden?
10195000	10198000	No, they're just re-releasing an old one, and it's still more exciting than Final Fantasy VII.
10199000	10201000	How's it going? Can Ami get the...
10202000	10208000	Fabrice, I gotta let you go so we can get some more callers, but thank you so, so, so much for calling in and the nice words. We really appreciate it.
10209000	10210000	Okay, thank you guys.
10211000	10212000	Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.
10213000	10218000	That's so awesome that we have people international in a country that I'll never be able to afford to fly to.
10219000	10220000	Who likes Sega.
10221000	10222000	Yes, who loves Sega. It has such good taste.
10223000	10224000	You chose a good day to call.
10224000	10226000	I'm glad we could do the earlier show to make it work.
10227000	10229000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10230000	10237000	Let me quickly go to the Twittersphere and see if, as I thought I saw some tweets coming in earlier before the show,
10238000	10242000	but you know, I am such a great radio host that I didn't bring up the Twitter in advance,
10243000	10246000	but I'm doing it now, because live radio is a joy.
10247000	10248000	Production!
10249000	10250000	And everybody on the house is on the internet.
10250000	10252000	Kidman Project tweeted us and said,
10253000	10256000	Bloody typical, I'm missing the convergence of our time streams,
10257000	10260000	so here's a big cheers for always making my Mondays less shit.
10261000	10264000	So, he's over in the UK, but it sounds like he couldn't make it today anyway.
10265000	10266000	So, that's too bad.
10267000	10271000	Let's see, yeah, there's some thoughts from Twitter, so let's go to another call.
10272000	10274000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10276000	10277000	Hi, this is Raginator.
10278000	10279000	Hey, Raginator, buddy. How you doing?
10280000	10282000	Pretty good, how are you?
10283000	10286000	Eh, no, we're doing really good. What's on your mind?
10287000	10293000	Well, I was going to touch on something that you were mentioning earlier in the news segment.
10294000	10295000	Go for it.
10296000	10308000	Yeah, you were mentioning how Steam, just the other day, introduced the Steam broadcasting feature on their server.
10308000	10312000	Yeah, they're like answering a Twitch in a way that's built into the service, yeah?
10313000	10321000	Yes, well, to go into a little detail to really participate in terms of broadcasting yourself,
10322000	10332000	you have to opt into their beta program, which you do there by going to your options on Steam.
10332000	10339000	Yes, it's a good reminder to check, because I thought I was already opted in, and apparently I wasn't.
10340000	10344000	So, when I couldn't see broadcasting in there, I was like, what the hell, I thought I was in the beta stuff, but I wasn't.
10345000	10346000	So, yeah, check that out.
10346000	10360000	The trouble is, the update that they released, I think it was on Thursday night, or Friday night, I think it was on, probably Thursday night,
10361000	10366000	but anyway, the update had a major flaw.
10366000	10380000	It worked, completely and utterly worked, this one file, I think it's called steamui.dl, for a lot of people,
10381000	10393000	and to the point where if you were to close Steam for whatever reason, and that file was worked for you,
10393000	10395000	you would not be able to relaunch Steam.
10396000	10404000	How do you know that this happened to you? Because I, of course, am getting all the updates, so now you have me a little worried that I'm going to have to reinstall everything.
10405000	10408000	Do you get an error message that makes it very clear that this happens to you?
10409000	10420000	Yeah, if you were to close, let's say for the sake of conversation, you were to close Steam right now, and then try to launch it again,
10421000	10437000	you'll see like a little dialog box that says fatal error, and then it'll list SteamUI.dll as being the issue.
10438000	10448000	So you can't just have it scan your computer and find all the games again, you actually have to go in and redownload everything, which that's a lot, oh my gosh, that's so much.
10449000	10459000	Yeah, yeah, well, some people are saying that you can rescan, assuming that you got the games on like a separate hard drive.
10460000	10470000	Now, if the problem is with me, A, I didn't know that, and B, I get my games between two drives, an internal hard drive and an external hard drive.
10470000	10485000	And at least with the stuff that's on the Steam hard drive and the Steam application itself, when I went to uninstall Steam, it deleted the games that were on the Steam hard drive, so I had to reinstall those anyways.
10486000	10494000	Well, Raginator, I think this might be a challenge, but only install those games you're actually playing, and that should cut it down to like 100 megs.
10495000	10497000	Only install the games you're actually playing.
10497000	10512000	Yeah, well, you know, the trouble with me is, you know, sure, there's certain games that I consider my go-to games, like, you know, me, I go on and on and on about the Magic the Gathering games.
10513000	10516000	Of course, that's alright, it's like Me and WoW, or Final Fantasy.
10517000	10530000	Yeah, but at the same time, you know, I have a lot of games that I haven't touched yet, and now I've been always the type to, yeah, I'm probably going to get around to it.
10531000	10543000	And a lot of times when I'm not playing the Magic the Gathering games or, you know, the Geometry Wars, you know, well, I end up choosing a status usually just totally seemingly random.
10543000	10548000	You know, one second I could feel like playing Sam and Max, and the next second I could see them.
10549000	10560000	Alright, so because you have what I lovingly refer to, because I have this too, as gamer ADD, you just, you need all your games there at a moment's notice, because you might have to switch from one, you know, to another in five minutes.
10561000	10562000	I understand, I understand.
10562000	10563000	Exactly.
10564000	10573000	Alright, so lesson learned, wait another week, maybe don't opt into these betas, because you might lose everything, who knows, or back things up, or just be careful, be careful.
10574000	10579000	Alright, Rachel, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but take care my friend.
10580000	10582000	Sure, bye, have a good one.
10583000	10584000	Bye, good luck with all the restoration.
10585000	10591000	At least, you know, I mean, especially if you're capped on your bandwidth, I don't know how you're going to manage in that situation, that's just going to suck.
10592000	10605000	But at least he didn't lose the digital rights, because I still remember that guy had a problem a few years ago on his PlayStation 3 or something, where he tried to download all this video, and then like, it disappeared, and he couldn't, like, re-download him. I just remember that was a huge issue.
10606000	10611000	I think you can just re-download the DLL, the Steam UI, you don't have to re-download all your games.
10611000	10615000	I don't know, but I would think Rage Nator probably poked around on the Steam forums, and you know.
10616000	10617000	Well, who knows.
10618000	10628000	Hopefully, who knows, who knows. That's usually what I do. The first thing I do is I Google it, and I narrow down the search to the last 24 hours, or today, to try to see if other people are posting and bitching about the problems.
10629000	10633000	Alright, we are going to take one more call, so we've got one more call coming in here, and then we'll wrap up. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10634000	10635000	This is Eric RPG.
10636000	10637000	Hey, Eric RPG, how you doing?
10638000	10639000	Fine.
10639000	10640000	Good to hear from you.
10640000	10641000	Going on, undergoing a cold, I think.
10642000	10647000	Oh, no. I somehow have avoided the sick thing, knock on wood, somehow avoided that. Well, what's on your mind today, my friend?
10648000	10653000	I just want to talk about one game in particular I played this week that I should warn everybody not to play.
10654000	10655000	Uh-oh, what's that?
10656000	10661000	This is a game called Haunted House Crypt of Graves, which is actually a remake of the original Atari Haunted House game.
10662000	10669000	Oh, we've reported that this was a thing on this show before, because I remember, I don't know if you're old enough to remember the 2600 version, but I remember the 2600 version.
10670000	10672000	It was, for its day, it was awesome.
10673000	10674000	It was brilliant.
10675000	10678000	It's not exactly the game that I go, gosh, they should remake that.
10679000	10683000	Yeah, but when you're, like, five years old, that game is, like, awesome.
10684000	10687000	Yeah, it was awesome. So it doesn't hold up well, huh, Eric?
10688000	10697000	Yeah, basically what they did is they made it a first-person adventure type of game, but they also made it kind of like Amnesia, but they failed miserably in every conceivable way.
10697000	10698000	Oh, no.
10699000	10704000	The controls are sluggish and awkward, and there's lots of graphical glitches.
10705000	10712000	Like, I was running away from invisible enemies, and apparently the only way to see them is to use this, like, supernatural vision that this character has.
10713000	10719000	But I was jumping up around trying to get away from them, and I ended up on top of them for some reason.
10720000	10721000	Whoa.
10722000	10724000	Yeah, unfortunately the house has trouble rendering.
10724000	10740000	Not only that, but the staircase that you took to get down to that place, you can go down it just fine, but you have to actually jump up the stairs because they didn't design it in such a way that you could just walk back up it, and it's awkward as heck to get back up there.
10741000	10746000	You can go down the stairs, but you can't go up. What kind of house is this? This is like the Winchester Mystery House. What is this?
10747000	10748000	It's like a roach motel.
10749000	10759000	There's really terrible voice acting, and for some reason the voice acting of the old man character is somehow worse audio quality than the main characters.
10760000	10769000	Wow. Oh my god. It's like people probably recorded it over Skype, which is fine for doing a show like this, but not for voice acting. You're going to actually put it in a video game.
10769000	10780000	Waynein1 in our chat room says, I just saw a video of Haunted House today on YouTube. Looked pretty bad. DungeonBuster says, the original is awesome, just a pair of eyes bumping into walls and the scary lightning.
10781000	10791000	Never mind the games using Unreal Engine 4, but it's like totally not taking advantage of it, and it looks terrible, and it's so unoptimized that even my PC can't run it very well.
10792000	10798000	My PC isn't the greatest. I'm still using a dual core, but it should be running somewhat confidently.
10799000	10801000	It should be better than it is. I'm sorry to hear that.
10802000	10809000	I'm going to give this game a 1 out of 10 on GameTactics.com. I'm not even going to bother finishing it because it's that bad.
10810000	10814000	It's so bad. Don't check it out. Now everyone's going to check it out because they want to see how bad it is.
10815000	10821000	So what you've done is unwittingly lead people into the trap. You're part of the problem. You're not the solution.
10822000	10825000	Is it showgirls bad? Because that's kind of good when it's that bad.
10826000	10827000	It's not so bad. It's good.
10827000	10829000	Okay, that's too bad. It's just bad.
10830000	10831000	Yeah? Well you don't know shit.
10832000	10837000	You are a whore, darlin'. Alright, well we gotta go. We're going to go eat some brown rice and vegetables.
10838000	10839000	Alright, take care my friend.
10840000	10842000	I'm ordering a hamburger. Rob's going to have dog chow.
10843000	10845000	I don't think Eric got the joke, the showgirls joke, but yes.
10846000	10847000	Hi, Alan's here. Hi Alan.
10848000	10849000	Hi. What's up? Do you want candy?
10849000	10857000	Yes, candy, candy, candy, candy. Yay. Ooh, he brought me the really yummy. Oh, in theme with tonight's show, we were talking about Australia earlier.
10858000	10860000	This is Australian black licorice.
10861000	10862000	Dude, sweet. I love black licorice.
10863000	10864000	We can eat it in the car with Jamie.
10865000	10866000	I'm going to be so nauseous.
10867000	10871000	I know some people can't stand black licorice, but I love it. Dan, it must be a Dutch thing.
10872000	10873000	Maybe.
10874000	10878000	I can't stand black licorice, so when I get that I'm being super nice because it's candy that I can't have.
10879000	10881000	I've bought Dan some before and then I left the house.
10882000	10884000	I've bought him mayonnaise and you all know how I feel about mayonnaise.
10885000	10886000	I love mayonnaise.
10887000	10888000	Alan, let's have a mayonnaise party.
10889000	10890000	Do you have a mayonnaise and black licorice sandwich?
10891000	10895000	The worst thing in the world is a tuna, because canned tuna is also, I can't stand.
10896000	10900000	So he makes those fucking tuna fish sandwiches. That's what, canned tuna and mayonnaise.
10901000	10905000	It's like licking up, like, you know, oozing up a side of mayonnaise.
10906000	10907000	God, I gotta shit. Alright.
10907000	10914000	Alright, well that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight. Thanks to everybody who called in, appreciate it.
10915000	10920000	If you didn't get through or you'd like to participate with the show, maybe you forgot that the show was early tonight, so you're listening at the six o'clock hour.
10921000	10927000	You can always tweet us at twitter.com slash o-l-r or you can always email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
10928000	10936000	But we are going to go around and start to wrap up the show because I don't believe Loki had any last minute stories, nor does Jamie or Dan, so that's it.
10937000	10941000	Thank you guys very much for being here. Those of you guys that tuned in live at the earlier hour, appreciate it.
10942000	10947000	Those of you guys that forgot, that are kicking yourselves, that are listening on the repeat, sorry, but we'll be back at our regular time next week.
10948000	10951000	And those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're all still awesome.
10952000	10955000	And I would love to hear from those of you guys, we had an emailer this week that said he'd been listening for like nine years.
10956000	10958000	I'd love to hear from more of you, especially those of you that have been listening for years and years.
10959000	10960000	Yeah, well I've been listening for twelve years.
10961000	10962000	I've been dealing with this crap for twelve years.
10963000	10964000	I've been ignoring for twelve years, no I'm kidding.
10964000	10971000	That's what I want for Chris McQuanzica. I want emails from listeners that have never emailed us before that have been listening for a long time, or even a short time.
10972000	10976000	That's what I want. You want to give me a really easy Chris McQuanzica gift? Give me that. Why is Alan wagging his finger?
10977000	10978000	A dozen unique emails.
10979000	10980000	Yeah, right.
10981000	10989000	The only caveat to that is that if you've been listening to the show for like nine, ten, eleven years, don't say, I started the sixth grade and now I'm at a bar.
10990000	10991000	So don't do that.
10991000	10997000	No, no, that's awesome. You should totally do that because if you're listening to this show in the sixth grade, you've got problems.
10998000	11000000	And we've contributed to those problems.
11001000	11005000	Yeah, don't tell me that you were in elementary school and you started listening and now you have your own kids. That I don't need to hear.
11006000	11011000	Oh come on, one of our listeners was in high school when he started and now he's my coworker.
11012000	11013000	I can't, I can't.
11014000	11018000	Anyhow, Dan, I want to thank you so much for being here tonight. You're always a fun time to have on the show.
11019000	11020000	I didn't have anything better to do.
11021000	11023000	I understand. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
11024000	11025000	No, no I do not.
11026000	11027000	Alright, sounds good.
11028000	11029000	You know you can just take that cabinet because he's just not going to use it.
11030000	11031000	No, you can't take that cabinet.
11032000	11033000	I want to use it.
11034000	11035000	He just said I could take it, so it's happening.
11036000	11037000	No, take it back. Alright, let's see. Loki, your final thought tonight.
11038000	11042000	Speaking of cabinets that aren't being used, I have to dust off my arcade cabinet at home.
11043000	11044000	It's not easy is it?
11044000	11052000	We're turning that room into a playroom, so it's still going to stay there because thank God I don't have to move it out because I don't, I barely made it.
11053000	11065000	My hallway, the way it is, I have to make like two sharp 90 degree turns to get the arcade cabinet in there and there literally was like maybe a half quarter of an inch clearance.
11066000	11068000	Is it the same one that was in your guys' apartment?
11069000	11070000	No, oh God.
11071000	11073000	No, we moved, we moved that thing upstairs.
11074000	11082000	We moved to an upstairs apartment like, ah, that is getting dismantled. That is not coming with us. I am not lifting that upstairs.
11083000	11085000	No, I have a Sega Astro City that I have.
11086000	11087000	Okay, you have a candy.
11088000	11090000	Yeah, so I have that and it's all nice and redone, but I don't use it ever.
11091000	11102000	I have Street Fighter IV on it though with my nice octagonal restrictor plates and shit that still doesn't make me any better at the game, but it's nice.
11102000	11113000	Alright, my final thought tonight is I want to thank Dan for running and getting tacos during the show. There's no, there's no better way to say I'm a good friend than to buy somebody a taco.
11114000	11115000	Add a hungry wife.
11116000	11119000	Alright, and speaking of hungry wife, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
11120000	11123000	I fucking love my new computer. It's so fucking pretty.
11124000	11128000	Hey, by the way, the local Toys R Us has those ColecoVision flashback consoles.
11129000	11130000	It sucks. Don't get it.
11130000	11131000	I got the Intellivision one.
11132000	11135000	The controllers are not good at all. The Intellivision one is sweet.
11136000	11138000	Yeah, I got the Intellivision one. I haven't got the ColecoVision one.
11139000	11143000	I was thinking of it as more a gift for my dad because he had a ColecoVision that he gave me a long time ago, so...
11144000	11146000	The controllers are almost unusable.
11147000	11149000	Alright, and it seems like you guys liked really...
11156000	11157000	Oh, yeah.
11157000	11162000	Dan, sorry, I didn't realize Dan was talking and not into a mic. Sorry, guys. That's definitely the time to...
11163000	11164000	Sorry, we're having a side conversation about it.
11165000	11166000	Yeah, clearly, clearly, and I'm trying to wrap up the show.
11167000	11169000	We can talk about ColecoVision flashback for like 45 more minutes.
11170000	11171000	No, no, no, no. We got to wrap up.
11172000	11177000	I do want to say, Wayne in one in chat says, thanks guys for doing this early show. Great to be able to tune in live for the first time since 2006.
11178000	11181000	You know, it seems like a lot of you guys like the earlier show, so it's something we'll have to consider.
11182000	11186000	I mean, we can't do it all the times, and certainly the folks that are used to six o'clock that can't be here at this time don't want us to do it all the time.
11187000	11191000	But we will definitely consider doing more of these in the future as we can work it out in our schedule.
11192000	11193000	It'll be random OLR times.
11194000	11198000	Man, this is so much easier to do with a laptop than on my old iPad.
11199000	11203000	You know, we have to do a show some week at like four in the morning, so that way our friends in Japan can tune in and listen.
11204000	11205000	Okay.
11206000	11208000	That's it, guys. Thank you so much for tuning in to another edition of Orange Laundry.
11209000	11215000	We'll be back next week, normal time, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at vognetwork.com, but 24-7 on the podcast feed.
11215000	11217000	Have a great week, everybody. Happy gaming.
11218000	11219000	Stay black.
11245000	11247000	See you next week.
11275000	11282000	.
