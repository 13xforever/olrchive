146000	148000	Cause it's also Foodmas
148000	154000	You know what, this time of year, I celebrate everything because there's great food with every holiday
154000	156000	What did you get for the holidays?
156000	157000	Food
157000	158000	Fat
158000	160000	Exactly, exactly right
160000	163000	Also say hello in the studio to Techmaster Loki
163000	164000	Hello
164000	165000	Hi Loki, how are you?
165000	166000	Doing alright
166000	169000	Alright, we were reminiscing a little bit before the show
169000	173000	This week was Stephen Colbert's last show on Comedy Central
173000	175000	It was a little bit sad
175000	176000	It was a little bit sad
176000	181000	I didn't watch it because I don't cable, but I did watch the YouTube of the last 10 minutes of the show
181000	182000	Of course
182000	184000	And it's like, oh man, it's
184000	188000	It was well done, let me put it that way
188000	194000	It's disappointing to see him going off the air, but he'll move on to better things
194000	199000	It's only for six months because he's gonna be in a slot where he'll get exposed to even more people
199000	201000	Taking over for David Letterman
201000	206000	And a lot of people I think are concerned because he hosted the Colbert Report as a persona
206000	211000	And he's gonna be hosting the Late Show as himself
212000	215000	It's like, seriously, have you seen anything else?
215000	218000	Yeah, he followed him for a long time, even on the Daily Show
218000	224000	And my favorite TV show of all time ever was one that he co-created called Strangers with Candy
224000	229000	Which I don't understand how that only ran for a few seasons because it was just brilliant
229000	230000	It was really brilliant
230000	233000	Yeah, I don't know why, it got cancelled in favor of Strip Mall
233000	237000	Which, you know, I love me some Julie Brown, but I just don't understand why Strangers with Candy
238000	243000	But anyway, it was the best TV show and Stephen Colbert was on it and he was hilarious
243000	247000	I actually, and you might be wondering, why are you talking about Stephen Colbert on your video game show?
247000	251000	Well, A, because he's awesome, and does he have a video game? He really should
251000	257000	Technically he is involved video game wise because he did have a song that was in Rock Band, remember?
257000	259000	Oh, that's right, that's right
259000	261000	Charlene, I'm Right Behind You
261000	265000	Yeah, but that was from the 80s, that wasn't even something he did recently
265000	268000	That was a long time ago when he was first starting out, that's right, I remember that
268000	273000	But I truly consider the man an inspiration, so I am like really happy for him
273000	278000	You know, some of you that listen to the show for a while know that I'm a corporate trainer by day
278000	284000	And so I consider his teacher character in Strangers with Candy like an inspiration
284000	286000	Not that I literally do a lot of that stuff in class
286000	291000	Where's your permission slip, Mr. Knoblet? Shut your dirty little mouth!
291000	293000	That's just amazing, anyway
293000	295000	Ah, good times
295000	297000	There should be a Strangers with Candy video game
297000	301000	That would be an amazing idea for the video game jam that's kicking off tonight
301000	303000	If it wasn't something copier
303000	305000	Or Telltale Games
305000	307000	Maybe that's something Telltale Games can adapt
307000	314000	You know what, if he really wanted to, well, obviously he's gonna be really busy with the late show
314000	319000	But man, if he really wanted to bring Strangers with Candy back, I think he'd probably do it now
320000	324000	Bobby's in our chatroom saying that Stephen Colbert made that song recently
324000	327000	He just made it look like the 80s, but it was a new song
327000	331000	I was convinced it was before from his XF57 days or something
331000	333000	I was convinced it was from a long time ago
333000	335000	That's hilarious
335000	339000	Alright, and in chat they mentioned that he's way into Lord of the Rings
339000	341000	I heard he has a cameo in the movie
341000	343000	He does have a cameo in the movie
343000	347000	And he also did like a photoshoot where he was dressed up like all the characters
347000	350000	It's pretty awesome, they did some really good makeup jobs on him
350000	352000	Amazing, amazing
352000	355000	Let's get into some video game news
355000	362000	I know, I have, I think, officially lost interest in these things because it's just been too crazy
362000	365000	But if they made one out of Stephen Colbert, I might be interested again
365000	368000	And I'm gonna talk about the Amiibos
368000	372000	And, you know, we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show when they were first launching
372000	374000	We didn't really know what they were
374000	379000	And Nintendo really, I mean, for all practical purposes didn't really reveal what the hell these things were gonna do until the last minute
379000	385000	And I don't think people still understood it until they finally played Smash Brothers and got to use the Amiibo
385000	388000	Or unlock stuff in Mario Kart or so forth
388000	394000	But this Amiibo stuff, I mean, I don't know if it's just the perspective of me as a gamer
394000	397000	But this stuff really feels like it's like the Beanie Babies of this year
397000	399000	It is nuts
399000	402000	It's just, I don't know, I still don't see the point to it
402000	407000	I mean, yeah, it's cool, don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to have collectibles and stuff like that
407000	410000	If you wanna put that stuff up on a shelf and have it look nice, then that's fine
410000	412000	Those things look pretty cool
412000	416000	But I just think, like, even looking at, like, the Pop figures and stuff like that
416000	419000	I think those look more interesting than some of the Amiibo figures
419000	423000	And that was always my complaint with not only just the Amiibos
423000	428000	But also the Skylanders and the Disney Infinity stuff
428000	431000	They're stuck to that base, you can't do anything for them
431000	436000	I think it would be awesome, like, you know, kind of like look at Legos or something like that
436000	439000	Where, like, the figure would come off and you'd be able to do stuff with that
439000	443000	Now I understand that, you know, they would be afraid of losing the base or something like that
443000	446000	But somehow get that RFID chip in there where you could do that
446000	449000	I sort of understand why these things took off though
449000	457000	And I think that just speaks to the volume of the classicness and pop culture infusedness
457000	460000	Of the characters that Nintendo has created
460000	464000	Which, you know, last week we were talking about the Sony hacks and the movie
464000	466000	That, you know, the Mario movie
466000	469000	And we talked about how, you know, this movie is gonna be big
469000	471000	No matter what, even if it's bad, it's animated
471000	476000	And there's gonna be tons of people that are gonna take their own kids to see a Super Mario Brothers movie
476000	479000	Because they grew up with Mario Brothers, right?
479000	482000	I mean, you did, you know, you did your kid's room in all Mario Brothers stuff
482000	483000	Yeah
483000	485000	Which was amazing, by the way
485000	487000	But it just speaks to the volume that these characters are
487000	490000	By the way, quick follow up, because I shouldn't work this in at some point
490000	495000	There is a quick follow up to the whole Sony hack and the movie leak stuff
495000	499000	And that is a little bit of a coyness out of Miyamoto about the Mario movie leak
499000	501000	And he said, I heard something about that this morning
501000	503000	What's interesting is that over the past 20 years
503000	507000	People come to us on a fairly regular basis about creating Mario movies
507000	510000	There are times that those ideas end right when they bring them to us
510000	512000	And other times we'll listen to presentations
512000	515000	It's not very unusual and it's something we've been doing for a very long time
515000	520000	I don't particularly have a vision that the next iteration of Mario is going to be in film
520000	522000	Here's the thing
522000	524000	I get that answer totally
524000	527000	But it is absolutely a non-answer answer
527000	529000	And I think in Miyamoto's head
529000	531000	The next iteration of Mario Brothers will not be in film
531000	535000	I would think that Miyamoto probably never wanted that first film to happen
535000	537000	But I also think that
537000	541000	It's been enough time now to where we can kind of forget about that
541000	544000	And I also think ultimately it's not up to Miyamoto
544000	546000	Like yes, I understand, he's the granddaddy of it
546000	548000	But at the end of the day
548000	550000	If a boardroom signs off on it, it's going to happen
550000	552000	Look at this way, okay
552000	554000	There's Batman and Robin
554000	556000	And now there's the new Christopher Nolan movies
556000	559000	Which, you know, one does not soil the rest
559000	561000	I mean, if anything, it makes them better
561000	563000	So I don't think just because there was
563000	566000	And don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the Mario Brothers movie
566000	568000	I know it was kind of stupid, but you know what?
568000	570000	A lot of the movies that came out around the same time were kind of stupid
570000	573000	Judge Dredd had some really stupid moments to it
573000	575000	You know, just something like that
575000	577000	I'm okay with that
577000	579000	Because that was just kind of the way things were
579000	582000	Like Double Dragon, remember how terrible that movie was?
582000	584000	It's just
584000	586000	It was loosely based on it, but it was just kind of like
586000	588000	That was just how it was going
588000	590000	Anyway, not to digress too much
590000	593000	I consider that a non-answer answer out of Miyamoto
593000	596000	And ultimately, as rough as this is to hear
596000	598000	I don't think it's up to him at the end of the day
598000	602000	And also that answer wasn't really him saying no
602000	606000	He just says, I think the next thing is not going to be a movie
606000	608000	But I don't know, it still strikes me as a non-answer answer
608000	610000	But anyway, rewinding a little bit
610000	612000	I want to talk about the amiibos
612000	614000	Because, you know, the reason why these things are doing so well
614000	618000	Is it just speaks to the strength of the characters
618000	620000	Behind these amiibo
620000	623000	And I don't think it has really anything to do with the game functionality at all
623000	626000	I think grown adults want to collect those little toys
626000	629000	Because it's okay
629000	631000	It's okay, unlike Beanie Babies
631000	633000	For whatever, it's socially acceptable
633000	637000	For 30-year-old men and women to be collecting those toys
637000	639000	Unlike Beanie Babies, which kind of got the grandma stigma
639000	643000	There's grown people that collect those Skylanders and the Disney infinity stuff as well
643000	646000	So, you know, I'm not surprised
646000	648000	So, anyway
648000	651000	So, amiibo is going crazy this holiday season
651000	655000	Whether you think they're useful in the games or not
655000	657000	People want those figurines
657000	659000	And it's kind of becoming a mess
659000	661000	And for me personally
661000	664000	This whole freak-out around it
664000	666000	Is kind of turning me off to it in a big way
666000	669000	But for some people it just drives them even more
669000	672000	But some of the big news that came out about amiibo this week
672000	676000	Is that Toys R Us started cancelling amiibo pre-orders and purchases
676000	678000	Pretty much out of the blue
678000	681000	A big chunk of this was the Lucario amiibo pre-orders
681000	684000	Which I believe, wasn't that the figure that's going to be exclusive to Toys R Us?
684000	686000	I don't remember
687000	690000	I can't keep track of which ones are exclusive where
690000	692000	Because it's a big mess
692000	695000	So, people have called Toys R Us to figure out what's going on
695000	698000	They've been advised that Nintendo did a product delay
698000	701000	And that amiibo are being cancelled as a result
701000	705000	Until there is a clear indication of how much stock there's going to be to get in
705000	707000	Well, that sounds like Nintendo
707000	711000	Now there's speculation that this wave 3 might be held back until beyond February
711000	715000	To make sure there is enough amiibo figures to meet the demand
715000	717000	Which is very high
717000	719000	I can see that
719000	723000	And once again, before I was kind of under the suspicion that it was an artificial shortage
723000	725000	But maybe not anymore
725000	727000	But then again, I just
727000	729000	I don't know how hard these things could be to manufacture
729000	731000	It's a piece of plastic with an RFID chip in it
731000	733000	I mean
733000	735000	I can't imagine it being that difficult
735000	738000	Some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
738000	741000	YYR says Nintendo should capitalize on the amiibo popularity
741000	745000	By actually delivering some new games and long ignored franchises
745000	747000	Next year is going to be really interesting
747000	751000	To see, you know, instead of having to back end amiibo into existing ideas
751000	754000	Which I think they had to do for a lot of games this year
754000	756000	Even Smash Brothers to an extent
756000	758000	I think they did it well in Smash Brothers
758000	761000	But I still think that was something that was kind of added on late in development
761000	765000	But next year as we start to look to games like Splatoon and Mario Maker
765000	769000	It's going to be very interesting to see how the amiibo work in the games from the outset
769000	771000	Let's see, also some comments in our chatroom
771000	773000	We have
773000	775000	Let's see
775000	778000	Act F saying that I had a Lucario amiibo preordered and got cancelled
778000	780000	Kaijuto says I'm an adult
780000	782000	I buy amiibos not to collect them
782000	784000	I buy them to train them to fight
784000	788000	I actually think, Kaijuto, while I certainly respect that perspective
788000	790000	And I don't think you're alone in that
790000	792000	I kind of actually think
792000	795000	I think more people are buying this not to use them with Smash Brothers necessarily
796000	799000	If what I see on Twitter and all that is any indication
799000	801000	Granted, that's my perception of the world
801000	804000	But I just get the feeling that more people are buying these
804000	807000	Just because they're Nintendo figurines than anything else
807000	809000	I don't know, what do you think, Loki?
809000	811000	I think definitely that they would be buying them
811000	814000	I don't know, I've seen better Nintendo figurines
814000	818000	I have some of the better Nintendo figurines in my son's room
818000	820000	That's kind of my thing
821000	825000	These are like, what, twelve bucks for a teeny tiny figure
825000	829000	And I've seen better action figures that cost less than that
829000	834000	It kind of bugs me that they're so expensive because of that
834000	837000	Now by the way, Loki, this is kind of funny that you said that about the card
837000	839000	Because I do want to throw out here
839000	841000	That Miyamoto has actually addressed that
841000	843000	In an interview that he did with ABC
843000	845000	He actually said
845000	847000	We're not making promises for certain figures
847000	849000	But the way amiibo is designed
849000	852000	Is that certain games can have amiibo specifically for that game
852000	854000	Other games can take advantage of past amiibo
854000	856000	That developers want to make their game compatible with
856000	858000	In the future, we have the option
858000	861000	If certain amiibo figures are no longer available in stores
861000	865000	To release an amiibo in card form with the same functionality
865000	868000	So they're out there
868000	870000	It's going to be a matter of time
870000	873000	That someone's just going to hack that anyways
873000	875000	And then you'll just buy a card
875000	877000	And it'll be whatever amiibo you want
878000	880000	I don't know
880000	882000	I just
882000	884000	I'm not getting into it
884000	886000	It probably doesn't help that I don't have a Wii U
886000	888000	But even if I had a Wii U
888000	890000	I don't think I'd really want to buy these things
890000	892000	It just seems like a big waste of money
892000	894000	But you know what
894000	897000	There's a lot of things I'd buy that are probably a waste of money to other people
897000	899000	That's true
899000	901000	Whatever you want to spend your money on
901000	903000	Jamie, I'm dying to check in with you and your perspective
903000	905000	Let me get to a couple other comments in chat first
905000	907000	Kaijuto, I love this comment
907000	909000	I was burned as a kid when I wanted Star Wars toys
909000	911000	And could never find them
911000	913000	I had no idea grown men were buying them
913000	915000	To keep them in a bahox
915000	917000	Sg100Matt says
917000	919000	They're Nintendo's beanie babies
919000	921000	People will collect the fuck out of them if there is a demand for them
921000	924000	Jamie, you're no stranger to video game collecting
924000	926000	You've done your own in the past
926000	928000	But surely you've got to be looking at this going
928000	930000	This is big
930000	932000	What do you think?
932000	934000	Dan and I already decided it was a waste of money for us
934000	936000	Really?
936000	938000	And I don't need to have any in my cubicle now
938000	940000	Because my neighbor purchased them and put them up on our cubicle wall
940000	942000	So I now have the never ending battle
942000	944000	Between Red Rico and Link
944000	946000	Now is that because you're not a Wii U owner at this time?
946000	948000	That you don't really have an interest in amiibo?
948000	950000	I probably wouldn't have an interest in it anyway
950000	952000	Interesting
952000	954000	I could have played Skylanders if I wanted to
954000	956000	I could have played Disney Infinity if I wanted to
956000	958000	I have a Rocket Raccoon
958000	960000	That's all I care about
960000	962000	Which I have to thank Codeman for
962000	964000	But um
964000	966000	I
966000	968000	I don't really care
968000	970000	I hardly play my DS anymore
970000	972000	I've been playing lots of Dragon Age
972000	974000	If there were you know
974000	976000	Dragon Age amiibo
976000	978000	Figures that I could
978000	980000	Model
980000	982000	I wouldn't even do that probably
982000	984000	I don't know if they had a
984000	986000	Garrus figure that unlocked something
986000	988000	in the game you'd probably be on that
988000	990000	So you think this
990000	992000	So I think I'm hearing this
992000	994000	I don't want to put words in your mouth
994000	996000	But this is what I seem to be hearing
996000	998000	Is that maybe you're shifting away
998000	1000000	And you've kind of been shifting for the past couple years
1000000	1002000	Away from consoles more to PC
1002000	1004000	Pretty much
1004000	1006000	You know I um
1006000	1008000	Actually right around the time I had my hand surgery
1008000	1010000	Yeah
1010000	1012000	Was when I started making the shift
1012000	1014000	Just because it hurt to hold a controller for too long
1014000	1016000	Makes sense
1016000	1018000	And um
1018000	1020000	I was identifying my games
1020000	1022000	Right
1022000	1024000	Which was really Mass Effect and DA too for me
1024000	1026000	Um
1026000	1028000	I don't know
1028000	1030000	Those are really more my thing right now
1030000	1032000	I don't really want to
1032000	1034000	I don't know and I'm also kind of
1034000	1036000	Anti-competition these days too
1036000	1038000	Because people are making competitions out of things
1038000	1040000	They have no business being competition
1040000	1042000	Or being competitive
1042000	1044000	And
1044000	1046000	It's back into the whole you know
1046000	1048000	I just really
1048000	1050000	I kind of look at the whole thing with a little
1050000	1052000	Edge of disgust
1052000	1054000	I don't care what you spend your money on
1054000	1056000	But you could be doing better things
1056000	1058000	Now
1058000	1060000	ActDeaf actually sent along a little
1060000	1062000	Update to this story
1062000	1064000	He sent me a private message being one of these people
1064000	1066000	That actually preordered saying
1066000	1068000	Toys R Us sent an email today to everyone
1068000	1070000	That had their Amiibo preorders cancelled
1070000	1072000	They're reinstating orders
1072000	1074000	And letting others make another reservation
1074000	1076000	For Amiibos but Toys R Us said
1076000	1078000	That they messed up the orders not Nintendo
1078000	1080000	Very interesting little
1080000	1082000	Follow up because I feel like I'm hearing
1082000	1084000	A conflict between what some of
1084000	1086000	Their own customer service people were saying
1086000	1088000	And this but again that's no
1088000	1090000	Real surprise there that you know
1090000	1092000	Something was different
1092000	1094000	Way at the top than it really was
1094000	1096000	So hmm
1096000	1098000	Anyway I'm sure this is just going to
1098000	1100000	Continue over the next few weeks
1100000	1102000	This whole Amiibo fever
1102000	1104000	But me like
1104000	1106000	I'm not willing to go camp
1106000	1108000	Out at the store for two hours
1108000	1110000	To get one of these figures like
1110000	1112000	I don't need them that bad
1112000	1114000	I like them well enough I kind of want a Mega Man
1114000	1116000	One but I'm not going to fight like crazy
1116000	1118000	For one if I can't just go online
1118000	1120000	And get it then I'm done and my understanding
1120000	1122000	Is if I haven't already preordered one I ain't
1122000	1124000	Getting one I guess at this point so
1124000	1126000	Eh we'll see like I'm just
1126000	1128000	I don't have to have one that badly
1128000	1130000	I think they're cool like I do
1130000	1132000	Really want the Mega Man one but
1132000	1134000	Is my life going to be over
1134000	1136000	If I don't get one? Nah
1136000	1138000	Will I be jealous of friends that have
1138000	1140000	Them and I don't have it? Not really
1140000	1142000	Actually I think I've
1142000	1144000	Kind of hit that point so
1144000	1146000	Anyway alright
1146000	1148000	Let's travel around and look at
1148000	1150000	Our gaming weeks and the types of games that we
1150000	1152000	Have been playing this week
1152000	1154000	Dark Sakura you haven't been playing 3DS
1154000	1156000	But what have you been playing?
1156000	1158000	I should have been bringing my 3DS with me because I'm doing
1158000	1160000	A puzzle now but um
1160000	1162000	I'm playing Dragon Age
1162000	1164000	A friend of mine
1164000	1166000	Actually started playing
1166000	1168000	Final Fantasy 14
1168000	1170000	So I'll be playing that a bit more later
1170000	1172000	Um
1172000	1174000	So uh
1174000	1176000	Yeah pretty much just Dragon Age right now
1176000	1178000	Um
1178000	1180000	I am taking my sweet time
1180000	1182000	With it I've already talked to people who have beaten the game
1182000	1184000	Several times over but
1184000	1186000	I've been playing just a little bit after work
1186000	1188000	Exploring, looking around
1188000	1190000	You know making up banter
1190000	1192000	In my head
1192000	1194000	And I've really
1194000	1196000	Been finding it a fun creative
1196000	1198000	Outlet lately so
1198000	1200000	I'm content to
1200000	1202000	Take my sweet time with it
1202000	1204000	Do you do a lot of mods with Dragon Age
1204000	1206000	Or is there not a lot available yet?
1206000	1208000	It's funny that you say that there are
1208000	1210000	There's only one mod out there right now and it's
1210000	1212000	A camera mod
1212000	1214000	I haven't put it in yet
1214000	1216000	But basically BioWare
1216000	1218000	Said well Frostbite's really
1218000	1220000	Going to be difficult for other people to mod
1220000	1222000	They're not going to be able to do the same mods with this
1222000	1224000	Like they're doing for Mass Effect 3
1224000	1226000	Or for the previous Dragon Age
1226000	1228000	And basically the entire modding community
1228000	1230000	Has said oh yeah watch
1230000	1232000	And they're working on breaking it
1232000	1234000	Um the guy who did
1234000	1236000	The uh
1236000	1238000	The tools for uh Mass Effect
1238000	1240000	Warranty voider I think is what his
1240000	1242000	Name was um at least online
1242000	1244000	Um has already started
1244000	1246000	Working on uh tools to
1246000	1248000	Uh go through the code
1248000	1250000	For uh Frostbite
1250000	1252000	So I think it's only a matter of time
1252000	1254000	We've already had people who have been able to rip
1254000	1256000	The character models and have done
1256000	1258000	Their own uh models for
1258000	1260000	The characters but um
1260000	1262000	Well the good news is that
1262000	1264000	They practice on Frostbite with Dragon
1264000	1266000	Age and that way when the new Mass Effect comes out
1266000	1268000	All these tools will be ready to go
1268000	1270000	And I honestly think that the
1270000	1272000	Oppression I've been getting from the BioWare folks
1272000	1274000	That is sort of like huh let's see if they can do it
1274000	1276000	You know
1276000	1278000	Like we don't see how without
1278000	1280000	All this so let's see how
1280000	1282000	Inventive you'll be and I
1282000	1284000	Think that it's not necessarily an
1284000	1286000	Active discouragement from doing it
1286000	1288000	But of a we actually
1288000	1290000	Just don't think it's possible type of thing
1290000	1292000	So of course challenge
1292000	1294000	Accepted
1294000	1296000	Alright uh let's put her mic down
1296000	1298000	So that's it for her gaming week. Loki your gaming week
1299000	1301000	Um really I just played uh
1301000	1303000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes
1303000	1305000	Um I'm just
1305000	1307000	You know finishing up my son wanted to play
1307000	1309000	A bunch during the week so
1309000	1311000	While he was just running around the city doing stuff
1311000	1313000	I was busy knocking out all the
1313000	1315000	Races and all of the um
1315000	1317000	Little activities
1317000	1319000	That I have to do to unlock all the characters
1319000	1321000	And get 100% in the game
1321000	1323000	Which brings me to a couple things
1323000	1325000	About this one some of the controls
1325000	1327000	Are fucking terrible
1327000	1329000	Like their flight controls I seriously
1329000	1331000	Want to punch the guy in the face
1331000	1333000	They came up with their fucking flight controls in that game
1333000	1335000	Cause it's just it's
1335000	1337000	So god damn frustrating
1337000	1339000	That it doesn't work right cause basically
1339000	1341000	You tap the jump button twice
1341000	1343000	To go into like a flight mode or whatever
1343000	1345000	And then you would tap uh
1345000	1347000	What was it circle twice or whatever to
1347000	1349000	Get out of that and land
1349000	1351000	But also X and
1351000	1353000	Circle are you know
1353000	1355000	For elevation so X makes you go up
1355000	1357000	Circle makes you go down
1357000	1359000	So you can kind of get where I'm
1359000	1361000	Coming at here first off the uh
1361000	1363000	Up and down vertical movement
1363000	1365000	And there is very sluggish so you have to
1365000	1367000	Kind of hold it down but so if you're trying
1367000	1369000	To kind of fine tune it and get it
1369000	1371000	So that you're aiming at the right speed
1371000	1373000	A couple things happens either you tap
1373000	1375000	X too fast and so
1375000	1377000	That sends you into like a kind of a
1377000	1379000	Burst speed thing so you fly super fast
1379000	1381000	And you can't get out of it really fast
1381000	1383000	Either or you just
1383000	1385000	Land on the ground because you hit
1385000	1387000	Circle twice and you just fall
1387000	1389000	Out of the sky so
1389000	1391000	I seriously was like cursing this game like
1391000	1393000	I fucking hate you stupid game I don't
1393000	1395000	Want to play this thing anymore then
1395000	1397000	They had certain races where they thought it would be
1397000	1399000	A great idea to lock the
1399000	1401000	Fucking camera in a really awkward position
1401000	1403000	While you were playing that race
1403000	1405000	I seriously want to strangle people that were in charge
1405000	1407000	Of the camera and the flight controls in that game
1407000	1409000	The rest of the game is fine
1409000	1411000	A little buggy at times but
1412000	1414000	Careful what you say on the internet Loki
1414000	1416000	You want to strangle them with love and understanding
1416000	1418000	And a better understanding of physics
1418000	1420000	I just want to smack them upside the head until they realize
1420000	1422000	The error in their ways I mean come on
1422000	1424000	This is like how many
1424000	1426000	Lego games have you made so far
1426000	1428000	I mean this isn't the first one
1428000	1430000	Of flight in it and you've had
1430000	1432000	Several Batman games
1432000	1434000	Anger leads to the dark side
1434000	1436000	And so
1436000	1438000	You can't tell me that you haven't figured out that this is
1438000	1440000	And then here's the other thing too
1440000	1442000	You have a controller with several buttons
1442000	1444000	That are not being used at all
1444000	1446000	But you decide to map
1446000	1448000	The elevation and all this shit
1448000	1450000	On the two buttons
1450000	1452000	Great that's good for kids to learn stuff
1452000	1454000	But it's fucking impossible to be able to
1454000	1456000	Just maneuver accurately through the game
1456000	1458000	So that's really my only thing
1458000	1460000	But now that I'm done with that
1460000	1462000	All the races and stuff
1462000	1464000	It's kind of a big relief
1464000	1466000	Because now I don't have to do that crap anymore
1466000	1468000	I just have to go through all the levels and get all the
1468000	1470000	Clocks and everything so
1470000	1472000	I'm very close to platinuming the game
1472000	1474000	Which will be my first platinum
1474000	1476000	As much as it drives you crazy
1476000	1478000	You're determined to platinum it
1478000	1480000	At this point I've already suffered through it enough
1480000	1482000	So I need to platinum it
1482000	1484000	Alan Alchemy in our chat room
1484000	1486000	Over at live.vognetware.com says
1486000	1488000	Little Josh gets sent home from preschool
1488000	1490000	For saying bullshit controls fucking work
1490000	1492000	What the fuck after throwing his Power Ranger
1492000	1494000	Action figures into the air
1494000	1496000	No we were
1496000	1498000	The other day my wife got
1498000	1500000	Inspired by watching
1500000	1502000	It was Jimmy Kimmel or something like that on the internet
1502000	1504000	And she was asking him what
1504000	1506000	Bad words he knew and so he only knew
1506000	1508000	Like stupid and
1508000	1510000	Something like
1510000	1512000	Something like poop I don't remember what it was
1512000	1514000	Poopy head or something like that
1514000	1516000	Those are the only two words
1516000	1518000	That he could think of
1518000	1520000	Probably for the best
1520000	1522000	I have called the game stupid though
1522000	1524000	And under my breath I'm like fucking
1524000	1526000	Yeah
1526000	1528000	That's when you
1528000	1530000	Walk out casually in the backyard
1530000	1532000	Shut the sliding glass door and go
1532000	1534000	Fuck
1534000	1536000	God dammit this game is good but like
1536000	1538000	But seriously though one of the best
1538000	1540000	Characters in the game though is squirrel girl
1540000	1542000	Because she has like
1542000	1544000	The most useless powers
1544000	1546000	She has one power where you charge it up
1546000	1548000	And for no reason like squirrels run around
1548000	1550000	Like they crawl all over her and then they kind of explode
1550000	1552000	Off of her and she throws squirrels
1552000	1554000	At people as her attack she throws squirrels
1554000	1556000	It's like bungee ferret tossing but with squirrels
1556000	1558000	You know what I don't think it made our show
1558000	1560000	World tonight but I'm very excited for
1560000	1562000	The Bravely Default sequel Bravely Second
1562000	1564000	They announced a cat girl
1564000	1566000	Character like a cat girl class
1566000	1568000	And so it's that involves cats
1568000	1570000	How can this be bad?
1570000	1572000	If she throws cats at people or whatever has cats do her bidding
1572000	1574000	I'm all for it it's like a summoner
1574000	1576000	But with cats? Heck yeah
1576000	1578000	Sounds good
1578000	1580000	I just want my party to be for cat people
1580000	1582000	Sounds good to me
1582000	1584000	So that was it I also tried to play a little bit more of
1584000	1586000	I Am Bread and the game is really frustrating
1586000	1588000	So I just pretty much stopped right away
1588000	1590000	It's like it's even worse
1590000	1592000	Than like Surgeon Simulator for me
1592000	1594000	I mean same people and it's just
1594000	1596000	Like I can't figure out what I'm supposed to be doing
1596000	1598000	To get you know off the floor
1598000	1600000	Once I hit the floor it's just like oh I'm gonna land on the skateboard
1600000	1602000	And I'm gonna ride the skateboard over the counter
1602000	1604000	And I'm gonna crawl up the wall
1604000	1606000	And that just didn't happen because there's like a
1606000	1608000	Grip meter and stuff and so the more you hold
1608000	1610000	Down on the grip you eventually
1610000	1612000	Lose grip so I
1612000	1614000	I'm just so frustrated
1614000	1616000	At that game it's funny but I just
1616000	1618000	Don't wanna play it
1618000	1620000	Well that's it for your gaming week I will talk quickly
1620000	1622000	And I haven't even bought anything on Steam
1622000	1624000	I've been very good for you so far I've been
1624000	1626000	I've been good at not getting anything on the Steam sale
1626000	1628000	Yet either but I've been voting every day
1628000	1630000	To get my card and I did
1630000	1632000	What I disenchanted some of the loot
1632000	1634000	Which was a brilliant idea on Steam's
1634000	1636000	Part by the way to get people to just destroy
1636000	1638000	Things in their inventory that they would otherwise sell
1638000	1640000	I
1640000	1642000	I disenchanted a bunch of crap
1642000	1644000	In my inventory like backgrounds I would never use
1644000	1646000	And stuff like that and I bought like a pack of cards
1646000	1648000	Or something I don't know so
1648000	1650000	Yeah anyway let's see
1650000	1652000	So my gaming week I've been playing more
1652000	1654000	Final Fantasy 13 on PC
1654000	1656000	My partner Alan bought me
1656000	1658000	A brand new monitor for the holidays
1658000	1660000	So now I have two widescreen monitors
1660000	1662000	That I'm using and this new one is bright
1662000	1664000	And it looks great and it does
1664000	1666000	Super resolution so I can play
1666000	1668000	Final Fantasy 13 in these really
1668000	1670000	Obscene graphic modes and I'm so happy
1670000	1672000	The game has come a long way
1672000	1674000	Once I got past all the bullshit bugs
1674000	1676000	Like the graphical issues from the initial release
1676000	1678000	And you know the fact that it frameskips
1678000	1680000	If you don't have a controller plugged in like what the hell
1680000	1682000	Once you get past all that it's so
1682000	1684000	Beautiful on
1684000	1686000	PC and I'm
1686000	1688000	I'm on like chapter 7
1688000	1690000	So like I'm pretty committed
1690000	1692000	To this playthrough so
1692000	1694000	I'm excited I've been having a good time with that
1694000	1696000	And continuing to play some other games
1696000	1698000	That I've been playing off and on Final Fantasy 14
1698000	1700000	Return to Diablo 3
1700000	1702000	Continuing with Seasons
1702000	1704000	Alan and I had a little squabble over
1704000	1706000	Diablo 3 about two weeks ago so I kind of put it on
1706000	1708000	Ice for a little while
1708000	1710000	But I went back to the game and I found a really
1710000	1712000	I really like in Diablo 3
1712000	1714000	That you can just respec your character at any time
1714000	1716000	If you find that the build you're
1716000	1718000	Using doesn't work for you
1718000	1720000	That's fine respec
1720000	1722000	You can't even reroll the gear
1722000	1724000	Thanks to Miriam the enchanter
1724000	1726000	You can try to like I went from
1726000	1728000	Ice mage to a fire mage
1728000	1730000	And so I rerolled all the cold bonuses
1730000	1732000	And now there are things like either fire bonuses
1732000	1734000	Or crit damage and I'm doing
1734000	1736000	Way more damage and I'm way more efficient
1736000	1738000	I'm having way more fun as a fire mage
1738000	1740000	Now as opposed to the ice mage I was
1740000	1742000	Playing and that's probably in part that I was getting
1742000	1744000	A bunch of fire mage drops
1744000	1746000	So I was like okay the game's trying to tell me something
1746000	1748000	So I switched and now I'm
1748000	1750000	Flying through torment 1 rifts
1750000	1752000	Like they're easy so I have to even
1752000	1754000	Bump up the difficulty a little bit so I'm having a lot of
1754000	1756000	Fun with Diablo 3 again
1756000	1758000	New games I have played
1758000	1760000	One new game this week I did play
1760000	1762000	One brand new game this week that came out on
1762000	1764000	PlayStation 4 I think it was one of the only
1764000	1766000	New game releases this past week
1766000	1768000	I decided to plunk down the $10
1768000	1770000	For a classic game
1770000	1772000	It's very hard to screw this game up
1772000	1774000	And do something wrong with it
1774000	1776000	Tetris I bought Tetris Ultimate which was
1776000	1778000	Released on the PlayStation 4 this week
1778000	1780000	And it is Ubisoft that made this port
1780000	1782000	And um
1782000	1784000	I'm gonna tell ya there's
1784000	1786000	Some things I liked that they're trying to do with this
1786000	1788000	You know they're trying to make Tetris more
1788000	1790000	Social you know like make it more like a
1790000	1792000	Social game which I get
1792000	1794000	That's where gaming's going so like apparently
1794000	1796000	Some of my play sessions have been
1796000	1798000	Ghosted and like Fifth Dream
1798000	1800000	In chat earlier was saying oh I was
1800000	1802000	Playing against one of your ghosts earlier and I was like
1802000	1804000	Oh shit I didn't know the game was recording
1804000	1806000	Me like I sometimes what I'll do
1806000	1808000	Is if I screw up too early I'll just
1808000	1810000	Drop all the pieces you know and I'll just fill up
1810000	1812000	The screen it's it's the rage quit of Tetris right
1812000	1814000	You just eternally drop all your pieces and start over
1814000	1816000	So I'm like oh shit if Fifth
1816000	1818000	Dream is playing one of my bots that just rage
1818000	1820000	Quits that's not a lot of fun so it's good to keep in mind
1820000	1822000	There's a lot of different modes and yada
1822000	1824000	Yada yada but here's the thing
1824000	1826000	That really gets me about Tetris
1826000	1828000	Ultimate
1828000	1830000	It's buggy like
1830000	1832000	Bad buggy like
1832000	1834000	Really bad buggy like
1834000	1836000	How the fuck did they release
1836000	1838000	This in its current state buggy
1838000	1840000	And it's mostly
1840000	1842000	One major bug
1842000	1844000	But that bug is
1844000	1846000	Frame hiccups
1846000	1848000	Now let us think about the game of Tetris
1848000	1850000	Especially when you're playing
1850000	1852000	On level 11
1852000	1854000	In endless mode
1854000	1856000	Is that okay for the game to suddenly
1856000	1858000	Hang for even just three frames
1858000	1860000	While you're trying to rotate a piece
1860000	1862000	Or drop a piece at just the right moment
1862000	1864000	Absolutely not
1864000	1866000	And it was to the point where I was like
1866000	1868000	Did any QA happen
1868000	1870000	On this game at all because that would
1870000	1872000	Have been noticed if it was played
1872000	1874000	On a real Playstation 4 maybe that's something
1874000	1876000	That didn't show up on a dev PS4
1876000	1878000	I get that but was this even play tested
1878000	1880000	On a real PS4 was it cause I'm not the only
1880000	1882000	One that's noticed no I saw was
1882000	1884000	I unfortunately went to IGN
1884000	1886000	To watch like the couple you know
1886000	1888000	Now they call it let's plays but it's not really
1888000	1890000	They had some issues with the game
1890000	1892000	I guess they had to literally unconnect
1892000	1894000	It from the internet in order to like drop
1894000	1896000	Those frame skips or whatever
1896000	1898000	And it to the point where it was like
1898000	1900000	Taking a super long time to load
1900000	1902000	Stuff and like there was even frame
1902000	1904000	Skips during like the whole Ubisoft
1904000	1906000	Logo and everything
1906000	1908000	And to the point where like they're trying to
1908000	1910000	Drop the piece and it was taking several seconds
1910000	1912000	To drop that piece and stuff
1912000	1914000	And apparently they said yeah we tried this
1914000	1916000	Even on a retail
1916000	1918000	System a debug system
1918000	1920000	On several different ones and it was still
1920000	1922000	Having the same problems
1922000	1924000	So
1924000	1926000	I don't know what's up
1926000	1928000	With Ubisoft man it's bad
1928000	1930000	When you can't even get Tetris I mean Tetris is
1930000	1932000	Not that complex of a fucking game
1932000	1934000	I think the power of the Playstation 4
1934000	1936000	And from what I hear it's only the
1936000	1938000	Playstation 4 version that's doing it
1938000	1940000	I would think that the Playstation 4 can run Tetris
1940000	1942000	Just I think it can
1942000	1944000	Now 5th Dream says I was playing
1944000	1946000	It on remote play and I had no issues
1946000	1948000	But then I don't play as fast as Rob's
1948000	1950000	Ghost I'm gonna say you know I
1950000	1952000	Was made aware of the IGN video via
1952000	1954000	Twitter and it was
1954000	1956000	After I already bought the game and I was
1956000	1958000	Playing it and I was like god damn it like
1958000	1960000	Why is this game buggy and then I saw that
1960000	1962000	Tweet come in because somebody retweeted it and I was like
1962000	1964000	Oh okay it's not just me and I
1964000	1966000	Watched the video now here's the weird thing
1966000	1968000	I didn't notice it as bad
1968000	1970000	As they do and
1970000	1972000	But that seems weird to me that there would be kind of
1972000	1974000	That variance there but I didn't notice it
1974000	1976000	As bad but I definitely noticed
1976000	1978000	It and it was definitely the point where
1978000	1980000	I'm like Ubisoft
1980000	1982000	You need to fucking fix your QA processes
1982000	1984000	You need something like something
1984000	1986000	Clearly is broken
1986000	1988000	Because how many games is that
1988000	1990000	Now that have gone out the door with very
1990000	1992000	Obvious bugs in them
1992000	1994000	Fix your
1994000	1996000	Processes please
1996000	1998000	It's embarrassing
1998000	2000000	It's Tetris
2000000	2002000	For god's sake Tetris
2002000	2004000	I could play Tetris on an Apple
2004000	2006000	What was the very first it was made for
2006000	2008000	The PS like PS2
2008000	2010000	Like old school IBM basics
2010000	2012000	Right was the original Tetris I'm talking
2012000	2014000	I'm talking the guy in Russia
2014000	2016000	I know right
2016000	2018000	So the power of the Playstation 4
2018000	2020000	Cannot handle Tetris
2020000	2022000	Give me a break
2022000	2024000	A TI calculator could play Tetris
2024000	2026000	Now
2026000	2028000	I do have faith that thanks to
2028000	2030000	I mean if I just sat here and bitched about it
2030000	2032000	Nothing would happen but IGN's
2032000	2034000	Got a lot more pull than I do I'm sure because
2034000	2036000	Of them putting out that video the game will get
2036000	2038000	A patch and it'll be fine but it's like
2038000	2040000	It's yet another one of those things
2040000	2042000	Why did we have to wait for the patch
2042000	2044000	I mean you release the game
2044000	2046000	The next to last week of December anyway
2046000	2048000	Would have delay until February
2048000	2050000	Have killed you it's not like I was sitting
2050000	2052000	Here going I can't fucking wait
2052000	2054000	For Tetris yeah like
2054000	2056000	It was more one of those things where it's like oh Tetris
2056000	2058000	Came out I like Tetris I'll get it
2058000	2060000	I would have had the same reaction in February
2060000	2062000	After you fixed your shit
2062000	2064000	Oh my god it just blows my mind
2064000	2066000	Well that was the thing it was like a lot of people
2066000	2068000	When they bought it you know they're kind of
2068000	2070000	There's a few games Ubisoft has released that haven't
2070000	2072000	Been that great that kind of little buggy
2072000	2074000	You know but it's Tetris
2074000	2076000	I mean how hard can Tetris be to program
2076000	2078000	I mean it can't be that bad
2078000	2080000	YYR in chat says don't worry Ubisoft will patch
2080000	2082000	It in in a few days not to fix the game
2082000	2084000	Breaking bugs but to put a face on the faceless
2084000	2086000	L block it's funny you say that because
2086000	2088000	In battle mode like you actually get
2088000	2090000	Blocks that have mustaches on them and other
2090000	2092000	Little things that happen
2092000	2094000	Just cute little things that
2094000	2096000	Have to do with the
2096000	2098000	Battle thing it's like
2098000	2100000	Playing Tetranet basically they basically
2100000	2102000	So there are some cool things about this game
2102000	2104000	That basically you can play Tetranet and that
2104000	2106000	Type of thing but you know again
2106000	2108000	When you have frame skip in a game
2108000	2110000	That badly needs it like Tetris it's like it
2110000	2112000	Ruins the whole fucking thing it doesn't matter
2112000	2114000	If they're doing all these other cool things to the game
2114000	2116000	The game is ruined it's tainted
2116000	2118000	Jason says that Tetris on the Playstation 4
2118000	2120000	Doesn't look or act like Tetris on
2120000	2122000	TI NES or whatever
2122000	2124000	To which I say I didn't ask for them to make me
2124000	2126000	A fancier looking Tetris it's fucking
2126000	2128000	Tetris I don't need it to have like
2128000	2130000	Fucking you know
2130000	2132000	Clouds in the background
2132000	2134000	Or shiny blocks or whatever it's
2134000	2136000	Fucking Tetris it doesn't matter
2136000	2138000	And here I do
2138000	2140000	Have one other this is a minor
2140000	2142000	More minor complaint about the game but it is
2142000	2144000	An issue I have with
2144000	2146000	Tetris lately and I think
2146000	2148000	The last round of Tetris games did this too
2148000	2150000	And I don't understand this and that is
2150000	2152000	What is the obsession with
2152000	2154000	T-Spins what is the obsession
2154000	2156000	With counting T-Spins
2156000	2158000	And having achievements for T-Spins
2158000	2160000	And getting T-Spins
2160000	2162000	As a statistic I don't understand
2162000	2164000	Like
2164000	2166000	What I even had to look up like what
2166000	2168000	A T-Spin is and it's
2168000	2170000	By the way it's when you take the T-Block
2170000	2172000	And you rotate it in to fill a gap
2172000	2174000	Like it's not you're not
2174000	2176000	Dropping it to fill a gap you rotate
2176000	2178000	It over to fill a gap that like
2178000	2180000	Might be on the side or something that's what a T-Spin
2180000	2182000	Is and it's like oh I
2182000	2184000	Thought I was already doing that but yet my statistic
2184000	2186000	For T-Spin I guess sit at zero but it's
2186000	2188000	Like I don't know I don't
2188000	2190000	I don't get why that has to be
2190000	2192000	Tracked the only T-Spin I'm aware of
2192000	2194000	Is you know with Baloo and where
2194000	2196000	They're flying a plane and
2196000	2198000	I guess that was Tailspin though
2198000	2200000	So anyway
2200000	2202000	YYR in chat says yeah I think those are dumb
2202000	2204000	Too and Alan Alchemy says the T-Block
2204000	2206000	Is the most versatile block yet
2206000	2208000	It's the line blocks that I always tend to
2208000	2210000	Put in my hold queue anyway
2210000	2212000	The Nintendo DS version
2212000	2214000	Of Tetris remains the definitive version for
2214000	2216000	Me or the Game Boy if you want to go all the way back
2216000	2218000	To the Game Boy version that one too I think the
2218000	2220000	DS one is the best one out there and it still hasn't been
2220000	2222000	Trumped on all these newer consoles
2222000	2224000	Came out on 3DS as well
2224000	2226000	On 3DS but not this isn't the Nintendo version
2226000	2228000	With like the Mario
2228000	2230000	No this version that just came out from Ubisoft
2230000	2232000	No Nintendo did one on the DS
2232000	2234000	Which certainly you could play on a 3DS
2234000	2236000	But Nintendo did one on the DS that in my mind
2236000	2238000	Is still the definitive version
2238000	2240000	But maybe that has to do with the love
2240000	2242000	Of Nintendo characters thing we talked about earlier
2242000	2244000	Cause all that retro nostalgia is all
2244000	2246000	Over that game but I even think without
2246000	2248000	That it's still the definitive version I mean because
2248000	2250000	It's the Game Boy version but modernized
2250000	2252000	And in many ways I think
2252000	2254000	If you said Rob the Game Boy version
2254000	2256000	Is the definitive version I would be like
2256000	2258000	You know I respect that angle
2258000	2260000	That's a hard one to argue with
2260000	2262000	The Game Boy and the DS ones are really neck and neck
2262000	2264000	So anyway
2264000	2266000	Alan Alchemy
2266000	2268000	In chat says everyone loves it when a T block
2268000	2270000	Shows up unlike the square one
2270000	2272000	That's like hello I'm here sorry I'm so fat
2272000	2274000	Frown no the ones
2274000	2276000	It's the Z blocks to get me
2276000	2278000	The Z and the S block because
2278000	2280000	I can never visualize
2280000	2282000	Ok what's the jagged pattern
2282000	2284000	Is this the one that fits the jacket on the right
2284000	2286000	This is the ones that you use to slide in
2286000	2288000	Yeah and I've used it that way too
2288000	2290000	But do we count Z spins or S spins
2290000	2292000	No we count T spins
2292000	2294000	Anyway, Jamie just rolled her eyes
2294000	2296000	That makes for great radio
2296000	2298000	Alright
2298000	2300000	SSJ100Matt says I came back in the middle
2300000	2302000	Of this discussion and my initial thought of
2302000	2304000	T spin stats were stats of how many times
2304000	2306000	You spun the teacups at Disneyland
2306000	2308000	Oh I'd win that fucking game
2308000	2310000	Purple ones for life
2310000	2312000	It is not the teacups unless somebody barfs
2312000	2314000	Alright that's what I'm saying
2314000	2316000	That's why you go in the purple ones they go faster
2316000	2318000	At night
2318000	2320000	They go faster at night for sure
2320000	2322000	Everything goes faster at night
2322000	2324000	Alright we're going to get into some news here
2324000	2326000	In a minute here also more information
2326000	2328000	On the VOG game jam coming up
2328000	2330000	In part B we're going to kick
2330000	2332000	This off tonight and
2332000	2334000	Us and Bobby Blackwolf and hopefully some of the
2334000	2336000	Other shows at VOG too teaming together
2336000	2338000	To encourage everybody out there to
2338000	2340000	Create something dammit
2340000	2342000	You know last week we had the guys from Cooking with
2342000	2344000	Unity on the show which I know Loki found
2344000	2346000	Very very motivating and I thought those guys
2346000	2348000	Were excellent motivators you know they've worked
2348000	2350000	In the industry and my favorite
2350000	2352000	Thing out of that whole interview was when Max said
2352000	2354000	You know I just
2354000	2356000	Want you to make a game I want you to make a game
2356000	2358000	And I thought yes I want you
2358000	2360000	To make a game too what can I do to help
2360000	2362000	Alright we've got a network let's do this
2362000	2364000	Let's do this VOG game jam
2364000	2366000	So together the
2366000	2368000	OLR live audience tonight we're going to pick a theme
2368000	2370000	Through our tried and true list list
2370000	2372000	Mechanism so we're going to get to that in part
2372000	2374000	B and that will be the theme for the game jam
2374000	2376000	But you know what if you're not comfortable programming
2376000	2378000	In Unity and you don't want to learn just yet that's okay
2378000	2380000	Use RPG maker
2380000	2382000	Use Twine
2382000	2384000	Use Commodore 64
2384000	2386000	Basic make a level in
2386000	2388000	Little Big Planet if you want or create
2388000	2390000	A level in another game but just
2390000	2392000	Create something dammit that's all
2392000	2394000	We want we want people to create
2394000	2396000	And get creative
2396000	2398000	So all we're going to throw you tonight is a spark
2398000	2400000	And we want you to run with it
2400000	2402000	And create a fire and who knows
2402000	2404000	Who knows sometimes
2404000	2406000	Big big games come out of game jams
2406000	2408000	So wasn't super hexagon born
2408000	2410000	Out of a game jam I could be wrong I don't remember there's
2410000	2412000	A lot of stuff there's a lot of stuff that suddenly
2412000	2414000	You know goes from game jam to like
2414000	2416000	You know steam release and I'm not necessarily saying
2416000	2418000	That that's going to happen
2418000	2420000	But it might so
2420000	2422000	Stay tuned
2422000	2424000	So more info on that in part B
2424000	2426000	For now quick housekeeping
2426000	2428000	We will actually still be
2428000	2430000	Here throughout the holidays
2430000	2432000	The holidays fall on pretty convenient days for us
2432000	2434000	Not so much for Hoard House but for us
2434000	2436000	So we will still be here next Sunday live
2436000	2438000	And the Sunday after the holidays will not be
2438000	2440000	Interfering with OLR scheduled this year
2440000	2442000	However
2442000	2444000	I am foreseeing off in the future we will not
2444000	2446000	Be here January 18th
2446000	2448000	That's way off in the future so I'll be giving you
2448000	2450000	Reminders we're still determining if we're going
2450000	2452000	To pre-record that week or what we're going to do
2452000	2454000	We can't do an early show I'm going to be
2454000	2456000	Out of town I guess I'm
2456000	2458000	Okay to say this on the show I'm
2458000	2460000	Going to Seattle Alan and I are going to go to Seattle
2460000	2462000	Visit some friends of his that he's known
2462000	2464000	Online forever and never met so
2464000	2466000	I'm going to go to Seattle over Martin Luther King weekend
2466000	2468000	So I'm excited about that I haven't been
2468000	2470000	Up to Seattle in about five years but I love it up there
2470000	2472000	And I can't wait to do all that touristy shit
2472000	2474000	Again Space Needle, EMP
2474000	2476000	Aquarium
2476000	2478000	First Starbucks, Pikes Market I'm going to do all that shit
2478000	2480000	So maybe
2480000	2482000	If we rent a car maybe I can talk
2482000	2484000	Alan into let's just
2484000	2486000	Drive by Nintendo headquarters and see if I can see
2486000	2488000	Reggie I just drive by I got to
2488000	2490000	After all these years I got to just drive by and wave
2490000	2492000	Or something see if I can sneak
2492000	2494000	Into the cafeteria who knows
2494000	2496000	Alright
2496000	2498000	So anyway more info on that to come
2498000	2500000	When we get a little closer into January
2500000	2502000	Tigerclaw asks
2502000	2504000	In chat will next week's OLR be a
2504000	2506000	Best of show I am thinking
2506000	2508000	We will do something to cap off the end
2508000	2510000	Of the year us being
2510000	2512000	OLR and haven't been around for so long
2512000	2514000	We seem to do something different for the last
2514000	2516000	Show of the year every year I don't think we found our thing
2516000	2518000	Yet but certainly we will be looking back
2518000	2520000	On 2014 and talking about
2520000	2522000	Our favorite games of the year even
2522000	2524000	Though you know what guys we don't
2524000	2526000	Possibly have time to play everything
2526000	2528000	We can't sit here and say this is the definitive
2528000	2530000	Best game of 2014 but we can't
2530000	2532000	Tell you our favorite games so we will at least
2532000	2534000	Go over that next week and I am still going back
2534000	2536000	And forth in my head there is two that I keep
2536000	2538000	Flip flopping so we will see
2538000	2540000	Anyhow
2540000	2542000	Let's get into some news after all that
2542000	2544000	Let's get into what is going on
2544000	2546000	In the game industry this week not as busy
2546000	2548000	Of a week but there is still some stuff going on
2548000	2550000	That is worth talking about right Loki? That's right
2550000	2552000	So of course you know some of the big news
2552000	2554000	This week had to do with Minecraft
2554000	2556000	And the announcement
2556000	2558000	Of Minecraft story mode a tell
2558000	2560000	Tell game series
2560000	2562000	And apparently it's going to be
2562000	2564000	A separate game
2564000	2566000	Not necessarily an add on to Minecraft
2566000	2568000	But it's a separate game
2568000	2570000	That will be released on PC
2570000	2572000	Mac mobile devices and
2572000	2574000	Xbox and Playstation consoles they say
2576000	2578000	The game they haven't really said
2578000	2580000	Too much about it yet other than you know
2580000	2582000	They are not creating an official story
2582000	2584000	For the main character Steve
2584000	2586000	But apparently it's going to have
2586000	2588000	Some sort of story that revolves around you know
2588000	2590000	User created stuff
2590000	2592000	So I don't know
2592000	2594000	You know to be honest
2594000	2596000	They kind of already have this
2596000	2598000	It's actually a mode you can set up
2598000	2600000	Your different worlds in I think it's
2600000	2602000	I forget the actual name of it's called
2602000	2604000	Like fantasy or something like that
2604000	2606000	But basically allows you you know someone to create
2606000	2608000	A world in creative mode
2608000	2610000	And then basically to limit the amount
2610000	2612000	Of building
2612000	2614000	And breaking that you can do in it
2614000	2616000	And it has a lot of you know kind of narrative stuff
2616000	2618000	Based off of that
2618000	2620000	You can like you know set up events and things
2620000	2622000	But
2622000	2624000	Cool I guess I mean that'll be
2624000	2626000	Neat to check out
2626000	2628000	When it comes out
2628000	2630000	There's a lot of hate for this idea
2630000	2632000	Out there a lot of people are really pissed off about it
2632000	2634000	Don't buy it then
2634000	2636000	I kind of don't I don't get that though
2636000	2638000	Like I understand that okay well
2638000	2640000	A Telltale Minecraft game is not going to be
2640000	2642000	Really Minecraft in the traditional sense
2642000	2644000	But at the same time it's like
2644000	2646000	Telltale has kind of done really
2646000	2648000	Good things with a lot of the properties they
2648000	2650000	Have a story for
2650000	2652000	Minecraft is really not something that's been
2652000	2654000	Explored at all I don't I don't
2654000	2656000	Understand where the negativity is coming from other than
2656000	2658000	It's something different I don't like
2658000	2660000	It I don't know
2660000	2662000	I think problem I don't see the problem
2662000	2664000	I just think they're immediately thinking that
2664000	2666000	Oh another Minecraft game
2666000	2668000	After Microsoft bought a mode they must be selling
2668000	2670000	Out or something but
2670000	2672000	Now maybe maybe it's Minecraft
2672000	2674000	For saturation like that I could
2674000	2676000	Maybe see that because you know
2676000	2678000	Minecraft really is everywhere
2678000	2680000	But it's not just this video game
2680000	2682000	I mean you know
2682000	2684000	Go into target or anything like they've got
2684000	2686000	All this Minecraft licensed shit everywhere
2686000	2688000	Like another game is really
2688000	2690000	Really the
2690000	2692000	Least of it but you know
2692000	2694000	I gotta say as much as
2694000	2696000	I'm not always really into like poking into
2696000	2698000	People's personal business and all this gaming news
2698000	2700000	You know it's out there that Notch
2700000	2702000	Bought that mansion in Beverly Hills
2702000	2704000	You see that? It was
2704000	2706000	Him and he outbid
2706000	2708000	Beyonce and Jay-Z
2708000	2710000	Like really
2710000	2712000	Really just think about that for a minute
2712000	2714000	The monarchy
2714000	2716000	Of Beyonce and Jay-Z
2716000	2718000	Got outbid by some nerd
2718000	2720000	For this mansion
2720000	2722000	I think that's absolutely hilarious
2722000	2724000	It's kind of awesome
2724000	2726000	Probably did it for spite
2726000	2728000	You've gotta admit you gotta see Beyonce
2728000	2730000	Sitting there going, who is this nerd?
2732000	2734000	Just bought our house
2734000	2736000	You know what though
2736000	2738000	Props to him
2738000	2740000	I saw that picture of him with his
2740000	2742000	Legs up with the whole like candy
2742000	2744000	Bar or whatever in the background and I was
2744000	2746000	Just like
2746000	2748000	The only thing that picture is missing
2748000	2750000	Is a gigantic bong I think
2750000	2752000	But anyway not that I endorse that
2752000	2754000	But I'm just saying it seems to be the one
2754000	2756000	Thing that's missing
2756000	2758000	With his kind of money
2758000	2760000	He could just
2760000	2762000	It's like the fucking Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
2762000	2764000	Of bongs
2764000	2766000	He can turn the pool into a giant one
2766000	2768000	Anyway sorry Loki I don't mean to digress
2768000	2770000	He could build a fucking chocolate factory
2770000	2772000	Like out of Willy Wonka
2772000	2774000	That's what I'd do with all that money
2774000	2776000	Wouldn't you? No
2776000	2778000	I just want an Oompa Loompa
2778000	2780000	I want it now
2780000	2782000	I want a golden goose
2782000	2784000	Daddy I want the goose
2784000	2786000	That lays the golden eggs
2786000	2788000	And actually it was the squirrels
2788000	2790000	But anyway Loki
2790000	2792000	So then on top of that you know
2792000	2794000	The Minecraft film has had a little bit of a setback
2794000	2796000	Apparently the director Sean Levy
2796000	2798000	Has left the project
2798000	2800000	Basically saying you know Warner Brothers
2800000	2802000	Asked me to develop
2802000	2804000	How this might be a story
2804000	2806000	For a movie because it's a non-narrative
2806000	2808000	Game and we came up with an
2808000	2810000	Approach that felt good but when they discussed
2810000	2812000	It with Mojang they were like
2812000	2814000	That doesn't sound like what we want
2814000	2816000	So
2816000	2818000	So yes unfortunately he couldn't really
2818000	2820000	Go from there
2820000	2822000	I don't know I'm not
2822000	2824000	Too terribly disappointed by that
2824000	2826000	Maybe
2826000	2828000	We'll see something with this Telltale game
2828000	2830000	That's the direction he wants to go with it
2830000	2832000	Or something you know maybe the story that we see
2832000	2834000	Laid out here because honestly
2834000	2836000	There isn't much
2836000	2838000	Of a story there
2838000	2840000	Alan does point out in our chat room over at
2840000	2842000	Fognetwork.com Alan Alchemy says
2842000	2844000	The original Minecraft doesn't really have a story
2844000	2846000	But there is a long ass objective to find
2846000	2848000	Farm Endermen, farm ore
2848000	2850000	Go into the netherworld or hell
2850000	2852000	Go to the Enderplane, kill the Ender Dragon
2852000	2854000	Which most people don't even do they just fuck around and explore
2854000	2856000	Caves and make badass asses with roller coasters
2856000	2858000	But if they wanted to explore that story
2858000	2860000	About the Ender Dragon I'd be interested
2860000	2862000	In it
2862000	2864000	I just think they need more to it it's kind of short
2864000	2866000	I mean it's kind of like oh we just put this there
2866000	2868000	Because people wanted an end to the game
2868000	2870000	I also
2870000	2872000	I would have a concern for
2872000	2874000	The clock and I said this
2874000	2876000	Back when Microsoft bought Minecraft
2876000	2878000	I sort of feel like the clock on
2878000	2880000	Minecraft is ticking and I think the ultimate
2880000	2882000	Climax to this whole thing is going to be when
2882000	2884000	Microsoft inevitably releases
2884000	2886000	Minecraft 2 because you know they're going to
2886000	2888000	You know they're going to they release Minecraft 2
2888000	2890000	And I kind of think that will be the beginning of the end
2890000	2892000	I just you know
2892000	2894000	I realize a lot of people might brand me a hater
2894000	2896000	For thinking that or that I don't get it because there's more
2896000	2898000	To it with all the licensing and all that
2898000	2900000	But I just kind of think the bubble is going to burst eventually
2900000	2902000	And then there's going to be because there will be another big
2902000	2904000	New thing that everybody gets into
2904000	2906000	That people can create and explore their own stuff
2906000	2908000	You know what I mean?
2908000	2910000	I'd be down for a Minecraft that ran better
2910000	2912000	I mean it's just all Java
2912000	2914000	Right now so I'd be fine you know running
2914000	2916000	A little bit better but
2916000	2918000	Whatever it's all good
2918000	2920000	And then of course you know with that the
2920000	2922000	Microsoft versions of the game
2922000	2924000	Are actually getting another update
2924000	2926000	They have was it it's
2926000	2928000	The 1.64 update
2928000	2930000	Now they're saying it's going to
2930000	2932000	Add horses because horses
2932000	2934000	Have been in the PC version for a while
2934000	2936000	But you can actually get horses
2936000	2938000	You can even you know
2938000	2940000	Make a donkey you can put horse
2940000	2942000	Armor on them
2942000	2944000	All sorts of fun stuff
2944000	2946000	Tame them and they're saying
2946000	2948000	That along with it they're going to add
2948000	2950000	New enemies
2950000	2952000	Bats, witches, wither skeletons
2952000	2954000	And new fireworks
2954000	2956000	So it's kind of it's getting close to where
2956000	2958000	The Xbox version is actually meeting with
2958000	2960000	Almost what the PC version is right now
2960000	2962000	So
2962000	2964000	I have to go back to the Xbox version
2964000	2966000	At some point or
2966000	2968000	I may have to actually get one for the
2968000	2970000	PlayStation 4 in that version
2970000	2972000	Alright
2972000	2974000	The PlayStation 4 version is pretty good actually
2974000	2976000	We'll get down with that. Alright moving
2976000	2978000	On let's talk about you know and honestly
2978000	2980000	I have a hard
2980000	2982000	Time quantifying this next story
2982000	2984000	As news because I really don't think this is
2984000	2986000	News but sometimes we have
2986000	2988000	To bring to the discussion
2988000	2990000	What other people are talking about
2990000	2992000	Out there in the gaming world and that's where this
2992000	2994000	Next story falls into
2994000	2996000	Miyamoto obviously he did a big interview this week
2996000	2998000	With ABC and there was a lot that came out of this
2998000	3000000	And one other thing that he said in this interview
3000000	3002000	Quote we're focused on providing
3002000	3004000	A robust lineup of Wii U software
3004000	3006000	For next year it seems like we've managed
3006000	3008000	To do that this year and people are very happy with
3008000	3010000	What we've done on Wii U which for the most part is pretty true
3010000	3012000	For the time being our focus
3012000	3014000	Is on the Wii U hardware but Nintendo
3014000	3016000	As a whole has groups working on ideas
3016000	3018000	For new hardware systems
3018000	3020000	While we're busy working on software for the Wii U
3020000	3022000	We have production lines that are working on ideas
3022000	3024000	For what the next system might be
3024000	3026000	And so what's the headline on every fucking
3026000	3028000	Game blog right now and every fucking tweet out there
3028000	3030000	Nintendo working on
3030000	3032000	Wii U successor
3032000	3034000	Because the little
3034000	3036000	What they don't say in that
3036000	3038000	Is that everybody wants
3038000	3040000	Nintendo to move on from the Wii U
3040000	3042000	So let's hear about their follow up already
3042000	3044000	Click me, click me, click me, visit my site
3044000	3046000	I sort of think that's that
3046000	3048000	Unsaid piece there
3048000	3050000	Is that people, there's a lot of people
3050000	3052000	That want to see Nintendo move on from the Wii U
3052000	3054000	Because they already wrote it off
3054000	3056000	I gotta say though Wii U has had a killer year
3056000	3058000	And I don't see
3058000	3060000	How you can have a top 5
3060000	3062000	Games of the year and not have at least
3062000	3064000	One Wii U title on it
3064000	3066000	Maybe if you're talking about your own personal list
3066000	3068000	And you don't own a Wii U
3068000	3070000	I guess that's the way you do it
3070000	3072000	But I can't see how you do if you are considering
3072000	3074000	Every single game that came out this year
3074000	3076000	I don't see how you have a top 5
3076000	3078000	And you don't have at least one Wii U game on it
3078000	3080000	Like they've had a pretty good year in that regard
3080000	3082000	So I still give them some credit
3082000	3084000	Wii U's got a lot of life left in it
3084000	3086000	So if they don't bring out their next successor
3086000	3088000	Right away then no big deal
3088000	3090000	But here's the thing
3090000	3092000	So that by itself
3092000	3094000	Not really a big deal
3094000	3096000	You know Sony's working on Playstation 5
3096000	3098000	It's years and years away but they're thinking about it
3098000	3100000	Xbox working on Xbox 2
3100000	3102000	Or whatever they're going to do next right
3102000	3104000	260 I don't know
3104000	3106000	Whatever the hell Microsoft decides to do next
3106000	3108000	They're working on it
3108000	3110000	They're brainstorming that name right now
3110000	3112000	Brainstorm really hard
3112000	3114000	Here's the thing
3114000	3116000	Here's what else Miyamoto said
3116000	3118000	It did nothing but add fuel to the fire
3118000	3120000	Since we first created Mario
3120000	3122000	We have compared him to Mickey Mouse
3122000	3124000	I've always said Mickey Mouse evolved
3124000	3126000	With each evolution in animation
3126000	3128000	You saw Mickey Mouse each step of the way
3128000	3130000	From early on I wanted Mario to be that character
3130000	3132000	In the digital world
3132000	3134000	So that with each digital evolution
3134000	3136000	He was there to usher in the next era
3136000	3138000	I think that maybe when we release the next hardware system
3138000	3140000	You can look forward to seeing Mario
3140000	3142000	Take on a new role or in a new game
3142000	3144000	And a lot of people are taking that to say
3144000	3146000	No more Mario until the next Nintendo system
3146000	3148000	But that's not really what I'm hearing in that quote
3148000	3150000	I don't know about you guys
3150000	3152000	But I'm just hearing in that
3152000	3154000	Mario is kind of the guy with the scissors
3154000	3156000	That cuts the ribbon
3156000	3158000	That says you know
3158000	3160000	It's now open for business
3160000	3162000	Not necessarily that every Nintendo console
3162000	3164000	Has launched right out the gate with a Nintendo title
3164000	3166000	But pretty close right
3166000	3168000	Super Nintendo had one
3168000	3170000	Nintendo had one at least here in America
3170000	3172000	Nintendo 64 had one
3172000	3174000	Gamecube had Luigi's Mansion
3174000	3176000	But Super Mario Sunshine
3176000	3178000	Wasn't that far from the get go
3178000	3180000	Wii U had new Super Mario
3180000	3182000	The Wii
3182000	3184000	Is the only one I can think of
3184000	3186000	That didn't have a Mario title right out the gate
3186000	3188000	But then you had some really strong Mario titles
3188000	3190000	Between the new Super Mario Brothers
3190000	3192000	And Mario Galaxy of course
3192000	3194000	A lot of people really loved
3194000	3196000	New Paper Mario
3196000	3198000	I like New Paper Mario
3198000	3200000	But that's the other thing too
3200000	3202000	Is that Mario is so much more
3202000	3204000	All these other things now
3204000	3206000	And so I think there's some people that assume
3206000	3208000	That this means there will be no Mario game on the Wii U
3208000	3210000	But I just
3210000	3212000	I can't imagine
3212000	3214000	I cannot imagine
3214000	3216000	That Nintendo is not thinking about another game
3216000	3218000	In the Mario Galaxy series
3218000	3220000	They have to be
3220000	3222000	Those games were so good
3222000	3224000	And they were so different
3224000	3226000	And they were always critically lauded
3226000	3228000	I assume they sold well
3228000	3230000	Didn't they sell pretty good?
3230000	3232000	First one did I'm pretty sure
3232000	3234000	Because they did make the sequel
3234000	3236000	They've got to be thinking of a Mario Galaxy for Wii U
3236000	3238000	I mean
3238000	3240000	Or even a pretty easy
3240000	3242000	Sequel to Mario 3D World
3242000	3244000	You would think would be up on the agenda
3244000	3246000	I would think that would be a very
3246000	3248000	In some ways Captain Toad might kind of be that
3248000	3250000	But I digress
3250000	3252000	So I would think there's going to be Mario Galaxy games
3252000	3254000	I don't think this necessarily means that no more Mario
3254000	3256000	Can you imagine an open world Mario game
3256000	3258000	Done in the same style as that new Zelda game
3258000	3260000	Right?
3260000	3262000	I don't know
3264000	3266000	To register participation for this week's episode
3266000	3268000	Of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
3268000	3270000	Use the pass phrase
3270000	3272000	Chair
3272000	3274000	Let's see going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
3274000	3276000	Kaijudo says
3276000	3278000	Wii U is the shit
3278000	3280000	Anyone that hates on it has never really played it or owns it
3280000	3282000	The Wii U is an amazing system
3282000	3284000	Only haters are the people that want HD shooters
3284000	3286000	And Mountain Dew perks
3286000	3288000	Fuck those guys
3288000	3290000	There was no Star Fox game on the Wii
3290000	3292000	But we are getting one for the Wii U
3292000	3294000	So yeah Nintendo does skip some of their ideas sometimes
3294000	3296000	You know what else was sorely missing
3296000	3298000	From the Wii
3298000	3300000	F-Zero
3300000	3302000	Act Def says
3302000	3304000	Super Mario 3D World is still an amazing game
3304000	3306000	And I wouldn't mind a Super Mario 3D World 2
3306000	3308000	Neither would I
3308000	3310000	I really kind of hope they do
3310000	3312000	And I'm okay with that if they just try to squeeze another game out of that
3312000	3314000	I'm sure it'll be great
3314000	3316000	Nintendo does a really good job
3316000	3318000	Of producing quality sequels
3318000	3320000	YYR says
3320000	3322000	Nintendo has always been stupid about sequels though
3322000	3324000	Never more than one Smash game
3324000	3326000	Per platform per example
3326000	3328000	Wasn't it because those games take years and years and years
3328000	3330000	For them to make
3330000	3332000	And that team was busy doing the Kid Icarus game
3332000	3334000	On 3DS for a while
3334000	3336000	So that's why there was a
3336000	3338000	Big lull between Smash Brothers games
3338000	3340000	If I'm not mistaken
3340000	3342000	Which I'm surprised they still haven't ported that over
3342000	3344000	To like the Wii U
3344000	3346000	Maybe they just didn't do that well
3346000	3348000	They probably don't think it's worth the effort
3348000	3350000	I don't know, I don't know why
3350000	3352000	Because there is a lot of Kid Icarus love in Smash Brothers
3352000	3354000	I mean they made Palutena a character
3354000	3356000	Which was a little bit unexpected
3356000	3358000	But I think
3358000	3360000	The studio that's making Smash
3360000	3362000	Obviously is a little partial to their own games
3362000	3364000	There's also the fact that they have
3364000	3366000	Kirby, Meta Knight
3366000	3368000	And Dedede
3368000	3370000	That's kind of a lot of Kirby in the game
3370000	3372000	Which I'm sure Act Def is probably sitting there going
3372000	3374000	I don't see a problem
3374000	3376000	Neither do I but I'm just saying
3376000	3378000	In the big scope of things I'm surprised they have a lot
3378000	3380000	From these three franchises
3380000	3382000	I'm surprised they haven't brought in more Donkey Kong
3382000	3384000	Country stuff like King Krule or something like that
3384000	3386000	I'm really surprised
3386000	3388000	From the Kid Icarus franchise
3388000	3390000	That the eggplant wizard didn't show up as a character
3390000	3392000	I would have thought the eggplant wizard would have been an awesome character
3392000	3394000	And that's kind of one that's been missing for a while
3394000	3396000	But maybe there's only so much you can do with that
3396000	3398000	DLC
3398000	3400000	Yeah you never know, careful what you wish for right Rob?
3400000	3402000	Alright moving on
3402000	3404000	Let's get into something a little different with Dark Sakura
3404000	3406000	Well we do have
3406000	3408000	A group
3408000	3410000	Are you familiar with the Electronic Frontier Foundation?
3410000	3412000	Of course
3412000	3414000	Yes they are
3414000	3416000	A very very worthwhile group
3416000	3418000	But they actually were celebrating
3418000	3420000	National Crossword Day
3420000	3422000	Can I just say real quick
3422000	3424000	Cause this is relevant and important
3424000	3426000	EFF I definitely recognize them
3426000	3428000	They were one of the people fighting the podcast
3428000	3430000	The EFF played a big part of
3430000	3432000	Fighting that fight
3432000	3434000	So that I can podcast
3434000	3436000	And you can podcast
3436000	3438000	Without somebody trying to say
3438000	3440000	That they're owed money because
3440000	3442000	They invented feed technology
3442000	3444000	I mean I don't get with it
3444000	3446000	So anyway the EFF was a huge part of that
3446000	3448000	Well anyway
3448000	3450000	They have
3450000	3452000	The official crossword day has happened
3452000	3454000	And so they put out a digital crossword
3454000	3456000	That you can download
3456000	3458000	It's very cool
3458000	3460000	It's actually a PDF
3460000	3462000	And I'm gonna link it into our chat room
3462000	3464000	Or there's also
3464000	3466000	An interactive version on
3466000	3468000	GitHub
3468000	3470000	But it's called 2014
3470000	3472000	The year in copyright news
3472000	3474000	So it's all copyright related stuff
3474000	3476000	So related back to
3476000	3478000	2014 so
3478000	3480000	Thought I would share that with our listeners
3480000	3482000	It's a very old school game talking about
3482000	3484000	Some new school ideas
3484000	3486000	If you think about it
3486000	3488000	Crossword that's one of the oldest
3488000	3490000	Video games we have
3490000	3492000	You know before there were
3492000	3494000	Video games I used to love and they still make
3494000	3496000	These books and once in a while
3496000	3498000	About once a year I will still buy
3498000	3500000	One of these books to play
3500000	3502000	On the airplane like while I'm flying
3502000	3504000	Across country or something and that is the
3504000	3506000	Variety puzzles
3506000	3508000	And games have you seen these books?
3508000	3510000	They have all the logic
3510000	3512000	Problems and crosswords and all this
3512000	3514000	I'm sure somebody in chat has to know what I'm
3514000	3516000	Talking about that's like
3516000	3518000	Gaming without a console
3518000	3520000	For me that kind of leads into
3520000	3522000	They still do your crossword in the paper every Sunday
3522000	3524000	So yeah well every time I try
3524000	3526000	To do the crossword on a flight or something
3526000	3528000	Somebody else has already done it
3528000	3530000	Jerks in ink
3530000	3532000	In ink
3532000	3534000	I don't want to bring my own I wanted a complimentary one
3534000	3536000	Jeez Rob
3536000	3538000	Cheapo
3538000	3540000	Well thank you EFF for
3540000	3542000	Providing a different crossword with a message
3542000	3544000	With a message
3544000	3546000	Loki
3546000	3548000	Alright so there's
3548000	3550000	Apparently a new project
3550000	3552000	That Microsoft is working on called
3552000	3554000	Arcadia and it's thought to be
3554000	3556000	A game streaming
3556000	3558000	Technology
3558000	3560000	Or service by the sounds
3560000	3562000	Of it and this is
3562000	3564000	I guess coming from
3564000	3566000	Some job openings that they have
3566000	3568000	One for a cloud based operating
3568000	3570000	Systems group and one for listing
3570000	3572000	A project called Arcadia
3572000	3574000	And they're saying that I guess
3574000	3576000	It's similar to
3576000	3578000	I guess it's built off of the Azure cloud
3578000	3580000	And something that's supposed to replace
3580000	3582000	Microsoft's Rio game streaming tech
3582000	3584000	To me it sounds a lot like
3584000	3586000	Technology that you would see with like
3586000	3588000	The
3588000	3590000	Playstation streaming to
3590000	3592000	You know like the SharePlay
3592000	3594000	But like streaming to like the Vita
3594000	3596000	That type of stuff and that's what they're saying
3596000	3598000	Like the listing they said
3598000	3600000	The new operating systems group
3600000	3602000	OSG streaming team is leveraging
3602000	3604000	The cloud to bring premium unique experiences
3604000	3606000	To Microsoft's core platforms
3606000	3608000	These experiences will take advantage
3608000	3610000	Of the new geo distributed massive
3610000	3612000	Scaling service to redefine
3612000	3614000	What is possible by today's services
3614000	3616000	Or today's devices
3616000	3618000	The client team is building the user
3618000	3620000	Interface applications
3620000	3622000	Our user facing applications
3622000	3624000	Bridging the service and
3625000	3627000	Our team is small but growing
3627000	3629000	Dedicated to solving Microsoft's one
3629000	3631000	Biggest challenge in the creative fashion
3631000	3633000	So they're saying that also
3633000	3635000	Possibly
3635000	3637000	Going to be streaming to not only like
3637000	3639000	Microsoft devices but iOS and Android
3639000	3641000	That type of stuff so
3641000	3643000	Makes sense I think it would be kind of cool
3643000	3645000	If they did something like that
3645000	3647000	You know it seems to work
3647000	3649000	It's working out pretty well with
3649000	3651000	You know Playstation right now and I know that
3651000	3653000	It hasn't quite gotten to the point where
3653000	3655000	They can do it on well actually I take that
3655000	3657000	It has kind of gotten to the point where they
3657000	3659000	Can do that on Android devices because I remember
3659000	3661000	I saw that hack last week that they
3661000	3663000	Somehow got that working now where you can
3663000	3665000	Play your Playstation 4 games on your
3665000	3667000	Android tablets and stuff
3667000	3669000	So
3669000	3671000	Cool hey if I can find a way to
3671000	3673000	Game on the go you know and it works
3673000	3675000	Well over Wi-Fi I'm all down for that
3675000	3677000	Ever since Sony announced
3677000	3679000	Like Playstation now and SharePlay
3679000	3681000	I've been curious how Microsoft's going
3681000	3683000	Honestly I would like
3683000	3685000	And this is cool you know that you can do it
3685000	3687000	On a mobile device but I would like to be able to do that
3687000	3689000	On my laptop I would think that
3689000	3691000	There would be a way they're going to stream it to PCs
3691000	3693000	Because you know
3693000	3695000	Microsoft does have that Windows tie-in
3695000	3697000	Can you imagine if you could stream your Xbox One console to a PC
3697000	3699000	That would be really neat
3699000	3701000	That would be fun
3701000	3703000	Because I would just take my laptop with me
3703000	3705000	And Sony I'd love to do the same thing
3705000	3707000	All my systems I'll just have them plugged in
3707000	3709000	And I'll just play them on my laptop
3709000	3711000	If I'm down with that
3711000	3713000	Doesn't mean you'll be able to use a keyboard and mouse with everything
3713000	3715000	I don't want to but you know
3715000	3717000	I'm fine with using just the controllers
3717000	3719000	But that would be really neat
3719000	3721000	If you have the Xbox One in the living room
3721000	3723000	And you could just stream stuff to your PC desktop
3723000	3725000	And you could play the game
3725000	3727000	Using an Xbox One controller plugged into your PC or something
3727000	3729000	That would be pretty cool
3729000	3731000	Anyhow maybe one game that you are
3731000	3733000	Streaming and still playing is
3733000	3735000	Destiny I see a lot of people actually
3735000	3737000	Streaming this on Twitch
3738000	3740000	Well you should get on that
3740000	3742000	Get on it because a lot of people
3742000	3744000	I knew that were playing it kind of stopped
3744000	3746000	And if you want me to play I'll still sign in and play with you
3746000	3748000	It's one of those things like
3748000	3750000	Especially once you get into the game jam stuff
3750000	3752000	It's like I haven't really been
3752000	3754000	You get to it eventually
3754000	3756000	The only reason I've been playing games at all
3756000	3758000	Is because I'm playing while my son is still awake
3758000	3760000	It's not when I have free time or anything
3760000	3762000	I can work on my own stuff
3762000	3764000	So I haven't really been playing when he's going to sleep
3764000	3766000	But we'll see
3766000	3768000	Anyhow Destiny had a little
3768000	3770000	Minor patch this week
3770000	3772000	And the patch has to do with the expansion
3772000	3774000	The Dark Below
3774000	3776000	Which I'm not going to buy until they slash the price
3776000	3778000	Which I know it's inevitable they'll slash the price
3778000	3780000	Of this because I kind of don't think
3780000	3782000	Everybody bought it
3782000	3784000	I mean I don't know maybe some sales numbers will come out and prove me wrong
3784000	3786000	But I know a lot of people that have either sold the game back
3786000	3788000	Or like I'm not buying this
3788000	3790000	Because there's not enough there
3790000	3792000	So very curious to see how that's going to affect things
3792000	3794000	But anyway a patch did come out
3794000	3796000	We tweaked some of the gear drop rates
3796000	3798000	With Crota's End
3798000	3800000	Which is the Dark Below's raid
3800000	3802000	And more players will get equipment with their efforts
3802000	3804000	So now raid gear in Crota's End
3804000	3806000	Starts at level 30
3806000	3808000	And this will help you on an upgrade path to level 32
3808000	3810000	There's also a specific helmet item
3810000	3812000	And it will also spawn on normal mode now
3812000	3814000	And hard mode players have an additional chance
3814000	3816000	Of getting it as a drop
3816000	3818000	There's also some issues regarding reputation gains
3818000	3820000	Hive shield functionality
3820000	3822000	Pocket infinity charging
3822000	3824000	So I'm going to be playing a lot of Destiny 2
3824000	3826000	In a Destiny update that went live this week
3826000	3828000	So you know
3828000	3830000	Despite the fact that I might feel a little more meh
3830000	3832000	On Destiny now than when it first launched
3832000	3834000	At least props to Bungie for staying on top of it
3834000	3836000	And doing regular updates with the game
3836000	3838000	But I still am not a big fan of the fact
3838000	3840000	That the raid content
3840000	3842000	Kind of
3842000	3844000	Or the new expansion content
3844000	3846000	Kind of gates some old things
3846000	3848000	Like you know the raid of the week
3848000	3850000	Is only in the expansion
3850000	3852000	So if you don't pay the $10 you can't do the same stuff
3852000	3854000	That you were necessarily doing before
3854000	3856000	A little silly to me
3856000	3858000	And I hope they consider
3858000	3860000	Some fixes with that
3860000	3862000	If they haven't already to be honest
3862000	3864000	I haven't put the game in and played in a while
3864000	3866000	Maybe I will this week or if Loki ever tells me
3866000	3868000	Hey get on and play Destiny help me
3868000	3870000	Dark Sakura
3870000	3872000	Well we keep hearing about 38 Studios
3872000	3874000	The group in
3874000	3876000	Rhode Island that didn't quite make it
3876000	3878000	And pissed off the entire state
3878000	3880000	I thought I really thought all that news
3880000	3882000	Was done with I thought we were past that now
3882000	3884000	I guess not huh?
3884000	3886000	Well it turned out that
3886000	3888000	38 Studios board
3888000	3890000	Member fined for
3890000	3892000	Well it was getting fined for unregistered
3892000	3894000	Lobbying in Rhode Island
3894000	3896000	That
3896000	3898000	Actually
3898000	3900000	It was there's a hearing
3900000	3902000	Out there that says that
3902000	3904000	Thomas
3904000	3906000	Lobbyed state officials
3906000	3908000	And different politicians
3908000	3910000	About the
3910000	3912000	Company and
3912000	3914000	But he wasn't a registered lobbyist with the secretary
3914000	3916000	Of state but that
3916000	3918000	Lobbying is what led to the loan
3918000	3920000	That funded the company
3920000	3922000	So dude's gonna get
3922000	3924000	Fined $2000 if he doesn't
3924000	3926000	Fill in the proper reports
3926000	3928000	So nope
3928000	3930000	We haven't heard the last of them
3930000	3932000	File your report or else
3932000	3934000	Or how about lobbying is
3934000	3936000	Stupid
3936000	3938000	Alright
3938000	3940000	Let's move on
3940000	3942000	We're gonna travel around the world and check out
3942000	3944000	Some release dates and check out some things coming
3944000	3946000	To a store near you although I think
3946000	3948000	This segment might be a little empty
3948000	3950000	This week I don't know Loki is there anything
3950000	3952000	In the US? It is that time of year there is
3952000	3954000	Nothing coming out
3954000	3956000	Yeah unfortunately there
3956000	3958000	Is nothing coming out this week I mean
3958000	3960000	Tuesday in the states is what Christmas Eve
3960000	3962000	Eve as my sister calls it
3962000	3964000	So yeah there's not really
3964000	3966000	I mean they don't normally put anything out around
3966000	3968000	This time and even it's pretty dead
3968000	3970000	Up until March
3970000	3972000	The only thing I can say is if you have
3972000	3974000	You know your games with gold
3974000	3976000	Or if you've got
3976000	3978000	PlayStation Plus don't forget to download the free
3978000	3980000	Games I know right now starting
3980000	3982000	On the 16th they had SSX on
3982000	3984000	Xbox so I
3984000	3986000	Reminded myself today to go download that
3986000	3988000	Even if I may not play it or not I still have
3988000	3990000	Like money I gotta spend on there and I just
3990000	3992000	I honestly haven't been touching my Xbox in a long time
3992000	3994000	So I just have to
3994000	3996000	Figure out what I'm gonna
3996000	3998000	Buy for it I'm hoping
3998000	4000000	I hope I'll get an Xbox One at some point and I can
4000000	4002000	Just buy a digital game on that or something
4002000	4004000	But yeah
4004000	4006000	Just unfortunately not a lot coming out until January
4006000	4008000	Alright well
4008000	4010000	Japan being a different culture has a
4010000	4012000	Different pattern with their releases and so we are
4012000	4014000	Seeing some releases in Japan this week
4014000	4016000	In fact on the 25th of December we have
4016000	4018000	On the PlayStation 4 Laura Croft and the
4018000	4020000	Temple of Osiris comes out on the PlayStation 4
4020000	4022000	And Shadow of Mordor
4022000	4024000	Middle Earth comes out on the Japanese
4024000	4026000	Version on the PlayStation 4
4026000	4028000	This week on the 25th
4028000	4030000	Shadow of Mordor also making its way to the Xbox One
4030000	4032000	In Japan this week
4032000	4034000	Looking at the last gen consoles
4034000	4036000	PlayStation 3 hey guess what
4036000	4038000	Shadow of Mordor also on the PlayStation 3
4038000	4040000	This week and on the Wii U
4040000	4042000	Nothing this week
4042000	4044000	Wii U is not getting anything until Captain
4044000	4046000	Toad Treasure Tracker next
4046000	4048000	Year I didn't realize that game was not
4048000	4050000	Out in Japan oh never mind cause that's the Europe date
4050000	4052000	Not the Japan date oops
4052000	4054000	So gosh Japan doesn't get
4054000	4056000	A Wii U game until
4056000	4058000	Lego Marvel Super Heroes
4058000	4060000	On January 22nd
4060000	4062000	Which they should totally download or buy
4062000	4064000	Which is also well it's gonna go up against
4064000	4066000	On the same day Kirby Super Rainbow
4066000	4068000	Which is the Kirby Touch
4068000	4070000	Wii U game is on the 22nd
4070000	4072000	In Japan let's quickly
4072000	4074000	Check the Vita and the 3DS
4074000	4076000	There is one game on the Vita this week
4076000	4078000	Mahuka Koku no
4078000	4080000	Retosei Out of Order
4080000	4082000	Comes out this week that's from
4082000	4084000	Bandai Namco and lastly
4084000	4086000	On the 3DS this week
4086000	4088000	Atelier Deco
4088000	4090000	La Doll Collection
4090000	4092000	Looks like another title in the
4092000	4094000	I would say in the Atelier series but I don't think
4094000	4096000	That is what this is at all this is just a doll
4096000	4098000	Dress up game coming out
4098000	4100000	On
4100000	4102000	It's those dolls what
4102000	4104000	Jamie what do they call these dolls with the
4104000	4106000	Giant eyes that look like that one Lady Gaga
4106000	4108000	Video oh the Puleps
4108000	4110000	Yeah or the Blythe
4110000	4112000	Or the Puleps I think the Puleps
4112000	4114000	Yeah that looks like a Pulep
4114000	4116000	So it looks like that kind of little dress up
4116000	4118000	Game there dress up and decoration
4118000	4120000	On the 3DS I'm sure all of you
4120000	4122000	Are pre-ordering it right now
4122000	4124000	How about Europe Dark Sakura?
4124000	4126000	Not a damn thing
4126000	4128000	Um it like gave me
4128000	4130000	Some games but didn't say when
4130000	4132000	So I'm just gonna throw off a few of them
4132000	4134000	Sure Cosmic Star Heroine
4134000	4136000	Uh Duelist
4136000	4138000	Habitat
4138000	4140000	The Girl and the Robot
4140000	4142000	Some other stuff
4142000	4144000	Those are probably games that were
4144000	4146000	Announced for this year but never dated
4146000	4148000	So I'm thinking that's probably what it is
4148000	4150000	We'll see I'm gonna put file that under
4150000	4152000	Bullshit so yeah
4152000	4154000	Nothing no games for you guys in the UK
4154000	4156000	Sorry you don't get to play anything
4156000	4158000	Catch up on your backlog shit
4158000	4160000	Get a Spectrum
4160000	4162000	Just a couple more stories for you guys
4162000	4164000	Speaking of the Spectrum just a couple more stories
4164000	4166000	Than the classic game of the week
4166000	4168000	Loki
4168000	4170000	So um
4170000	4172000	You know I think we talked about this a while back
4172000	4174000	You know how the whole
4174000	4176000	Debate regarding
4176000	4178000	You know 1080p and upscale
4178000	4180000	1080p and the whole you know
4180000	4182000	Oh this game's not really 1080p
4182000	4184000	It's like 900p or whatever
4184000	4186000	Yes I do remember this debate
4186000	4188000	There was this lawsuit or
4188000	4190000	It was a class action lawsuit against
4190000	4192000	Killzone Shadowfall
4192000	4194000	And they were saying that you know
4194000	4196000	It was false advertising because it wasn't a native
4196000	4198000	You know 1080p
4198000	4200000	And so
4200000	4202000	Apparently the
4202000	4204000	Federal judge has ruled
4204000	4206000	I guess that a lot of the
4206000	4208000	Complaints have been dismissed
4208000	4210000	So there is
4210000	4212000	Only still one left I guess
4212000	4214000	And I'm trying to see here I believe it
4214000	4216000	Was that they were saying
4216000	4218000	Um
4218000	4220000	Let's see here
4220000	4222000	Something I think that still has to do with
4222000	4224000	The native or the razor sharp
4224000	4226000	1080p native resolution
4226000	4228000	Is false advertising
4228000	4230000	And they were claiming that it was blurry
4230000	4232000	To the point of distraction which honestly
4232000	4234000	Looking at the screenshots and
4234000	4236000	Videos of seeing a Killzone it looked pretty
4236000	4238000	Good I just don't understand why people
4238000	4240000	Would be complaining about that game there's
4240000	4242000	Plenty other games that look like crap
4242000	4244000	Um
4244000	4246000	But yeah basically
4246000	4248000	All but one argument
4248000	4250000	Basically that shouldn't agree that
4250000	4252000	The negligent misrepresentation
4252000	4254000	Claim cannot stand in its current
4254000	4256000	State as Ledor did
4256000	4258000	Not present a non economic
4258000	4260000	Loss such as personal injury or property
4260000	4262000	Damage yes he caused property
4262000	4264000	Damage because of the
4264000	4266000	The lack of pixels burned
4266000	4268000	My house down
4268000	4270000	Um yes
4270000	4272000	And so you know because of that you know
4272000	4274000	They granted them 30 days to file an
4274000	4276000	Amendment complaint in which case they say
4276000	4278000	Um they can sufficiently
4278000	4280000	Alleged that he or other punitive class
4280000	4282000	Members suffered such non economic
4282000	4284000	Damages I just
4284000	4286000	I the whole thing just seemed to be
4286000	4288000	Kind of a grab for money in the first place
4288000	4290000	I just don't see this
4290000	4292000	I'd be surprised if that last
4292000	4294000	Bit doesn't get dismissed
4294000	4296000	Or if it does go to court that
4296000	4298000	They still don't win I mean cause
4298000	4300000	I think they're just
4300000	4302000	Kind of stretching at this point trying to
4302000	4304000	I don't know if it ever
4304000	4306000	Says it's native 1080p anywhere
4306000	4308000	On like any of the advertising
4308000	4310000	Hey Murica
4310000	4312000	Ah
4312000	4314000	Anyhow uh alright
4314000	4316000	I got a story about a series
4316000	4318000	That I know a lot of you like I like this series
4318000	4320000	An awful lot it's pretty much all I use my 3DS
4320000	4322000	For now that Smash Brothers is on Wii U
4322000	4324000	And that game is Theatrhythm
4324000	4326000	And guess what Theatrhythm Dragon
4326000	4328000	Quest is going to be a thing
4328000	4330000	It was shown at Jump Festa 2015
4330000	4332000	Which was a big Square Enix festival
4332000	4334000	That's going on right now
4334000	4336000	We have some other stories about what came out of Jump Festa
4336000	4338000	A little later on in the show
4338000	4340000	But yeah Theatrhythm Dragon Quest is going to be a thing
4340000	4342000	Who knows if it will actually come out here
4342000	4344000	In America that's the big
4344000	4346000	Question right now but Dragon Quest
4346000	4348000	Theatrhythm will come out in Japan on March
4348000	4350000	26th of next year
4350000	4352000	Again no Western release yet confirmed
4352000	4354000	For the game if they're going to do it
4354000	4356000	I would imagine they'd announce it at E3
4356000	4358000	For a holiday release kind of like what they did with Curtain Call
4358000	4360000	I don't know if this would be the type of thing
4360000	4362000	That might be download only
4362000	4364000	Because I mean unfortunately over here
4364000	4366000	Dragon Quest is a little more niche
4366000	4368000	Especially when you consider
4368000	4370000	That there's probably going to be songs from Dragon Quest 10
4370000	4372000	In it which wasn't even released here
4372000	4374000	So I don't know but anyway there still
4374000	4376000	Will be field and event music stages
4376000	4378000	That are in the game
4378000	4380000	There will also be apparently a top down
4380000	4382000	Rock band type setup
4382000	4384000	That will take the four lane battle
4384000	4386000	Layout that was found
4386000	4388000	In the previous Theatrhythm games and
4388000	4390000	Turn it into something a little different there
4390000	4392000	So again March 26th
4392000	4394000	2015 is the big day
4394000	4396000	For that in Japan I'm sure some people will
4396000	4398000	Be importing that
4398000	4400000	Also good news for Japanese owners of
4400000	4402000	Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call
4402000	4404000	Some more DLC
4404000	4406000	Was confirmed for Final Fantasy
4406000	4408000	Curtain Call now there was some
4408000	4410000	Stuff that you would expect in this game such as the
4410000	4412000	Ultima Battle music from Final Fantasy 14
4412000	4414000	Which is really good by the way
4414000	4416000	Hard to miss as well will be
4416000	4418000	Coming out but those songs are going to be
4418000	4420000	Free for two weeks when they come out in Japan
4420000	4422000	So that's pretty cool but also get this
4422000	4424000	The opening titles and
4424000	4426000	Passionate rhythm from
4426000	4428000	Romancing Saga and Romancing
4428000	4430000	Saga 2
4430000	4432000	Saga Frontier will be getting a song in the game
4432000	4434000	The Meridian dance
4434000	4436000	From Secret of Mana is going
4436000	4438000	To be in Theatrhythm Curtain Call
4438000	4440000	And Chrono Trigger
4440000	4442000	Is getting a song
4442000	4444000	In Theatrhythm Final Fantasy
4444000	4446000	Which many people
4446000	4448000	Were saying Chrono Trigger should just get its own
4448000	4450000	Damn Theatrhythm game
4450000	4452000	But it's been so long
4452000	4454000	I don't know if that will happen
4454000	4456000	No announcement yet if those
4456000	4458000	Songs will make their way over
4458000	4460000	To the US I sure hope
4460000	4462000	So I think a lot of
4462000	4464000	People would really dig some
4464000	4466000	Of these songs in America
4466000	4468000	But we shall see
4468000	4470000	What do we have to do for like DLC
4470000	4472000	For Mario Kart 8 that's
4472000	4474000	Chocobo Racing
4474000	4476000	What do we have to do for that?
4476000	4478000	Or hell just make
4478000	4480000	A racing game. Shit it can't be
4480000	4482000	That expensive they have the fucking Sanrio
4482000	4484000	Games that come out that aren't that great
4484000	4486000	Chocobo Racing is coming to Final Fantasy 14
4486000	4488000	With the Chocobo breeding
4488000	4490000	Yeah but it's not Chocobo Kart Racing
4490000	4492000	I understand that
4492000	4494000	You're actually going to get to control your Chocobo though
4494000	4496000	It's probably
4496000	4498000	It's not going to be as robust as something that Mario Kart 8
4498000	4500000	There should really be like a whole
4500000	4502000	Derby Owners Club type game
4502000	4504000	Like Final Fantasy where you're just sitting there
4504000	4506000	Like guiding on them
4506000	4508000	I know I'm sounding fanboy
4508000	4510000	And you know what sometimes I just can't help it
4510000	4512000	You made Polteri cry
4512000	4514000	With Final Fantasy 14
4514000	4516000	The fact that they're bringing Triple Triad into the game
4516000	4518000	And Chrono
4518000	4520000	Yes they're bringing Chrono Trigger into Final Fantasy 14
4520000	4522000	No they're not
4522000	4524000	It's not canon if it comes in there
4524000	4526000	But can they get like the Golden Saucer up in there
4526000	4528000	That's what it is it's coming in the next patch
4528000	4530000	It's called the Manderville Gold Saucer
4530000	4532000	Is coming in the 2.5 patch
4532000	4534000	Before the expansion
4534000	4536000	There's more
4536000	4538000	Fucking Hilda whatever
4538000	4540000	The fuck is it
4540000	4542000	They haven't said if it's part of the Hildebrand quest or not
4542000	4544000	I hate him
4544000	4546000	I love him you're a hater
4546000	4548000	I am a hater because he's stupid
4548000	4550000	I like his dad though
4550000	4552000	I don't know if it was Allen or Shane that suggested this
4552000	4554000	I think it was Allen that said this
4554000	4556000	That it could be that his
4556000	4558000	No it was Shane because I think we were talking about Skype
4558000	4560000	It could be his dad that owns
4560000	4562000	The Gold Saucer
4562000	4564000	Or his mom
4564000	4566000	His mom has not been seen in the story
4566000	4568000	Hildebrand's mom
4568000	4570000	She could be the one that runs the Gold Saucer
4570000	4572000	She probably got smart and left him
4572000	4574000	So what was the new
4574000	4576000	The new jobs that they added for 14?
4576000	4578000	They announced
4578000	4580000	This didn't make our show roll but yes they announced
4580000	4582000	3 new jobs for Final Fantasy 14 that will be in the expansion
4582000	4584000	Dark Knight which is a new
4584000	4586000	Tank class it was not a tank in 11
4586000	4588000	But it will be a tank class now
4588000	4590000	They announced Astrologist which is the new healer class
4590000	4592000	Machinist
4592000	4594000	And Machinist
4594000	4596000	Is going to be the DPS class
4596000	4598000	I want to play an Aurra
4598000	4600000	Aurra is the new race
4600000	4602000	It's new to Final Fantasy
4602000	4604000	They look like Draenei but just not blue
4604000	4606000	They're pretty
4606000	4608000	They build mechs and stuff
4608000	4610000	That would be pretty bad
4610000	4612000	Do you remember
4612000	4614000	Edgar in Final Fantasy 6
4614000	4616000	Why did they tell me this?
4616000	4618000	That sounds so awesome
4618000	4620000	They're going to actually use little
4620000	4622000	Drones too
4622000	4624000	Looks awesome
4624000	4626000	It's kind of like the Engineer class
4626000	4628000	Come to the dark side
4628000	4630000	Do the thing
4630000	4632000	Sorry Nellie
4632000	4634000	That means
4634000	4636000	I'm not going to remake Mulan
4636000	4638000	But I'm probably going to do a second character
4638000	4640000	Edgar is like seriously my favorite character
4640000	4642000	From like pretty much all the entire series
4642000	4644000	They have the most bad ass weapons
4644000	4646000	This is why Final Fantasy 14
4646000	4648000	Is doing so awesome
4648000	4650000	And why the game continues to be awesome
4650000	4652000	The reason why
4652000	4654000	Is they know that
4654000	4656000	And they're acknowledging that Loki
4656000	4658000	They know that people love Edgar and that's why they're making
4658000	4660000	Machinist a class in the game
4660000	4662000	Just for the same reason they made a fucking Magitek armor
4662000	4664000	Something that you can actually get in the game
4664000	4666000	And ride around on
4666000	4668000	It's that same type of stuff
4668000	4670000	I wouldn't doubt
4670000	4672000	At some point they'll put the fucking Opera House from Final Fantasy 6
4672000	4674000	Somehow in the game
4674000	4676000	They have Ultros
4676000	4678000	With the old school battle music
4678000	4680000	In the game so
4680000	4682000	That's why the game is doing so well
4682000	4684000	I'm on that quest line right now
4684000	4686000	They know what people like
4686000	4688000	That fight is kind of a bitch
4688000	4690000	It's harder than the Shiva fight
4690000	4692000	You can teach me the mechanics before I try it
4692000	4694000	You get turned into an imp
4694000	4696000	And you have to imp punch
4696000	4698000	The other guy
4698000	4700000	Before he does his thing
4700000	4702000	Can you imp punch him in his
4702000	4704000	Imp junk?
4704000	4706000	SSJ100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
4706000	4708000	Nelly can't hear you Rob
4708000	4710000	She's pouring sand in your car's gas tank
4710000	4712000	Probably
4712000	4714000	Alright you know what
4714000	4716000	Let's travel back to a time when games were a lot simpler
4716000	4718000	You know they weren't
4718000	4720000	Just self referential
4720000	4722000	Although this game might have been a little bit
4722000	4724000	It's the classic game of the week
4724000	4726000	Where Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault
4726000	4728000	And find a game and she thinks
4728000	4730000	You know what
4730000	4732000	Since there's no games coming out in the US or Europe this week
4732000	4734000	You go fucking play this game
4734000	4736000	You do the thing
4736000	4738000	You get Loki subbed
4738000	4740000	To Final Fantasy 14
4740000	4742000	And then you play this
4742000	4744000	Dark Soccer what is
4744000	4746000	If you make your character by the way
4746000	4748000	No that will never happen
4748000	4750000	I will just name my
4750000	4752000	I'll name him
4752000	4754000	Just after what I had in my other class
4754000	4756000	Alright
4756000	4758000	Here it is your classic game of the week Dark Soccer
4758000	4760000	I love love love this game and I'm so excited
4760000	4762000	It's finally a fucking
4762000	4764000	Classic game of the week
4764000	4766000	I picked a game that came out the year I graduated high school
4766000	4768000	Oh my god
4768000	4770000	Why do you insist
4770000	4772000	Is that your new thing you're going to come out here and go
4772000	4774000	I picked this game because it's now officially
4774000	4776000	Nine years old and so are you
4776000	4778000	No Rob this is more than
4778000	4780000	Ten years old
4780000	4782000	This is 20 years old
4782000	4784000	Remember I skipped my 20th high school reunion
4784000	4786000	To play this game
4786000	4788000	Oh and the oven is preheated so we got
4788000	4790000	I better do this quick because Latkes
4790000	4792000	Oh yeah
4792000	4794000	Point blank also known as
4794000	4796000	Gun Bullet
4796000	4798000	I love that game
4798000	4800000	Or it's also been nicknamed
4800000	4802000	Gun Buddy
4802000	4804000	It came out by Namco
4804000	4806000	In the arcade Playstation
4806000	4808000	It's got a version on the DS
4808000	4810000	But it first came out in 1994
4810000	4812000	For the arcade and it is the first
4812000	4814000	Light gun game
4814000	4816000	That Namco has ever done
4816000	4818000	Basically
4818000	4820000	It's a fucking light gun game
4820000	4822000	But you have different types of
4822000	4824000	Quests that you have
4824000	4826000	And they're different puzzles
4826000	4828000	Like the one on the video
4828000	4830000	That I'm linking here is actually one of the harder ones
4830000	4832000	Where it's a cut out shoot
4832000	4834000	That you go down a hall
4834000	4836000	And you have to shoot all the bad guys
4836000	4838000	And none of the civilians
4838000	4840000	You got ones where you shoot
4840000	4842000	Different targets of a color
4842000	4844000	You get
4844000	4846000	Different
4846000	4848000	Shoot all the balls
4848000	4850000	Yes
4850000	4852000	You shoot the balls
4852000	4854000	And it's like Buster Brothers
4854000	4856000	The way that the balls work
4856000	4858000	You shoot them and they get smaller
4858000	4860000	That would be so easy to make
4860000	4862000	It's funny
4862000	4864000	This game is so fucking good
4864000	4866000	I can't
4866000	4868000	You have to also protect Dr. Don and Dr. Dan
4868000	4870000	You have other challenges
4870000	4872000	Some things that have in common
4872000	4874000	With police trainer
4874000	4876000	Different difficulty levels you have
4876000	4878000	Practice, beginner, advanced, and very hard
4878000	4880000	Because some people like it very hard
4880000	4882000	Determine how many stages
4882000	4884000	That you have to finish
4884000	4886000	To complete the game
4886000	4888000	As well as their difficulty
4888000	4890000	And then you get four missions
4890000	4892000	In each of those types of groups
4892000	4894000	So you can do different ones
4894000	4896000	In different orders
4896000	4898000	So you lose your lives by failing to complete your quota
4898000	4900000	Within your time limit
4900000	4902000	Or shooting a bomb
4902000	4904000	Or letting Dr. Don or Dr. Dan die
4904000	4906000	When you have to protect them
4906000	4908000	Incorrectly answering questions
4908000	4910000	By shooting the wrong answers
4910000	4912000	Shooting a cardboard civilian
4912000	4914000	Shooting a cardboard geisha
4914000	4916000	Failing to complete a quota
4916000	4918000	For multiple life things
4918000	4920000	Letting meteors destroy the earth
4920000	4922000	Because that's always a day ruiner
4922000	4924000	Running out of bullets
4924000	4926000	Shooting incorrect differences
4926000	4928000	Letting aliens steal your shot
4928000	4930000	And more
4930000	4932000	So the things that you're
4932000	4934000	Gauged on is accuracy, intelligence, memory
4934000	4936000	Simulation, visual acuity
4936000	4938000	And speed
4938000	4940000	So as far as the games that have come out
4940000	4942000	In this series
4942000	4944000	We have Point Blank, the first one in 1994
4944000	4946000	Or Gun Bullet
4946000	4948000	As it's called
4948000	4950000	Point Blank 2, which came out as
4950000	4952000	Gun Body
4952000	4954000	Ghoul Panic
4954000	4956000	Or Baekhyun
4956000	4958000	Which was a haunted house theme
4958000	4960000	In 3D graphics instead of the
4960000	4962000	Yes, the cat bug level
4962000	4964000	Yes, the cat bug level
4964000	4966000	Point Blank 3
4966000	4968000	Or Gun Ballina
4968000	4970000	And Point Blank DS
4970000	4972000	Which was a
4972000	4974000	Uno no Tatsujin Gun Bullet Trainer
4976000	4978000	But yeah, it actually
4978000	4980000	Like I said, it was an arcade release
4980000	4982000	But then it came out on the Playstation
4982000	4984000	Which I've got versions of this that I cannot play
4984000	4986000	Because we can't use light guns on modern TVs
4988000	4990000	And the Playstation had
4990000	4992000	The arcade mode included
4992000	4994000	But it also had like an RPG mode
4994000	4996000	And then it was recreated in Point Blank 2
4996000	4998000	And then
4998000	5000000	So basically the very last iteration that came out
5000000	5002000	Was in 2006
5002000	5004000	With
5004000	5006000	Sorry, Point Blank DS
5006000	5008000	Or as I said, Uno no Tatsujin
5008000	5010000	Gun Bullet Trainer
5010000	5012000	There you go
5012000	5014000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week
5014000	5016000	I really love this game, Point Blank
5016000	5018000	Available
5018000	5020000	In the arcades
5020000	5022000	So you know, on main cabinets everywhere
5022000	5024000	Or the more ethical way of
5024000	5026000	On the Playstation, even though
5026000	5028000	You're gonna have to get an old TV to play it on
5028000	5030000	It reminds me, where the hell are my gun guns?
5030000	5032000	I wish they'd bring this back
5032000	5034000	Here's what you can do with the Morpheus
5036000	5038000	That's what I want with the Morpheus
5038000	5040000	The Move Controllers
5040000	5042000	They had the gun controllers for that
5042000	5044000	They had Time Crisis
5044000	5046000	They had the Toy Story game on Wii
5046000	5048000	Which is a very similar type of thing
5048000	5050000	Well they also have it on the Playstation 3
5050000	5052000	Yeah, that's right
5052000	5054000	Yeah, I'm down with that
5054000	5056000	Come on Namco, it's been a
5056000	5058000	It's been a long time
5058000	5060000	Hell, just bring it to
5060000	5062000	Well, I don't know if they could do it on Virtual Console
5062000	5064000	But that'd be awesome on Virtual Console
5064000	5066000	Point Blank is the reason the CRT should never truly die
5066000	5068000	YYR wants to point out
5068000	5070000	Shameless plug
5070000	5072000	My game, Sharpshooter, on Xbox Live Indie games
5072000	5074000	Is basically Point Blank using the analog stick
5074000	5076000	Instead of a gun
5076000	5078000	Also crappy graphics, but the gameplay is there
5078000	5080000	Hey, you know what?
5080000	5082000	YYR kind of planted the seed that led to this whole game jam idea
5082000	5084000	That we're going to get into tonight
5084000	5086000	So I have no problem plugging his stuff
5086000	5088000	YYR
5088000	5090000	YYR is doing the Lord's work
5090000	5092000	In my opinion, between
5092000	5094000	Bungie ferret tossing and pixel shits
5094000	5096000	So you know what? Plug away
5096000	5098000	Plug away
5098000	5100000	Let's take a break
5100000	5102000	We're going to take a quick break, guys
5102000	5104000	But when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio

5114000	5116000	To prevent, to present
5116000	5118000	Not prevent
5118000	5120000	If we pick the wrong theme, it might prevent it
5120000	5122000	But we are going to present
5122000	5124000	The VOG
5124000	5126000	game jam

5130000	5132000	Ready to go
5132000	5134000	You just need to know the theme
5134000	5136000	So we are going to pick that theme when we come back
5136000	5138000	After a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio

5152000	5154000	Whatever it is you celebrate this December
5154000	5156000	It's Hanukkah
5156000	5158000	Right now
5158000	5160000	It's Hanukkah
5160000	5162000	It is Hanukkah right now
5162000	5164000	But this week also sees
5164000	5166000	You know, Christmas
5166000	5168000	Which is kind of a big deal to some people
5168000	5170000	Which is kind of a big deal to some people
5170000	5172000	Kwanzaa, what else
5172000	5174000	Is Festivus this week?
5174000	5176000	When is Festivus? I don't know
5176000	5178000	Ramadan, I don't know
5178000	5180000	Ramadan is in the middle of the year
5180000	5182000	What is the other holiday I am thinking of
5182000	5184000	This time of year
5184000	5186000	Solstice for some people
5186000	5188000	Saturnalia, which is today I believe
5188000	5190000	What is the other big one this winter
5190000	5192000	That is the Solstice, Yule
5192000	5194000	Hanukkah going on
5194000	5196000	Kwanzaa going on
5196000	5198000	Boxing Day
5198000	5200000	That's the day after Christmas
5200000	5202000	It's like Black Friday in Canada
5202000	5204000	But instead of trying to kill each other
5204000	5206000	They all push each other and apologize
5206000	5208000	Sorry, sorry
5208000	5210000	Sorry
5210000	5212000	Try to get that crockpot
5212000	5214000	Anyway
5214000	5216000	Let's move on
5216000	5218000	And try to get into
5218000	5220000	Some more gaming news
5220000	5222000	And we are going to start off with some rapid
5222000	5224000	Fire news, Loki
5224000	5226000	Which is kind of cool
5226000	5228000	Even though we don't technically have our first
5228000	5230000	Female character in a Grand Theft Auto
5230000	5232000	Game, unless you can count
5232000	5234000	Grand Theft Auto online
5234000	5236000	Now, Payday 2 is getting its first
5236000	5238000	Female gang member
5238000	5240000	In some new DLC
5240000	5242000	Her pseudonym is Clover
5242000	5244000	And I guess she is joining
5244000	5246000	Joining in on the
5246000	5248000	Heist scene
5248000	5250000	Also they are going to have a unique weapon
5250000	5252000	Called the Shillelagh weapon
5252000	5254000	The Shillelagh, so is she Irish?
5254000	5256000	She is Irish
5256000	5258000	And there is also a new mission
5258000	5260000	I guess called the Diamond Heist
5260000	5262000	They will try to swipe
5262000	5264000	I guess you would try to swipe the
5264000	5266000	World's most famous diamond from a
5266000	5268000	Heavily guarded museum
5268000	5270000	So the Diamond Heist
5270000	5272000	DLC, that would be $7
5272000	5274000	And then
5274000	5276000	I guess $5 for the character pack
5276000	5278000	So
5278000	5280000	That's pretty cool
5280000	5282000	Definitely looks like
5282000	5284000	She would fit right in with Grand Theft Auto
5284000	5286000	Or Payday 2
5286000	5288000	I have to check out Payday 2
5288000	5290000	I got Payday 1
5290000	5292000	I got it free when they had it on there for a little bit
5292000	5294000	I miss chocolate Paydays, those were delicious
5294000	5296000	And then of course
5296000	5298000	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto
5298000	5300000	Grand Theft Auto 5, they kind of do stuff
5300000	5302000	For the holidays every now and then
5302000	5304000	I haven't played my game
5304000	5306000	Recently yet, but I know they are
5306000	5308000	Going to have snow
5308000	5310000	In Los Santos, so you can check that out
5310000	5312000	But they also have Festive Surprise
5312000	5314000	Update
5314000	5316000	Which is going to add
5316000	5318000	A lot of Christmas and holiday themed
5318000	5320000	Things, including
5320000	5322000	They've got brand new weapons
5322000	5324000	Also Christmas sweaters
5324000	5326000	Had scarves, they had a mask that looks like
5326000	5328000	A gingerbread man that's kind of creepy
5328000	5330000	A penguin mask
5330000	5332000	They are also going to have some
5332000	5334000	New Year's stuff
5334000	5336000	Including a fireworks launcher
5336000	5338000	Rocket ammo again, just like
5338000	5340000	Last year
5340000	5342000	Hot Rod, Christmas Rat Loader
5342000	5344000	Slam Van
5344000	5346000	Oh, proxy mines and a
5346000	5348000	Homey Missile Launcher were added to the game as well
5348000	5350000	And of course, all that is free
5350000	5352000	So go check it out
5352000	5354000	And to go with that
5354000	5356000	They've been
5356000	5358000	Heists have been promised for Grand Theft Auto Online
5358000	5360000	Forever now
5360000	5362000	It was supposed to have been out around the time
5362000	5364000	That Grand Theft Auto Online launched
5365000	5367000	And this week they had a new trailer
5367000	5369000	For heists that are going to be coming early
5369000	5371000	2015
5371000	5373000	And it looks pretty awesome
5373000	5375000	Definitely going to
5375000	5377000	They even kind of poke fun at it a little bit
5377000	5379000	In there talking about
5379000	5381000	Kind of a little bit of a delay
5381000	5383000	But it's showing off different types of missions
5383000	5385000	It can go on
5385000	5387000	Breaking people out of jail
5387000	5389000	And all sorts of
5389000	5391000	Bank heists and that kind of stuff
5391000	5393000	Looks pretty cool, should be coming to
5393000	5395000	Platforms early next year
5395000	5397000	Hopefully sooner than later
5397000	5399000	Alright
5399000	5401000	Let's see here
5401000	5403000	Last but not least
5403000	5405000	More DLC for LittleBigPlanet 3
5405000	5407000	I guess it would be for everything
5407000	5409000	Because
5409000	5411000	I think those characters are interchangeable
5411000	5413000	But they're going to have
5413000	5415000	Frozen characters
5415000	5417000	Making their way to
5417000	5419000	LittleBigPlanet
5419000	5421000	Oh, hooray
5421000	5423000	They're going to be able to have
5423000	5425000	Elsa, Anna, Sven, Kristoff, and
5425000	5427000	Marshmallow in the medicine man skins
5427000	5429000	Which can be purchased for
5429000	5431000	$1.99 a piece or in the whole
5431000	5433000	Costume pack which would include
5433000	5435000	The exclusive Olaf skin
5435000	5437000	For $5.99
5437000	5439000	And they're going to be releasing
5439000	5441000	A winter creator kit for free to go along with that
5441000	5443000	Look, I love Disney
5443000	5445000	And I'm sure this is fine
5445000	5447000	I have not seen Frozen
5447000	5449000	I don't know how the fuck I never saw it
5449000	5451000	I so rarely get out to movies anymore
5451000	5453000	I just never saw Frozen
5453000	5455000	But the more and more overexposed Frozen gets
5455000	5457000	The less and less I want to see the damn movie
5457000	5459000	Because I'm just like, stop
5459000	5461000	There's like an entire
5461000	5463000	Archive of Disney everything
5463000	5465000	And it's still everything Frozen
5465000	5467000	Like half of Disneyland is Frozentown
5467000	5469000	Right now
5469000	5471000	Why can't it be all like, you know, I don't know
5471000	5473000	Wreck-It Ralph or Big Hero 6
5473000	5475000	Yes, exactly
5475000	5477000	Exactly
5477000	5479000	Alright, anyhow
5479000	5481000	There is more news coming out of the Jump
5481000	5483000	Festival over in Japan
5483000	5485000	Including a new trailer for Final Fantasy
5485000	5487000	XV that showed up
5487000	5489000	I'm very excited about this game
5489000	5491000	Even though, I got to admit, seeing the English
5491000	5493000	Voice acting in the game, I'm a little bit worried
5493000	5495000	Because it wasn't exactly
5495000	5497000	The best, but well
5497000	5499000	It was better than Destiny's
5499000	5501000	So we'll see
5501000	5503000	So this game will be coming out
5503000	5505000	I'm assuming they're trying to make it for holiday
5505000	5507000	Next year, especially with the demo coming out
5507000	5509000	So we'll see if it makes it
5509000	5511000	But other notable things in the trailer
5511000	5513000	They showed a Titan summon
5513000	5515000	In the trailer and it looked amazing
5515000	5517000	He was gigantic
5517000	5519000	And it looked like he was about to step on one of the guys
5519000	5521000	That was pretty cool
5521000	5523000	And they revealed that they're going to have Sid
5523000	5525000	In the game, of course, but this time Sid is a woman
5525000	5527000	Named Sydney
5527000	5529000	And Sydney is an engineer
5529000	5531000	And she has a bit of an accent
5531000	5533000	And she introduces herself as Sydney
5533000	5535000	And they call her Sid for short
5535000	5537000	Why not?
5537000	5539000	Anyhow, they
5539000	5541000	Also have announced
5541000	5543000	Not Square, but Nintendo has announced
5543000	5545000	That Duck Hunt will be coming out to the Wii U
5545000	5547000	Virtual Console
5547000	5549000	We talked about that a while ago
5549000	5551000	I think that news just came out this week
5551000	5553000	That it's officially coming out to the Virtual Console
5553000	5555000	It's dated now
5555000	5557000	Oh, they have the date now?
5557000	5559000	Christmas Day
5559000	5561000	When they were talking about Smash
5561000	5563000	They mentioned Duck Hunt
5563000	5565000	But I don't think they had a date yet
5565000	5567000	Well now it has a date
5567000	5569000	So it's December 25th is the day that it's coming out
5569000	5571000	I have no idea how that is going to work
5571000	5573000	With the light gun
5573000	5575000	I'm assuming it's using the Wiimote as the controller
5575000	5577000	Maybe tapping the gamepad would be kind of cool too
5577000	5579000	But I doubt it
5579000	5581000	Neat
5581000	5583000	Don't forget, there's also the whole
5583000	5585000	Many people remember the Duck Hunt part
5585000	5587000	But it's also the clay pigeon shooter thing
5587000	5589000	They have in there too
5589000	5591000	The original game that the whole thing was based on
5591000	5593000	But anyway
5593000	5595000	Also coming out on the 25th
5595000	5597000	Of this month
5597000	5599000	The same day
5599000	5601000	Shantae and the Pirate's Curse
5601000	5603000	Is finally coming to the Wii U
5603000	5605000	And I know some people have been awaiting this game
5605000	5607000	It's been out on the 3DS for a little bit
5607000	5609000	But of course the Wii U version will have
5609000	5611000	HD character portraits
5611000	5613000	Off TV play
5613000	5615000	Classic Controller Pro
5615000	5617000	And Wii U Pro Controller support
5617000	5619000	And he's a very talented individual
5619000	5621000	So I'm sure a lot of people will be checking out Shantae
5621000	5623000	And hopefully enough people buy this game
5623000	5625000	So that the Nintendo
5625000	5627000	E-Shop can say, Shantae, you stay
5627000	5629000	Alright
5629000	5631000	And one more little quick announcement here about
5631000	5633000	Killer Instinct
5633000	5635000	Of course the free to play fighting game on the Xbox
5635000	5637000	Riptor
5637000	5639000	Is making its way to Killer Instinct this week
5639000	5641000	And December
5641000	5643000	17th was the day that Riptor hit the game
5643000	5645000	I guess that was
5645000	5647000	A little bit earlier or whatever
5647000	5649000	Anyhow, the new design is similar to the old design
5649000	5651000	For Riptor
5651000	5653000	There you go, some extra little
5653000	5655000	New high definition features on
5655000	5657000	Riptor
5657000	5659000	A game which I will certainly check out whenever
5659000	5661000	I finally get around to getting an Xbox One
5661000	5663000	I thought I would buy it this holiday
5663000	5665000	But
5665000	5667000	Sadly didn't get one in time
5667000	5669000	For the big holiday
5669000	5671000	Alright, Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?
5671000	5673000	Rescued the latkes
5673000	5675000	Alright
5675000	5677000	They look well done over there
5677000	5679000	They are done, they have to cool off a little bit
5679000	5681000	D-U-N
5681000	5683000	Well, first of all for the holidays there are
5683000	5685000	Some freebies going on
5685000	5687000	And some happiness to be had
5687000	5689000	So first of all
5689000	5691000	The
5691000	5693000	There's a game called
5693000	5695000	Enter the Gungeon
5695000	5697000	And Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike
5697000	5699000	They are both free on Steam right now
5699000	5701000	And
5701000	5703000	Especially in the Fork Parker game
5703000	5705000	You get features like
5705000	5707000	Snow Helicopter, Dope Beat
5707000	5709000	Ethics
5709000	5711000	Reverse Monetization, Hot Tubs
5711000	5713000	Falling
5713000	5715000	And Ropes
5715000	5717000	So there you go
5717000	5719000	Next up, Capcom though
5719000	5721000	Is going to be delisting
5721000	5723000	Marvel vs. Capcom
5723000	5725000	Origins very soon
5725000	5727000	So get it while you can
5727000	5729000	It's going to be taken off the Playstation Network
5729000	5731000	On December 23rd
5731000	5733000	And Xbox Live Arcade on December 31st
5733000	5735000	Get it while you can
5735000	5737000	Right now it's $15
5737000	5739000	And then
5739000	5741000	Last but not least, Halfbrick
5741000	5743000	Studios is giving away
5743000	5745000	Every game in its
5745000	5747000	IOS catalog for free right now

5763000	5765000	I like free things
5765000	5767000	I do too
5767000	5769000	Alright
5769000	5771000	Bummer about those games
5771000	5773000	Getting delisted but I guess it makes sense
5773000	5775000	With all the licensing and so forth
5775000	5777000	Well one thing we don't plan on delisting from this show
5777000	5779000	Anytime soon is the chance for you guys
5779000	5781000	To have your say in a segment we call
5781000	5783000	The Fugal Question of the Week
5787000	5789000	You take the words
5789000	5791000	Facebook and Google Plus
5791000	5793000	And slam them together and you get
5793000	5795000	Fugal
5795000	5797000	And we're going to ask our community a question
5797000	5799000	As we do every week
5799000	5801000	And this week has to do with
5801000	5803000	The video game jam
5803000	5805000	That we are starting tonight
5805000	5807000	The video game jam kicking off tonight
5807000	5809000	We want all of our awesome listeners
5809000	5811000	To create something, dammit
5811000	5813000	And so we're asking you
5813000	5815000	What should the theme be?
5815000	5817000	So I don't think Loki has finished his list yet
5817000	5819000	And I don't think Dark Soccer has finished her list yet
5819000	5821000	Finished, started, you know, same thing
5821000	5823000	Alright
5823000	5825000	Bobby hasn't finished his list yet
5825000	5827000	I don't know
5827000	5829000	Or maybe he has
5829000	5831000	So we want you guys to have your say
5831000	5833000	On what should be on the list
5833000	5835000	So here it is, some of the answers from Facebook
5835000	5837000	We have some answers here on Facebook
5837000	5839000	Such as Hitstun
5839000	5841000	Who says three colors
5841000	5843000	Should be the theme
5843000	5845000	And Hitstun wants to remind us that
5845000	5847000	Food and rotation
5847000	5849000	Are also things that were submitted
5849000	5851000	On the comments to last week's episode
5851000	5853000	I believe boobs was also submitted
5853000	5855000	Twice as the theme
5855000	5857000	So you got three colors
5857000	5859000	Food and rotation
5859000	5861000	You know why I like three colors?
5861000	5863000	Because it reminds me of the old school computer monitors
5863000	5865000	Although I think technically that was CMYK
5865000	5867000	I think were the colors that it could do
5867000	5869000	Black is technically not a color
5869000	5871000	Alright
5871000	5873000	Let's see, Milton H says
5873000	5875000	Theater
5875000	5877000	Theater should be the theme
5877000	5879000	Alright we'll see, we'll see
5879000	5881000	Fifth Dream suggesting unicorns
5881000	5883000	I think I brought that one up earlier in the show
5883000	5885000	Unicorns, that would be a lot of fun
5885000	5887000	And Raginator
5887000	5889000	In typical Raginator suggestion
5889000	5891000	Says either explosive projectile diarrhea
5891000	5893000	Or ginger pubes
5893000	5895000	Oh Raginator
5895000	5897000	And we only have one answer
5897000	5899000	One lone answer over on Google Plus
5899000	5901000	And it's actdeft suggesting
5901000	5903000	And I like this one
5903000	5905000	How about hats?
5905000	5907000	Well how about hats?
5907000	5909000	Alright
5909000	5911000	There it is, some of the suggestions from you guys
5911000	5913000	We will see what makes the list here
5913000	5915000	In just a little bit
5915000	5917000	But we have a few more stories for you guys
5917000	5919000	Before we get to that list list
5919000	5921000	Alright so
5921000	5923000	Let's talk a little bit about
5923000	5925000	Let's see here
5925000	5927000	Steam
5927000	5929000	So the Steam Controller
5929000	5931000	Still not out yet
5931000	5933000	But it's been going
5933000	5935000	Undergoing several revisions
5935000	5937000	And the newest revision of the Steam Controller
5937000	5939000	Actually kind of is unveiled
5939000	5941000	Based off of
5941000	5943000	An image that was in the Steam Client Beta
5943000	5945000	And it shows now
5945000	5947000	Where the
5947000	5949000	You know how they kind of have those
5949000	5951000	Crazy circle
5951000	5953000	Touch pad things that were
5953000	5955000	The analog sticks
5955000	5957000	I remember last time that they added
5957000	5959000	Actually an analog stick to the controller
5959000	5961000	Now there's a d-pad where one of those
5961000	5963000	Circle pads is
5963000	5965000	Or I guess it's still part of the circle pad
5965000	5967000	But there's like some sort of d-pad
5967000	5969000	Cross mark on it
5969000	5971000	So I don't know
5971000	5973000	It's more and more becoming like an
5973000	5975000	Xbox 360 controller
5975000	5977000	As time progresses
5977000	5979000	It's just slowly
5979000	5981000	Evolving into like an Xbox
5981000	5983000	Controller or like a
5983000	5985000	New pro controller or something
5985000	5987000	But uh
5987000	5989000	I don't know
5989000	5991000	It'll be interesting to see
5991000	5993000	What that looks like when it's actually released
5993000	5995000	Hell it'll be interesting to see what these
5995000	5997000	Scene boxes look like when they're actually released
5997000	5999000	Yeah won't it have been a year
5999000	6001000	Since they were announced
6001000	6003000	When we finally get around to the CES
6003000	6005000	Has it only been a year?
6005000	6007000	I think CES was when they announced it
6007000	6009000	Whoa why is our outro playing
6009000	6011000	Sorry about that it's not over yet
6011000	6013000	Be quiet Jason
6013000	6015000	My fault sorry
6015000	6017000	Um so yeah I'm not sure
6017000	6019000	Um
6019000	6021000	I'm surprised it's only been a year
6021000	6023000	But it's taking
6023000	6025000	Taking a long time I guess
6025000	6027000	I don't know
6027000	6029000	Definitely less excited about
6029000	6031000	Them kind of taking over as like a console
6031000	6033000	Though the buzz
6033000	6035000	Is kind of dropped off
6035000	6037000	Completely
6037000	6039000	I think I don't know
6039000	6041000	Alright one more story for you guys
6041000	6043000	And this has to do with
6043000	6045000	World of Warcraft
6045000	6047000	Which I've been playing a little bit thanks to the new
6047000	6049000	Expansion and some updates were
6049000	6051000	Finally posted this week I was curious when they were
6051000	6053000	Going to finally talk about what their first
6053000	6055000	Major patch will have for
6055000	6057000	Warlords of Draenor and they finally talked a little bit about that
6057000	6059000	But
6059000	6061000	You know it doesn't really matter what else the note said
6061000	6063000	Because
6063000	6065000	A lot of people very interested
6065000	6067000	In one of these points that was
6067000	6069000	On the blue post that was made about this
6069000	6071000	About potentially adding
6071000	6073000	A subscription currency
6073000	6075000	And they're comparing this
6075000	6077000	To the Plex currency in EVE Online
6077000	6079000	And what would happen is that you could buy
6079000	6081000	And sell game time tokens
6081000	6083000	For in game gold
6083000	6085000	Saying quote our current thought on this is that
6085000	6087000	It would give players a way to use their surplus
6087000	6089000	Gold to cover some of their
6089000	6091000	Subscription cost while giving players
6091000	6093000	Who might have less play time
6093000	6095000	An option for acquiring gold
6095000	6097000	From other players through a legit
6097000	6099000	And secure system
6099000	6101000	So this is going to cause a lot of people to perk up
6101000	6103000	When the world's biggest MMO
6103000	6105000	Which a lot of people have been saying should go
6105000	6107000	Free to play already
6107000	6109000	When they're talking about possibly
6109000	6111000	Funding subscriptions through
6111000	6113000	In game gold
6113000	6115000	Now granted it's not going to be like you just pay the gold
6115000	6117000	For the subscription there still has to be that exchange
6117000	6119000	Of currency but this will
6119000	6121000	In some ways combat
6121000	6123000	The third party market that's out there
6123000	6125000	For gold buying
6125000	6127000	And they tried to do this before with a pet
6127000	6129000	They sold a pet on the marketplace
6129000	6131000	But it was something that would be tradable
6131000	6133000	And you could actually sell it on the market boards
6133000	6135000	And what was interesting is that the market kind of
6135000	6137000	Bottomed out on those pets really fast
6137000	6139000	And so people bought them and
6139000	6141000	They wouldn't sell for a lot of gold in game
6141000	6143000	So it would be very interesting to see what happens
6143000	6145000	Because when you're talking about subscription fees
6145000	6147000	I mean that is literally the life blood of a game
6147000	6149000	Much different than the pet so it's going to be very interesting
6149000	6151000	To see how that plays out
6151000	6153000	But would you be interested
6153000	6155000	In playing Final Fantasy XI if you could pay for your subscription
6155000	6157000	In Gil?
6157000	6159000	It's hard enough to earn Gil in the game
6159000	6161000	I don't know if I'd want to
6161000	6163000	I ain't sure, why not
6163000	6165000	But I don't know if I'd want to do that
6165000	6167000	Just drop the subscription down to like
6167000	6169000	Five dollars a month or something
6169000	6171000	Something ridiculously cheap
6173000	6175000	I don't know, even twelve bucks is not a lot
6175000	6177000	But it's been that for a long time
6177000	6179000	Why would they drop it down that low
6179000	6181000	When people are still paying what's out there today
6181000	6183000	Why would I pay twelve dollars for that
6183000	6185000	When I can, isn't it like twelve
6185000	6187000	Or fourteen dollars for fourteen
6187000	6189000	I don't know what the subscription fee is
6189000	6191000	I honestly can't remember either
6191000	6193000	It's something around that but like why would I pay
6193000	6195000	Twelve when I can pay
6195000	6197000	You can also do like the multi month thing
6197000	6199000	And all that other stuff so
6199000	6201000	Yeah
6201000	6203000	I don't know
6203000	6205000	Alright well it is time ladies and gentlemen
6205000	6207000	Get ready because the
6207000	6209000	VOG Jam
6209000	6211000	Kicks off right now
6211000	6213000	With a segment that we
6213000	6215000	Call Listless
6215000	6217000	And I will explain it to you guys here momentarily
6217000	6219000	But we have to get an old buddy of ours here
6219000	6221000	On the line to play Listless with us
6221000	6223000	Tonight so I'm going to hope that he is standing
6223000	6225000	By ready to
6225000	6227000	Share the themes and ideas with us
6227000	6229000	Hello Bobby are you there
6229000	6231000	I'm here what's up
6231000	6233000	Hey I should have said Atlanta
6233000	6235000	Are you there? Did you always say Sacramento
6235000	6237000	Or are you guys there?
6237000	6239000	How are you doing my friend?
6239000	6241000	I'm doing good
6241000	6243000	Are you excited about the game jam?
6243000	6245000	I'm very excited
6245000	6247000	Me too, what is exciting you about this in particular?
6247000	6249000	That I actually will have a reason to open up Unity again
6249000	6251000	Have you opened up Unity
6251000	6253000	Since Flappy Vog?
6253000	6255000	Nope
6255000	6257000	And why not?
6257000	6259000	Time
6259000	6261000	And inspiration
6261000	6263000	You're going to have to make time for the
6263000	6265000	And Bobby Blackwolf and do we know if any
6265000	6267000	Other shows on the network have joined in on this?
6267000	6269000	I don't know
6269000	6271000	But is the video game jam
6271000	6273000	But the nice thing is about those words video game
6273000	6275000	You got V, O, and G in the word
6275000	6277000	Haha wink wink nudge nudge right?
6277000	6279000	We created something dammit
6279000	6281000	That's right we want everybody to create something
6281000	6283000	Alright so let's go over the rules
6283000	6285000	Here's the way it's going to work
6285000	6287000	Let me stop the Listless music
6287000	6289000	Because we're not ready to get quite into Listless yet
6289000	6291000	But let's go over the rules of the competition
6291000	6293000	Well it's not really a competition
6293000	6295000	Everybody joins in, it's a participation event
6295000	6297000	But here's the way it works
6297000	6299000	It is open for your submissions
6299000	6301000	Around this central theme
6301000	6303000	And you can make a game in Unity
6303000	6305000	You can make a game in RPG maker
6305000	6307000	You can make a level in LittleBigPlanet
6307000	6309000	You can do a pen and paper game
6309000	6311000	If you want to scan it as a PDF
6311000	6313000	Whatever works
6313000	6315000	We want you to create something dammit
6315000	6317000	And the only question we're going to ask
6317000	6319000	Is did you try
6319000	6321000	Did you try
6321000	6323000	And that's a very subjective question
6323000	6325000	And Jamie will be the ultimate judge
6325000	6327000	Of the can you try or did you try department
6327000	6329000	Because we don't want somebody just sending in
6329000	6331000	Like a piece of paper that says
6331000	6333000	You know frame one frame two
6333000	6335000	You know what I mean
6335000	6337000	You gotta try a little bit with this
6337000	6339000	But we realize everybody has different skill sets
6339000	6341000	So we want you guys to try
6341000	6343000	And the theme should tie into
6343000	6345000	Whatever it is that you put together
6345000	6347000	Lightly or heavily
6347000	6349000	It's up to you
6349000	6351000	You're going to submit your completed
6351000	6353000	Game jams to the following
6353000	6355000	Address jam
6355000	6357000	As in grape or jelly
6357000	6359000	Jam at vognetwork.com
6359000	6361000	You can send those emails jam
6361000	6363000	At vognetwork.com
6363000	6365000	And with a link to your finished product
6365000	6367000	Now Bobby vognetwork.com
6367000	6369000	Can actually host
6369000	6371000	Some of the finished products right Bobby?
6371000	6373000	Right so what I'm offering
6373000	6375000	Is because I've already got kind of a
6375000	6377000	Thing in our backend system that we run
6377000	6379000	That I created for VOG
6379000	6381000	Is so if your game
6381000	6383000	Can be run in a browser
6383000	6385000	Which is either Unity Web Player
6385000	6387000	Which uses its own plugin
6387000	6389000	Or if it's Flash
6389000	6391000	Or if it's HTML5
6391000	6393000	Something that can be run in a browser
6393000	6395000	And you don't have space for it yourself
6395000	6397000	I'm willing to host it
6397000	6399000	On vognetwork.com for you
6399000	6401000	It'll actually appear in our drop down
6401000	6403000	Because we have that arcade menu item
6403000	6405000	In our top drop down it'll actually appear in there
6405000	6407000	People can go in there and play it
6407000	6409000	And essentially what I'll do
6409000	6411000	Is I've created a forum
6411000	6413000	A sub-forum on our very
6413000	6415000	Not used forums
6415000	6417000	At vognetwork.com
6417000	6419000	Right up near the top about the video game jam
6419000	6421000	And I'll put technical specifications in there
6421000	6423000	As to what you need to send
6423000	6425000	We're also willing to host your file
6425000	6427000	For you
6427000	6429000	So that way you don't have to worry about
6429000	6431000	Too much about like a Mega account
6431000	6433000	Or a Dropbox account
6433000	6435000	We'll host the file on our servers as well
6435000	6437000	If you just want to distribute the zip file
6437000	6439000	And have people install it that way
6439000	6441000	My only
6441000	6443000	Rule on this
6443000	6445000	And this is not censorship
6445000	6447000	This is because I don't want to have an awkward
6447000	6449000	Conversation with our web host
6449000	6451000	That hosts VOG
6451000	6453000	No supreme gore and no supreme
6453000	6455000	Sex and nudity
6455000	6457000	You could still do that
6457000	6459000	We're just not gonna host it
6459000	6461000	If you really want to make a porn game
6461000	6463000	Go for it and I will totally play your porn game
6463000	6465000	However you just have to host it on your own server
6465000	6467000	So I just want to make that clear
6467000	6469000	We gotta keep all the super porn
6469000	6471000	And the super gore off of our own server
6471000	6473000	But if that's what you want to submit
6473000	6475000	You know what, more power to you
6475000	6477000	Just create something dammit
6477000	6479000	Alright
6479000	6481000	This is gonna be so much fun I can't wait
6481000	6483000	So there is a forum and people can actually collaborate on that forum
6483000	6485000	Like I know Dark Tetsuya in our secret forum
6485000	6487000	He actually put together
6487000	6489000	A brilliant list of all these possible ways you could make a game

6501000	6503000	We just said we're not

6511000	6513000	That's right you gotta have your hook up
6513000	6515000	Somewhere else
6515000	6517000	Preem sex and nudity
6517000	6519000	What if we leave off the sour cream and diced tomatoes

6547000	6549000	And when I say evaluate just mean

6551000	6553000	We're gonna give it a fair review and a mention here
6553000	6555000	On the show but we will be a lot
6555000	6557000	Nicer if you're worried that we're gonna
6557000	6559000	Make fun of your game or talk negative about your game
6559000	6561000	No that's not what we're here about
6561000	6563000	We are here to promote and encourage people
6563000	6565000	To create so we promise we will
6565000	6567000	Only say positive things about your game
6567000	6569000	And keep the whole thing positive
6569000	6571000	We wanna encourage people to create things
6572000	6574000	And we'll live stream some of that
6574000	6576000	And some of the prizes
6576000	6578000	For participating you're gonna get some

6594000	6596000	There is not gonna be any judging as far as first
6596000	6598000	Second or third place because we just wanna say
6598000	6600000	Create something dammit but we may still
6600000	6602000	Give out some special acknowledgements
6602000	6604000	As need be
6604000	6606000	So I think I covered everything right Bobby?
6606000	6608000	Yeah basically
6608000	6610000	That's pretty much it
6610000	6612000	I would say what like 5 PM Pacific
6612000	6614000	Like when our show starts
6614000	6616000	Sunday night that's when submissions should be closed
6616000	6618000	Yeah 5 Pacific 8 Eastern so we can read them
6618000	6620000	All out on Bobby's show
6620000	6622000	Just like their chatters
6622000	6624000	And you can be in teams that's perfectly
6624000	6626000	Fine you can even collaborate on the forums
6626000	6628000	And stuff YYR brought up a good point
6628000	6630000	Maybe you know people should do status updates each week
6630000	6632000	Just so we can kinda keep tabs on it
6632000	6634000	Absolutely Because I could be mean
6634000	6636000	And just submit flappy vog
6636000	6638000	If it fits the theme
6638000	6640000	If it fits the theme
6640000	6642000	And the theme I might suggest in a moment here is anything
6642000	6644000	But flappy vog
6644000	6646000	And preferably no copyrighted
6646000	6648000	Works Oh yeah yeah try to stay away
6648000	6650000	From the copyrighted stuff
6650000	6652000	We ban them from the theme submissions
6652000	6654000	Now a lot of people asking about
6654000	6656000	What qualifies as supreme gore
6656000	6658000	Or sex and
6658000	6660000	Tiger class says if the game has colorful language
6660000	6662000	Is that allowed? Yes because our shows
6662000	6664000	Have colorful language that's fine
6664000	6666000	And as far as supreme gore and sex
6666000	6668000	If your game is called like
6668000	6670000	Decapitation corpse fucker
6670000	6672000	Then you know it's probably not
6672000	6674000	Gonna be okay for the game jam
6674000	6676000	To be hosted on our site
6676000	6678000	We did have decap attack on
6678000	6680000	I know I know look just use
6680000	6682000	We're talking about hosting you can make whatever you want
6682000	6684000	If it's like that it can't be hosted
6684000	6686000	On the site and I will be the
6686000	6688000	Supreme dictator on what gets hosted
6688000	6690000	Or not I will be like steam
6690000	6692000	And if I say that I'm not
6692000	6694000	Gonna host it then I'm not gonna host it
6694000	6696000	And but you can still put it somewhere else
6696000	6698000	But again I want to really
6698000	6700000	Encourage you guys to think outside
6700000	6702000	Those don't get hung up on the
6702000	6704000	Sex and gore good god people
6704000	6706000	There's so much more out there
6706000	6708000	It's just Raginator and if you yeah if you want
6708000	6710000	To do sex and gore go for it just
6710000	6712000	On your own server that's all just
6712000	6714000	Get your own dropbox account or whatever so there it is
6714000	6716000	YYR in chat says
6716000	6718000	Decapitation corpse fucker theme noted
6718000	6720000	Alright
6720000	6722000	Well let's talk about how list list works
6722000	6724000	Cause it's been it's been quite some time
6724000	6726000	Since we played list list here on the show
6726000	6728000	So I know not everybody may have heard this so this is the way it's gonna work
6728000	6730000	You guys listening live
6730000	6732000	Get to vote on this as this unfolds
6732000	6734000	So here's how it's gonna work
6734000	6736000	We have compiled all of our answers
6736000	6738000	As well as some of the answers we've seen you guys post
6738000	6740000	Into a list of three
6740000	6742000	Items a piece
6742000	6744000	So each of us will put an item up on the list
6744000	6746000	That's gonna leave us with a list of twelve
6746000	6748000	Then comes the very hard part we go around
6748000	6750000	The room and we each remove one
6750000	6752000	Item from the list hey it's tough
6752000	6754000	But it's a scientific process it has to be done
6754000	6756000	No host can have their list
6756000	6758000	Decimated so if
6758000	6760000	If somebody gets
6760000	6762000	Two answers eliminated from their list the third
6762000	6764000	Answer gets immunity
6764000	6766000	So through that process we'll be left with a list of
6766000	6768000	Eight that you guys will vote on
6768000	6772000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
6772000	6774000	So right now you're gonna see that pop up on the board
6774000	6776000	If you happen to be listening to the show
6776000	6778000	You're gonna see that pop up on the screen
6778000	6780000	What should the video game jam theme be
6780000	6782000	And you can watch the list creation
6782000	6784000	As it unfolds
6784000	6786000	We are gonna let our guest go first tonight
6786000	6788000	With his first answer
6788000	6790000	Bobby what is your number three
6790000	6792000	Position even though it doesn't really matter for this
6792000	6794000	But we still say three two one what is your number three
6794000	6796000	Answer for what should the video game jam
6796000	6798000	Theme be
6798000	6800000	Okay well first thing I wanna say is that you have to be
6800000	6802000	Logged into vognetwork.com to see
6802000	6804000	The list list pop up
6804000	6806000	Oh yes very important thank you
6806000	6808000	So if you're not logged in if you're just anonymous
6808000	6810000	And haven't created an account you're not gonna see it come up
6810000	6812000	Thank you
6812000	6814000	My number three answer
6814000	6816000	Obviously because of who I am
6816000	6818000	Drums or drumming
6822000	6824000	I see so a little bit of percussion freaks there
6824000	6826000	Drums or drumming
6826000	6828000	Just because you have a personal
6828000	6830000	You have a personal interest
6830000	6832000	In this right
6832000	6834000	Alright but just keep in mind guys
6834000	6836000	Tycho drum masters already been done
6836000	6838000	Alright drums or drumming
6838000	6840000	Let's put that on the list
6840000	6842000	Alright up next tonight
6842000	6844000	Loki, Loki what is your
6844000	6846000	Number three answer
6846000	6848000	Not entirely original
6848000	6850000	But I used a random generator
6850000	6852000	So for some of these
6852000	6854000	But some of them are pretty good
6854000	6856000	So the first one I had was
6856000	6858000	Buggy game
6858000	6860000	To win you have to work around the bugs
6860000	6862000	Or die trying
6862000	6864000	That was one of my alternates
6864000	6866000	A buggy game
6866000	6868000	Interesting
6868000	6870000	Can I think of like
6870000	6872000	What was that game
6872000	6874000	Rom check fail
6874000	6876000	Or something like that
6876000	6878000	No but I think especially in light
6878000	6880000	Of the year we've had and what I just complained
6880000	6882000	About at the beginning of the show with Tetris
6882000	6884000	And everything I think it's kind of funny
6884000	6886000	That now the intention would be to make
6886000	6888000	A buggy game I like that that's cute
6888000	6890000	Alright a buggy game let's add it to the list
6890000	6892000	Alright I'm up next with my
6892000	6894000	Number three answer
6894000	6896000	My number three answer tonight
6896000	6898000	You know gosh I've been kind of going back and forth
6898000	6900000	A little bit with the ideas
6900000	6902000	And originally
6902000	6904000	I was going to put one called
6904000	6906000	Revive the arcade on the list
6906000	6908000	But the more I was thinking about it
6908000	6910000	I was kind of like ah I don't know if that
6910000	6912000	I think that might be too specific
6912000	6914000	I'm not sure if everybody would get that so I'm going to
6914000	6916000	And chatters this way
6916000	6918000	You guys can't say you didn't have your say of this
6918000	6920000	I really like the idea
6920000	6922000	Of three colors so I'm going to go ahead and add that
6922000	6924000	To the list because I think that's going to encourage
6924000	6926000	Some retro stuff but not necessarily
6926000	6928000	Because there's a lot you could do with three colors
6928000	6930000	Concept so I like that idea so much
6930000	6932000	I'm going to put it on my list in the number three spot
6932000	6934000	Alright DarkSakura ladies
6934000	6936000	Last what is your
6936000	6938000	Number three answer
6938000	6940000	Typography
6940000	6942000	Typography okay
6942000	6944000	The font fan in you
6944000	6946000	Wants typography so
6946000	6948000	Mavis Beacon teaches typography
6950000	6952000	I don't want it to be like
6952000	6954000	A word game
6954000	6956000	I just want typography
6956000	6958000	To be a theme
6958000	6960000	A theme in the game
6960000	6962000	Alright I like that let's add it on the list
6962000	6964000	Alright there it is the number three answer so far
6964000	6966000	A buggy game three colors and typography
6966000	6968000	Alright let's add four more
6968000	6970000	To the list as we get the number two answers

6974000	6976000	Know when to quit
6978000	6980000	Know when to quit
6980000	6982000	Interesting again another very
6982000	6984000	Kind of vague answer because
6984000	6986000	I don't know why but my mind instantly
6986000	6988000	Went to well I don't know if I should even say this
6988000	6990000	Because I don't want to steer the game so you know what
6990000	6992000	I'm not even going to say what my mind instantly went to
6992000	6994000	I think it's the same place everybody else's would go
6994000	6996000	That's the beauty of it
6996000	6998000	That is the beauty of it you guys
6998000	7000000	See my other answers are very like silly
7000000	7002000	But you guys have these like really in
7002000	7004000	Depth thought provoking things where's the dick and
7004000	7006000	Fart jokes tonight Rage Nator is going to stop listening

7047000	7049000	Next up my answer my number two

7055000	7057000	And the game I would like to see the
7057000	7059000	VOG faithful create

7067000	7069000	Jamie joins the circus
7069000	7071000	What?
7071000	7073000	No
7073000	7075000	But circuses are fun
7075000	7077000	It could be a freak show
7077000	7079000	I'm afraid of clowns
7079000	7081000	Oh that's a good tidbit to know
7081000	7083000	So maybe Jamie joins the circus
7083000	7085000	To eliminate the clowns who knows
7085000	7087000	They just need to die
7087000	7089000	Alright there it is Jamie joins the circus

7129000	7131000	The last one to put on the list Bobby Blackwolf
7131000	7133000	I'm torn between two
7133000	7135000	Cause I wrote down a bunch
7135000	7137000	But I'm gonna go ahead and say
7137000	7139000	Programmer Art
7139000	7141000	Programmer Art
7143000	7145000	That's almost like MS Paint
7145000	7147000	But it's a little bit better than MS Paint
7147000	7149000	Almost
7149000	7151000	But is it?
7151000	7153000	It's just different I guess
7153000	7155000	Alright
7155000	7157000	Programmer Art
7157000	7159000	Alright the number one answer from Loki
7159000	7161000	What is it
7161000	7163000	See I had two thoughts on this
7163000	7165000	And one thought though is if I did that
7165000	7167000	That that might win
7167000	7169000	And I don't want that to win actually
7169000	7171000	But I just would like to
7171000	7173000	I'll keep that as an honorable mention I guess
7173000	7175000	But um I'll just stick with also one of the ones
7175000	7177000	That came up on the random generator
7177000	7179000	Unwanted Powers
7181000	7183000	Unwanted Powers
7183000	7185000	Would that be about the Sony Network TV show coming soon?
7185000	7187000	It could be
7187000	7189000	It could be alright
7189000	7191000	We're gonna add that to the list
7191000	7193000	Unwanted Powers there it is
7193000	7195000	Alright my number one answer
7195000	7197000	You know what you guys enjoyed the Jamie Joins the Circus
7197000	7199000	Answer so much
7199000	7201000	I thought we would do another one
7201000	7203000	Involving some VoG personalities
7203000	7205000	And so my number one answer tonight
7205000	7207000	Bobby and the Banhammer
7207000	7209000	Is my number one answer
7211000	7213000	What no reaction from Bobby?
7213000	7215000	That's Flappy VoG right?
7215000	7217000	It could be
7217000	7219000	No submitting Flappy VoG though
7219000	7221000	Alright there it is on the list
7221000	7223000	Bobby and the Banhammer
7223000	7225000	Alright here we go
7225000	7227000	Dark Sacra
7227000	7229000	Last chance for people to have their items on the list
7229000	7231000	Dark Sacra what is your number one answer?
7231000	7233000	Ink
7233000	7235000	Ink
7235000	7237000	Alright you've got a very designed mindset tonight
7237000	7239000	Ink is your final answer
7239000	7241000	I do because I like to challenge people to think outside of
7241000	7243000	I want to
7243000	7245000	Ink
7245000	7247000	Specifically black ink
7247000	7249000	Excuse me
7249000	7251000	So do you want to know my
7251000	7253000	Answer that I've
7253000	7255000	Forgone
7255000	7257000	What was that?
7257000	7259000	Oh my god
7259000	7261000	How did we not get President Cat on the list?
7261000	7263000	Because it would win
7263000	7265000	I don't want it to win
7265000	7267000	You don't want it to be that easy
7267000	7269000	Bonus points for throwing in President Cat
7269000	7271000	Bonus points for any
7271000	7273000	You know what though? You could do
7273000	7275000	President Cat for any of these other things
7275000	7277000	Yeah I was going to say even though this isn't graded
7277000	7279000	Bonus points to
7279000	7281000	Any OLR, Bobby or
7281000	7283000	VoG references that you work into these games
7283000	7285000	I mean like think of something vague
7285000	7287000	Like three colors of typography
7287000	7289000	You could totally do like a President Cat game out of that
7289000	7291000	Alright
7291000	7293000	You want to know some of my honorable mentions that I threw out?
7293000	7295000	So I also
7295000	7297000	And I actually used the same random theme generator
7297000	7299000	Just because I just clicked it like a thousand times
7299000	7301000	And picked out my favorites
7301000	7303000	Losing to win
7303000	7305000	Delayed reaction
7305000	7307000	Please enter your name
7307000	7309000	And recurring dream
7309000	7311000	And then actually the buggy game
7311000	7313000	Was the other one
7313000	7315000	Oh funny
7315000	7317000	Alright so here it is and be thinking about
7317000	7319000	What is going to be eliminated because it's going to
7319000	7321000	Happen it's got to happen it's part of the process
7321000	7323000	Y'all the elimination round here is the list as it stands
7323000	7325000	Right now
7325000	7327000	Drums or drumming? Know when to quit
7327000	7329000	Program or art?
7329000	7331000	A buggy game
7331000	7333000	Strong, unwanted powers
7333000	7335000	Three colors
7335000	7337000	Jamie joins the circus
7337000	7339000	Bobby and the ban hammer
7339000	7341000	Typography, MS Paint or Corel Draw
7341000	7343000	And black ink
7343000	7345000	Alright
7345000	7347000	Here it is the part none of us want to do
7347000	7349000	But we have to it's science people
7349000	7351000	It's science
7351000	7353000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
7353000	7355000	Bobby Black Wolf
7355000	7357000	You know when I'm looking at these
7357000	7359000	I'm trying to get something that's
7359000	7361000	Not so straight
7361000	7363000	Like a game jam a good game jam theme shouldn't
7363000	7365000	Be something that's so straight forward
7365000	7367000	Or so linear
7367000	7369000	You know like where it really constrains
7369000	7371000	People so I am going to eliminate Jamie
7371000	7373000	Going to the circus
7373000	7375000	Thank you but now I have to think of another one
7375000	7377000	Oh come on you could have done like
7377000	7379000	Just a regular circus theme
7379000	7381000	Or something and just put Jamie as a character
7381000	7383000	In it that would have been easy
7383000	7385000	Easy come on they did
7385000	7387000	Circus on the Atari 2600 boo
7387000	7389000	Alright whatever
7389000	7391000	It is stricken from the list
7391000	7393000	And you're a jerk alright
7393000	7395000	Loki you're next
7395000	7397000	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
7397000	7399000	Only because I'm not creative enough right now
7399000	7401000	To understand how I'd even incorporate
7401000	7403000	This in there I'm sorry Jamie
7403000	7405000	I'm gonna have to take off typography
7405000	7407000	Oh typography
7407000	7409000	And there's some concepts are beyond people
7409000	7411000	Hey I'm fine with that
7411000	7413000	You know I gotta admit
7413000	7415000	I kinda wanted to do like a text adventure
7415000	7417000	Typography is a tricky one Jamie
7417000	7419000	It's a tricky one
7419000	7421000	I will tell you though I did have an idea
7421000	7423000	Of making a game
7423000	7425000	Where the landscape is made out of text
7425000	7427000	Okay
7427000	7429000	Actual words
7429000	7431000	Well you could do it in three colors
7431000	7433000	Or one of these other ones we'll see
7433000	7435000	That's okay I'm probably gonna stick with my first idea
7435000	7437000	Alright cool
7437000	7439000	For now though we've got to eliminate
7439000	7441000	A couple more from the list oh shit it's my turn
7441000	7443000	And I have to ask myself which of these
7443000	7445000	Is not worthy of the list
7445000	7447000	Um I am going to
7447000	7449000	Eliminate I'm gonna take a
7449000	7451000	I'm gonna do a revenge strike on Bobby
7451000	7453000	And I'm gonna take off one of his answers
7453000	7455000	Cause again this is one of those ones
7455000	7457000	Like most of these I instantly had an idea
7457000	7459000	In my mind but I couldn't think
7459000	7461000	Of one for programmer art
7461000	7463000	I'm sorry I have to eliminate that from the list Bobby
7463000	7465000	I'm okay with that
7465000	7467000	But we're gonna call that a revenge vote
7467000	7469000	Alright what do we have left
7469000	7471000	What do we have left Dark Soccer wants to know what's left
7471000	7473000	Loki has a fully intact list
7473000	7475000	But Loki's list is a buggy game
7475000	7477000	Everything you know is wrong and unwanted powers
7477000	7479000	And we also have drums or drumming
7479000	7481000	No when to quit
7481000	7483000	Three colors, Bobby and the band hammer
7483000	7485000	MS Paint or Corel Draw
7485000	7487000	And black ink
7487000	7489000	I actually
7489000	7491000	Am gonna go with everything you know is wrong
7491000	7493000	Just because that Weird Al song is stuck in my head
7493000	7495000	And I would make
7495000	7497000	I would make a Weird Al game
7497000	7499000	And I would be so distracted so
7499000	7501000	Alright well this
7501000	7503000	You know what
7503000	7505000	The list worked out alright
7505000	7507000	This is the nice politically correct
7507000	7509000	Positivity list because each
7509000	7511000	Person had one answer removed
7511000	7513000	That's the way we like to see it happen
7513000	7515000	So there it is
7515000	7517000	It is now up to you guys
7517000	7519000	How many people can say they've had their answer removed because of Weird Al?
7519000	7521000	Same
7521000	7523000	Well for me about that is that there's actually a game
7523000	7525000	That's done by some local Georgia developers
7525000	7527000	Who once it comes out I'm gonna have them on my show
7527000	7529000	It's called Default Dan
7529000	7531000	And the entire premise of the game
7531000	7533000	Is that it looks like Mario except
7533000	7535000	The enemies are good and the coins
7535000	7537000	Kill you
7537000	7539000	It's basically it's everything you know is wrong
7539000	7541000	It's basically that and that's all I would be able to think of
7541000	7543000	If I was working on that theme
7543000	7545000	Alright so fair enough fair enough
7545000	7547000	And to be fair also with the programmer art
7547000	7549000	I kind of thought it was really similar to the MS Paint answer
7549000	7551000	And it hit some points out in chat too
7551000	7553000	That makes me think about another idea that I did have to suggest
7553000	7555000	What's that? Power down
7555000	7557000	If you want to see a perfect example of programmer art
7557000	7559000	Check out this week's Cooking with Unity
7559000	7561000	This on Monday
7561000	7563000	They made a snowman
7563000	7565000	Out of primitives in Unity
7565000	7567000	That is programmer art right there
7567000	7569000	Alright well it is in your hands now folks
7569000	7571000	It is answerable
7571000	7573000	You may submit your answers now

7575000	7577000	You can vote for your number 1 is your first click
7577000	7579000	And your number 2 is your second click answer
7579000	7581000	Your votes are weighted

7583000	7585000	So vote now at live.vognetwork.com
7585000	7587000	And a little later in the show we're going to tabulate it up
7587000	7589000	And reveal the big theme
7589000	7591000	For the first VoG game jam
7591000	7593000	I'm excited I think
7593000	7595000	I think some people's heads are turning already about some of these
7595000	7597000	In fact I think some people are going to be pissed if one of these doesn't win
7597000	7599000	I'm just
7599000	7601000	I'm excited I can't wait
7601000	7603000	But again if the theme you like doesn't win
7603000	7605000	I still think you get bonus points
7605000	7607000	For incorporating two or more of these
7607000	7609000	Into your jam or any other long running joke
7609000	7611000	So get creative people
7611000	7613000	Get creative
7613000	7615000	Alright Bobby before I let you go anything else you want to add to this?
7615000	7617000	No good luck
7617000	7619000	And I look forward to playing everybody's game
7619000	7621000	Alright me too I look forward to it
7621000	7623000	Bobby I wish you were here to eat latkes with us
7623000	7625000	I wish I was there too
7625000	7627000	I'll throw one at you

7639000	7641000	Please vote or die
7641000	7643000	Meanwhile we've got some more segments to get back to
7643000	7645000	Including the mail bag
7645000	7647000	So Dark Sakura is going to dive into the mail bag
7649000	7651000	She's going to find some emails that she believes are worthy of reading
7651000	7653000	So do my favorite Eddie Izzard quote
7653000	7655000	It's a little sticky
7655000	7657000	Alright
7657000	7659000	We have a email
7659000	7661000	A email one singular email
7661000	7663000	One
7663000	7665000	Alright
7665000	7667000	Or as I learned recently
7667000	7669000	The way to say it in Hebrew is echad
7669000	7671000	Alright
7671000	7673000	Fair enough
7673000	7675000	Hi OLR I wanted to give kudos to the nice
7675000	7677000	Bunch of guest talks you've had in recent shows
7677000	7679000	They were very fun and informative
7679000	7681000	If I may I would like to suggest
7681000	7683000	Someone to interview on the show
7683000	7685000	YouTube personality
7685000	7687000	Ryan Letourneau
7687000	7689000	Aka Northern Lion
7689000	7691000	He's Canadian that's all you need to know
7691000	7693000	Sign him on and an email
7693000	7695000	Anyway Ryan is best known for his long running
7695000	7697000	Play series of The Binding of Isaac
7697000	7699000	Though he has played through some other
7699000	7701000	Notably difficult games such as Europa
7701000	7703000	Universalis 4
7703000	7705000	Spelunky FTL
7705000	7707000	And XCOM Enemy Unknown
7707000	7709000	On top of that he hosts
7709000	7711000	Live streams with friends a few times a week
7711000	7713000	And also offers quick impressions on games
7713000	7715000	That have just released or are still in the works
7715000	7717000	Typically more with indies than AAA games
7717000	7719000	I think it would be interesting to know
7719000	7721000	What it's like for Ryan to play video games
7721000	7723000	To entertain others for a living
7723000	7725000	When did it seem
7725000	7727000	Viable to attempt this
7727000	7729000	And how risky was it to try
7729000	7731000	What sort of difficulties has he faced nowadays
7731000	7733000	Why don't you just interview him dude
7733000	7735000	Interview him for us
7735000	7737000	And send us the recording
7737000	7739000	Has he faced any criticism
7739000	7741000	Over his livelihood were there any unwelcome surprises
7741000	7743000	Or cool perks to have come up since he began
7743000	7745000	What would he recommend to others
7745000	7747000	Who want to start their own channel
7747000	7749000	Yeah I bet he'd answer these questions if he emailed him
7749000	7751000	But in all seriousness
7751000	7753000	I appreciate the referral
7753000	7755000	At first I was like well there's a lot of people that do let's play videos
7755000	7757000	What makes
7757000	7759000	Kind of what I didn't get from this
7759000	7761000	Email was what makes this guy
7761000	7763000	Unique
7763000	7765000	Why do you want this particular individual on the show
7765000	7767000	Because I don't know the guy
7767000	7769000	He sounds like you really like him
7769000	7771000	I'm just curious like what it is
7771000	7773000	That really makes this guy unique
7773000	7775000	But then I did hear in the email
7775000	7777000	It appears he makes a living off doing this
7777000	7779000	So that is unique not everybody can do that
7780000	7782000	So this guy's doing something right
7782000	7784000	Well there's more to the email
7784000	7786000	These are just some things I'm curious about
7786000	7788000	And I'm sure OLR can come up with
7788000	7790000	Other interesting questions given the opportunity
7790000	7792000	Even if Ryan doesn't get on the show
7792000	7794000	I want to give my thanks for having my suggestion
7794000	7796000	Read on air
7796000	7798000	Or can I just bribe you all three
7798000	7800000	You like bribes involving tacos right
7800000	7802000	That'll work but latkes are kind of winning me over tonight
7802000	7804000	From the nasty canasta
7804000	7806000	We need to bust into that pie
7806000	7808000	We need to have a new segment just called pie
7808000	7810000	We do need to bust into that pie
7810000	7812000	Let's make it happen
7812000	7814000	We are done with late emails
7814000	7816000	It's going to be a celebratory pie
7816000	7818000	For when we have our
7818000	7820000	VOG game jam theme determined
7820000	7822000	Which by the way now is the time where I say
7822000	7824000	Last call for listless votes
7824000	7826000	Get your butt logged into the site
7826000	7828000	And vote
7828000	7830000	Last call for those votes
7830000	7832000	Alright
7832000	7834000	Let's get to the FUs of the week
7834000	7836000	It's after the mailbag segment
7836000	7838000	You have to give your FU
7854000	7856000	DarkSakura your FUs of the week
7856000	7858000	Um
7858000	7860000	FU to the lingering bits of the plague
7860000	7862000	That I had last week
7862000	7864000	That make my lungs hurt
7864000	7866000	Getting out of my wonderful codeine syrup
7866000	7868000	And um
7868000	7870000	FU to not having a
7870000	7872000	Tron pinball table
7872000	7874000	Those are pretty rad
7874000	7876000	I played one a couple days ago
7876000	7878000	Nice
7878000	7880000	I saw on Facebook
7880000	7882000	I saw them just for you Rob
7882000	7884000	I was wondering where the hell you were that had a table
7884000	7886000	It was a private party right
7886000	7888000	Why wasn't I invited
7888000	7890000	It's a private party
7890000	7892000	I'm awesome
7892000	7894000	And then we went to the pinball party
7894000	7896000	I know like 20 people that work at little cat
7896000	7898000	Why wasn't I invited
7898000	7900000	I should have been somebody's date
7900000	7902000	Next year you'll be my plus 2
7902000	7904000	Awesome
7904000	7906000	Loki your FU of the week
7906000	7908000	Um
7908000	7910000	Just to go back to what I was saying before
7910000	7912000	FU to telltale games for
7912000	7914000	I'm sorry not telltale
7914000	7916000	Travelers tales
7916000	7918000	Fuck them
7918000	7920000	For their really shitty flight controls
7920000	7922000	And lego marvel super heroes
7922000	7924000	I swear to god
7924000	7926000	That game would have been awesome
7926000	7928000	But that right there kind of really pisses
7928000	7930000	Me off
7930000	7932000	Thankfully the races
7932000	7934000	Because it's a game meant for kids
7934000	7936000	Are really fucking easy
7936000	7938000	Uh the driving races
7938000	7940000	But uh yeah fuck those flight controls
7940000	7942000	They're fucking terrible
7942000	7944000	Alright my FU of the week
7944000	7946000	First one goes to the fact that I wasn't invited to the low cap party
7946000	7948000	No
7948000	7950000	The second FU of the week is the fact that
7950000	7952000	Of um
7952000	7954000	Of all the trainers in our company
7954000	7956000	All of them
7956000	7958000	I'm the only one that has to work next week
7958000	7960000	And I have a class
7960000	7962000	Monday Tuesday
7962000	7964000	No not Wednesday
7964000	7966000	Monday Tuesday next week
7966000	7968000	I have to teach and then I have to teach the next week too
7968000	7970000	Every day that isn't technically a holiday
7970000	7972000	With the new year involved
7972000	7974000	But you know what at least I like my job
7974000	7976000	But still it always sucks when you have to work
7976000	7978000	So that's awesome
7978000	7980000	Dar soccer is complaining that she has to work on Christmas
7980000	7982000	But you're Jewish
7982000	7984000	Alright
7984000	7986000	Alright anyway they can't hear you
7986000	7988000	You're not on mic
7988000	7990000	She's too busy slicing up this amazing pie
7990000	7992000	That I can't wait to dig into
7992000	7994000	So let's do a couple more stories
7994000	7996000	Then we're going to reveal the listless winner
7996000	7998000	And then we're going to get into your calls
7998000	8000000	So let's do it
8000000	8002000	Uh Loki
8002000	8004000	So Humble Bundle everybody is pretty much familiar with that website
8004000	8006000	The process behind it
8006000	8008000	You buy a game for whatever price you want
8008000	8010000	And part of that money goes to charities
8010000	8012000	And part of it goes to devs
8012000	8014000	And Humble Tip and all that fun stuff
8014000	8016000	Well they've raised a lot of money since launching that site
8016000	8018000	Back in May 2010
8018000	8020000	Over 50 million dollars
8020000	8022000	For charity since that first sale
8022000	8024000	And they've even
8024000	8026000	Raised was it 100 million dollars
8026000	8028000	Towards developers
8028000	8030000	So that's pretty awesome
8030000	8032000	And um
8032000	8034000	They're saying the very first Humble Bundle
8034000	8036000	Raised $400,000 for charity
8036000	8038000	$200,000 each for
8038000	8040000	EFF and Child's Play
8040000	8042000	And um
8042000	8044000	Just
8044000	8046000	That's just amazing
8046000	8048000	All this money going to these awesome charities
8048000	8050000	And um
8050000	8052000	Hell even
8052000	8054000	They're not the only site out there now
8054000	8056000	Now they have all these other bundles that go to
8056000	8058000	Different charities
8058000	8060000	I'm kind of curious to see how much money
8060000	8062000	You know sites are kind of injecting
8062000	8064000	To these great causes
8064000	8066000	So uh awesome
8066000	8068000	Although I gotta say though
8068000	8070000	I'm starting to run out of gains
8070000	8072000	To purchase on their site because
8072000	8074000	A lot of them seem to be repeating
8074000	8076000	And I have a lot of leftover Steam keys
8076000	8078000	I don't need anymore copies of Fez
8078000	8080000	Please no more copies of Fez
8080000	8082000	Alright
8082000	8084000	And one more story I have for you guys
8084000	8086000	And this is
8086000	8088000	This is tough to report on
8088000	8090000	But in the same way it shows the
8090000	8092000	Good side of the gaming community
8092000	8094000	And the last official news story
8094000	8096000	I wanted to have because you know it's
8096000	8098000	Been kind of a rough year in some ways in the gaming
8098000	8100000	World and there's been a lot of
8100000	8102000	Very heated
8102000	8104000	Intense and sometimes
8104000	8106000	Downright personal debate that's been going
8106000	8108000	On out there so I like
8108000	8110000	It when gamers can band together for something
8110000	8112000	That's good
8112000	8114000	And um
8114000	8116000	Unfortunately the situation is awful
8116000	8118000	The situation is not so good
8118000	8120000	And uh it has to do with Final Fantasy
8120000	8122000	14 but I just want to say
8122000	8124000	Because I know you're all going to go fanboy
8124000	8126000	But hold on I'd be reporting on this even if it wasn't
8126000	8128000	Final Fantasy 14 this is just kind of the first
8128000	8130000	Big case that we've seen in Final Fantasy
8130000	8132000	14 and this has to do with a
8132000	8134000	Reddit post that was posted on the Final Fantasy
8134000	8136000	Subreddit last night where
8136000	8138000	A free company leader
8138000	8140000	Put a new permanent rank on a friend
8140000	8142000	That they were informed was going to be
8142000	8144000	Passing away literally within
8144000	8146000	Hours and there was a little
8146000	8148000	Screenshot that was posted over to Imgur
8148000	8150000	That noted that
8150000	8152000	Codex Valda
8152000	8154000	And I hope I said that name right Codex Valda
8154000	8156000	Would be the immortal siren in this
8156000	8158000	Particular free company
8158000	8160000	And that alone
8160000	8162000	Is pretty cool but what really happened next
8162000	8164000	Was really amazing and
8164000	8166000	You know the player
8166000	8168000	Behind the character
8168000	8170000	Only 29 years old
8170000	8172000	And passed away the other night
8172000	8174000	Codex unfortunately he did pass away due to
8174000	8176000	Complications from renal failure which is another
8176000	8178000	Word for kidney failure
8178000	8180000	And it was one of those things where they knew
8180000	8182000	He needed a new kidney and it was
8182000	8184000	Kind of a surprise that this happened
8184000	8186000	I mean because
8186000	8188000	Yeah they had like a donor lined up
8188000	8190000	You know this was just one of those
8190000	8192000	And I think they even said one in a
8192000	8194000	Million situations where unfortunately
8194000	8196000	It was that one in a million
8196000	8198000	So Codex did unfortunately
8198000	8200000	Pass away but the side of this
8200000	8202000	Is good I mean that part's obviously not good
8202000	8204000	And very tragic but the side of this
8204000	8206000	That's really great is that
8206000	8208000	This really just created this
8208000	8210000	Spontaneous outpouring of
8210000	8212000	Support in the game and it started with
8212000	8214000	One or two people just kneeling
8214000	8216000	With their characters in front of the house
8216000	8218000	And staying logged in and kneeling
8218000	8220000	And then that slowly grew on the Gilgamesh
8220000	8222000	Server too I think they said it was up to 80 people
8222000	8224000	At one point and more and then it was spilling
8224000	8226000	Onto other servers in the same
8226000	8228000	Housing district people kneeling and being respectful
8228000	8230000	And I saw some people
8230000	8232000	Took out their fairies as scholars
8232000	8234000	And actually spelled out the guy's name
8234000	8236000	Codex with their fairies as a bit
8236000	8238000	Of a tribute and I just thought
8238000	8240000	You know I was like this is
8240000	8242000	The type of stuff why
8242000	8244000	I love games and why
8244000	8246000	I love MMOs was that the community
8246000	8248000	You know put all their shit aside
8248000	8250000	About you know so and so doesn't heal
8250000	8252000	Fast enough in a dungeon or whatever put all
8252000	8254000	That stuff aside to take a moment out
8254000	8256000	To recognize one of
8256000	8258000	Their own community that was gone way too
8258000	8260000	Soon and I just you know and this this story
8260000	8262000	Has been gaining a lot of steam on like you know
8262000	8264000	Kotaku did a story on it and so it's
8264000	8266000	Spreading to other places as well and I just
8266000	8268000	Thought this is a great example
8268000	8270000	Of the community recognizing
8270000	8272000	One of their own and I do hope the final fantasy
8272000	8274000	14 developers I know they're busy with the
8274000	8276000	Japanese fan fest right now I hope the
8276000	8278000	14 developers kind of notice this and maybe
8278000	8280000	Will consider doing an NPC
8280000	8282000	Tribute and I realize you can't
8282000	8284000	Do a tribute for each and every person
8284000	8286000	That played final fantasy 14
8286000	8288000	That happens to pass away
8288000	8290000	Just like they can't do that in wow or whatever
8290000	8292000	But for particularly invested people
8292000	8294000	And for particularly people
8294000	8296000	That seems very tied into the community
8296000	8298000	Where the community sort of you know
8298000	8300000	Spontaneously comes together for something
8300000	8302000	Like this I really hope that the 14 developers
8302000	8304000	Do some type of official
8304000	8306000	Recognition of support for codex
8306000	8308000	And you know
8308000	8310000	I'm so sorry for codex's friends
8310000	8312000	And families that this happened but
8312000	8314000	Just know that there are literally
8314000	8316000	Hundreds and thousands
8316000	8318000	And thousands now of
8318000	8320000	People who are remembering this
8320000	8322000	Particular player because you know
8322000	8324000	What we all love this game as
8324000	8326000	Well anyway
8326000	8328000	Let's see fifth dream in chat says there was a
8328000	8330000	Get together tonight on mcgarthomer I put off some
8330000	8332000	Fireworks I'm very sad I missed it
8332000	8334000	I had to do this show though but I'm glad
8334000	8336000	I could at least mention it on the show
8336000	8338000	Act F says the gaming community
8338000	8340000	Can be amazing when it tries to
8340000	8342000	And dungeon buster says indeed
8342000	8344000	And I think that is a fantastic note
8344000	8346000	To end on but I do want to point
8346000	8348000	Out as joan under matt also says the guy's real

8416000	8418000	Maybe I do
8418000	8420000	This all is automated
8420000	8422000	Behind the scenes
8422000	8424000	No I don't want you to resend data that you already
8425000	8427000	Hold on I'm going to try this one more time
8427000	8429000	I think I remember something about you have to be on the page
8429000	8431000	For a minute before it pops in
8434000	8436000	I might need to
8436000	8438000	Actually make it live
8438000	8440000	Set it on fire
8440000	8442000	Uh oh
8442000	8444000	Did you break it? No I didn't break it
8444000	8446000	Hold on I'm going to try making it live again
8446000	8448000	Just not answer but we'll see if that fixes it
8448000	8450000	It's been so long since I've done this
8450000	8452000	That I forget how to make it show me the
8452000	8454000	I just I know what the winner was
8454000	8456000	New theme everything's broken
8456000	8458000	Hey a buggy game wins
8458000	8462000	I do know which one was on top
8462000	8465000	But I was hoping to name the other two as well
8465000	8467000	Bobby says I broke it
8467000	8470000	Re-check answerable I think
8470000	8472000	Alright we're going to make this answerable again
8472000	8474000	Hold on
8474000	8476000	Let's see what happens
8476000	8478000	This is going to be so funny you guys
8478000	8480000	There it is fine
8480000	8482000	It's going to be so funny
8482000	8484000	Number three answer
8484000	8486000	The number three theme
8486000	8488000	Just missed it, missed it by that much
8488000	8490000	MS Paint or Corel Draw
8490000	8492000	Very close
8492000	8494000	Number two answer
8494000	8496000	Bobby and the Ban Hammer
8496000	8498000	Missed it by that much
8498000	8500000	And the number one
8500000	8502000	The winner this
8502000	8504000	Year or maybe we'll do this every six months
8504000	8506000	Who knows
8506000	8508000	This first
8508000	8510000	VOG game jam's theme will be
8510000	8512000	And how appropriate
8512000	8514000	A buggy game
8514000	8516000	Is the winner
8516000	8518000	A buggy game is going to be the theme
8518000	8520000	There it is
8520000	8522000	A buggy game
8522000	8524000	The theme for the first ever
8524000	8526000	VOG game jam
8526000	8528000	How appropriate when I broke
8528000	8530000	The whole fucking website trying to see the answer
8530000	8532000	So there it is
8532000	8534000	Alright
8534000	8536000	Thank you everybody for voting and participating
8536000	8538000	Wait to see what you guys
8538000	8540000	Come up with and again
8540000	8542000	Just especially after the rant
8542000	8544000	I went on earlier this evening
8544000	8546000	And everything else that's been going on in the gaming industry
8546000	8548000	I think this is a perfect fit, I really do
8548000	8550000	A buggy game
8550000	8552000	Yeah, new earth defense force game
8552000	8554000	Oh is that, that's what you
8554000	8556000	Really wanted
8556000	8558000	That was your way of getting copyright in there without it
8558000	8560000	Alright
8560000	8562000	Nice
8562000	8564000	You can't copyright killing chain insects
8564000	8566000	Alright
8566000	8568000	I would never do that, maybe
8568000	8570000	Alright, anyhow
8570000	8572000	Let's see, and some folks talking
8572000	8574000	About what they were going to do for Bobby and the
8574000	8576000	Banhammer, Act F says
8576000	8578000	A card game similar to Cards Against Humanity
8578000	8580000	But trying to get a card
8580000	8582000	Or comment to get you banned
8582000	8584000	Oh man, we should
8584000	8586000	I should have let people submit for the top
8586000	8588000	Three, that would have been awesome to see, but we'll see
8588000	8590000	Alright, a buggy game
8590000	8592000	There it is
8592000	8594000	Chat says, all the bugs
8594000	8596000	And Hitstun says, I hope you guys like
8596000	8598000	Exploitable game mechanics
8598000	8600000	Yeah, that's going to be hard programming that in
8600000	8602000	But, we'll see
8602000	8604000	I don't know, when I hear
8604000	8606000	A buggy game, I think of
8606000	8608000	Like, actual bugs
8608000	8610000	Like, why can't a buggy game be like
8610000	8612000	Why can't it be Frog Fractions?
8612000	8614000	Is this Frog Fractions 2?
8618000	8620000	This was all a ruse for Frog Fractions 2
8620000	8622000	Oops
8622000	8624000	Alright, I'm kidding, I'm kidding
8624000	8626000	So there we go
8626000	8628000	VXJ6V says, number 2 can be done in the spring
8628000	8630000	Well, you know what? It depends on
8630000	8632000	How the participation level is
8632000	8634000	This time, so again, when you're finished
8634000	8636000	With your theme of
8636000	8638000	A buggy game
8638000	8640000	You're going to submit that to Jam
8640000	8642000	At OrangeLoungeRadio.com
8642000	8644000	The deadline is January 11th
8644000	8646000	Not that I'm going to stop you from
8646000	8648000	Submitting after that date
8648000	8650000	And I don't think Bobby would be opposed to
8650000	8652000	Putting things on the site that come in after the date
8652000	8654000	However, if you want to earn one of the participation
8654000	8656000	Prizes, if you want to earn one of the loot
8656000	8658000	And you want to earn that official recognition
8658000	8660000	You've got to be done by January
8660000	8662000	11th. Get to work
8662000	8664000	A buggy game
8664000	8666000	Alright, once again, the Skype line is open
8666000	8668000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype
8668000	8670000	OrangeLoungeRadio
8670000	8672000	Last minute stories, Loki?
8672000	8674000	Oh, I haven't even been looking
8674000	8676000	You're too excited about the buggy game
8676000	8678000	I've seen some good examples
8678000	8680000	Of some really funny buggy ideas
8680000	8682000	Like another game jam didn't do this
8682000	8684000	Did they?
8684000	8686000	I don't think so, but no
8686000	8688000	I still like to think, even if another game jam
8688000	8690000	Did it, we would still be the first
8690000	8692000	That says, you can create
8692000	8694000	Anything, you're not limited to
8694000	8696000	Unity, you can do anything
8696000	8698000	You want. Yeah, usually game jams
8698000	8700000	Will be like, you program it
8700000	8702000	You can use Unity, you can use whatever
8702000	8704000	But it has to be a program
8704000	8706000	You can't just make a card game
8706000	8708000	Or a board game, or whatever
8708000	8710000	No, I've seen some good examples
8710000	8712000	Of just, usually in the
8712000	8714000	Unity subreddit
8714000	8716000	Where they'll be showing
8716000	8718000	There's this one guy who actually does
8718000	8720000	A lot of development on there
8720000	8722000	He posts updates and stuff
8722000	8724000	Of things he's working on
8724000	8726000	And the last couple of ones that he put up there
8726000	8728000	Is some bugs that he had in the game
8728000	8730000	That he coded something slightly wrong
8730000	8732000	And it was a hilarious result
8732000	8734000	Kind of gives me ideas
8734000	8736000	Alright, well our phone lines
8736000	8738000	Are not really lighting up
8738000	8740000	So, here's me stretching
8740000	8742000	Trying to fill time
8742000	8744000	Let me go to the Twitter
8744000	8746000	I'm trying to eat this pie, you guys are making me
8746000	8748000	Fill time, I'm not able to eat this pie
8748000	8750000	This upsets me
8750000	8752000	Anyway, I'm going to go to Twitter
8752000	8754000	Yeah, tweet the thing
8754000	8756000	Let's see, Eric RPG
8756000	8758000	Sent a tweet with a link
8758000	8760000	Let me pull up this link and see what this is all about
8760000	8762000	Again, if you want to call us on Skype
8762000	8764000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word
8764000	8766000	Or our telephone number
8766000	8768000	1-877-GAME-OLR
8768000	8770000	Let's see
8770000	8772000	We got sent a story by Eric RPG
8772000	8774000	To a story on
8774000	8776000	Siliconera, which says
8776000	8778000	Queen Victoria blasts through Martian mines
8778000	8780000	In Rock Boshers DX
8780000	8782000	On PS4 and PS Vita
8782000	8784000	So this is a game
8784000	8786000	That has, I guess, cross-buy
8786000	8788000	And cross-save support
8788000	8790000	A 10-stick puzzle shooter set on Mars
8790000	8792000	Starring Queen Victoria
8792000	8794000	That is pretty fucking random
8794000	8796000	But I like that, I like games that are really random
8796000	8798000	It stylizes
8798000	8800000	If you were playing it on a ZX Spectrum
8800000	8802000	I like stylistic games
8802000	8804000	That's really cool
8804000	8806000	Alright, now our phones are lighting up, it was just a little delayed
8806000	8808000	Let's get to it
8808000	8810000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8810000	8812000	Hey guys, it's Jason
8812000	8814000	Hey Jason, wow, are you at the office?
8814000	8816000	I was going to say, that's a huge background back there
8816000	8818000	Oh my gosh, I didn't realize you were back in San Francisco
8818000	8820000	When are you coming to visit?
8820000	8822000	That's a good question
8822000	8824000	I've actually been super busy
8824000	8826000	Obviously, I haven't been talking about it with you at all
8826000	8828000	I understand, I understand
8828000	8830000	Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8830000	8832000	There was a topic that you guys were talking about earlier
8832000	8834000	And Go figured that as soon as I
8834000	8836000	Clicked, I hit
8836000	8838000	A hit call, the particular topic
8838000	8840000	Completely slipped my mind
8840000	8842000	The actual game
8842000	8844000	Oh, Tetris
8844000	8846000	Tetris, Tetris on the PS4
8846000	8848000	Like, I've been in these
8848000	8850000	Kind of conversations before, and I always
8850000	8852000	Am completely motivated to chime in
8852000	8854000	Because, like, I just
8854000	8856000	I'm not a
8856000	8858000	Full time developer, I never have been
8858000	8860000	And so, it's like, I don't
8860000	8862000	Always have the way of really explaining these things
8862000	8864000	But, being
8864000	8866000	Who I am, being the person
8866000	8868000	Knowing what I know
8868000	8870000	And being in these kinds of situations, like, I have to
8870000	8872000	Defend developers
8872000	8874000	Because
8874000	8876000	Delaying the game to get it right
8876000	8878000	Like, development
8878000	8880000	Ah
8880000	8882000	You never know what you need
8882000	8884000	Until you don't have it
8884000	8886000	You never know what you need until you've lost it
8886000	8888000	There's an old thing in IT
8888000	8890000	Where if everything works great, you don't even know
8890000	8892000	You have assisted men, it's when things go wrong
8892000	8894000	But you're, you know, breathing down their neck
8894000	8896000	Because things have to get taken care of
8896000	8898000	All of those kinds of things
8898000	8900000	Extend to development as well
8900000	8902000	Like, what was
8902000	8904000	This is maybe a bad example for Tetris
8904000	8906000	But what would have happened
8906000	8908000	What happens when any game is delayed
8908000	8910000	People don't defend developers
8910000	8912000	They jump down the throats of
8912000	8914000	Especially in the case of Tetris
8914000	8916000	This game isn't difficult
8916000	8918000	No
8918000	8920000	The design and theory and everything behind Tetris isn't difficult
8920000	8922000	But that doesn't mean that
8922000	8924000	Implementations
8924000	8926000	First game of its kind on its generation
8926000	8928000	New tools
8928000	8930000	New libraries, new engines
8930000	8932000	Yes, Tetris is a simple shaped game
8932000	8934000	But there is so much more detail
8934000	8936000	That goes into it
8936000	8938000	Which is literally what the act of development is
8938000	8940000	And it just
8940000	8942000	I just don't like deriding developers
8942000	8944000	I know I've done it myself
8944000	8946000	I just don't like deriding developers
8946000	8948000	Period
8948000	8950000	I understand that to a point, Jason
8950000	8952000	And I think sometimes when we have issues with games
8952000	8954000	A lot of times it's not even necessarily
8954000	8956000	The people working on the front lines
8956000	8958000	Who are the quote unquote problem
8958000	8960000	And I think in a case where
8960000	8962000	A game gets released buggy
8962000	8964000	Specifically like Assassin's Creed
8964000	8966000	And that whole debacle
8966000	8968000	I really think that is just pressure
8968000	8970000	Where the developers needed more time
8970000	8972000	To make it happen
8972000	8974000	And they were denied from up above
8974000	8976000	Absolutely
8976000	8978000	That is a really significantly good example
8978000	8980000	Because that was just
8980000	8982000	Blatant and absurd
8982000	8984000	The issue is, Jason
8984000	8986000	It's the same company
8986000	8988000	And now it's Tetris
8988000	8990000	And so that's showing me a pattern
8990000	8992000	And that's kind of worrisome
8992000	8994000	And I do understand that when games get delayed
8994000	8996000	Everybody gets really pissed off
8996000	8998000	But at the same time, you know, in Miyamoto
8998000	9000000	Or somebody had said this a long time ago
9000000	9002000	If a game gets delayed, if it's good
9002000	9004000	People will never remember that it was delayed
9004000	9006000	And I think to some extent
9006000	9008000	That really is true
9008000	9010000	And I know at least we here at OLR
9010000	9012000	At least I like to think so
9012000	9014000	Whatever the delay is
9014000	9016000	But after seeing so much crap like this happen
9016000	9018000	Like when The Witcher 3 got delayed a few weeks ago
9018000	9020000	It was what, like the second delay
9020000	9022000	You know what, I don't want Witcher 3 coming out
9022000	9024000	And being broken
9024000	9026000	If they have to delay it two more months to get it right
9026000	9028000	Then cool, do it
9028000	9030000	I was gonna say exactly the same thing
9030000	9032000	That Bonds did
9032000	9034000	Half-Life 2 was delayed significantly
9034000	9036000	At least two or three times
9036000	9038000	And along the way there was also the legendary
9038000	9040000	E3 hack that leaked significant
9040000	9042000	Half-Life 2 content to everybody
9042000	9044000	And you can guarantee this is why
9044000	9046000	They don't even announce Half-Life 3
9046000	9048000	They'll announce it when it
9048000	9050000	No, seriously, they're gonna announce it when it's done
9050000	9052000	And ready to go
9052000	9054000	That's why when we joke around that Gabe needs to come out
9054000	9056000	At E3 and go
9056000	9058000	Half-Life 3 is on Steam right now and drop the mic
9058000	9060000	That's no joke
9060000	9062000	That's how it's gonna fucking go down
9062000	9064000	Absolutely
9064000	9066000	Yeah, I just, it's kind of
9066000	9068000	The way that it was being presented
9068000	9070000	The way that people have learned
9070000	9072000	To talk about these kinds of incidents
9072000	9074000	That just, they're just great on me
9074000	9076000	Because, you know, blame
9076000	9078000	Blame the developers, blame the testers
9078000	9080000	They're the go-to
9080000	9082000	Because they are the face of the game
9082000	9084000	Shy of like the CEO of the company
9084000	9086000	Or something like that
9086000	9088000	But nowhere in that discussion at the start of the show
9088000	9090000	Did anything like businessy
9090000	9092000	Get discussed
9092000	9094000	It was the fault of the developers
9094000	9096000	Period when it was being discussed
9096000	9098000	And that's the kind of stuff
9098000	9100000	That's the part of it that really disappoints me
9100000	9102000	Is that that is the go-to
9102000	9104000	Vocabulary for everybody to talk about
9104000	9106000	When there's a good chance that
9106000	9108000	A ton of developers or testers
9108000	9110000	Had brought up saying
9110000	9112000	These things are problems
9112000	9114000	But for business, political
9114000	9116000	Possibly technical people
9116000	9118000	Downplaying things
9118000	9120000	Oh, three frames gone isn't bad?
9120000	9122000	Well, that person has never heard of speed running before
9122000	9124000	And knows the technical obsession
9124000	9126000	With the level that people go to
9126000	9128000	If I gave the impression that I was solely placing
9128000	9130000	Blame on the developers for the Tetris debacle
9130000	9132000	Then I apologize
9132000	9134000	But I think what I kind of meant to say
9134000	9136000	Is that the development on this game clearly wasn't finished
9136000	9138000	Whose fault is that?
9138000	9140000	Probably management's
9140000	9142000	And more so that I
9142000	9144000	It's not even really the developers that I blame
9144000	9146000	It's a lack
9146000	9148000	Of QA
9148000	9150000	And I think that's an okay thing to say
9150000	9152000	There's a complete lack of QA
9152000	9154000	Or this would have been caught
9154000	9156000	It's not something that happens on level 5
9156000	9158000	On Tuesdays
9158000	9160000	When you're maybe connected on a shoddy Comcast connection
9160000	9162000	When this happens
9162000	9164000	No, it happens to everybody
9164000	9166000	If you just play a normal game
9166000	9168000	And that's where I'm like
9168000	9170000	The funny thing is I can actually kind of see
9170000	9172000	I can envision that some of those same arguments
9172000	9174000	Happen business-wise
9174000	9176000	It's Tetris, we know this franchise
9176000	9178000	We've done it before
9178000	9180000	Why are these problems problems?
9180000	9182000	Because the tools don't remain
9182000	9184000	The same between generations
9184000	9186000	And even years
9186000	9188000	Two games of an iteration
9188000	9190000	In the same generation things can change entirely
9190000	9192000	I actually don't get so bothered by the whole
9192000	9194000	But it's Tetris, it should be easy to do
9194000	9196000	Type of argument
9196000	9198000	It's Tetris, but it's Tetris on the PS4
9198000	9200000	And there's certain expectations
9200000	9202000	Of what PS4 games should have in them
9202000	9204000	Especially with this whole
9204000	9206000	Social era we live in
9206000	9208000	And game sharing and all this stuff
9208000	9210000	There's
9210000	9212000	Hiccups are killing me
9212000	9214000	There's certain expectations
9214000	9216000	Where I don't think it's as simple as
9216000	9218000	You just put the Game Boy version of Tetris on the PS4
9218000	9220000	I think there is a certain
9220000	9222000	Greater expectation than that
9222000	9224000	I'm actually not going to be
9224000	9226000	One of those people that says, oh it's just Tetris
9226000	9228000	But I am going to say, oh it's just a
9228000	9230000	QA department
9230000	9232000	Well that's halfway there
9232000	9234000	So I guess I can give you at least that much
9234000	9236000	Alright, fair enough. Hey, you thinking about
9236000	9238000	participating in the game jam?
9238000	9240000	I
9240000	9242000	Because it doesn't have to just be
9242000	9244000	Like a classically programmed game
9244000	9246000	That opens the door for me, like I said
9246000	9248000	I've never been a full time programmer
9248000	9250000	There were a couple of concepts that did kind of cross my eye
9250000	9252000	And my number one vote
9252000	9254000	Matched the winner, so
9254000	9256000	There are definitely ideas
9256000	9258000	But with traveling back home
9258000	9260000	And all that kind of stuff, we'll see
9260000	9262000	I certainly would like to, but we'll see
9262000	9264000	I understand, well you know the golden rule is
9264000	9268000	Even if it's not the totally fleshed out game you wanted to build in Unity
9268000	9270000	Create something, dammit
9270000	9272000	Alright, Jason, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in some more calls
9272000	9274000	But take care buddy, we miss you
9274000	9276000	You too, thank you
9276000	9280000	By the way you guys, Jason has an epic fucking beard growing on his face now
9280000	9282000	I saw that beard when it was a little bit
9282000	9284000	But getting to see that on Skype via the video, that is epic
9284000	9286000	That is an epic beard he's got there
9286000	9288000	Alright
9288000	9290000	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype
9290000	9292000	Orange Lounge Radio
9292000	9296000	I'm going to leave it open for a couple minutes to see if something can get through here
9296000	9298000	I did see at least one other caller trying to get through
9298000	9300000	So I want to give them another chance to try to get through
9300000	9302000	And we will see what happens
9302000	9304000	Oh, I do see another call coming through
9304000	9306000	Let's get to it
9306000	9308000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9308000	9310000	Let's do Zaku there
9310000	9312000	Zaku, you are really loud, get a little ways away from the mic
9312000	9314000	And tell us what's on your mind
9314000	9316000	Oh, nothing much, just celebrating
9316000	9318000	The end of my birthday
9318000	9320000	And the start of the 30s for me
9320000	9322000	Well, happy freaking birthday
9322000	9324000	My god, you're 30 years old
9324000	9326000	Yep, 30, the big 3-0
9326000	9328000	How old were you when you first started listening to this show?
9328000	9332000	Oh, I'd say about 19
9332000	9334000	Oh my god
9334000	9336000	I can't, I can't, I quit
9336000	9338000	We're done
9338000	9340000	The last OLR everybody
9340000	9342000	Have fun with that game jam
9342000	9344000	We won't be here when it's done
9344000	9346000	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding
9346000	9348000	Happy birthday, Zaku
9348000	9350000	Yep
9350000	9352000	You know what, 30s aren't as bad as everybody says it is
9352000	9354000	30s is actually kind of awesome
9354000	9356000	Everything's better
9356000	9358000	And less stupid
9358000	9360000	Everything's better
9360000	9362000	It's like Logan's run where after a certain age
9362000	9364000	The light in the palm of your hand
9364000	9366000	Blinks and you have to take that ride
9366000	9368000	Into that other magical place
9368000	9370000	Obviously
9370000	9372000	Where they kill you off at that certain point
9372000	9374000	But I digress
9374000	9376000	I guess the point is
9376000	9378000	To the young folks
9378000	9380000	I'm pretty much a dinosaur
9380000	9382000	You know, senior citizen at that point
9382000	9384000	Oh, whatever, you know what, the thing they don't realize
9384000	9386000	Is that sex is better in your 30s
9386000	9388000	TMI, I don't care
9388000	9390000	Speak for yourself
9390000	9392000	Oh wow
9392000	9394000	TMI, I don't care
9394000	9396000	I don't care
9396000	9398000	Alright, well I don't think you called in
9398000	9400000	Just to talk about your birthday
9400000	9402000	What else is on your mind, my friend?
9402000	9404000	Just catching up on the gaming
9404000	9406000	That I'm trying to do right now
9406000	9408000	Apparently
9408000	9410000	Recently
9410000	9412000	Dovetail, the folks who
9412000	9414000	You know, the folks who brought us Train Simulator
9414000	9416000	They recently released
9416000	9418000	Microsoft Flight Simulator on Steam
9418000	9420000	And apparently
9420000	9422000	As much as I, you know
9422000	9424000	The fact that I managed to jump on it a few months before
9424000	9426000	That thing was announced
9426000	9428000	It's like, whether or not
9428000	9430000	There's any life left
9430000	9432000	In that whole flight sim market
9432000	9434000	And I mean, after the
9434000	9436000	You know, the past few months
9436000	9438000	After getting hooked on it
9438000	9440000	And spending dozens of dollars on
9440000	9442000	Third party add-ons for it
9442000	9444000	Mainly like commercial airliners
9444000	9446000	I mean, is it
9446000	9448000	Is, you know, the point is
9448000	9450000	Whether or not there's still room
9450000	9452000	For something like that
9452000	9454000	Given the fact that it's almost like
9454000	9456000	Ten years removed from where
9456000	9458000	From the height of the game
9458000	9460000	Um, I think
9460000	9462000	Especially with flight sims
9462000	9464000	There's gonna kind of always be an audience
9464000	9466000	For that, you know, and they did
9466000	9468000	They just released that game on Steam
9468000	9470000	Like, just came out, but you know
9470000	9472000	If you look at Steam and the simulator
9472000	9474000	Like, okay, let me tell you
9474000	9476000	Let me tell you a little story
9476000	9478000	There's another simulator game that I see all the time
9478000	9480000	On Steam, and I'm always sitting there going
9480000	9482000	People actually play this game
9482000	9484000	And it's Farming Simulator
9484000	9486000	Is the name of the game, okay, Farming Simulator
9486000	9488000	Okay, right, and it's up there all the time
9488000	9490000	Okay, so when I'm at E3
9490000	9492000	And we're doing the whole thing where it's like
9492000	9494000	We're gonna live, you know, cover E3
9494000	9496000	Ask us questions on Twitter, da da da da da
9496000	9498000	I get a question from, like, Germany
9498000	9500000	Out of the blue, from some person
9500000	9502000	Because I posted a random picture
9502000	9504000	Of me in front of something funny
9504000	9506000	At the Farming Simulator booth, and the guy was like
9506000	9508000	You have to tell me everything about Farming Simulator
9508000	9510000	What's the game like, is it playable?
9510000	9512000	What's in the game? You gotta tell me everything about Farming Simulator
9512000	9514000	You'd be surprised, there's a lot of people that are interested in that game
9514000	9516000	Fuck, Farming Simulator, really?
9516000	9518000	It's on, like, console, Maximum Games
9518000	9520000	Is the one that's been distributing that
9520000	9522000	And I seriously talked to the guy that's the head of the company
9522000	9524000	When I was working at my old job
9524000	9526000	And he would tell me stories about
9526000	9528000	How well that game's selling
9528000	9530000	It's, like, their best-selling game
9530000	9532000	So there are people that eat that up
9532000	9534000	And look at all those other simulators that they have on Steam
9534000	9536000	There's, like, a ton of them
9536000	9538000	But, yeah, I mean, they have
9538000	9540000	DCS World, which has, like, the
9540000	9542000	Fighter jet simulator
9542000	9544000	Which is essentially, like, a chore
9544000	9546000	Not to belittle
9546000	9548000	The fact that certain flight sim
9548000	9550000	Add-ons, like, you try starting
9550000	9552000	Up a triple seven from
9552000	9554000	Dark, from cold to dark
9554000	9556000	All the way up to the point where it's taxing
9556000	9558000	I think it's, like, I need
9558000	9560000	Clip notes for that
9560000	9562000	Zaku, I think there still absolutely is an audience for Flight Simulator
9562000	9564000	I mean, you express interest in it
9564000	9566000	And you're just 30 years old
9566000	9568000	You're still young, there's still room for
9568000	9570000	Tons of Flight Simulator games
9570000	9572000	Even though maybe the audience is a little different
9572000	9574000	Is what it is
9574000	9576000	Because I remember a day when I was younger
9576000	9578000	When I was 19 years old or what have you
9578000	9580000	I remember when Flight Simulator games
9580000	9582000	Were oftentimes kind of the benchmark
9582000	9584000	For new hardware
9584000	9586000	Like, when new things would come out on PCs
9586000	9588000	It always seemed to be, like, a Flight Simulator game
9588000	9590000	Was one of the first things to come out
9590000	9592000	To really show off the graphics
9592000	9594000	And the capabilities of the systems
9594000	9596000	And I think that's changed Zaku
9596000	9598000	I think Flight Simulator games
9598000	9600000	Have turned more into people that are
9600000	9602000	Enthused about
9602000	9604000	Amateur flight or what have you
9604000	9606000	Or as the enthusiasts of the genre
9606000	9608000	Right, and the thing is
9608000	9610000	You're talking about
9610000	9612000	FSX, which is almost a decade old
9612000	9614000	That still runs on DirectX 9
9614000	9616000	Meanwhile, you have
9616000	9618000	X-Plane, the latest version
9618000	9620000	X-Plane 10, which
9620000	9622000	Apparently, it's a little slightly better
9622000	9624000	In terms of graphics, but
9624000	9626000	The only thing that's close to
9626000	9628000	You know, to actually matching
9628000	9630000	You know, a modern
9630000	9632000	The only thing close to a modern day
9632000	9634000	Flight Simulator right now is PrepR3D
9634000	9636000	And that's a professional
9636000	9638000	Version of FSX that
9638000	9640000	Lockheed Martin puts out for real pilots
9640000	9642000	But I guess
9642000	9644000	With Dovetail now at the helm
9644000	9646000	Whatever future Flight Simulator
9646000	9648000	Game they're going to make is obviously
9648000	9650000	Not going to be called Flight Simulator
9650000	9652000	But it's going to be, in essence, a spiritual
9652000	9654000	Successor of that franchise
9654000	9656000	And hopefully it will bring the graphics into
9656000	9658000	This decade of
9658000	9660000	You know, modern computing where you could
9660000	9662000	Just take advantage
9662000	9664000	Completely advantage of a modern PC
9664000	9666000	Instead of just doing everything in a single
9666000	9668000	Core, you take
9668000	9670000	You exploit multi-core
9670000	9672000	And high-end video processing
9672000	9674000	To essentially
9674000	9676000	And more importantly, 64-bit
9676000	9678000	So that you can actually
9678000	9680000	You know, you can run a game like FSX
9680000	9682000	Which is very intensive for
9682000	9684000	A ten-year-old game which is not optimized
9684000	9686000	And you could essentially run it
9686000	9688000	Like, you know, you could take advantage of new hardware
9688000	9690000	That's available today
9690000	9692000	Right
9692000	9694000	Yeah, and hopefully
9694000	9696000	As I said, it was on sale
9696000	9698000	For five bucks a couple of days ago
9698000	9700000	When it first came out
9700000	9702000	I'm kind of skeptical on getting
9702000	9704000	Re-buying it again on Steam because apparently
9704000	9706000	You can't activate your existing keys on it
9706000	9708000	You have to buy the game again
9708000	9710000	Nice
9710000	9712000	I'm not too sure, other than the fact
9712000	9714000	That you can now play online
9714000	9716000	Multiplayer again
9716000	9718000	It's a wait-and-see approach in terms of
9718000	9720000	How it will actually
9720000	9722000	Perform with the existing
9722000	9724000	Third-party add-ons that I have on it
9724000	9726000	Well, you know, I do
9726000	9728000	I do want to see the game in motion
9728000	9730000	I hope some people are livestreaming it
9730000	9732000	Because I do want to see, I haven't really looked at a
9732000	9734000	Flight simulator game in a while and I bet
9734000	9736000	I bet they're still very
9736000	9738000	Pretty to look at and so forth
9738000	9740000	Yeah, if you tweak the
9740000	9742000	I mean, with FSX right now
9742000	9744000	You could definitely tweak a lot of the files
9744000	9746000	There are many ways to make it look good on
9746000	9748000	On modern PCs for
9748000	9750000	For almost a ten-year-old game
9750000	9752000	Even like DirectX 10, which wasn't
9752000	9754000	Officially supported, it was a preview
9754000	9756000	Back then, there are plugins that allow you to fix
9756000	9758000	The DirectX 10 issues
9758000	9760000	That were rampant in FSX
9760000	9762000	And essentially looks a lot better than
9762000	9764000	Than running it on, you know,
9764000	9766000	DX9
9766000	9768000	I guess there has been folks
9768000	9770000	Streaming on Twitch for
9770000	9772000	FSX, but until I get a new
9772000	9774000	Video card that allows me to stream through
9774000	9776000	Nvidia, I'm probably gonna
9776000	9778000	Yeah, it'll be a while before I
9778000	9780000	Do any livestreaming of that
9780000	9782000	Fair enough, alright my friend, I gotta let you go
9782000	9784000	But thank you for the FYI, Flight Simulators
9784000	9786000	They're out there, check them out
9786000	9788000	Alright, take care my friend
9788000	9790000	Have a good one, you too, bye
9790000	9792000	And congrats on hitting 30
9792000	9794000	Even though you've been listening to this show since you were 19
9794000	9796000	Which means I'm
9796000	9798000	Also that old
9798000	9800000	Alright, Rob
9800000	9802000	What? Deal with it
9802000	9804000	No, actually, you know, and like
9804000	9806000	I told Zaku, actually my 30s have been
9806000	9808000	Pretty fucking awesome, and considering the fact
9808000	9810000	That I had, uh
9810000	9812000	You know, I was really, really sick when I was 29
9812000	9814000	It actually made me very thankful to turn 30
9814000	9816000	So, you know, alright
9816000	9818000	1877 game OLR, username on
9818000	9820000	Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, now the phones are
9820000	9822000	Lighting up, they were slow earlier, but now it's
9822000	9824000	They just fill right up
9824000	9826000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9826000	9828000	Uh, this is YYR
9828000	9830000	Hi Aaron, how are you?
9830000	9832000	Hey YYR, how you doing?
9832000	9834000	Well, I'm
9834000	9836000	Trying to formulate an idea
9836000	9838000	For this new game jam
9838000	9840000	Thing that we've all laid out
9840000	9842000	Tonight
9842000	9844000	So far the best idea I have
9844000	9846000	Going off Jason's
9846000	9848000	Phone call a little bit ago
9848000	9850000	Was, uh, come up with
9850000	9852000	A plan to develop
9852000	9854000	A game in five weeks
9854000	9856000	Yeah
9856000	9858000	And don't test it
9858000	9860000	And then release it
9860000	9862000	I mean, it works for Ubisoft, right?
9862000	9864000	That's right, so the game
9864000	9866000	It's gonna be meta, it's gonna be a game about
9866000	9868000	Making a game
9868000	9870000	Uh, oh, well
9870000	9872000	Well now we have another thing entirely
9872000	9874000	No, he's saying basically
9874000	9876000	To develop a game, don't test it
9876000	9878000	Okay, I thought that was his idea
9878000	9880000	Okay, in the game you're gonna make a game
9880000	9882000	Okay, nevermind, I was going too meta with it
9882000	9884000	Okay, I get it
9884000	9886000	Wow, you're really thinking about this
9886000	9888000	I am, I am, well you know what, there's a part of me
9888000	9890000	Not that I want to give away everything I'm doing
9890000	9892000	But I'm actually thinking of going with the very literal
9892000	9894000	Interpretation of the word and doing a game about
9894000	9896000	Bugs
9896000	9898000	Not giving Loki
9898000	9900000	Not giving Loki his Earth Defense Force game
9900000	9902000	But I don't see why you can't do a game about bugs
9902000	9904000	Well, I mean, I'll admit
9904000	9906000	You know, as soon as the theme was chosen
9906000	9908000	I turned to my fiance
9908000	9910000	Sitting on the couch next to me and I said
9910000	9912000	Alright, let's do something with spiders
9912000	9914000	But, uh, I don't know if I'm
9914000	9916000	Actually gonna go with spiders
9916000	9918000	I just, I would
9918000	9920000	Love to do something that was both figurative
9920000	9922000	And literal
9922000	9924000	I also don't want to go beyond my
9924000	9926000	Means, you know, one
9926000	9928000	Person, three weeks
9928000	9930000	And a keyboard
9930000	9932000	I mean, basically though
9932000	9934000	Three weeks does sound like a lot
9934000	9936000	I'll warn anybody, I mean
9936000	9938000	First of all, I want to super encourage
9938000	9940000	Everyone, as many people as
9940000	9942000	Possible to get in on this
9942000	9944000	But I also want to warn people that
9944000	9946000	Game development really is
9946000	9948000	A time sink, it will take
9948000	9950000	Longer than you would expect to do
9950000	9952000	Well, pretty much anything
9952000	9954000	So don't wait for
9954000	9956000	Two and a half weeks and then say
9956000	9958000	Alright, yeah, let's throw something to get now
9958000	9960000	The way I figure it's always three times longer
9960000	9962000	So just plan something for a week
9962000	9964000	And it'll take you three weeks
9964000	9966000	Also, one big reason
9966000	9968000	We're starting it now is that we know a lot of people
9968000	9970000	Have time off for the holidays
9970000	9972000	Now granted, a lot of you spend time with family
9972000	9974000	But there's also a lot of you that have a lot of free time right now
9974000	9976000	So we really want to start it before the holidays
9976000	9978000	And then run it really all the way through
9978000	9980000	The holiday period, so
9980000	9982000	Yeah, this is probably the best time of year to do it
9982000	9984000	I think, I mean, any time's a great time
9984000	9986000	To develop a game, but this is probably
9986000	9988000	As good as we could do as far as
9988000	9990000	Time for everyone
9990000	9992000	Absolutely, as many of you guys
9992000	9994000	Listening as possible, whether you're
9994000	9996000	Listening live on the podcast, anything
9996000	9998000	Go ahead and make something, because
9998000	10000000	You're going to enjoy it
10000000	10002000	I think you will
10002000	10004000	And some folks in chat saying
10004000	10006000	Let's see, they're talking about the meaning of the word bugs
10006000	10008000	And Darth Tetsuya says, so you can do a game about
10008000	10010000	Bugs, that I think I can work with
10010000	10012000	However you interpret the rules
10012000	10014000	You can do anything you want
10014000	10016000	Around that theme of buggy game
10016000	10018000	How do you interpret that?
10018000	10020000	Because, I don't know, maybe you want to do a game about
10020000	10022000	Amish people and have it be about a horse and buggy
10022000	10024000	You could do it!
10024000	10026000	You know, SSJ100 Matt did bring
10026000	10028000	That up earlier in chat
10028000	10030000	Amish Racer 2000
10030000	10032000	Why not? Come on
10032000	10034000	You could do a game with horses and buggies
10034000	10036000	Look, I just gave somebody a concept right there
10036000	10038000	Alright, now I've got to think of something new
10038000	10040000	Perfect
10040000	10042000	Alright, well YYRA, I'm so excited
10042000	10044000	I think we're done here
10044000	10046000	I'm so excited to see what you come up with
10046000	10048000	Alright
10048000	10050000	I'm sorry, you've broken up a little bit, what happened?
10050000	10052000	I just wanted to say I am so excited to see what you come up with
10052000	10054000	Oh, yeah, well I'm excited too
10054000	10056000	Because I'll tell you, at this point my slate is blank
10056000	10058000	I really have no idea
10058000	10060000	I'm with you
10060000	10062000	You have just as much of an idea as I do
10062000	10064000	Alright
10064000	10066000	Well, I've got to think too
10066000	10068000	I will come up with something
10068000	10070000	Me too, I think I know how I'm going to do it
10070000	10072000	I just need to know what story I'm going to tell, so we'll see
10072000	10074000	Alright
10074000	10076000	I've got some serious thought into this over the next day or two
10076000	10078000	Alright, good luck my friend, take care
10078000	10080000	I'm very excited, and I'm looking forward to
10080000	10082000	what everyone else puts out as well
10082000	10084000	So, yeah, pick up your keyboards
10084000	10086000	or game controllers or whatever you're using
10086000	10088000	and get cracking, this is going to be great
10088000	10090000	Do it, create something dammit
10090000	10092000	Yup
10092000	10094000	Alright, take care my friend
10094000	10096000	Enjoy your weekend, your holidays
10096000	10098000	and everything else
10098000	10100000	You too
10100000	10102000	Take care, bye
10102000	10104000	I know I'm going to enjoy the rest of those latkes
10104000	10106000	that are sitting over there waiting for me to eat
10106000	10108000	I'm so excited
10108000	10110000	Alright, oh man, you filled me so, like even Alan
10110000	10112000	messaged me earlier, do I even need to make dinner tonight

10114000	10116000	and I'm like, I filled up on crap
10116000	10118000	but it was really good crap
10118000	10120000	I'm taking some of the cookies with me
10120000	10122000	unless Becky has some when I get to our house

10150000	10152000	Yeah, I posted even there's some
10152000	10154000	tools that I found on one of these
10154000	10156000	game jam tip sites, so I
10156000	10158000	just copied and pasted that
10158000	10160000	Awesome, awesome, I'm really gonna
10160000	10162000	try to spend time to do this
10162000	10164000	I'm the type that will procrastinate
10164000	10166000	Come up with an idea quick
10166000	10168000	because that could take a while
10168000	10170000	It could, it could, alright well
10170000	10172000	that is about gonna do it, Loki checking in

10188000	10190000	we're not IGN
10190000	10192000	we can't put a big video out there that everybody sees
10192000	10194000	of our buggy Tetris experience, we can only
10194000	10196000	tell you about it, so please

10208000	10210000	as soon as I
10210000	10212000	as I'm in my outro, a buggy podcast
10212000	10214000	No, sorry
10214000	10216000	It's kinda cool, there's a British company
10216000	10218000	apparently Liberty Games that made
10218000	10220000	a pinball table that's an
10220000	10222000	internet meme pinball table
10222000	10224000	it has a bunch of internet memes in there
10224000	10226000	Oh, that's awesome, it looks pretty sweet
10226000	10228000	like Grumpy Cat, it's a real, yeah

10234000	10236000	Ah, that could've been the theme, internet memes
10236000	10238000	Ah, yeah, that would've been
10238000	10240000	Oh well, next time, the sequel
10240000	10242000	the sequel, you guys have to make this
