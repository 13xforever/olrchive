Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week Sony brought us the re-release of Final Fantasy 7 in glorious HD quality, upscaled, and ported. Uh, thanks?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But that's not all, we'll have more from the award show, plenty more news, your comments and calls right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this December the 7th of 2014 with the 578th episode of our show.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food. With my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I haven't had any food today.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh my gosh, how are you going to go for three hours without food?

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're going to get food before we leave.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No. Dan, go get me food.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is not going to be pretty. Uh oh, wait a minute. If you're talking to Dan, that must mean Dan the man is here in the house today joining us.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I gotta go get food.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dan will be leaving, actually. So Dan, any final thoughts for us?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How are you doing, Dan?

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good, yeah? Awesome.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can hear a feedback click every time I turn the mic on.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, you don't have to turn the mic on and off. Don't worry about it. I do it over here. If I have to mute you, I just push a little button over here and it shuts Dan down.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can't silence me!

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Which will be all the time.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, you're so loud the internets can hear me. On Jamie's mic.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Alright. Also, I have to introduce, of course, every week here with us, Techmaster Loki.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hello.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How you doing, Loki?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm okay.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah?

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Good morning.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Afternoon.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, yeah, if you guys aren't aware, we're taping at a special time today, or broadcasting, whatever you want to say.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We are live at noon on Sundays. We've been saying for the past couple weeks what we were going to do. We're live at noon today.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This will rebroadcast at the normal time at VOG Network, six o'clock. So if you're listening at six o'clock, wondering why the chat room seems emptier than usual, it's because, oops, you forgot we were going to do the earlier time today.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But we're rebroadcasting. And then, of course, our podcast listeners all get the same thing that they're used to, the show delivered on the podcast feed for you guys.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But we do still have the chat over at live.vognetwork.com and folks chatting away.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Some folks in chat talking about tea. Dungeon Buster saying, time for tea and crumpets. I guess because of the earlier hour. It's noon tea here.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Or, in Loki's case, noon sandwiches. Because the sandwich place you'd love to go to was actually open today. Oh, not tea, Red Bull. I see.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Of course, this is Loki we're talking about here.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who's calling me on my phone?

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, who'd be calling you? Don't they know you have a show?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No, they don't.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All right. That is a loud, loud ringer for sure. All right.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Anyway, the joys of doing live radio. Phones going off. People showing up. It's all good. You guys showing up in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, I don't have the chat room yet.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You don't have the chat room yet.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Because I just got this a few days ago.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, you have a new toy that you brought to the studio with you.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have a 13-inch MacBook Pro.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah?

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because I go for the superior machinery.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is that one with the pretty retina and all that stuff?

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, it's retina.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nice. I bet pornography looks beautiful on that thing.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Twat and 2000 DPI. I don't know.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Awesome. Well, how did you Christian it? What was the first thing you had to do on it?

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The first thing I had to do was set up the internet.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Really, that was about it. Well, actually, I had to do a system update, which was fine.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I had to make sure that all the stuff that I normally see going on with Yosemite wasn't happening.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I have a perfect computer. I have named her Edie.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Have you done any gaming on it? Oh, wait, gaming on a Mac.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did you not see the post I made on my Facebook?

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm just giving you crap. Calm down.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have both fractal and transistor.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, nice. Okay.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So, playing through those.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah. And there's more and more stuff, to be fair.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There's more and more stuff, especially, I think, thanks to Steam in large part.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know, kind of putting things out there on Linux and Mac.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's more and more and more stuff showing up.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A lot of the stuff on the Steam store, by the way, is available through the app store.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's where I got transistor and fractal.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Nice.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Borderlands is on there. All the Borderlands games.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Bioshock.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you beat something on Steam PC, or, sorry, not beat something.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you bought something on Steam PC, don't you automatically get it on Steam Max?

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like, if you log into your library, you'd be able to download whatever?

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I do, indeed.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, that's good.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I was going to say, but if you buy it on the Mac store, you don't get the trading cards.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
They don't have trading cards on Macs?

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No, no, not if I buy through the app store.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, got it.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, not on, you know, Mac on Steam has trading cards.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And you don't get achievements, Steam achievements, or whatever they call it over there.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's achievements.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I get smug superiority.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And that's very important.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Speaking of smug superiority, let's talk about this for our kickoff topic.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This was a really crazy, busy week, considering that usually this time of year is very, very dead

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
because all the games have already been released.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A lot of game developers are not even really working during this period because their games are out.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And so, you know, this is the time of year where they actually get their time off

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
before they're putting in their 10- and 12-hour days again to ship whatever game is coming in 2015.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Usually things are awfully quiet.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But we've had an insanely busy week in news.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Like, it's almost been like a winter E3.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And that's in large part to the Game Awards happening this week and, of course, Sony's PlayStation Experience.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Which the PlayStation Experience seemed like it was more of like a...

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They had actual presentations versus just like, oh, here's some Sony games.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, they're doing panels and things like that, too.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Like, they are really turning it into their own, like, I don't want to say their own Penny Arcade Expo,

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but in a way, it's kind of what they're doing.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I mean, it's probably a little smaller right now, but it's the first year.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But we'll talk more about the PlayStation Experience a little later.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Obviously, there's these very two distinct events going on.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I want to talk first about the Game Awards because it is the thing that happened first on Friday night.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know how many of you guys actually watched or maybe watched on the back end or whatever.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I forgot that it was on that day, so I had to go back.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And all I did was kind of skim through YouTube and went and watched all the trailers

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and then skimmed through it some more trailers and then caught up to live and that was it.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, you guys know if you listened to the show a few weeks ago, I was really skeptical about the Game Awards,

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
especially how fast they were trying to put the whole thing together.

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I was like, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of time here.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But I actually did end up watching most of it.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I watched two... It was kind of long.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was a three-hour show, and I watched the first two hours,

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and then Alan needed me for something else, so I stopped.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And I missed the best part, so I had to go back and watch it on YouTube the last hour.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I kind of did what you guys skimmed through the last hour to watch all the Zelda Wii U gameplay, which was huge.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah, I gotta say, Zelda on Wii U, which they showed at the Game Awards, that does look really hot.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It was very interesting the way they presented it, though,

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
because they filmed Miyamoto playing on a television, but they never showed a direct feed of the TV.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It was always showing what was on the TV.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And I'm not sure why they chose to do it that way.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Perhaps that was to prevent such a scrutiny eye to pick out the little things in the interface.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with that.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But yeah, they were showing it all off the little TV instead of a direct feed.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But still, however they decided to show it, it looked great.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Dan, did you get a chance to see this footage yet of the Zelda Wii U?

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I have not.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh, you gotta check it out at some point. It looks gorgeous.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You can definitely see where maybe the Skyrim, because we've heard this before,

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that they're being influenced by Skyrim a little bit,

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
and you can kind of see that even in the little bit that they showed with the gigantic world map,

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
being able to place a marker where you want to go, get on your horse,

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
and ride to the marker and kind of kill things along the way.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They're doing a lot of that in this new Zelda game, and it looks interesting.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It looks like it's going to be really rad. I'm excited.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I've been playing something very similar to that called Dragon Age.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Freeform questing in Zelda.

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Maybe. They didn't say anything about...

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
For the first time since, like, what? Zelda 1?

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, they didn't say anything specifically about how questing would work,

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
so we can only infer that. We don't know that for sure,

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
but I would think there would at least have to be side quests, you would think.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I don't know. I mean, there's still a lot to be determined.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That wasn't really what they were talking about with the reveal.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But anyway, Nintendo really did kind of dominate the game awards.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I mean, there was some Sony and even Microsoft presence as well,

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
but Nintendo took a lot of the awards. Game of the Year, though, they didn't.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They did not get Bayonetta 2, which a lot of people expected.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Dragon Age 1 Game of the Year, which I get that, having played most of those nominees.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Game of the Last Couple Weeks.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, here's the thing. A lot of people are complaining, like,

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
how could you give Dragon Age Game of the Year when it's only been out two weeks?

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But you guys are forgetting. These critics have been playing them.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All those people that were on the jury.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Whatever. The sponsor paid the most.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, I heard about that too.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I mean, really. Really. It's like, oh, it's been out for, like, 13 seconds.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's Game of the Year.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, and I...

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, admittedly, it is a pretty hot looking game.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I haven't played it, but I've watched it over Jamie's shoulder a lot,

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and I've been like, damn.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And I saw a lot of people complaining on Twitter, and I was just kind of like,

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Bayonetta 2 is a great game, don't get me wrong.

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And if it had won, I couldn't have been upset.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I feel like the people criticizing Dragon Age for winning haven't really played it.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So, whatevs.

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But I mean, I can also see an argument that Bayonetta 2 is a better game. That's fine.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But I just don't think there would be such anger if you've actually played Dragon Age

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and you kind of go, oh, this game is really, really, has a lot of depth to it

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and extremely well done storytelling.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But the 16 people who are playing Bayonetta 2 realize how great it is.

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I hope it's sold better than that. I really do.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They deserve it. They deserve a great success.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Platinum is awesome. I mean, they make great games, but...

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And you can't feel...

185
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Going single platform on Bayonetta was probably not the best call.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I have a hard time feeling bad for Nintendo when Nintendo did win Developer of the Year.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They got what? Sports Game of the Year for Mario Kart 8.

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Because that's really a sports game.

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, it's considered sports and racing.

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's the best sports slash racing game.

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay, whatever. But anyway, they did pretty well for themselves.

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They got best fighting game for Smash Brothers on Wii U as well, right?

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So, I mean, they did pretty well.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But there weren't that many fighting games out this year.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And they were nominated twice for Smash Brothers.

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They had two spots. Smash Brothers 3DS and Smash Brothers Wii U.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Come on.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I kind of think the awards themselves are sort of...

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't want to say meaningless, but I think...

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, no, no. Meaningless is probably an accurate term.

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think the community and Twitter and so forth is making it to be a much bigger deal than it really is.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I mean, again, it's a group of 20 people who voted on what they believe the best game of the year is.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And there's such diversity in the gaming world that I would not want to listen to just what one person or even one group of 20 people feel is the best game.

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It sounds kind of weird for me to ask this since I've had the exposure to your guys' program that I've had over the last 100,000 years.

205
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But do you guys do a Game of the Year, like an Orange Lounge Awards, anything like that?

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because the truth is, the things that you guys called Game of the Year would be just as meaningful as whatever they called Game of the Year.

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That is the point exactly.

208
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I think the Game of the Year that any 20 people grouped together would call Game of the Year is just as meaningful as what these guys end up picking as Game of the Year.

209
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That is exactly the point.

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Usually, the last show of the year will kind of try to do like a, what was your top three sort of thing.

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And it can kind of vary from year to year because also, we are not paid to do this full time.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Nor is most podcasters you're listening to their show unless it's tied into a major website.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We're not paid to do this anytime.

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So most of the people that are talking about their Game of the Year haven't played everything that have come out in that year.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And I always kind of put that disclaimer out there as like, this is my personal Game of the Year from what I've played.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And there's also some years where I don't get around to the games of 2013 till 2014.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, and it used to be like, think of it this way, right?

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So it used to be that there were, what, a dozen video game magazines that had some sort of relevance.

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You know, you had your EGM's, your game pros, your video games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And you had several editors and they would all do games of the year.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And you know, you could actually at that point have probably had a consensus of industry professionals who could probably put together a fairly meaningful Game of the Year.

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You know, instead each magazine would just do their own.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So now, what was it, Spike TV, was that 10 years ago they started doing their Game of the Year awards or the Spike TV Video Awards?

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But that's all just so super commercial that you know that it's just sponsorship money talking, baby.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And as much as I'm kind of saying some what could be construed as negative things about this awards ceremony, I actually thought it wasn't as bad as we all feared it was going to be.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It was fairly decent.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sure, there were a lot of things that could have been done better, but for as rushed as that whole thing had to have been, I thought it was pretty decent.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And a lot of that, Dan, is because that commercialism, a lot of that was really sucked out of it.

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You didn't really have the actors that were forced out there on stage and pretty men and pretty ladies who probably played Candy Crush Saga and that's it.

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You had a lot of people up there on the stage that were actually like game developers and game players.

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think one moment that kind of put a bow on all that was when Trey Parker won the award for best voice acting or whatever they called it.

232
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He won the award for best voice acting for all those voices he did in the South Park game, right?

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So he got up there on the stage and he said, only at the video game awards could I beat Kevin Spacey for an acting award.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And he raised the trophy and walked off the stage. Kevin Spacey wasn't even there.

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So I thought that was kind of one of the moments to sort of sum the whole thing up.

236
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So I thought from that standpoint they did really well.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But I'm going to tell you my favorite, favorite thing, the thing I loved most of all, the thing that, oh my god, I would have watched three hours of nothing but this and they need to do it again next year.

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Kudos to whoever got Ken and Roberta Williams to come out of hiding and take the stage at the video game awards to accept their award for gaming icon.

239
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That was awesome.

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And if you don't know who Ken and Roberta Williams are, you really need to go back and do some gaming history research because pretty much every amazing 80s and 90s point and click adventure game that came from Sierra On-Line Entertainment or even other companies was inspired by something that Ken and Roberta Williams did.

241
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And they left the game industry in the late 90s.

242
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I think Phantasmagoria was the last game that Roberta Williams was really intimately involved with.

243
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
She might have produced one of the later King's Quest games but Phantasmagoria was kind of the last one.

244
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And things in the industry started to shift.

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We had a phase where we were getting away from adventure games and so they kind of left the industry at that time because people weren't really playing those kinds of games anymore.

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And they have really disappeared from the public eye and they rarely make public appearances.

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I think they've been spotted once or twice in the past decade.

248
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So to see them come out on stage and the audience really... I'm so happy that the audience was cheering and screaming and we love you and all that stuff and not like, who dis?

249
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you, video game audience, for knowing it's so important who Ken and Roberta Williams were and making them feel welcome because I kind of hope it might convince them to try something else.

250
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know but if they want to retire forever, they certainly deserve it.

251
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
They've done so much for the industry.

252
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That was seriously my favorite part.

253
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I know that seems like one little thing but that gave the whole thing so much more cred, in my opinion, to see that.

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I was very, very, very happy with that.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Did they come to get bought and disassembled by EA or Activision?

256
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I believe it was Universal, then Vivendi, then Activision.

257
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So it's kind of a chain of events.

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A free level disassemble there.

259
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, exactly. And I think it was the Universal acquisition that didn't... because it's kind of what King's Quest VIII turned into.

260
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But looking at the footage from the new King's Quest game, that kind of surprised me because the new King's Quest does not appear to be a point-and-click adventure at all.

261
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It appears to be something a little more like... I don't want to say like Dragon's Lair but it's definitely more like... I get that more like cartoony 3D adventure sort of gist from it.

262
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It looks really good and to hear Roberta Williams go, I want to play this. I've seen it and I want to play it.

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That alone makes me go, all right, I'm going to listen to you because you know what you're talking about.

264
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
She's like, and there's two L's in Williams on the check.

265
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, right.

266
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
DungeonBuster says in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says,

267
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Seeing Ken and Roberta Williams on stage is my favorite moment from the award show.

268
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
ActDev says, Activision probably considering the King's Quest reimagining.

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh yeah, that was... I mean, getting them out there to unveil the trailer was certainly a huge part of it.

270
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
DungeonBuster says, They're so incredibly private after they left that all anyone has really seen from them is the occasional text blurb or short form interview.

271
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Alan Alchemy says, Their presence gave so much more legitimacy to the show over anything Spike did.

272
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I... without sounding like a fanboy, although I guess if I'm going to fanboy for anything, it's going to be Ken and Roberta Williams.

273
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's always a good idea to pander to the 40 year old audience.

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Well, that's why I said thank God the audience did know who they were and was cheering and made them feel the love.

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Because if you enjoy The Walking Dead, which was the game of the year a couple of years ago, right?

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
A lot of what you see in that game, you can thank Ken and Roberta Williams for. Let's be real.

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Every... it's like every adventure game owes its origins to either Ultima or King's Quest.

278
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Every single one of them.

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Everyone.

280
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, you know, if people don't understand who they are, I mean, it's understandable because they've stepped out of the limelight. They don't make games.

281
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The truth is game creators are fairly underappreciated.

282
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And when they do become rock stars...

283
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Especially in that age.

284
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Right. When they do become the rock stars of game creation, then they normally get a little too full of themselves and they try to make a Daikatana and it kills them.

285
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So, you know.

287
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But yeah, I mean, speaking of King's Quest or Ultima, next year if they want to get Lord British on stage, just let him talk for three hours because Lord knows the man could do it.

288
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I would be totally fine with that as well.

289
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, because, you know, you just want to hear Garriott talk about how fucking great he is.

290
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And that he's an astronaut.

291
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I went to his panel at Dragon Con and listened to him talk about his fucking mansion for like an hour and it was worth every minute of my time.

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It was worth every minute of my time.

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Garriott is like...

294
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The man's a fucking genius.

295
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm the best motherfucker that's ever lived.

296
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And yes you are. Yes you are.

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Did you ever see the documentary that he did talking about his mansion?

298
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Lord British.

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Just like showing all the secret passages and stuff?

300
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No, I did. I need to watch that.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You need to watch that. It's pretty awesome.

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah, I do. I do. No, he talked about it.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's called Lord British. I'm so great.

304
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Alright. So, anyway.

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Although. Although.

306
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Although.

307
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
He is responsible for that really shitty Facebook game that had to play.

308
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I get over it.

309
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Although.

310
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm sorry. I'm not getting over it.

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Listen. You're better than this.

312
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You don't need to have a garage sale game on Facebook.

313
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And Tabula Rasa. I understand. I understand.

314
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But the man's allowed a few stinkers in his decades long great career.

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Anyway.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He made a terrible RPG when he was a teenager when nobody else was making terrible RPGs.

317
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Give him some slack.

318
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
As much as I'd love to just talk about people I love from 80s and 90s computer game development.

319
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I do want to get back into some of the other stuff.

320
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I just want to mention one other thing that I thought was really weird about the award show.

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Okay. So, it was a video game award show, obviously.

322
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Although, there was lots of trailers.

323
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I mean, it was really three quarters trailers and new game presentation and like a quarter awards.

324
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
So, one thing that was really awkward is that, you know.

325
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Jeff Keeley would be talking to somebody like Reggie Fils-Aime and he'd be like.

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So, tell us about what Nintendo's doing. And then he'd be all.

327
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And by the way, congratulations because you won developer of the year. Here's your trophy.

328
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Like, it was very much like I purposely brought you over here to kill two birds with one stone.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And get you to pimp something and then hand you a statue.

330
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Like, that happened a lot throughout the whole awards presentation.

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That was kind of weird.

332
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But at the same time, the freaking thing was three hours long and kind of needed to be cut back.

333
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
So, they needed to cut some corners.

334
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So, I'm not sure where that happy balance is.

335
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I actually think they might have done.

336
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And this is going to sound really weird.

337
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
They might have done too many world premieres.

338
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And I think they really should have focused on the stuff that was really new.

339
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You know, things like the Tacoma trailer.

340
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I like a third trailer for No Man's Sky.

341
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And yes, I understand it's the same thing every time.

342
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't let me start it on No Man's Sky.

343
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I have had it officially with flying through fucking space.

344
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay, here's the problem with No Man's Sky that I'm seeing right here.

345
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I'm going to tell you, here's my worry about this game.

346
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I think it's going to be fucking boring.

347
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Because it looks really amazing that you can visit all these planets and stuff.

348
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And there's somewhat different things on there.

349
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I think I'm going to get so bored so fast with that game.

350
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And that's what I'm worried about.

351
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's like they haven't really shown what you do other than exploring new things.

352
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Okay, I was bitching about that on Twitter.

353
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And of course, Bobby jumped in and said,

354
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, Rob, look at this YouTube. It's all right here.

355
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And he leaked me this YouTube.

356
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And sure enough, there was a 14-minute GameSpot had done a preview or something

357
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
where they actually showed some of the gameplay and the fact that,

358
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
yes, those ships do shoot things.

359
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And you can explore the planets and all this stuff.

360
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So there is a game in there.

361
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
But these trailers we keep seeing don't really show any of that.

362
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I still want to buy it, but I just think I'm going to get bored with it really fast.

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Seriously, when I saw it again at the PlayStation experience,

364
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I was like, all right, this is now past bordering on pretentious.

365
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And I understand I'm probably pissing people off with what I'm saying

366
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
because some people are very excited for that game.

367
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And I understand it's more of an indie company and all this stuff.

368
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But I'm just like, you guys, at these big, big, big awards shows,

369
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
they have shown the same thing three times.

370
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
So I really need to see some...

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's essentially the same trailer, just different planets each time.

372
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And yeah, that's cool.

373
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Okay, here's my example.

374
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Here's my example and why I'm concerned.

375
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Because there was another game almost ten years ago at this point

376
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that was very big on this whole,

377
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
we're going to go from the smallest of smallest of micronisms

378
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
to getting bigger and bigger.

379
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And then it's going to be a civilization and you take over the world and all this stuff.

380
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

381
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I know what you're talking about.

382
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm talking about Spore. Remember?

383
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And there was a lot of good ideas in Spore as well,

384
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
but ultimately the game felt like a collection of mini-games.

385
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So if you want to know why I'm sitting here giving No Man's Sky a hard time

386
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
for doing the same thing over and over,

387
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
it's because I've played Spore and I feel like I've kind of been here before.

388
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So I just want to see a little more about how do those littler parts

389
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
make the big thing function?

390
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Because that's a very important part of the game, if that makes sense.

391
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I would love nothing more than for this game to come out and blow my fucking mind

392
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and be like, I really shouldn't have given this game such a hard time on all those trailers

393
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
because this game is fucking amazing.

394
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I would love nothing more than for that to happen.

395
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But right now, since I haven't played it, I can't really say that yet.

396
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
All I can say is, okay, I've seen the same,

397
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
it's been the same joke three times.

398
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's like an episode of this show. Come on.

399
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So there you go. That's my thoughts on No Man's Sky.

400
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

401
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
DungeonBuster says, I'm excited for it, but I understand where Sky is coming from.

402
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Raven's Dolphin says, that concert was something, just show the game.

403
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Static 68 is cool, but show off the game, it's just colorful and whatever.

404
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, No Man's Sky seems way too ambitious.

405
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I hope they deliver in the end. Yeah, me too.

406
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
EB says, oh, Spore was such a disappointment, right?

407
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
But there was so many, I mean, and it's really hard to figure out where that game went wrong

408
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
because there were so many good ideas in it.

409
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But I think at the end of the day, it felt like a bunch of little mini games.

410
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It just didn't feel cohesive.

411
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It didn't feel cohesive. Yeah, exactly.

412
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I think that was a big problem with it.

413
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Those comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

414
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Alright, so that's the Game Awards in a nutshell.

415
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Anything else you guys want to say about it?

416
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I didn't watch it.

417
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I didn't think that the Dragon Age Inquisition thing was as clever as the Mass Effect thing last year.

418
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh, with the little Conan O'Brien spots where he's saying,

419
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
so what do you do in this game? Question dragons?

420
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Some of that was a little silly.

421
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I get that Conan O'Brien does these hilarious- Even the introduction thing.

422
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah, I know.

423
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It was a little, I hate to say it, but if they could have cut something,

424
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
maybe that's something they could have cut was those little Conan O'Brien bits

425
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
because they did get a little grating.

426
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
But, Dar Sakura, do go back and watch for Ken and Roberta Williams

427
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
because I literally got verklempt watching them get on stage.

428
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I was at this thing called work.

429
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So, even though I skimmed all of it-

430
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
There's this thing called YouTube.

431
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I didn't notice that they had anybody calling gamers nerds or anything like that.

432
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Like, I think it was Joel McHale was doing last year.

433
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You know, gamers are nerd, you know, basement dwelling.

435
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
No, none of that.

436
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Thank goodness they've realized that, hey, those jokes aren't funny anymore.

437
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
And they never really were that funny to begin with.

438
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I mean, it's like, okay, yeah, you're the first person to make the reference

439
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
that gamers live in their mom's basements and play video games all day

440
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and don't get exposure to the sun.

441
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's like, oh, wow, that's the first time I've ever heard that joke.

442
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Do you remember when I came back from the very first GamerX

443
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
and I was a little critical of Pandora Boxx, who's the famous drag queen

444
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
who was on RuPaul's Drag Race because she was making those same type of jokes

445
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
at GamerX, and I was like, know your audience.

446
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Hello, you know, those jokes are really cheap and it wasn't funny at all.

447
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's kind of funny, but it's a very similar sort of thing.

448
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I just compared a drag queen to Joel McHale.

449
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm okay with that, totally okay with that.

450
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
All right, anyway.

451
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Great job, sir.

452
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games

453
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
that we have been playing this week, and then we can get into some news.

454
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

455
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Actually, for all the work I've been doing, it was pretty busy.

456
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition, and I've managed to get almost back

457
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
to where I was in about 10 hours less gameplay,

458
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
plus I'm a higher level than when I left off, so I'm doing okay.

459
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And I've been playing Fractal because I freaking love Fractal.

460
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I got a...

461
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Fractal seems to be like your Tetris of sorts.

462
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's like the old go-to puzzle game you can always rely on for a good time.

463
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It requires a lot of thought.

464
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah.

465
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
How do you play it then?

466
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich.

467
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I don't even care if this isn't our house, but make me a sandwich.

468
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Speaking of pretentious...

469
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Um...

470
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I've just been playing a few things then.

471
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Okay, I'm just giving you crap.

472
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I've played some Bejeweled.

473
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah?

474
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's...

475
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What else did I play, though?

476
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I played something else because I picked up something through one of the...

477
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Stupid sales...

478
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh, yeah, I played more Mountain.

479
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Game is so stupid.

480
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But, like, I'm gonna spin the mountain for a minute.

481
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay, I'm done.

482
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Awesome.

483
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
All right.

484
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, yeah, and Dan got me Knights.

485
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, Sonic.

486
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Was that in the Sega Humble Bundle?

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The Sega Humble Bundle.

488
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Nice. Very cool.

489
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

490
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
It was okay.

491
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, I played really only two things this week.

492
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

493
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
A lot of it because my son's actually playing it now.

494
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It's hilarious.

495
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
He actually knows how to play games now.

496
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Back from when, oh, I used to put Grand Theft Auto on and he'd sometimes hit the gas and drive straight.

497
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Now he can actually control a character using the analog stick and stuff and walk around the city and do things.

498
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
How far he has come.

499
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So I've been playing a lot of that.

500
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Just trying to unlock things.

501
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So now I figured out how to get to the part of the helicarrier where I can actually unlock the Deadpool bricks to give you, like, multipliers and stuff.

502
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And so I'm trying to get some of that done so I can unlock more characters and all that stuff.

503
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So I played a ton of that this week, which is surprising because I have Grand Theft Auto 5 that I haven't really touched much of.

504
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
That's surprising.

505
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Well, not really.

506
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Because Grand Theft Auto 5, I've played a ton of it already.

507
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And so basically I'm playing the same game again, whereas Lego Marvel Super Heroes, I've never played through it before.

508
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So I can see why I'm more interested in this right now than I am Grand Theft Auto 5.

509
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, I got really excited for a minute because I thought that that game was going to be on sale this weekend.

510
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Because they were saying something at the Game Awards.

511
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Go on Steam and all these Game of the Year things are going to be on sale.

512
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So you go on Steam and sure enough, you can get, like, the South Park game for what, like, 15 bucks?

513
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
18 for the entire thing.

514
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Right, but Grand Theft Auto, not on sale.

515
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
No.

516
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Well, it's not out yet on PC.

517
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, that's right. Well, even pre-order or whatever.

518
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
In January.

519
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I thought maybe it was PlayStation 4 then. Maybe they said something about PlayStation 4 because they were like, oh, it'll be out on Play...

520
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah, no, I saw that.

521
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And there's no sale there either.

522
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, they do have the thing for the PlayStation Experience stuff on there, but yeah, they don't have it.

523
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Sorry, I got that. Lots of sales. I got that twisted in my head.

524
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Then it was the PlayStation Experience sale and they said go online, there's a bunch of stuff on sale, and Grand Theft Auto 5, they, like, showed the logo and I was like, yes, I'll finally get it.

525
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But they are going to still, they're doing their holiday sales still, but it's still week one.

526
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's been week one for, like, a week and a half now, so I'm waiting for them to switch it up.

527
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Very, very, very, very close to buying Wolfenstein and New Order.

528
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I may do that today. I don't know. I'm that close because it's 50% off right now, but we'll see.

529
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Anyway, so yeah, I was surprised. I was kind of playing that more than anything, but once again, it's a new game to me.

530
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And surprisingly, there's a lot to do in it.

531
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I actually was reading some, they're talking about, you know, I was reading through some of the facts and stuff.

532
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
They were saying that it's very similar to Lego Batman 2, so I have to see if that's, I don't think that was on PlayStation 4, so I may have to check that out, though.

533
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
That sounds interesting.

534
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
But it's a fun game. I'm having fun with it.

535
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
The humor's good. I mean, that's kind of what I enjoy about it. It's pretty funny.

536
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And then the other game I played, very briefly, but I'm running into a problem because it is early access and it's still buggy.

537
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,000
And one of the known bugs is that the controls don't work well with my gamepad on Windows 8.1, but it's a game called I Am Bread.

538
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And it's a game from the folks that brought you Surgeon Simulator.

539
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And you know, Surgeon Simulator has a very unique control style. Well, this is just the same. A little bit different.

540
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You use the, on gamepad, you use the shoulder buttons and the triggers to move your toast.

541
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,000
So each corner of the bread, or I'm sorry, your bread, and you're trying to become toast.

542
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So you're a piece of bread trying to become toast. Simple premise, but you have to move across a room in order to get there.

543
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And so each trigger controls a corner of the bread. And so you stick, you know, one side down and you kind of tilt with your analog stick.

544
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And you stick the next side down, you kind of roll around. But you have to be edible, so you can't like roll through things that might get you dirty.

545
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And in the same time, you're also destroying the house because, you know, it's just hard to control.

546
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Gaming is so strange right now. She's been playing a game about a mountain. You've been playing a game about bread.

547
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Somebody created an OLR dream game about shit. Actual shit.

548
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Pixel shit.

549
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
This is just, this is a very interesting time in gaming, is it not?

550
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's a funny game though.

551
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
No, it sounds great. It sounds great.

552
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But that's it. I mean seriously though, think about it. The premise of this game can be some, you are a piece of bread that's trying to become toast.

553
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's the premise of the game.

554
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
What do all three of those things I have in common have?

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Bread that eventually leads to shit?

556
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
No, it's just the fact that...

557
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And you can poop on a mountain.

558
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's just the fact that all those things are like these very obscure concepts, original concepts, but that could be still very simple in execution.

559
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:36,000
But it's funny because it's so hard to control. It's just like, it's the same appeal that you have with Surgeon Simulator where, you know, of course you're fucking stuff up.

560
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You're dropping the drill in the guy's face because you can't maneuver your hand well with the keyboard and mouse.

561
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
So this is kind of the same thing.

562
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm gonna have to try to do it with keyboard and mouse I guess because I can't, they don't have a workaround yet.

563
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The problem is with the gamepads that the triggers are backwards.

564
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So instead of pulling down the triggers to have it where you kind of grab the ground, you have to let them go so they're reversed.

565
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And so it's kind of hard to train your brain to do that right.

566
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I wish they had a way just to flip the axis on it, but they don't.

567
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So there's unfortunately no workaround for it yet.

568
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But maybe a joy key type thing will fix it.

569
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
But right now they're working. It's early access, it just came out.

570
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
So I think I have a story about it later on so we'll talk about it.

571
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
But it's funny.

572
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Well it sounds like you're not the only one that's being tempted by these sales going on.

573
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

574
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Fabrice is in our chatroom saying, I bought Wolfenstein yesterday, didn't have time to play it though, but that'll be something for tomorrow.

575
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Well already there's free, I downloaded Injustice and I haven't got a chance to play that yet.

576
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yeah but a Playstation Plus perk is a little different than actually purchasing.

577
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's so many games though!

578
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Seriously, my digital library on Playstation Network is starting to get, it's not as bad as Steam because that would be a lot more money.

579
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There's not as many discounts there, but it's getting pretty big.

580
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's just like, I'm never going to play these games, but I'm downloading them just in case!

581
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Sony's trying to compete a little more with dropping games to a really, really low price to make them more appealing.

582
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
There's a lot of stuff on sale right now.

583
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I buy digital a ton on there, it's just so convenient.

584
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Instead of going to the store and buying stuff on sale, or use games, which I probably should.

585
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Alright, let me talk about my gaming week real quick and then we'll go over to Dan.

586
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I actually don't have a lot of new stuff because the only real new stuff I played, I played Ultimate NES Remix on the Nintendo 3DS which just came out on Friday.

587
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What?

588
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What?

589
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Yeah, it's 30 bucks.

590
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I gotta get it.

591
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah, I can get my DS if you want to check it out.

592
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's the only reason I've even close to wanted a Wii U is NES Remix.

593
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So now that it's on the 3DS, fuck the Wii U.

594
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And so, yeah, it's kind of a greatest hits compilation, but they finally got leaderboards on every level which is kind of a nice thing to see.

595
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I only played like 30 minutes or less of the game so I don't really feel comfortable giving the thing an entire review.

596
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But if you already own it on the Wii U, you might want to just think carefully about buying it on the 3DS as well because there's not really a lot of new stuff.

597
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Except for the fact that they have, I don't know what they call it, like Ultra Super Mario, or like Super Fast Mario Brothers or something.

598
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Which is basically an emulated version of Super Mario Brothers, but with the speed turned up to like 500%.

599
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So you're like running super fast.

600
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
So does the time go that fast too?

601
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Yes, so you have to be very fast to get through the levels.

602
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Gotta go fast, gotta go fast.

603
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And there's also like, they have the championship mode.

604
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Sorry, just because of what we're talking about here.

605
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I know we were not going to talk about it because at least I don't think we're going to talk about it.

606
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But that Mario Maker looks pretty awesome though.

607
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It does.

608
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know, I wasn't really giving it much credit before.

609
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm like, wow, that does look pretty sweet.

610
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Their last trailer that they did was really like, ooh, that's some pretty cool stuff there.

611
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's going to be like Little Big Planet for Super Mario Brothers.

612
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
This is the game a lot of people have been wanting, so I'm excited for that.

613
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:18,000
So I also played just a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, which very much struck me as, wow, EA has definitely this multiplayer model.

614
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Because this looks very similar with the whole opening the packs and stuff as Mass Effect multiplayer had, and as I'm seeing in the Dragon Age multiplayer.

615
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
But I didn't really play enough of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare to tell you much more.

616
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
But I imagine a lot of you are playing it this week, and we'll get into why later on.

617
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Otherwise, some of the same stuff I've been playing.

618
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm up to level 97 on World of Warcraft Warlords of Draenor.

619
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Alan and I have been playing more Diablo III.

620
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
We got to level 70 on his seasonal, which is nice.

621
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So Alan got his transmog gear for season one, and now I have two level 70s in seasonal.

622
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Because I have an addiction.

623
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah, all on PC.

624
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I do have a level 70 on PS4, though.

625
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But there's no seasons on PS4.

626
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And there never will be because you're not always connected on PS4, and people have already figured out how to hack the game.

627
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So they're not going to do it because they know people will cheat.

628
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Because the game is not always online.

629
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Who cares?

630
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I know, I know.

631
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So yeah, that's really it for my gaming week.

632
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
More Final Fantasy XIV, a little bit of Dragon Age, more Geometry Wars III, which I awfully still enjoy quite a bit.

633
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Was able to beat the second boss in that, and now I'm making my way through the green stages.

634
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
When I'm not playing some of the retro stages in the game, but that game is a lot of fun as well.

635
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That's my gaming week.

636
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Dan, how about you? How was your gaming week?

637
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I've done very little gaming this week, unfortunately.

638
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I did buy the Humble Bundle for Sega, and I played Sonic Generations for the first time, and I played Sonic in the All-Stars Racing.

639
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And actually what happened was I bought the Humble Bundle for Sonic All-Stars Racing, and then they re-released it with Generations.

640
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So I bought it again so I can get Sonic Generations.

641
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But it's an opportunity to give money to my favorite charity, Sega.

642
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So, there you go. Most of the other stuff I gifted to Jamie.

643
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Fair enough. That works.

644
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I probably could have given you a Sonic Racing since I already bought it.

645
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I seriously am swimming Steam codes in my Humble Bundle library that I just have duplicates of.

646
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Why don't you just pay some in chat? Be like, here guys, thanks for listening.

647
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
They may not work internationally, though. That's the only thing I'm worried about.

648
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
We are fortunate we are joined by people in time zones that usually can't tune into the show.

649
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think it should be fine. I think that they don't.

650
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
One way to find out.

651
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Yeah, let's do it.

652
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Let's see what happens.

653
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Alright, so that is it for all our gaming weeks.

654
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's get into some quick housekeeping. Don't forget to follow us on Facebook.

655
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

656
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

657
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Orange Launch Radio will be returning live at its normal time next week.

658
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

659
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Sorry for that. Some people have told me, I like the noon time better.

660
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Sorry guys, it's just that we have to kind of make a lot of rearrangements to do the show earlier.

661
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We can't move the show to noon ourselves every week.

662
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But don't forget the show is podcast and the great thing about that,

663
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
you can listen to the podcast whenever you damn well please.

664
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I know some people that don't listen to the show until Saturday.

665
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Because that's when it's convenient for their schedule.

666
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So, you know what, that's the great thing.

667
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Or some people binge listen to O-L-R too.

668
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
They're like, I gotta catch up on a month worth of O-L-R.

669
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So I'm gonna play M-M-O's and listen to O-L-R literally all day.

670
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I've had people tweet me that before and I think that's really awesome.

671
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
And I don't mind being in the background while you're grinding wolf pelts

672
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and whatever you need to get in your M-M-O.

673
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's okay, I was listening to Mist in History when I'd go to the gym.

674
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I would learn about Crazy King Ludwig and lose calories.

675
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I listen to What's the Tea with RuPaul and Michelle Visage.

676
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Because it keeps me laughing and gets me going.

677
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't do podcasts, but I do...

678
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Wait, you don't do podcasts?

679
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Well, listening to podcasts. I don't really listen to podcasts too much,

680
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
but I do watch the web series, which, as you probably saw,

681
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm trying to get them on the show, so hopefully soon.

682
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Just have to get them to commit to a day.

683
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yeah, nice. I should give a plug, because they're always good about plugging us

684
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
to some of the other shows that some friends of mine do,

685
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
because I do listen in the car a lot to GameBui.org,

686
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
which today is Captain Spike's birthday, by the way.

687
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I listen a lot to Koopa Club, which we were talking about our game of the year,

688
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
which depends on what group you are.

689
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I can already tell you Koopa Club will name Bayonetta 2 their game of the year,

690
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
because they love Nintendo that much over there.

691
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Video Game Realness probably will also name Bayonetta 2.

692
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There are also big Nintendo fans over there.

693
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Game Bar, there's lots of great other shows I listen to as well.

694
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I would like a Wii, but I just can't justify buying one without my wife getting mad.

695
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You never know. You never know. They might even...

696
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So family, if you buy me one, then that's okay, because then I can get one.

697
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
All right, let's get into some news.

698
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
We're going to get into the news for the week, of which there was quite a bit,

699
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
thanks to PlayStation's event, and even without that,

700
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
there was still a lot of stuff going on. It was a very busy week.

701
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
It was interesting. So this week, there was a couple announcements

702
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
from Capcom regarding Street Fighter.

703
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
One being, of course, that Capcom is bringing Ultra Street Fighter IV

704
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
exclusively to PlayStation 4 this spring.

705
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
They're saying that the port of the game will come with all the costumes

706
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
that have been made available so far via DLC.

707
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
No firm date has been given yet to when we can expect that.

708
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But on top of that, not only are people on PlayStation 4 getting Ultra Street Fighter IV,

709
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
they are also getting Street Fighter V.

710
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That's right. Street Fighter V has been announced as a PlayStation 4 and PC exclusive.

711
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
And before you think, hey, that they did the same thing with Tomb Raider on Xbox One,

712
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm just going to wait until the exclusive period is done,

713
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
they made sure to clarify that, in fact, as Adam Boyce said,

714
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,000
PlayStation 4 will be the only console this game ever appears on.

715
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I don't think you get much clearer than that.

716
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Well, until Super Street Fighter V. Or Street Fighter V Turbo.

717
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Or Street Fighter V Turbo Ultra Mega.

718
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, I'm not holding out that they're not going to have six or seven different re-releases of the game.

719
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I think a big thing to consider why Microsoft didn't get this game,

720
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and I'm not trying to hate on Xbox One.

721
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Xbox One, I don't think there's any reason why Xbox One doesn't deserve the game.

722
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
However, exclusives are a part of the industry.

723
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
This is why Mario doesn't show up on PlayStation 4.

724
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
You know, what would Nintendo have for their Wii U if they didn't have exclusives?

725
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
So exclusives are just a part of this industry, and wheeling and dealing and all this stuff.

726
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
However, there's another huge factor coming into play,

727
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
which is why the Xbox One got shut out of this,

728
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
and that is the cross-platform play between PC and PlayStation 4.

729
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
That's huge.

730
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And we all know that Microsoft, for whatever reason,

731
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
has chosen to exclude themselves from these types of cross-plays.

732
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Which is weird, because they used to do that back in the early Xbox 360 days.

733
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Xbox One could have Final Fantasy XIV.

734
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Square Enix wanted to do it for Xbox One, but they would not run separate servers for Microsoft.

735
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So, in a way, although I think at the end of the day Sony and Capcom have an arrangement,

736
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Capcom is a Japanese company, the Xbox One is a non-factor in Japan right now.

737
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
As much as that might, you know, sting to hear, it's the reality.

738
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Xbox One's a non-factor in Japan right now.

739
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
It makes this relationship make a lot of sense.

740
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But at the same time, this is going to put a lot of pressure on Microsoft,

741
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
because I think there's going to be a perceived notion that a big reason why the Xbox One didn't get this

742
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
is because it doesn't support the cross-platform play.

743
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And I think if you are hoping that Ultra Street Fighter V, or whatever the fuck they call it,

744
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
will come to Xbox One, that wall will have to drop.

745
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So this is going to put a lot of pressure on Microsoft to reverse that policy.

746
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
And I'm going to predict, I'm going to be one of those guys making predictions,

747
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
this is, that's mine, this is going to be one of those things that they come out at E3 next year

748
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and say that they're going to drop the wall.

749
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm actually going to go so far to predict they're going to announce Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox One next E3.

750
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And this will be their big, we are no longer requiring that Xbox One have their own isolated servers.

751
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So, we'll see.

752
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I still think they're all full of crap.

753
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Well, what do you guys think of the Street Fighter V reveal?

754
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Because I'm seeing a lot of people, I mean, there's definitely two camps.

755
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
There's definitely some people that are very, very, very excited to see it.

756
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
But there's some people that are like, it looks a lot like Street Fighter IV.

757
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
It does look a lot like Street Fighter IV, just with more particles.

758
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I like how the stages are, though, where they're busting through the wall and it's kind of extended out.

759
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I think that's something that...

760
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Mortal Kombat.

761
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
And Justice.

762
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And Justice I know did that.

763
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
But I want to say that I think King of Fighters had that as well.

764
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah, way back in the day, yeah.

765
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And that was special when it was done in Mortal Kombat II.

766
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Or, no, actually, I think even Dead or Alive did that.

767
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I don't know, they've all done that at this point.

768
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
But it looked different.

769
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's something that's separated, I guess.

770
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I still feel like what we got.

771
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I think that gameplay trailer that we got was an apology from Capcom for the whole thing leaking a day early.

772
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Because Yoshinori Ono looked a little surprised.

773
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
He was kind of taken by surprise because the guy was like,

774
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
oh, we do have some gameplay footage to show.

775
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
And he was kind of like, oh, okay.

776
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,000
He's so adorably cute and he's skipping over to see what's on the phone.

777
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I love that guy.

778
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Anyway, so he kind of looked a little surprised.

779
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And I think that was probably Capcom's apology.

780
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Because that Street Fighter V trailer had leaked a day early.

781
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
That took a lot of wind out of the PlayStation Experience keynote sales.

782
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
There was a lot of other good stuff at that keynote.

783
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm not saying it was a bad keynote or anything.

784
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
But that Street Fighter V unveil, exclusive on PlayStation 4.

785
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Imagine if they were able to keep that a secret.

786
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That would have been a huge moment for that room in Vegas.

787
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Huge moment.

788
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And so to kind of have that knocked away, they needed something to make up for it.

789
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
So I think Capcom gave them the gameplay as an apology.

790
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
But I think it's so, so early on.

791
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I think it's just too soon to tell.

792
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I think there's many, many more layers to be peeled back about this game.

793
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So I think it's definitely too early.

794
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I mean, right now, yes, it looks quite a bit like Street Fighter IV.

795
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
But I'm still hopeful that we're going to see more of the differences as time goes on here.

796
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That's for sure.

797
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I want another Marvel vs. Capcom.

798
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

799
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Dungeon Buster says,

800
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Street Fighter IV is still going strong.

801
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Seems a bit too soon for a new one.

802
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Well, it did come right after that talk about Ultra Street Fighter IV.

803
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, Ultra Street Fighter IV would be in the spring.

804
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I'm guessing this would be coming out in fall.

805
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Actually, maybe even late summer, I'd guess.

806
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because I know Capcom tends to release stuff at weird times.

807
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
They like to use August or October usually for their releases like this.

808
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Well, I think 2015 is generous.

809
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I think there's a distinct possibility Street Fighter V not till 2016.

810
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Honestly.

811
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Who cares?

812
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No, seriously, who cares? We're going to get new Mortal Kombat next year.

813
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
We're going to have Ultra Street Fighter IV.

814
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Oh, yeah, I think it's alright.

815
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Can we get new PlayStation All-Stars? I'd be down with that.

816
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Maybe I'm in the minority there.

817
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I think you might be.

818
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Moving on, speaking of Steam, we've talked a little bit about Steam tonight.

819
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Steam came out with some big news independent of all these other events going on the weekend.

820
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Steam unveiled Steam Broadcasting this week.

821
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Steam Broadcasting will allow you to stream your gameplay to friends, strangers, and any Steam user

822
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
without having to use open broadcast software any other time.

823
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's built into Steam.

824
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So if you start playing and you hit the broadcast button, you can broadcast your gameplay.

825
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You can also, and this is a pretty neat thing, you can also keep your streaming private.

826
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So if you only want to stream to a handful of people, you can do that.

827
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So this is very interesting, is that Steam is now throwing their hat into the broadcasting ring.

828
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
And it's very important to note, this is not Steam sending a signal to Twitch or Ustream.

829
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
This is Steam broadcasting within Steam.

830
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
There's also quite a few limitations right now, such as you can't use a webcam with this,

831
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
or any type of custom layers, or things that people like to do on Twitch.

832
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's just the gameplay and your voice.

833
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
So it's even kind of behind where the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are at with the streaming.

834
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Well, they do have a chat window, I think, as well.

835
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
They do have a chat window. They do have that.

836
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
But it's all still early. I mean, again, it is in beta.

837
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But it is very interesting to see Steam throwing their hat into the ring.

838
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I think a lot of us have been saying for some time it would be nice to see Twitch get a little bit of competition,

839
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
because competition is going to make things better.

840
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And Hitbox isn't really taking off, and Ustream is really not good for game streaming.

841
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
If Steam wants to come up with another U2, I'd be down with that.

842
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Oh, yeah, that would be awesome.

843
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:55,000
See, I've been noticing that the various streaming services out there are really, I'd say, finding different niches to cater to.

844
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Like Ustream and Livestream both seem to be a combination of artists doing stuff and political activism.

845
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah, Ustream seems to be also more for concerts and entertainment type events.

846
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I mean, I do realize the PlayStation 4 streams to Ustream.

847
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
But if you look, like, filter Ustream and look at what people are broadcasting on Ustream,

848
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
and it's almost all playroom streams, because they can't go to Twitch.

849
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And what do people do on their playroom streams? Talk shows and showing titties.

850
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Now, Twitch actually did respond to this whole thing, so I wanted to mention this real quick.

851
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
The VP of Marketing, Matthew DiPietro, I hope I said that right, said,

852
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
We are huge fans of Steam and work with Valve regularly on various events and product integrations.

853
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,000
While Steam's broadcasting solution and the Twitch platform are very different things with vastly different feature sets,

854
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
it's really validating to see a company like Valve embrace streaming in this way.

855
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Live video is the future of social connectivity for gamers, and this is another proof point.

856
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
We wish them the best of luck.

857
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
So that was a statement that was like, well, we don't want Valve to not let people stream on Twitch anymore,

858
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
although that really can't happen, I mean, you can't filter a game out of Twitch very easily,

859
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
so I don't think that would really happen.

860
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But they are trying to say, like, this is very different from what we've got going on at Twitch.

861
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
These are two very different things.

862
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And to be fair, he's right, they are very different things.

863
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You know, you can't get Steam broadcasting right now on your iPhone or on the PlayStation 4.

864
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
You can't do that yet.

865
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Now, would this be a very logical thing to build into the iOS and Android app that Steam already has for the future?

866
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Absolutely.

867
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Ooh, they could do that on iOS and watch me play Bejeweled all day.

868
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Would this be an easy thing for them to integrate into the Steam box in the future?

869
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Absolutely.

870
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So, again, very early beta, I think there is a lot, lot more to come from this.

871
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
We shall see.

872
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Let's move on with some more news.

873
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
DarkSakura.

874
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Well, to jump into a little bit of piracy talk, argh.

875
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Argh.

876
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Well, there was an app that was on the Google Play Store for Pirate Bay.

877
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
And Google's like, nope, took it down.

878
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It was basically, it took down not just the Pirate Bay, but it took down Pirate Bay Proxy, Pirate Bay Premium, Pirate Bay Mirror, and Pirate App.

879
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And basically, they just are like, we are not going to have anything related to torrenting at all involved in our service.

880
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:53,000
And the official reason for removal on the thing says violation of intellectual property and impersonation or deceptive behavior provisions of the content policy, please refer to the IP infringement and impersonation policy, help article for more information.

881
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:05,000
So, basically, the Pirate Bay Proxy developer who goes by Gavin said he was disappointed because they didn't do anything to other browsers.

882
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Well, they weren't, let me start over.

883
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
They weren't doing this to other places.

884
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
He said that the app was no different than Firefox or Chrome.

885
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But in this case, because it was specifically for Pirate Bay is why they took it down.

886
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,000
It's not like the Google Store doesn't have a piracy problem all their own, but I digress.

887
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yeah.

888
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It's, I mean, what could these apps have really done?

889
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Is it more of like a image thing where Google just doesn't want to be affiliated with it because of the image?

890
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Well, some of them, like, it depends.

891
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Like, some of them I know that you can download, like, torrents for actual, you know, APKs and stuff like that so you can download the actual apps from it.

892
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I guess I'm just naive because I didn't think you could do all that crap on your phone.

893
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah, you can do BitTorrent on your phone.

894
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:01,000
They haven't blocked the app for people who've already gotten it because, I mean, over 900,000 folks have used it.

895
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Wouldn't a lot of folks, though, that might be into using a site like the Pirate Bay, wouldn't a lot of them kind of know how to sideload apps, though?

896
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
They would. It's more of a convenience thing. It's like, oh, I want to download Angry Birds now.

897
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I mean, I don't know why you would do BitTorrent. I mean, you can just download something like that, you know, other ways that's maybe a little bit more direct, but I don't know.

898
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Yeah. It's just there.

899
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But, I mean, at the end of the day, it does no company good to say, oh, we're going to embrace you, people that love piracy.

900
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
So, that's why they had to distance themselves from it. I think at the end of the day it's an image thing more than anything.

901
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So, that's that. But I would like to see how Google Play is going to tackle some of their other piracy problems.

902
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But anyway, let's move on. Loki.

903
00:55:50,000 --> 00:56:09,000
All right. So, apparently, even though it's been out for over a year now, Target in Australia has, at least now, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not exactly sure when Grand Theft Auto 5 released in Australia, but I would assume it's around the time that it came out in North America.

904
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
But I'm making an assumption there. So, if that's the case, then, yes, it's been out for about a year or over a year.

905
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So, now it's being taken off the shelves of Target because, you know, basically saying we've been speaking to many customers over the recent days about the game and there is a significant level of concern about the game's content.

906
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:37,000
We feel the decision to stop selling Grand Theft Auto 5 is in line with the majority of our customers.

907
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Basically, they're saying that there's feedback from customers about the game's depictions of violence against women.

908
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Which I don't get that because I've played through the game 100% and there's not really exact instances where you're targeting women in the game.

909
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Aside from, oh, you can run around and beat up anybody and there just happens to be women walking around as well as men.

910
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Which I think that's equal opportunity defenders if you ask me. I mean, but whatever.

911
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And also, Grand Theft Auto is Grand Theft Auto. You don't go into that experience thinking, like, oh, it's gonna be, you know, happy Hello Kitty, Friends Forever type of stuff.

912
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Yeah, I don't understand. So, you think it's okay that, okay, so you think it would be okay to, like, say, have it where you can't hurt women but you can kill men or something? You think that's fair?

913
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
No.

914
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:37,000
That's exactly what I'm saying. You can maim anybody in the game, including wildlife.

915
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Silence for all.

916
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You know, you can beat up a deer if you want. I mean, so, I don't know, I just think it's kind of ridiculous at this point why that now, like a year after it's been selling, that, oh, it's bad.

917
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Well, speaking of piracy, this just encourages it.

918
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And on top of Target, Kmart has joined Target in taking up Grand Theft Auto 5 off their shelves. To which I say, there's still Kmarts?

919
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Yeah, it was that one near my old house.

920
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Are they, like, time capsules in Australia like they are? Do we have anybody else? The time in Australia is gonna be awful right now for this new show, but I'm curious in general if anybody's listening over there on the podcast.

921
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Is, are there Kmarts in a time capsule like the ones over here? Because I would say, did Kmart even have Grand Theft Auto 5 in the first place? Like, aren't they still selling, like, you know, Sega Genesis at the Kmarts in Australia?

922
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:43,000
They've Grand Theft Auto, like, one, three, San Andreas. They've taken San Andreas off the shelves because they think it's the same game. I don't know, I think it's a little ridiculous.

923
00:58:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Yeah, there's violent, there's, you can do violence against women, but there's not, like, a mission that says, oh, go kill these women. It's, like, there's a mission where you're torturing somebody who's a man, but, I mean, no one seems to be having to, you know, taking offense to that, but, oh, but, you know.

924
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm gonna say one thing. True equality, which should be the actual goal of feminism here, means it goes both ways. You can't have, oh, well, we don't like that just because of how women are treated and that when every character is treated the same way.

925
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:27,000
It'd be one thing if it was a disproportionate number of actual missions in game that were considered belligerent toward women.

926
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Well, and I kind of think, I don't know, I get the feeling we're focusing too much on the women versus men aspect in this conversation because I think Australia as the territory has a history of kind of being oversensitive with a lot of video games.

927
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I mean, they tend to ban a lot of stuff. They ban Mortal Kombat over there. They've banned, I know they've banned other games as well because it seems like every few months on this show we're talking about such and such game isn't available in Australia.

928
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I don't know. I think they banned that a long time ago before they had that R18 rating or whatever that they have now.

929
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I heard that wasn't really stopping games from not happening over there, though.

930
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I don't know. I think it's ridiculous.

931
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:19,000
This tells me that there's a very, like, you know how we have people in the US, ultra sensitive, conservative people that want to govern. And I'm not saying if you're conservative, you're bad. Listen, hear me out here.

932
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It's a certain set of conservatives that want to police morality. We have that here, right? I think Australia probably has a lot of that, too.

933
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And since maybe they've failed because of what you're talking about, the rating system, this is their new approach.

934
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Contact retailers and get the games pulled off the shelves and use these clips of beating up on women as an example. That's what it is.

935
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:58,000
My friend that lives in Adelaide was telling me that there actually is a really crazy conservative environment right now, especially, I mean, if you look at the I don't know if you paid much attention to the overall political environment in Australia right now, but their PM's a dick.

936
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yeah.

937
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And there are a lot of people who are just sort of taking it as a license to be extra conservative because that's the way that the government is going.

938
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:21,000
There are certain areas out there that will really try to to crack down on just anything that isn't fitting the conservative norm.

939
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
And so I think that's also another contributing factor to why this is going on.

940
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah. And then, like, you know, to be fair, it is, you know, this retailer's choice to do that. And also to be fair, if you live in Australia, I'm sure they've got a God.

941
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I don't even consider Kmart a decision, a choice anymore for buying video games, but like Target, I guess could be.

942
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But there's plenty of other choices out there if you want to buy that game at retail and how you can buy digitally as well.

943
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So I wouldn't say that these two retailers taking off shelves is necessarily dooming.

944
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But I mean, remember, like Wal-Mart over, you know, in the United States, you know, taking music, you know, they've taken different albums off the shelves because of, you know, lyrics and stuff like that.

945
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:18,000
So I could see that they want to position themselves in a certain way to their customers and fine, then just don't do business with them if you don't like it.

946
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And I think that's fair since, you know, it's not like that the whole country is banning the game. So you've got options.

947
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:38,000
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about one event at the PlayStation Expo that many are saying is the troll event of the year.

948
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:46,000
The biggest troll that's happened all year. So, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this, but let me set the stage here.

949
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So Square Enix gets on the stage at PlayStation Expo and says, well, we're celebrating, you know, 20 years, and I'm summarizing here, we're celebrating 20 years of the PlayStation.

950
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And you know, it's been many, many years since this game came out and the Final Fantasy 7 logo comes out on stage or comes up on the stage, right?

951
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And he says, so it's time that we bring Final Fantasy 7 to the PlayStation 4. And I don't know about you guys, but I did the gay gasp.

952
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:23,000
When he said Final Fantasy 7 on PlayStation 4, I did, I did, I did that because I was like, oh, it's happening. Like, this is, this is like the really happening, right?

953
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That, that infamous Final Fantasy 7 remake that we've been, you know, saying Square needs. And I realized there's Final Fantasy 7 haters out there that are like, move the fuck on with it.

954
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:44,000
But you have, you can't, you need to shut up because we don't care. You can't ignore, there's a large amount of people who want to see Final Fantasy 7 get remade, just like four got remade and three got remade.

955
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Or even just a style of Advent Children because Advent Children is fucking amazing.

956
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Right? So when they said Final Fantasy 7 was coming on PlayStation 4, and then the crowd goes wild, right? They're like, whoa.

957
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
And I'm sitting there at home going, you know, like, oh my gosh, this is really happening. Heavy breathing.

958
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I know, right? Yes. Heavy breathing, cat picture, right? You know, so, um, and then they show the, the miasma in like the, the high definition, the live stream.

959
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And I'm sitting there like, they're going to show, you know, everything in HD, right? And then they show the Final Fantasy 7 in a little tiny window and I'm like, okay, they're just showing the original game, right?

960
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And then they're going to show what it looks like now. Nope, it's still the original Final Fantasy 7 because it's just the original Final Fantasy 7 as it was ported to the PC with the slightly up-res textures and the slight differences.

961
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:50,000
That's right. It's a PC. Okay. So Final Fantasy 7 ported to PC, ported to PlayStation 4. That's what was announced.

962
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
And the entire audience.

963
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
F you! You son of a bitch!

964
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Now, now, now that's not the biggest troll ever. I mean, after all, Mega Man being in Marvel versus, was it Marvel versus Capcom? No, uh, Street Fighter X Tekken. That was the biggest troll of them all. I'm sorry. Yeah.

965
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Or the fact that there was even going to be a Tekken X Street Fighter was a pretty big troll.

966
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Yeah, that's hilarious.

967
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Remember, that's... It still could happen. That was the tweet I wrote, by the way, when they announced Street Fighter 5 exclusive for PlayStation 4. I said, don't worry Xbox and Wii U, you can have Tekken X Street Fighter.

968
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But yeah, it's just... I won't buy it. I already have it on PC. Not playing it on PC because, you know, it's in my Steam library. But I just don't see a reason to buy a shitty port of a game. I'm sorry. No, I won't buy it.

969
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I'm sure it'll look alright on PlayStation 4. It'll look alright! It looks alright on PC, but no, I'm not buying it. You can buy Final Fantasy 7... Well, I guess you can't buy it for PlayStation 4, because the...

970
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It better be fucking dirt cheap, then it better be like 8 bucks on there, not like, $29.99. It'll carry the Square Enix tax. It'll be $19.99. Fuck that. Ain't buying it.

971
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Do they think that we don't have access to the internet and we just don't realize that, you know, it's just a port of the PC title?

972
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Well, let's give Square Enix a call. Oh! I'm hearing yes. They just replied yes. That's what we believe. Alright. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

973
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Well, back to a little bit of politics. There is a Senator, Ron Wyden, who's a Democrat from Oregon, who has put in a bill to ban the use of backdoors to circumvent encryption.

974
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:02,000
As in, not just computer encryption, but encryption on phones, other devices, any type of digital data. It's called the Secure Data Act.

975
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It'll basically prevent the government from telling manufacturers that they have to provide a way to decrypt personal data for investigations.

976
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Meaning that it's not just to be protection from other people, but protection from the government, from snooping, as it were.

977
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:36,000
But the thing is, that would also, of course, apply to, I believe, justice cases. But at the same time, we already started having this go on when Apple said that the iPhone 6s, they were not going to allow any external access for decryption.

978
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I think it's actually a really positive step in the case of user advocacy. But, I mean, we're probably going to see this expand to, you know, maybe people's VITAs or DSs, or, you know, for people who crack their own devices, their encryption is going to be protected.

979
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Very interesting. Do you think this has a chance of actually passing?

980
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:17,000
I think there's going to be some pretty hardcore lobbying against it. I think anything has a chance, as long as people think with their morality instead of their wallet.

981
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Well, I mean, I know we've heard a lot about, like, the government is asking Facebook for all these records and Yahoo, and didn't somebody told them no? Was it Apple that told them no? Somebody said that they came out and told the government no.

982
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I know Apple did for the iPhone 6 encryption.

983
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So, but, very interesting. We'll see what comes of this, because I don't think anybody likes the idea of the government being able to snoop on them, but I also get the double-edged sword of, well, but then there's those, you know, one bad person out of 10,000 that we need to be able to hear those conversations.

984
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
So, I don't know. It'll be very interesting to see what develops from this. It'll be a very controversial issue, I'm sure.

985
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of video games coming out near you soon. Loki, if anything, this might be a very empty week.

986
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah, it would be nice if, you know, we had websites that actually had release dates now, but some certain websites decided to remove that information.

987
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
There's nothing else left.

988
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yeah.

989
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I know of one thing in the US this week. I know of one thing in the US.

990
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Well, there's not really any retail releases, I don't think. I'm getting there, but, yeah, I want to say that last week was pretty much the last set of releases that we had for this week as far as retail goes.

991
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I want to say, I think Game of Thrones is this week, but I don't think that was retail. Maybe that was last week. That was last week.

992
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think Game of Thrones is already out, but maybe that was last week.

993
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yeah, that was last week.

994
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris, I know.

995
01:09:49,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Oh, that's right, they're doing a retail release of that. I forgot. Yeah, so they have that coming out. That's pretty much it. I don't think there's anything else. Like I said, I'm trying to get there, but I don't see anything. In fact, actually, here we go.

996
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Yeah, I don't see anything coming out.

997
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Right, yeah, it's going to be a slow week.

998
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Unless you want some Assassin's Creed hoodies, in which case, then, yes, there's lots of those.

999
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:24,000
It's more of a digital distribution week, then, with Lara Croft, and I think Suikoden 2 gets its big hyped release this week. I know a lot of people were very happy to hear.

1000
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Yeah, it was Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris, and apparently they are doing Lara Croft and the Guardian of Lights getting a disc release as well.

1001
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Oh, I'm sorry, no, that's not good.

1002
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It would make a lot of sense if the two of them were kind of bundled or something like that.

1003
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:47,000
This is all digital. Is Tetris Ultimate coming out this week, it looks like? Yeah, Tetris Ultimate is coming out digitally.

1004
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Neat.

1005
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I don't see what else here. This is all digital shit.

1006
01:10:53,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Yeah, okay, so here we go. So Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris coming out, retail, and then, if digital, I guess, Destiny's expansion, the Dark Below is coming out now.

1007
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:20,000
What else was there? That Tetris game on, looks like, PlayStation 4, and that's it. That's it.

1008
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Alright, let's travel to Japan. Believe it or not, they have a lot of stuff still coming out this week, including, I love this, this is a limited edition PlayStation 4.

1009
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:37,000
People losing their minds here over that 20th anniversary PlayStation 4, but over in Japan, they're getting a Dragon Quest Metal Slime PlayStation 4.

1010
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And that's coming out this week, and that looks really cool. It's like a little actual metal slime on the box, and, oh gosh, that looks really cute. I want one of those.

1011
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Unfortunately, it's going to cost me $800 if I want to import it, so maybe not.

1012
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
You don't want that bad.

1013
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah, I don't want it that bad, exactly.

1014
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:59,000
But there are some games as well. Grand Theft Auto 5 gets its release in Japan this week. JoySound TV Plus also gets its Japanese release.

1015
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Need for Speed Rivals Complete Edition, which I'm assuming that means it includes all the DLC, is this week.

1016
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou with Power Up Kit comes out in a regular and a treasure box this week.

1017
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
So, that is out on the PlayStation 4.

1018
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Going over to the Xbox One. The Xbox One has Grand Theft Auto 5 this week. That is really its only release.

1019
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Seeing if there's still things on the PlayStation 3 this week. There are.

1020
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Shining Resonance from Sega is out this week on the PlayStation 3, as is Assassin's Creed Rogue.

1021
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou. Hajime no Ippo the Fighting.

1022
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Ryu Ga Gotoku 1 and 2 HD Edition gets a price reduction, as does Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 gets a price reduction as well.

1023
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
So, some games getting discounts there on the PlayStation 3.

1024
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Looking at the Wii U this week? No, but you have Sonic Tune on December 18th.

1025
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,000
And on the PlayStation Vita this week, we have Sengoku Hime 5.

1026
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Earth Defense Forces 2 Portable V2 comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1027
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Yeah. Not gonna import it?

1028
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:15,000
No, I don't have a Vita anymore. So, no. Although, the new Earth Defense Force game may be.

1029
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Grisaia no Rakuen la Iden de la Grisaia comes out this week.

1030
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
And the Portable V2? I think that's just a remake of the last one that they put out.

1031
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Because they did have a portable, was it 20? Well, it was over here.

1032
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah, it was a portable 2017 V2, I think. I don't remember what it was called.

1033
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Now, next week in Japan, big, big release on December 13th.

1034
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Yokai Watch 2 Senuchi comes out next week.

1035
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And this series, pretty big deal over in Japan.

1036
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I can't wait till we get it.

1037
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Yeah, so that's a really big release on the 3DS.

1038
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
So, even though things are slowing down here, this is a big week in Japan for releases.

1039
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Moving on to Dark Sakura and the UK releases.

1040
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
On the 9th, we have Star Wars The Old Republic Shadows of Revan on PC.

1041
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
On the 11th, we've got BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend on PC.

1042
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Rune Factory 4 on 3DS.

1043
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
And then on PC and Mac, we have The Talos Principle.

1044
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
On the 14th, it's Halo Spartan Strike on Windows Phone and PC.

1045
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
That's it.

1046
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1047
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
But first, Loki.

1048
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:41,000
So, thanks to the PlayStation Experience in celebrating 20 years of the PlayStation.

1049
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:50,000
EA has decided to be generous and give away free games for the length of the PlayStation Experience.

1050
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
So, ending tonight, December 7th at midnight.

1051
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
They're going to be giving away, or up to that.

1052
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
They're going to be giving away on PlayStation 4 Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

1053
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Mirror's Edge on PlayStation 3 and Need for Speed Most Wanted on the Vita.

1054
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And those are going to be free on the PlayStation Store during that time.

1055
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So, if you haven't done it yet, go ahead and download those.

1056
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Or, at the very least, go on the Sony Store online and just mark them all to download.

1057
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
That way you have them for the future.

1058
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I'm not sure if you need PlayStation Plus to get them.

1059
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I know I had that, so I don't know.

1060
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Which Need for Speed Most Wanted is it?

1061
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
It's the one that was on the Vita.

1062
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I don't know. It must have been the new one.

1063
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Yeah, I think it's the new one.

1064
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
It's the new one, but it's only on the Vita.

1065
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It's like the old school PS2 version.

1066
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Yeah, I know.

1067
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
That guy's awesome.

1068
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
No, that guy's confusing.

1069
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Yeah, it's the new Most Wanted.

1070
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
And sadly, a lot of the podcast listeners, it's going to be too late by the time you hear this.

1071
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:56,000
But hopefully, I mean, hopefully you guys are tapped in enough to the game blogs and Twitter and so forth that you already heard about this and got your games flagged for download.

1072
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
What do you guys think, though?

1073
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
It's a very interesting, I mean, EA has no real need to do this.

1074
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
The interesting thing, though, I will throw this out there.

1075
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I mean, Mirror's Edge, I really feel like a lot of people already own that game one way or another.

1076
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
And EA does have a sequel they want to create awareness for.

1077
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Plants vs. Zombies.

1078
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Has a lot of microtransactions.

1079
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Microtransactions and to be honest, I was not interested in buying that game ever.

1080
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
So it looked OK, but it was like it never was.

1081
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh, when I get a PlayStation 4, I'm totally going to buy this game.

1082
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
No, that never happened.

1083
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Again, I don't want to review something based on only like 30 minutes, but it's not exactly the type of game that's, you know, get me like super excited.

1084
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
It's not as awesome as it's supposed to be, like team portraits, too, with plants and zombies.

1085
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Yeah, sort of, sort of.

1086
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
So, but yeah, they can still make the money from microtransactions and so forth.

1087
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
So not that I'm trying to belittle what's going on here, because, you know, free games are a good thing.

1088
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But I don't think the risk factor or how much EA is going to lose in this is necessarily a huge, huge deal.

1089
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Because I think what they lose in Garden Warfare sales they'll make up for is people...

1090
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I think Mirror's Edge is like 10 bucks now on the PlayStation Network, so.

1091
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And Most Wanted, well, but it's probably...

1092
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Yeah, I don't think a lot of people are seeking out that game anymore, you know, so there you go.

1093
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
As far as Mirror's Edge goes, though, is by somehow you have still missed this game time and time again,

1094
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
do go get it now that it's free.

1095
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I mean, at least check that one out if nothing else.

1096
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
If you got a PlayStation 3, which a lot of you do, it's just...

1097
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Just market download. I mean, what's it going to hurt you?

1098
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Exactly.

1099
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
ActDef says, I got the free game, but no space in my Vita memory card.

1100
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Well, at least if you have it flagged on your account, you can always download it when you get a bigger memory card.

1101
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Because that's the interesting thing, is that the price of the system keeps dropping, but the memory cards are still expensive.

1102
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Anyway.

1103
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
That's because they still use their stupid proprietary memory cards.

1104
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Yeah, right.

1105
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the end of this segment.

1106
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And that is a Wii U game that EA was working on.

1107
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,000
And speaking of EA, they're giving away these free games, but the Wii U is getting nothing.

1108
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Because here's the deal, EA was working on SimCity for the Wii U.

1109
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,000
That's right, EA's recent SimCity release was at one point being planned for the Wii U, but...

1110
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Which joke should I make? I don't know.

1111
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It ended up being cancelled.

1112
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Was it because it didn't support online very well?

1113
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Well, we don't know why the game was cancelled, ultimately.

1114
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Or because the game was just not good?

1115
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It could be because the Wii U's not tapped in online.

1116
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Or because they have a hate boner for the Wii U?

1117
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I don't know. Maybe the Wii U's didn't sell enough?

1118
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
SimCity didn't have enough inertia to really justify the Wii U release?

1119
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I don't know. We'll never know.

1120
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:47,000
They haven't said why it was cancelled, just that some things leaked out about that it was something that was being planned at one point.

1121
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
SimCity on the Wii U.

1122
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Which, I don't know if you guys ever played SimCity 2000 on PlayStation 1.

1123
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:01,000
But I think the only time SimCity really worked well was the original on the Super Nintendo.

1124
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
And that's because Nintendo kind of put their own little magic on it.

1125
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You know, they did their own little thing to it to make it a little more controller friendly.

1126
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
But those games really require a mouse and keyboard to really play.

1127
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
However, the touchpad I think could have really made up for a lot of that.

1128
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:23,000
So it's kind of too bad we'll never get to see how it could have executed on the Wii U.

1129
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Because I bet it could have been pretty good.

1130
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So, we'll never know.

1131
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
But there you go. SimCity was a thing that was being working on for Wii U.

1132
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And was ultimately cancelled.

1133
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Well, not cancelled and running strong week after week after week is the classic game of the week.

1134
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault, take a walk down memory lane and find a game that she thinks,

1135
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Hey, you guys should be checking this out right now.

1136
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
The classic game of the week.

1137
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Dark Soccer, what is this week's classic game of the week?

1138
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:04,000
The classic game of the week is a game that came out on the ZX Spectrum in 1984 called Deus Ex Machina.

1139
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:11,000
And I wanted to pick something on the Spectrum since we didn't get the system over here.

1140
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
We've got our UK listeners today, our European listeners.

1141
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
This is actually a really weird game.

1142
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Basically, it does have an amazing voice cast though.

1143
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,000
It has Ian Drury, it has Jon Pertwee in it, as in we knew him as the Third Doctor.

1144
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Quite a few people and including the composer Mel Croucher.

1145
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
The music in this game is really good too.

1146
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:42,000
It's basically a game that you cover the life of a defect that grows inside of a machine.

1147
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,000
From conception through growth, evolution and death.

1148
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And it's sort of based off the seven ages of man from As You Like It.

1149
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
The game is...

1150
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It was really, I think...

1151
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Well, it got lots of great reviews, but it wasn't necessarily anything that people knew what to make of right when it came out.

1152
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
It was really odd and then people didn't know how to sell it either.

1153
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
So it was, at the time, only mail order direct to the public.

1154
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Pirated a whole lot and the game's now got this massive cult status.

1155
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Visually today, it's really not a lot to look at.

1156
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
In 1984, this is pretty crazy go nuts.

1157
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And you start off like the level that we're looking at.

1158
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Now you follow its DNA formation.

1159
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Then you follow watching the embryo grow.

1160
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Then you follow it through childhood and everything.

1161
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And it's quite a bit out there.

1162
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Even today, it's quite a bit out there.

1163
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But I think that if this game were to be remade today, I mean, it'd probably be nothing to run it.

1164
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
But it would still be one of those...

1165
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It reminds me of a lot of indie games that you see today.

1166
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
So that's why I think it's really...

1167
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
It's a big influential on, I think, a lot of our indie gamers.

1168
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:09,000
There was a reimagining of the game in 2010 that went under Deus Ex Machina 2.

1169
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
And the same director, everything.

1170
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
And it had Christopher Lee as the programmer.

1171
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
The main character in there.

1172
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,000
But I don't know if they ever actually finished it.

1173
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I didn't see anything about it if it was actually finished.

1174
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,000
But the game was listed as one of the 1,001 video games you must play before you die.

1175
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And so there you go.

1176
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
It's really trippy and it seems like...

1177
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
So the whole voice acting thing was like...

1178
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
It wasn't because these old computers couldn't play CD quality.

1179
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It was off cassette.

1180
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So you would play this cassette while you play the game.

1181
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That's so weird.

1182
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
But it's that way you get, though, the whole experience together.

1183
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So that means everything that you're actually doing in the game has to be timed.

1184
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
And if I'm right, actually, I think that the game played off the cassette.

1185
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I would want to say.

1186
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Interesting.

1187
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Yeah.

1188
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
What a neat little concept.

1189
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Yeah.

1190
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
So, I mean, for its time, definitely innovating.

1191
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah.

1192
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So that's the game I picked.

1193
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
All right.

1194
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
There it is.

1195
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Your classic game of the week from the Spectrum.

1196
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Deus Ex Machina.

1197
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Very obscure choice.

1198
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
I like that one.

1199
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,000
All right.

1200
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Well, that is going to do it for part A of the show.

1201
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Oh, wait.

1202
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
And it's not related to the Deus Ex series.

1203
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
This is completely different.

1204
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah, it has nothing to do with the newer series.

1205
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Which I do recall that the reason why they couldn't call Deus Ex anything more than that

1206
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
was because of copyright on this game.

1207
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Well, guys, we have to, before we actually get to our break here,

1208
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
we actually have some breaking news.

1209
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
This is an envy.

1210
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
All right.

1211
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
So let's get to.

1212
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
No, it's not.

1213
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
It's O-L-R.

1214
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
We have some breaking news.

1215
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
This is not happy breaking news, actually.

1216
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
This is kind of crappy breaking news and very unfortunate.

1217
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
But Ralph Baer, the father of video games known as,

1218
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,000
he has passed away at the age of 92.

1219
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That's a good run.

1220
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah, it's a great run.

1221
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So, you know, but if you don't know the name,

1222
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
he actually was called the Thomas Edison of the home TV game

1223
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
in Popular Electronics magazine in 1980.

1224
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And that's because he created the Odyssey,

1225
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
which was really the first home video game system,

1226
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
the patent being filed in 1970 and released by Magnavox in 1972.

1227
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
You can thank Ralph Baer for home video game consoles.

1228
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I just don't like that they insult you.

1229
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Plus, Nolan Bushnell totally stole the idea for Pong from him.

1230
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So there it is.

1231
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
It's also the first home light gun game.

1232
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
An add-on for the Odyssey called Shooting Gallery was Ralph Baer's as well.

1233
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
His contributions were recognized by receiving the National Medal of Technology

1234
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
by then President George W. in 2000.

1235
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And then he was named President of the National Medal of Technology

1236
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
by then President George W. in 2006.

1237
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Also created Simon.

1238
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Did he really?

1239
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Yep.

1240
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
I did not realize that.

1241
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah, the story behind that is really cool.

1242
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Atari made a game called Touch Me and Baer saw it and then made Simon.

1243
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And it was the biggest seller of 1978.

1244
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So to make up for getting Pong ripped off from him,

1245
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
he quickly ripped Touch Me off from Atari.

1246
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
There you go.

1247
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Well, there you go.

1248
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
A tip of the hat and pouring out the 40 to Mr. Ralph Baer.

1249
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Rest in peace.

1250
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Okay, we're going to use this opportunity to take a break.

1251
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
But we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1252
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Don't go anywhere.

1253
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The Fugu Question of the Week, some rapid-fire news,

1254
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
your emails, of which there are a lot tonight,

1255
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Twitters and live calls.

1256
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
We will still take live calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1257
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
right after this.

1258
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

1259
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
episode number 578 in progress,

1260
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
live at a special time at vognetwork.com.

1261
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,000
We're taping a little early today because Dark Sakura

1262
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
and I have some plans in the Bay Area this evening.

1263
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:16,000
So it's this recurring thing that's been going on for years and years.

1264
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
And every year we miss it because we always do an OLR.

1265
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,000
So we said, you know what, this year, let's do two birds with one stone.

1266
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
We'll be able to make this gathering and we'll do an earlier OLR.

1267
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Because once every few months, probably actually it's more like every six months,

1268
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
we like to do an earlier show just so people in different time zones

1269
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
are able to participate as well because it is the show, of course,

1270
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
where every gamer has a voice.

1271
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I really wish we could do a different time for everybody every week,

1272
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
but unfortunately we have our own personal lives to juggle.

1273
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm sure you can understand.

1274
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
But that's why we have the podcast, which you can check out at iTunes,

1275
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Stitcher Radio, TuneIn.

1276
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
There's millions of places to check out podcasts.

1277
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
You can also just listen to it directly at either orangeontradio.com

1278
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
or vognetwork.com. Take a pick.

1279
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Lots of great ways to catch up with the podcast every week.

1280
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio

1281
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, stop.

1282
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1283
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Lots of other news going on this week. Loki.

1284
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
All right. So this is kind of cool.

1285
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Some of the announcements that they're making during the PlayStation experience

1286
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
included some games that are getting ported over to different platforms,

1287
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
including Broken Age and Day of the Tentacle,

1288
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
the special edition coming to PlayStation 4 and Vita.

1289
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
So no idea what's special about the special edition for Day of the Tentacle,

1290
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
but I love Day of the Tentacle, so I'll probably have to buy it.

1291
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And then they're also saying that on top of that,

1292
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Gang Beasts, I guess, is coming to PlayStation 4 as well,

1293
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
which actually is a pretty fun-looking game.

1294
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,000
And, you know, I guess, what else here?

1295
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
No, that's it so far.

1296
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
So, yeah, that was during their keynote that they announced those.

1297
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,000
No timeframe.

1298
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I'm super excited for the Day of the Tentacle.

1299
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I thought of you when they announced that, actually.

1300
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
I'm down, so that should be awesome.

1301
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And then, actually, the game I was trying to play during break,

1302
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but my expat or thing is not working correctly.

1303
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:28,000
It's a game called I Am Bread, and it just released on Steam Early Access.

1304
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
It's from Bossa Studios, who did Surgeon Simulator,

1305
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
and if you want a game that just is really weird and silly,

1306
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
then this is probably going to be up your alley.

1307
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I think it's 15% off right now.

1308
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I think it's like $8.99 instead of $9.99 or something.

1309
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And, basically, the premise of the game is you're a piece of bread,

1310
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:53,000
and you control the bread by holding down different corners of the bread.

1311
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Kind of like QWOP.

1312
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yeah, it's sort of like QWOP.

1313
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It's very difficult, I guess.

1314
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,000
You get used to it, but it's difficult to control, I guess, on purpose.

1315
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
But, yeah, each corner is a different key,

1316
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
and then you have to kind of hold those corners down

1317
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
and provide momentum using the analog stick or mouse or keyboard,

1318
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
and you have to move across the room to get toasted,

1319
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
and you're graded on a few different things,

1320
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
including edibility and deliciousness,

1321
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
and you also break things while you happen to be doing that.

1322
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:37,000
So the way they put it is like a piece of bread apparently trying to toast itself,

1323
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
and it's a lot of fun.

1324
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So I took it as early access.

1325
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,000
There are issues with the game, though.

1326
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I did run into the problem, as I mentioned before,

1327
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
where my gamepad doesn't work with it because it's Windows 8.1 right now,

1328
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
so that doesn't work too well.

1329
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
That's why I was trying to get the keypadder thing to work

1330
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
so I could assign keys to it.

1331
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
But I tried it with keyboard, and it works okay,

1332
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
although then I got on the floor,

1333
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
and my edibility started dropping really fast.

1334
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I was like, ah, I need to get to the counter,

1335
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
except I'm very awkward with that game,

1336
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
and so I started moving in the opposite direction.

1337
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
But check it out. It's pretty cool.

1338
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
And then if you're a fan of Yakuza,

1339
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
and definitely there's a lot of rabid fans out there of Yakuza,

1340
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Yakuza 5 is going to be coming to North America on PlayStation 3.

1341
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Apparently they're saying that Yakuza 4 and Yakuza Dead Souls

1342
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
will also be now on PlayStation Network starting this week as well.

1343
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
But that's a big deal for people wanting the Yakuza series

1344
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
to come over to North America.

1345
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
So, pretty awesome that that's going to happen.

1346
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I bet Deakman, who is an integral part of our orangeonitrader.com website,

1347
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I could hear him fangirl screaming when they announced the Yakuza 5.

1348
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Absolutely.

1349
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
There was a lot of fangirl scream moments out of that

1350
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
between either Day of the Tentacle or Suikoden was another big one.

1351
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
You know, Suikoden 2 is finally happening.

1352
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
There's a lot of great, great moments.

1353
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Alright, moving on.

1354
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,000
This probably isn't as scream-worthy, but it still is kind of neat.

1355
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:24,000
You can get some, I guess, faceplates is what they would be for the PlayStation 4.

1356
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
You can get these for $25 a pop.

1357
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,000
The Order 1886 or LittleBigPlanet faceplates.

1358
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
They're available on the Sony store right now.

1359
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And you can actually pop them on to your existing PlayStation 4.

1360
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
So it's not going to change the way the entire thing looks,

1361
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,000
but kind of like the front half, you can change how that looks.

1362
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah, it looks like the part that's over the disk drive kind of on top.

1363
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
You know what's funny is I actually looked at my PlayStation 4 the other day

1364
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
and I'm like, wow, it's upside down.

1365
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It's on its side, but it's the wrong way.

1366
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
The PlayStation logo is upside down.

1367
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I never realized that that thing could pop off so easy.

1368
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
But apparently it's designed to do that,

1369
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
so you can get a new faceplate and just pop that right there.

1370
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Or is that, I haven't replaced the hard drive.

1371
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Is that where the hard drive is maybe?

1372
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Oh, maybe. That could be it.

1373
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
So PlayStation 4 faceplates are a thing.

1374
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That'll be happening.

1375
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
This is neat.

1376
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Deep Silver is going to be auctioning off the real life Saints Row Genki Mobile,

1377
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
which there's a little picture of it circulating around the internet.

1378
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And it's available on eBay.

1379
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,000
And it was starting at $7,500 even though this vehicle has 80,000 miles on it.

1380
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I don't know who the hell would drive this out in public.

1381
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
I'm not entirely sure it's street legal either.

1382
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Yeah, so this might just be something you aim at your neighbor's house.

1383
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I don't know what the practical purposes would be.

1384
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
The cool thing though is that cannon in the back actually does work.

1385
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It fires t-shirts, right?

1386
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Yes. I would fire tons of t-shirts.

1387
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Things like that have been done before.

1388
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Well, so here's the thing. It started at $7,500.

1389
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
It's up now to $7,700.

1390
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
You got like one or two people interested.

1391
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Three bids so far actually. Three bids on this so far.

1392
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I would like to know what the hell somebody's going to do with this.

1393
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
But if you would like to get in on this, it's going to end Saturday at 9 a.m.

1394
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
So you still have a good five days.

1395
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
So podcast listeners, if you have $7,000 or $8,000 sitting around,

1396
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
send it to us here at Orange Tons Radio.

1397
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,000
We will make better use of it than buying a t-shirt cannon.

1398
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
It worked better when Gorillaz did it.

1399
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
If you're a real big Saints Row fan that you're ruling to drop $8,000,

1400
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
if you were ruling to drop $8,000 on the GameCube mobile,

1401
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,000
just save that and you could drop a significant less portion of that

1402
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,000
on a bunch of the shoes, the clothing, all that shit, the games,

1403
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
and still have several thousand dollars left over.

1404
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah, you could go to Party City on an $800 budget

1405
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
and probably decorate your own pickup truck and all that.

1406
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Yeah, I was going to say, you can DIY that.

1407
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
In fact, you know, maybe for like $1,000,

1408
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
OLR will come out and decorate your vehicle.

1409
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Nope, nope. I won't come out for $1,000.

1410
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
All right.

1411
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
As long as you can cover the travel as well.

1412
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Anyhow, Sony Santa Monica Studio announced some things

1413
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
that they are preparing at the PlayStation Keynote the other day,

1414
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
including Fat Princess Adventures, which, you know,

1415
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
if you're into Diablo, Gauntlet, that type of stuff,

1416
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Fat Princess Adventures looks very similar to that sort of thing.

1417
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Whatom was a game that they showed that really made no sense at all.

1418
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But when you consider that it's coming from Keita Takahashi,

1419
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:41,000
that's right, the creator of Katamari and Noby Noby Boy,

1420
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
then it makes sense why it did make sense.

1421
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Which, by the way, was it just me or was he drunk when he was on stage?

1422
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Because there's this gif around.

1423
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I noticed this too when it was happening live.

1424
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
He's like literally stumbling around in a circle while he's on stage

1425
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
trying to watch what's going on.

1426
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It's very... I hope he's all right.

1427
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
You know what?

1428
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
I hope he was just really nervous.

1429
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Can you imagine a Katamari game, though,

1430
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
with the amount of particles that the PlayStation 4 can handle?

1431
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I know, right?

1432
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
He's probably not interested in revisiting it, but...

1433
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I don't care if he's interested.

1434
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Goddamn it, make me another one.

1435
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And again, that series really has never been as good as the original.

1436
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Anyway...

1437
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Or make another strange game like Noby Noby Boy,

1438
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,000
where you eat your own butt.

1439
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I actually was still playing Noby Noby Boy on my phone for, like, years.

1440
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Now, did you notice, though, that Wadam is kind of one of those names

1441
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
that is the same if you flip it upside down?

1442
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
So I wonder if that's kind of the gist of the game.

1443
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
What's the word? A palindrome?

1444
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Yeah, because the M, if you flip it upside down, is a W.

1445
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
So if you flip that word...

1446
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Oh, yeah.

1447
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
It's like the same thing.

1448
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
So kind of a double whammy.

1449
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Yeah, maybe there's a meaning in there somewhere.

1450
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I don't know. Who knows?

1451
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Anyway, another strange trailer that they showed,

1452
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
What Remains of Edith Finch.

1453
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
There's a bunch of short stories around a cursed family.

1454
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
The trailer was very ambient and kind of horror film-ish.

1455
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So I like, though, that there's all these kind of, like, original ideas coming out.

1456
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
We're not just talking, like, you know, here's, you know,

1457
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
part seven of this ongoing series.

1458
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I mean, there's room in the world for those games, too.

1459
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
There's ongoing series called Final Fantasy.

1460
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Yeah, right?

1461
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I mean, there's room in the world for those games, too,

1462
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
but I like that we're seeing a lot of new concepts, as well.

1463
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,000
So we'll see more about these games at a future date, I'm sure.

1464
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Some people, I think, play in this stuff at the Expo.

1465
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I wish we had had somebody lined up to call into the show today,

1466
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
because the Expo's going on right now.

1467
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Somebody could have called in, but...

1468
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
We had some people going, too.

1469
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I only know, like, one listener out there,

1470
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
and a friend of mine on Twitter's out there, too,

1471
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
but they're probably playing games.

1472
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
They don't want to stop for 20 minutes to talk to us.

1473
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I understand.

1474
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I don't take it personally.

1475
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Very hard.

1476
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
DarkSakura.

1477
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Well, there's one thing that we like.

1478
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
It's SNK.

1479
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Whoo!

1480
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So they are going to be bringing more games from the EOGO catalog

1481
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
to the PlayStation Network,

1482
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,000
starting off with Metal Slug 3 for PS4, PS3, and PS Vita.

1483
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
It's also the upgraded version, like we saw on Steam,

1484
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
with the online multiplayer and leaderboard, whatever.

1485
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
And then they are polling fans to see what we want next.

1486
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
So the 15 candidates we've seen...

1487
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Twin Star Sprite...

1488
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Twiggle Star Sprite, sorry.

1489
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Neo Turf Master, Sengoku 3,

1490
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Gairo, Mark of the Wolves,

1491
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Samurai Shadow on 5 Special, and Last Blade II.

1492
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
My vote would be for Last Blade II, because that game's fun.

1493
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
So, good on that.

1494
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
We also have The Legend of Zelda,

1495
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Symphony of the Goddesses,

1496
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:49,000
is on the Master Quest Tour in 2015,

1497
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:54,000
meaning that they're going to be going on a worldwide tour to play Zelda music.

1498
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:00,000
And it's done to celebrate the upcoming release of Majora's Mask on the 3DS.

1499
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
They're going to be...

1500
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
It looks like just a handful of locations on this tour.

1501
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
It kind of looks like it is really whirlwind.

1502
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Nothing really near us, but we've got a few Canadian ones.

1503
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
We have a few...

1504
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
We have also just a few over in Europe,

1505
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:24,000
and we have one in Hawaii, one in Tokyo.

1506
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Who did none near us? Because I would have wanted to go.

1507
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Couldn't be bothered to roll through San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose,

1508
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
I don't know, Silicon Valley.

1509
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I don't see any in California. That's what I was looking over.

1510
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
So I guess we have to go to Texas.

1511
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
No, thank you.

1512
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
No, thank you. Not on purpose.

1513
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I could go visit Travis, give him some shit.

1514
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Let's just go to Toronto.

1515
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
All right. That'll work.

1516
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Oh, the Video Game Realness guys are out in Toronto.

1517
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
We could go to Montreal.

1518
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
That's right. All right.

1519
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
So anyway, last but not least, we have Shovel Knight News.

1520
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Yay, Shovel Knight.

1521
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
It sold 300,000 copies.

1522
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Yay. Not bad for kind of a quiet little game there, right?

1523
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
But Shovel Knight's fun, and it's one of the Kickstarter games,

1524
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,000
and it's Kickstarter made four times what they asked for,

1525
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:25,000
which ended up being a total of $311,000.

1526
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So not bad.

1527
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Not bad at all.

1528
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Did you see the little bit out of the PlayStation experience where...

1529
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I haven't touched our PlayStation anything in ages.

1530
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
No, no, no, no.

1531
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
On the announcements that came out the past couple days,

1532
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
well, Shovel Knight's coming to PlayStation was the big thing,

1533
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
and they're doing an extra stage or something because Kratos is a boss in it now.

1534
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
So that'll be interesting.

1535
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Interesting.

1536
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Yeah.

1537
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
That's a good word for it. Interesting.

1538
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Yes. So we'll see how that plays out.

1539
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Also interesting, every week, you guys lend your voices to the show

1540
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.

1541
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Thanks, Mario.

1542
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
We go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1543
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
You throw those words together, you get Fugal.

1544
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And every week we ask a question of our communities,

1545
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
and we read our favorite answers here on the show.

1546
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
And tonight our question was all about the Game Awards

1547
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
because we were curious, you know?

1548
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Did you guys watch it? Did you check it out?

1549
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,000
So our question was, did you watch them?

1550
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
And if you did, what did you think they did well,

1551
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
and what do you think they could do better?

1552
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:33,000
And if you didn't watch, what's something they could do to get you to watch?

1553
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Fabrice starts us off over on the Facebooks saying,

1554
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Didn't watch. I wasn't very interested in another top three show that drags along.

1555
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
It did drag a little bit.

1556
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I'm not sure how they could super tighten it up,

1557
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,000
but it did drag a little bit, so I don't blame you.

1558
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
But you can watch The Highways on YouTube, I guess.

1559
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Andy R. said, Didn't watch.

1560
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I was driving to the PlayStation Experience during that time.

1561
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Good enough excuse, I suppose.

1562
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
LowCatFrog responds and says, I don't watch award shows.

1563
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Even this one I would not have watched.

1564
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Everything I watched is streamed, no TV.

1565
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Well, LowCatFrog may not have got the memo.

1566
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
This actually wasn't on TV.

1567
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
This was something that was only available on streaming,

1568
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
so somehow you missed it. I don't know.

1569
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Fifth Dream. Okay, now we've got somebody who did watch them

1570
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
because Fifth Dream says I did watch them, and I was actually pretty impressed.

1571
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So many award shows are just embarrassing, but this one wasn't.

1572
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,000
It had a nice mix of industry people, world premiere footage,

1573
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
and musical performances.

1574
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
It wasn't without hiccups, but they were pretty minor.

1575
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
The industry icon award being presented to Roberta and Ken Williams

1576
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,000
is a pretty great moment.

1577
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Overall, I actually enjoyed the show.

1578
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And Red The Haze says, I watched while I played a game on my Vita.

1579
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
It was definitely a step in the right direction.

1580
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It did have a lot of awkward moments,

1581
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
but it wasn't as bad as the older Spike VGAs

1582
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
that were targeting non-gaming audiences.

1583
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I think those comments last two really sum it up for me as well

1584
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
because, you know, I think it was a step in the right direction.

1585
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I think it's a very good way of putting it.

1586
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,000
But let's go over to our Google Plus page

1587
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:06,000
because we have some comments there as well.

1588
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And over on Google Plus, we have

1589
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
At Deft replies and says, I watched later that night,

1590
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
and the tribute to Ken and Roberta Williams

1591
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
was probably the best thing about the whole thing,

1592
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
and the music segments were spectacular.

1593
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
The whole ceremony has lots of room for improvement,

1594
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
both in presentation and technical stuff,

1595
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
but overall it was enjoyable.

1596
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I could probably do with less advertising from publishers

1597
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
and more actual recognition to the industry as it deserves.

1598
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Redtertainment says, I didn't watch them,

1599
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
but I find it hard to watch things on the internet while I'm at work.

1600
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I've heard general mocking of the game awards,

1601
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
but as we all know, gamershateeverything.com.

1602
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
If I could change anything, I would change the fact

1603
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
that I couldn't easily watch it on my TV after the fact.

1604
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Perhaps being able to download the show on iTunes

1605
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,000
or watch via streaming like Hulu or Netflix.

1606
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
And then Alicia L. follows that up over on Google Plus saying,

1607
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
yes, put it on Netflix.

1608
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
So some people wanting to have a little more on demand.

1609
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I believe it is on YouTube, but I know YouTube...

1610
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
It is on YouTube.

1611
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
It is on YouTube, but that...

1612
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I mean, YouTube is and isn't accessible

1613
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
depending on where you're at and what device you're carrying, so...

1614
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But that's how I watched the hour that I missed at the end there,

1615
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
and the ultra important Ken and Roberta Williams tribute,

1616
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
which is really the thing you most need to see.

1617
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And to be fair, wouldn't that be hashtag gamershateeverything these days?

1618
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
No, there's actually a website that Bobby registered some time ago

1619
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
called gamershateeverything.com,

1620
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
and you go to it and it says, do gamers hate everything?

1621
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Yes.

1622
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
There it is.

1623
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
There you go.

1624
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
That's it.

1625
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Just like the whole...

1626
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
They do that type of website for everything.

1627
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
There's, you know...

1628
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Is Half-Life 3 out yet?

1629
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
Is Half-Life 3 out yet?

1630
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
You know, is there a Steam sale?

1631
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Things like that.

1632
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So anyway, let's move on with some more news.

1633
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Loki.

1634
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Alright.

1635
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So, you know, definitely there's at least some love from Sony for the Vita,

1636
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:04,000
and they're kind of trying to show that with more releases coming to it.

1637
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,000
And so, some big name games are actually scheduled to be coming that way,

1638
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
including the Banner Saga, which is pretty awesome,

1639
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Suicoden 1 and 2,

1640
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Super Time Force Ultra,

1641
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Towerfall Ascension,

1642
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Octodad, The Dadliest Catch,

1643
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Resident Evil Revelations 2,

1644
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
and more.

1645
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:36,000
So they're saying also that, I guess, they've already got ports of Geometry Wars Dimensions and Bastion

1646
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
coming to the Vita as well,

1647
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
but at least they're going to be supporting with more games.

1648
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And Resident Evil Revelations, that's supposed to be coming out spring of 2015.

1649
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
So, not bad.

1650
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Yo, it was nice to see the Vita getting a little bit of attention.

1651
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:59,000
I wonder how the Vita TV's doing, or that PlayStation TV's doing.

1652
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I'm curious as well, because it was very curious.

1653
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
There were some things in that Sony event that they didn't talk about.

1654
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I mean, granted, the thing kind of started to go on a little long anyway,

1655
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,000
and for me, overall, the last 30 minutes really lost steam compared to the first hour 30 minutes.

1656
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
So, they needed to end it.

1657
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
But there were some things they didn't really talk about at all, and that Vita TV is one of them.

1658
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Like, they didn't mention it, the whole keynote, and I really thought that was an extra chance.

1659
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Maybe it's just not doing that well. I don't know.

1660
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I don't know.

1661
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Maybe they'd rather you buy the regular Vita.

1662
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,000
The other thing that surprised me, PlayStation Now was not talked about at all.

1663
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
You know, that thing that's been in beta for a year or whatever,

1664
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
they didn't really give any updates or any announcements that, oh, more games...

1665
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
It's only been like a few months.

1666
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
It feels like it's been longer. I think it's only been public a few months.

1667
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:47,000
No, maybe.

1668
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Because they were giving away the codes at E3, and even before that, it was something that some people had.

1669
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Because before it was on the PS4, I think it was on the PS3?

1670
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah.

1671
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Yeah, I mean, it's been testing for a while.

1672
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
So, I'm surprised there were no updates on that either.

1673
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
But I'm happy to see that, you know, for people that invested in the Vita, or will be investing in the Vita TV,

1674
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,000
and maybe that's why it's time to talk about it, they are showing, like, here's how we're going to support it.

1675
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Not a lot of exclusives.

1676
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I mean, there was a couple in there, but, you know, all right.

1677
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,000
At least as an alternative in portable gaming.

1678
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Well, for people that don't own a PlayStation or an Xbox, maybe you finally are checking out Final Fantasy XIII on the PC.

1679
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Or maybe you checked out Final Fantasy XIII on the PC with the assumption that, oh, it would run better, it would look better.

1680
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,000
And then we're shocked to find out that, oh, the graphics are locked down.

1681
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:51,000
You can play either in full screen 720p, or you can play in a window that is not going to take up the whole size of your desktop.

1682
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And many people were really pissed off with the limited graphic options in the game.

1683
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Well, some good news.

1684
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Square Enix has posted an announcement on their forums over on Steam saying,

1685
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
the Final Fantasy XIII team has been working hard to improve your experience on Steam.

1686
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:17,000
We're happy to announce that custom resolutions, 720p, 1080p, and graphic options will be added into the game from December 11th will be the date of that patch.

1687
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Except they've already been hacked into the game by other people, but now they're just doing it officially.

1688
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Now it's just official.

1689
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:30,000
And this is very interesting, because I can't think of many times in gaming's history where we've talked about now being patched into our game.

1690
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Graphic options.

1691
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
The graphics are literally being patched in after the fact.

1692
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
You don't hear that a lot these days.

1693
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
We're now giving the option to change the resolution.

1694
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
What's that?

1695
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
We're now giving the option to change the resolution.

1696
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it didn't handle full screen windowed like Final Fantasy XIV does.

1697
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
It's like there's other Square Enix games that'll do it.

1698
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
But it's because it's just an emulator or something.

1699
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:03,000
I think it's a fast and easy port is what they're doing, clearly.

1700
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
You don't say!

1701
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
A fast and easy port of a Final Fantasy game!

1702
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Like, I don't know, a Final Fantasy game that we might be heading towards the Playstation 4.

1703
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
You don't say that they do fast and easy ports of their Final Fantasy games.

1704
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
That's shocking to hear.

1705
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, Square Enix late to the party with PC standard settings.

1706
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Quote, sorry, here are the doors for your car.

1707
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,000
That's kind of what Final Fantasy XIII is missing right now on PC.

1708
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
It's kind of unfortunate.

1709
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I won't buy XIII II or Lightning Return.

1710
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:41,000
They are making literally the least amount of effort possible to do this stuff.

1711
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Well, you know what, though? It did finally bite him in the ass.

1712
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Because a lot of people complained about this in a lot of negative Steam reviews.

1713
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
They were really pressured to fix this shit.

1714
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I'm glad they're doing it.

1715
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I hope they're pressured to make a remake of Final Fantasy VII that's not a port of the old PC version.

1716
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:00,000
I can understand that a little more, though, because there's a difference there, Loki.

1717
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Because this XIII, we're saying, is admittedly a Playstation 3 emulator that Square's running their own internally.

1718
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
It may not literally be a Sony Playstation 3 emulator, but it's able to use the same code.

1719
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
It's a fast and lazy port, right?

1720
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
That's what they're doing over here.

1721
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,000
But to give you the Final Fantasy VII you want, that's not going to be a fast and lazy port.

1722
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
They're going to have to go back and redo all of the textures in the game.

1723
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
You know, it's different.

1724
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Well, I feel so bad for them then.

1725
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
As they're rolling around in their pools of money.

1726
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:38,000
If only we had 3D models of the Final Fantasy characters that were in high resolution.

1727
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
You know, something that might be considered movie quality.

1728
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:48,000
If only we had made a movie with Final Fantasy VII characters in several locations that were featured in Final Fantasy VII.

1729
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Hmm. That would be very convenient for us to make a game out of.

1730
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Or perhaps we use similar models to, I don't know, make some Vita games.

1731
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Or not Vita games, Playstation Portable games.

1732
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
You know.

1733
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Or maybe everybody just moves the fuck on and lets Final Fantasy VII go.

1734
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Because it was okay to start with.

1735
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
But it wasn't that great.

1736
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
We don't listen to Dan for a reason.

1737
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You know it wasn't that great.

1738
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
It was that great.

1739
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Oh yeah, you loved Eris. I remember that. That was like one of your favorite characters ever, right?

1740
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I'm going to stab that bitch in the face again.

1741
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Alright.

1742
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
In the face.

1743
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
You know, Jaime, I think you need to let it go.

1744
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Let it go, let it go.

1745
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
That's what I was saying.

1746
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
You know, it didn't make the show roll tonight.

1747
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:44,000
But they did register, was it, they have the rating or whatever in Europe for the Sing Star or Frozen.

1748
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:47,000
That did make it into the show roll and that was my story.

1749
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

1750
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I was helping Jaime out there with a transition, Loki.

1751
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
God dammit.

1752
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Read the show roll.

1753
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Nah, I don't want to.

1754
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Alright, well I don't need to talk about it then. Oh well.

1755
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Sing Star or Frozen. There we go.

1756
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Don't throw a fit. What else? There's got to be more to it than that.

1757
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
It just has a rating out for it.

1758
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
It says it's going to be published by Sony on the PS3.

1759
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
And that it's going to have all the songs from Frozen in it.

1760
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:19,000
And basically they confirmed that yes, it's going to be out and a complete PS4 version as well.

1761
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
But they don't have any other information on it.

1762
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
It's not out yet and I already hate it.

1763
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Frozen is getting as annoying as Final Fantasy 7. It's just taken 17 less years to do it.

1764
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
But that's okay though. They're going to make as many sequels as Final Fantasy 7 received for Frozen as well.

1765
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Yeah, they already are working on the sequel.

1766
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Frozen 2. Re-frozen.

1767
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
It's not just the whole...

1768
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
She won't let it go.

1769
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Like, did you hear about Disneyland? They're finally getting rid of the Mad Tea Party.

1770
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Which, you know, good riddance.

1771
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
But they're not bringing it back for, or they're not doing it to bring back Electronica.

1772
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
They're going to do a Frozen party.

1773
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:59,000
They're turning the Muppet 3D theater into a Frozen sing-a-long theater.

1774
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
And there's all this like, it's like, okay...

1775
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Oh, you mean the dance thing?

1776
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I thought you were talking about the teacups. I was like, fuck you!

1777
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
No, no, no, no, no. The dance thing.

1778
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
No, no, it's just like, enough! Enough! Frozen!

1779
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:16,000
What about Brave? What about Big Hero 6? What about any other movie you've released?

1780
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Have you seen the licensing for Frozen?

1781
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Yeah, no, they ain't getting rid of that shit any time soon.

1782
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Or why are you making like, a Toy Story 4, when you could be making an Incredibles 2?

1783
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I mean, seriously.

1784
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
They are making an Incredibles 2.

1785
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
I know, but it's not coming quick enough!

1786
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Instead, I get another Toy Story, which I don't fucking want to see another Toy Story.

1787
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Toy Story's awesome! What the fuck is your problem?

1788
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
This is what surprises me, though, about this whole thing.

1789
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
SingStar is that, you know, Sony, Siri...

1790
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Wait, Disney has their own game development thing.

1791
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Why did they license it over to Sony?

1792
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Because they don't want to do it anymore.

1793
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
They don't want to do their own...

1794
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Disney didn't have a game development thing anymore.

1795
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
They sort of do, but they don't want to deal with it anymore.

1796
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
I can't remember, I'm thinking maybe LucasArts here, that they only want to do licensing now, but...

1797
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I was like, somebody's making...

1798
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,000
And that's good, because...

1799
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:07,000
But I don't think Disney's SingIt did really well for them, so they probably don't want to continue on it.

1800
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:12,000
That they'd rather just, once again, license out the stuff to someone else that wants to do it, and just get paid the...

1801
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
So, if it bombs, who cares? We got our licensing fee, so whatever.

1802
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:22,000
And Disney does have something, because, yeah, there's that Star Wars iPhone game that Disney made that's doing very well, and Disney Infinity.

1803
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:29,000
But I think there was one branch of Disney, the studio that made Split Second and so forth, I think that is what you're thinking of.

1804
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
But Disney's real big.

1805
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Black Rock Studios, I think, remember?

1806
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yeah.

1807
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,000
They brought out a bunch of developers and closed them and dismantled them and ruined them.

1808
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
I didn't know Disney was still in the games business. At least I was hoping they weren't.

1809
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
They're in the Disney Infinity business.

1810
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
And then, of course, iPhone and Android is a good fit for the Disney stuff.

1811
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
But, yeah.

1812
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
SingStar, though, I don't know if you've checked it out, but now you don't need microphones to play SingStar anymore.

1813
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I don't know if you know that. It's free on PlayStation 4, I think.

1814
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
That's just called singing.

1815
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Yeah, you don't need a microphone anymore, because you download an app to your smartphone.

1816
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
And through the network, the smartphone sends the scoring over to the device.

1817
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:17,000
It actually works out stupid well. I've actually downloaded it and sang some songs.

1818
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
And, of course, it was ABBA.

1819
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:28,000
No, because, okay, rant time. You can't import the stuff that you have on disc onto the PlayStation 4 versions.

1820
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
So my SingStar Queen and SingStar ABBA are worthless.

1821
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:38,000
But the other stuff that I downloaded, I don't know who did it, but I somehow have three Britney Spears songs

1822
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
and two Spice Girls songs on my SingStar library.

1823
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
So I was able to download those to my PlayStation 4.

1824
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Well, that list of suspects is pretty short.

1825
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:51,000
And via my cell phone, you know, it was your wife that made me download Whitney Houston songs, by the way.

1826
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Well, don't give in to her demands.

1827
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
So I can sing into my phone,

1828
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
The greatest love

1829
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Yeah, I can sing into my phone.

1830
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
And he was holding the phone up to his face when he did that.

1831
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
That's right, because that's how it works.

1832
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
And then it scores me, and I fail.

1833
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Never get trophies, and then rage quit the game.

1834
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Well, you can also play Just Dance for free that way, too.

1835
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Yeah.

1836
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
But why would you?

1837
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Why would you?

1838
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Yeah, to your point, it is just singing.

1839
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:24,000
It's like on these cable and satellite networks they have,

1840
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:29,000
Hey, we have hundreds of channels that are garbage, but some of them are karaoke.

1841
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
And you can pull up karaoke songs on demand and sing to them.

1842
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
For free.

1843
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Let's move on with some more news, Loki.

1844
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Alright, so PlayStation 20th anniversary.

1845
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:52,000
So now it's time to release a slightly different color, PlayStation 4, and charge more for it than we could for any other color.

1846
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:59,000
That's right, the 20th anniversary PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Grey, or whatever the hell they're going to call it.

1847
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,000
They're making 12,300 of these because it's such a random number.

1848
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:11,000
And you can buy one for $500 pre-orders now, and it includes also a grey camera and DualShock 4.

1849
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,000
But you're paying $500 for a system that's actually $400, so you're an idiot.

1850
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Here's the deal. I would actually buy that if, when you start it up, it makes the PS1 noise.

1851
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
That would be pretty awesome.

1852
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
That would be fucking amazing.

1853
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Well, there's that theme.

1854
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Don't well me. I'll kill you.

1855
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
PlayStation 4, well, Dan.

1856
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Well, Dan. Dan, food.

1857
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Actually, for the last two weeks, it's been like, Dan, computer. Dan, computer.

1858
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Dan, PlayStation.

1859
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:50,000
And on the PlayStation 4, they have that free theme, the PS1 classic theme, and it does play the classic boot up.

1860
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
So when you turn it on, it does that. See, that would be just about worth it.

1861
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
There you go. You saved yourself $500.

1862
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I don't have a PlayStation 4.

1863
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Well, that's $100.

1864
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
You can download that to any PlayStation 4.

1865
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:04,000
So far, I've saved myself $400.

1866
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Yeah, but wait a minute, because Jamie's got a new laptop, so you didn't save that much money.

1867
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Discount.

1868
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Oh, and here's a quick update in case you were interested in purchasing one.

1869
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
It's sold out.

1870
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
It's sold out.

1871
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
It's sold out in like two seconds.

1872
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Mel got one.

1873
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Two seconds or 12 hours.

1874
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
It took that long.

1875
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:27,000
And it has like the little, it has the original logo on it too.

1876
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
It does.

1877
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So people were having issues, like their servers were crapping out.

1878
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I don't doubt that people are going to scalp these, but whatever.

1879
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I don't remember.

1880
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,000
You're, I don't know.

1881
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,000
They should have acquired your gamertag or something to at least filter some of these people that scalp.

1882
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
They should not make them limited.

1883
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
That's a great idea too.

1884
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Just sell as many as people are going to buy.

1885
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
That's a great idea.

1886
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
What, are you allergic to money or something?

1887
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Especially if you consider that if all the sales stuff we're hearing out of black Friday's to be believed,

1888
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Xbox one's outselling PlayStation this holiday.

1889
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
And it should include a copy of Ridge Racer.

1890
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Ridge Racer.

1891
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I'm telling you, they put out a decent Ridge Racer game on PlayStation four.

1892
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I'd buy it.

1893
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
They could have thrown in like Vib ribbon.

1894
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Like I'm trying to think of the PS one stuff they've actually put on PS four right now.

1895
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Oh no.

1896
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
That's supposed to be on PS four, but not yet.

1897
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
I don't know.

1898
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I guess they don't have PS one games playable on PlayStation four.

1899
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Delicious irony.

1900
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Delicious irony.

1901
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I can play them on my PlayStation three.

1902
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
They still don't have that PlayStation one technology emulating on the PlayStation for you.

1903
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Crazy stuff.

1904
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
All right.

1905
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Well, here's something you'll be able to play on your PlayStation four, whether it be 20th anniversary or not.

1906
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Eventually it's Kingdom Hearts.

1907
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Is that Mickey Mouse holding a lightsaber?

1908
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:50,000
It is Mickey Mouse holding a lightsaber in this little picture, but that's not, that is not a.

1909
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I want to say that's probably Disney infinity, so don't go crazy now.

1910
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
It probably is.

1911
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Cause if you unlock, if you unlock all the characters or I'm sorry, purchase all the characters, then you get a lightsaber.

1912
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Yeah.

1913
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Anyway, that's all of the money.

1914
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
This is about Kingdom Hearts three.

1915
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:15,000
And here we go again with some wank going around that Kingdom Hearts three will be including star Wars and Marvel characters.

1916
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,000
This is because of some statements that was made by the co-director of the game.

1917
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Tai Yasue who said, quote, yeah, I can't go into specifics, but there's a lot of new Disney stuff and we have our plates full.

1918
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
There's a lot to consider.

1919
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
We're looking at all of Disney, the new ones as well.

1920
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
They have a lot of pull and drop.

1921
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:38,000
It's like, I can't go into details, but motherfucking star Wars and captain America are going to be in this shit.

1922
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1923
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
That means fucking frozen.

1924
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
There's going to be fucking frozen in Kingdom Hearts three.

1925
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
That's what it means.

1926
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Sorry to burst your bubble people, but frozen yet again, we'll be coming to Kingdom Hearts three.

1927
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I don't really have a problem with that.

1928
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Because I want to see Sora run around in Lederhosen.

1929
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,000
So are we going to have like the gummy ship taking on TIE fighters and shit like that?

1930
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Because that would actually be excellent.

1931
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
No, because that's what people want.

1932
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Oh yeah.

1933
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
So is there going to be a lazy port of a PC version that they're going to do for this?

1934
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
No, no.

1935
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
That'll be the final fantasy level.

1936
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I think Kingdom Hearts three will be pretty awesome, but see, he didn't say anything about Marvel and all that stuff.

1937
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I think that meant frozen.

1938
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
That's what I take it to mean is that it's like frozen and maybe the Pixar stuff.

1939
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
I think the Pixar stuff would be awesome.

1940
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Wally.

1941
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Why not?

1942
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
But you're not even the main character.

1943
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
The main character is Sora.

1944
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Toy story or the incredible-

1945
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
That was last week.

1946
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Just up.

1947
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
It'll be just a world where you cry for 30 minutes through the whole thing.

1948
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
It'll be great.

1949
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
So there you go.

1950
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
More wank about Marvel and Star Wars.

1951
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
More wank dies and everyone's depressed.

1952
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Don't get me wrong.

1953
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:53,000
I would love that if it would come out to the PlayStation four in Kingdom Hearts three.

1954
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I just don't really see that happening.

1955
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:55,000
That's all.

1956
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,000
All right.

1957
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Let us go to our next segment, which I believe is the mailbag.

1958
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:07,000
And every week Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag and dives in head first and tries not to drown in there with all the emails.

1959
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
But she's going to pick out a few emails that she believes are worthy of reading on air tonight.

1960
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
If you want to send us an email, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do that.

1961
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Dark Sakura, what is awaiting us in the mailbag tonight?

1962
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:20,000
My first email comes from Robert M.

1963
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
And it says Minecraft VoG server.

1964
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,000
I admit I'm entirely guilty of being inactive on the server.

1965
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
But I hope one factor doesn't enter into the decision to close it.

1966
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:40,000
When 1.8 launched, all one got when seeing the VoG server on their list was a big red X and alert that the version of craft bucket being used is no longer compatible.

1967
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Hence the most recent inactivity.

1968
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Of course, the cost of updating everything to chase the game's updates isn't worth it for the rest of the population you have been getting.

1969
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I fully respect the decision.

1970
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I just wish there had been a survival server.

1971
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Fun fact.

1972
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:59,000
All Minecraft mobs, including villagers, are basically gender neutral.

1973
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Also, mushrooms.

1974
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
I just feel like I'm wasting my time.

1975
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Don't inherit the job.

1976
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:39,000
No, it's just I want it to be on another server.

1977
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:44,000
They have, for example, I think it's PC Gamer or something like that.

1978
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
They have their entire website has a server.

1979
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
And there's a ton of people on there because there's a ton of people to go there.

1980
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And it's a lot easier to, you're always going to have people online.

1981
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Whereas ours, we had quite a few people on the list to get in, but you'd be lucky to see somebody playing for a few hours.

1982
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
It just wasn't as hard to coordinate stuff.

1983
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
Minecraft's one of those games that I kind of gravitate to when there's not a lot of other big stuff going on right now.

1984
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
So now is just not the time of year for Minecraft because there's so much other games out right now.

1985
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Minecraft's that thing I'll visit in March when I'm like, oh, I've kind of finished these other games.

1986
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
And oh, remember Minecraft? That's fun.

1987
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
So that's just me anyway.

1988
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Next email.

1989
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Next email.

1990
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Howdy peoples.

1991
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
It starts off with a link about Winnie the Pooh being banned from Polish playgrounds.

1992
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Your discussion from last week about gender identity of Toad and Toadette reminded me of a story that broke recently about a Polish city council discussing Winnie the Pooh.

1993
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:58,000
This is the discussion that reflected the city council's fundamental misunderstanding of the characters being discussed as well as the nature of and definitions of hermaphroditism and homosexuality.

1994
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I'm wondering if the people who think negatively about gender expression in Mario games don't suffer from the same fundamental misunderstanding.

1995
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:16,000
I think that we can all agree that if you are thinking deeply about the sexuality and gender expression of characters in children's programming, that you need to rethink your priorities.

1996
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Also conservative...

1997
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Well, but...

1998
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Have you even been on the internet?

1999
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
But talking about Bert and Ernie being gay is okay, right?

2000
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Yeah, because they're totally.

2001
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Also, conservatives need to do their fucking research before they talk about shit.

2002
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Stay black. Retertainment.

2003
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:34,000
This message has been brought to you by Pixel Shits 2, projectiles of exercise impediment.

2004
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Trainer.

2005
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Did he say to stay black?

2006
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Yes.

2007
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I actually like that guy's email now, but before I thought it was totally lame.

2008
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:47,000
People will come on every week and say that ever since you did that on the show, Dan.

2009
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I have been the trendsetter.

2010
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
You're supposed to say it to Ranma.

2011
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:00,000
So, yeah, I think some people are way overthinking, especially when it comes to the children's books and stuff.

2012
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
It's just... I don't know.

2013
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Take it away, gay!

2014
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Yeah.

2015
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:12,000
The nice thing is that kids don't have that problem. Parents have that problem.

2016
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
That's right.

2017
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Adults overthink shit.

2018
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
And parents pass it on to their kids.

2019
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
And they don't just let it go.

2020
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Let it go. Let it go.

2021
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
It just doesn't go away.

2022
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I'm coming to Kingdom Hearts 3 with Sora and Goofy.

2023
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
That was good.

2024
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Thank you.

2025
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Did you practice that all night?

2026
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Yes, I did.

2027
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Good job.

2028
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:19,000
I think most would agree the classic example of this would be NES's Super Mario Bros., the popularized side-scrolling, or PS1's...

2029
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
But didn't invent it.

2030
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Final Fantasy VII and the lavish production quality standards that most RPGs attempted to replicate in its wake.

2031
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
But is shallow and lame.

2032
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,000
In Dan's opinion.

2033
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:38,000
It is. It wasn't even the deepest Final Fantasy game when it came out.

2034
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Here we go.

2035
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,000
That's just the question. And Dan doesn't get to answer.

2036
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Yes, you do.

2037
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
The defining game of the generation.

2038
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I feel like we tackled this question on a previous episode and had a real in-depth conversation on it.

2039
02:06:51,000 --> 02:07:01,000
And I want to say, and Dark Tetsuya knows this show better than I do, it was either the week before the Wii U launched or the week before the PlayStation 4 launched.

2040
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
We did a show.

2041
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Did we do a list list about it?

2042
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I think so.

2043
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:13,000
So you might want to go back in the archives because I feel like we had a discussion about the past generation of games as we were transitioning from one generation to the other.

2044
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:18,000
But to humor the question because it is a good question and opinions can also change.

2045
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I haven't sampled necessarily as many games from the last generation a year ago as I have now.

2046
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:31,000
But I would still say, and this is probably what I would have said on the other show, the defining game of the last generation, absolutely in my opinion, was Wii Sports.

2047
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Wii Sports is the defining game of the generation.

2048
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
And for a multitude of reasons.

2049
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Not just because of what it did for the Wii and the fact that the Wii was the number one system in sales of the last generation solely on the back of Wii Sports.

2050
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Really.

2051
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:51,000
But the fact that it brought motion control into what we see now in games.

2052
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Although it's kind of turned into this rock band, guitar hero oversaturation.

2053
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Now it's only dance games that seem to really use it and so forth.

2054
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
It led to the Wii condom.

2055
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Right. Yeah, yeah. The breaking of the TVs.

2056
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:12,000
But it also got, and this is very important, there's more than just the motion control why I say Wii Sports.

2057
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
It got a lot more people playing games that weren't playing games already.

2058
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Which is, you know, when we talk about the Wiis being in retirement homes and things like that.

2059
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:29,000
That's a theme that's carried on into this generation as we talk about now mobile gaming, Candy Crush, Farmville, yada yada.

2060
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,000
There's that.

2061
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
And also the simplicity of Wii Sports.

2062
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
This is building on something Loki said earlier.

2063
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:43,000
If you have a basic concept, that's really all you need to have a really awesome game.

2064
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,000
And Wii Sports really feels like something that could have been done by an indie developer.

2065
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
It really does.

2066
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:54,000
So I think for all those reasons, Wii Sports was the defining game of last generation.

2067
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
But that's my opinion.

2068
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Loki, I don't know if you have an opinion.

2069
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Grand Theft Auto IV.

2070
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Grand Theft Auto IV is awesome.

2071
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Was it the defining game of the last generation?

2072
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Last generation? I'd say the last generation of the defining game would have been Grand Theft Auto V.

2073
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
But that was just Grand Theft Auto.

2074
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
It was awesome!

2075
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
It is awesome, but it's Grand Theft Auto with better graphics.

2076
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Grand Theft Auto IV is pretty good.

2077
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I don't know, as far as games that really kind of did something different.

2078
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Yeah, I guess Wii Sports would be pretty good.

2079
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:35,000
The whole Wii in general was pretty good just because it was completely different at the time of everything that had been out there.

2080
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
You play with controllers, now we're going to do motion controls.

2081
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:42,000
And it kind of worked, as opposed to the iToy or something like that.

2082
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
That didn't really work too well.

2083
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
So I think it was neat.

2084
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,000
Too bad that people at retirement homes don't buy games.

2085
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:56,000
And people that bought the system unfortunately don't buy a lot of games either.

2086
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
And so that's where they lost the support.

2087
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:04,000
It was an underpowered system that they didn't want to embrace HD in a time where HD was becoming popular.

2088
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,000
If only they'd put a supermarket sweep game on the Wii.

2089
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:14,000
If only they had a system that was as powerful as the Xbox 360 that had motion controls at that time.

2090
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
But now we have the Wii U and that's that.

2091
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
But now our systems are even more powerful and they're stuck in the same fucking situation again.

2092
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Dan, I'm sure this is a thought that keeps you up late at night. What would you say is the defining game of the last generation?

2093
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Five bucks, Jamie was going to say Mass Effect.

2094
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
I was going to say Mass Effect 3 for one thing.

2095
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:35,000
No, I actually have a reason not just because of the game, it's because of the shit that went on around the game.

2096
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:51,000
About having the fans speak up and voice their disappointment to such a degree that the company would bend over backwards and make DLC that would fix those problems in their point of view.

2097
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:57,000
And then throw out the total, oh by the way here fandom, here's a cookie for the Citadel DLC.

2098
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:04,000
I think that it was the first situation where they really, really took to heart what people were saying.

2099
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Dan, to be fair, I think she makes a damn good point.

2100
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Oh no, I just knew that she would say Mass Effect.

2101
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
But I think her rationale makes sense because...

2102
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Oh absolutely, I wasn't saying it's not rational. Mine is kind of similar.

2103
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
If the internet had existed when Final Fantasy 7 came out, they would have had to change the ending there too.

2104
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Maybe, I don't know.

2105
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Alright, anyway.

2106
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
And Square would have been like, fuck the internet! Moving on.

2107
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:29,000
They still do say that.

2108
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
What, you guys want Final Fantasy 7 again? No, we don't want money.

2109
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I would say, strangely enough, I'd say Call of Duty 4. The first Modern Warfare.

2110
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Which you think, oh it's just another FPS, it just had better graphics, which is true, but it essentially redefined every FPS that came after and made FPSs the dominant genre for the rest of the generation and carrying over into this generation. It's almost ridiculous.

2111
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Well, have you guys seen, they've just put this out for Dragon Age Inquisition, the cinematic tools.

2112
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Which had come based on the Call of Duty cinematic tools where people are actually doing whole machinima movies using Call of Duty and its engine.

2113
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:17,000
All the later ones because of the scope of the levels and all of the hidden things and just how well developed they are.

2114
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Rageinator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the Wii didn't need a supermarket sweep game, the Wii needed a Matlock vs Golden Girls fighting game. With fatalities.

2115
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Matlock would have kicked ass in that.

2116
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Matlock would have kicked ass.

2117
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Oh no, Sofia's pretty mean.

2118
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Robert M. in chat says, what was one of the first popular indie titles? Minecraft. And you could make a case that Minecraft was a defining game.

2119
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:51,000
So what you're essentially saying is that you're looking for a TV Land, Injustice, Gods Among Us type of game. TV Land, Gods Among Us.

2120
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:57,000
They move around in the car 54 where are you car and listen to the monkeys play the background.

2121
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Dibs on the maid from the Jeffersons.

2122
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Lawrence.

2123
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Lawrence was awesome. She epitomized sassy black lady.

2124
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Archie Bunker yo!

2125
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
So there's more to the email.

2126
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Wait real quick, real quick. Robert M. says, I'd say to answer my own persistent question, probably Braid and or Cave Story.

2127
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Act F says, Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

2128
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:20,000
So the rest of the email?

2129
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Yes.

2130
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:33,000
With that said, my pick is Demon Souls for PS3. The fact that you can lose all your progress by dying twice in a row and not reaching your blood stain was a revelation to me and made every single encounter in the game an intense fight for survival.

2131
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Also the obscure take on multiplayer and PvP was something I'd never seen before.

2132
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:43,000
This game may not have been the peak of the series, but it was a solid foundation that created the framework for each game to follow.

2133
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 and the upcoming Bloodborne.

2134
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:52,000
It's a game I'll always look back fondly on and one I compare most action adventure RPGs to now.

2135
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Your turn go. We already went haha.

2136
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:05,000
So for those of us, by the way, who remember life before checkpoints and safe states and all that, remember when dying in any game three times in a row meant you lost all your progress?

2137
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Yeah. Yeah. Right? Like Battletoads?

2138
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Any game. Oh, and I'm starting from the beginning.

2139
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Ghouls and ghosts? Yeah.

2140
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Anyway.

2141
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
The source of many, many profane statements.

2142
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Golden9007.

2143
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:27,000
PS, I've been listening to you guys for over nine years and have loved every minute. Keep up the good work and happy holidays. That comes from Tonic Vision.

2144
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Wow.

2145
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Thank you, Tonic Vision.

2146
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
That's amazing. Nine years. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Dance.

2147
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I haven't even been wanting to do the show that long.

2148
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Wait, somebody's been listening to this show for nine years. Can you believe it?

2149
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Morons.

2150
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
I mean, hi.

2151
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I'm going to set you on fire.

2152
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
PUNNING!

2153
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Alan Android in our chat says Gary's Mod or Journey?

2154
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Like Journey Escape? That was on 2600.

2155
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
No, no, no, no. Journey, the adventure, you know, PlayStation 3.

2156
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I think that game came a little late to really define the generation. I think we have yet to see what that's going to really inspire moving forward.

2157
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I think Journey just threw it all for a loop.

2158
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
I think in a way. So anyway.

2159
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I do agree with Gary's Mod.

2160
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Good email. Even if I did say, I think we had this discussion before, we probably didn't have Dan there. So now Dan's.

2161
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Probably not.

2162
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Alright.

2163
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Last email.

2164
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle series turtle.

2165
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I'll start out by saying that I firmly believe in voting with my wallet.

2166
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:40,000
And in the spirit of that belief, I almost never buy PC games day one, mostly because of the recent acceptance of publishers releasing broken games that they plan to patch later.

2167
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Now why would I want to play through half a game with lots of bugs before it gets patched?

2168
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I want my experience to be as enjoyable as it can be.

2169
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,000
And don't get me started on early access, AKA, pay the beta test.

2170
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Let's take Far Cry 4 as an example. I planned on buying that game immediately upon release.

2171
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:09,000
But a week before, Ubisoft released bonked Assassin's Creed to the populace and now I don't want to support them at full price.

2172
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I have no problem waiting three to six months for all the patches and a Steam sale.

2173
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:24,000
So my question, if enough PC gamers waited on the games to be patched and bought them on sale later on, would some game companies reconsider building games for the PC platform?

2174
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I want to send a message, but I also don't want the developers to negatively retaliate to said message.

2175
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
I just want a working game. I look forward to your thoughts.

2176
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
As always, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

2177
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:48,000
I agree with the concept of being able to vote with your wallet and kind of rejecting a lot of these broken games.

2178
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I mean, I literally just reported five stories ago on a game that was released on PC that's broken and they're having to patch in graphics.

2179
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:08,000
And that's, you know, that's not okay. And I think we do have to sometimes resist that gut reaction to buy things until we know that they're working because clearly that expectation is no longer there.

2180
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
The games have to actually be working in order to be sold.

2181
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Maybe Nintendo was onto something way back in the 80s when they used to have that seal of quality. Remember that? The Nintendo seal of quality?

2182
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Not that it necessarily made the games good to carry the Nintendo seal of quality, but at least you know they weren't super fucking broken.

2183
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Maybe a little broken, but not super fucking broken. Do we need some type of seal of quality standard back in the industry?

2184
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Do we need a Steam quality badge or a GOG badge? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just throwing ideas out there.

2185
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:57,000
This is not a new problem. Even before the easy patches and the broadband internet and all that, in the 90s, in the 80s, you can go out and buy a game from your PC and you can go through the install process and it was going to be broken.

2186
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:16,000
It was much, much more unusual on consoles because consoles were managed not just by the publisher, but they were managed by, like, to get a game to go through Nintendo, you had to submit it to Nintendo and they'd send it back and they'd submit it to Nintendo again and they'd send it back and submit it to Nintendo again before they finally said...

2187
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
And you had to submit to Nintendo on your knees. You can only do three games a year.

2188
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:26,000
And then they would do it, you know, and Sony was the same way on the PlayStation and Microsoft's the same way on the Xbox. Nobody does that on the PC.

2189
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Now you've got a question of games being so big budget and patches being so easy to put out there that, you know, Assassin's Creed is, I think, kind of the watershed of the issue because it's a huge title at this point in time.

2190
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
It was hugely anticipated.

2191
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Huge fan base.

2192
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:57,000
There were tons and tons of people who had already kind of been up in arms about it because the developers were all, uh, yeah, we can't put female models in it, so just deal and everyone was already pissed.

2193
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:06,000
And then they booted the launch, which at least shows us that they were fucking serious about not being able to put their female models in because they could barely put their male models in.

2194
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:19,000
But yeah, it just ended up being, I think that it's going to be finally kind of the breaking point where hopefully, like you were saying, vote with your wallet. Tell Ubisoft to eat a dick.

2195
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Don't give them your next game at full price. Let them figure it out. And if they lose the revenue, they'll get more serious. I agree.

2196
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Don't buy games until you're satisfied that they're going to be good. And when they lose their revenue, then they'll be like, oh, maybe we should be a little more conservative with that release date.

2197
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:49,000
And I'm definitely understanding of glitches that are kind of not necessarily something that you'd normally run into, but like when the whole face is missing off of somebody and it's like, come on, you should have seen that testing.

2198
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Yeah. Well, and then it's like, you know, and Assassin's Creed has a lot of very devoted, very hardcore fans. There's a lot of people who are going to give that series money by default.

2199
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:13,000
It's like the people, okay, the people who went and saw Star Wars Episode One because it was Star Wars and you have to go see it and then Jar Jar Binks comes on screen and your childhood is being ruined right in front of your eyes.

2200
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Why Lucas? Why, why, why? Assassin's Creed was the episode, Assassin's Creed Unity is the Episode One of the series in some ways.

2201
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
You know what the coolest thing about Episode One was?

2202
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
The pod race.

2203
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:32,000
No. The lightsaber battle that happened in the parking lot waiting for the movie.

2204
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:36,000
The fact that Greg Proops is one of the commentators during the pod race is the coolest part of Episode One.

2205
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I love Greg Proops.

2206
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,000
But yeah, no, I do think that this is going to hopefully make a fundamental change.

2207
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Yeah.

2208
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Especially, at least to Ubisoft at exactly what releasing an unfinished game is going to get you.

2209
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Who are they going to pick on? Last year it was EA over the whole Mass Effect.

2210
02:20:54,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Look at EA though. I mean, perfect example of how someone that's kind of, or a company that's sort of learned from their mistakes, you know, with Battlefield 4 and that mess that was there online.

2211
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:09,000
You know, and now they've kind of taken things a little bit different. They gave Dragon Age Inquisition more time and that turned out great.

2212
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,000
And now they're giving Battlefield Hardline more time and we'll see.

2213
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Right, and so it seems like EA is making the adjustments.

2214
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:23,000
EA's problem though, almost more than just like we're releasing a ridiculously broken program, is literally always their DRM.

2215
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I think we need a list list here at some point for 2015 because, you know, like we said, EA usually has, or EA was fucking up a couple years ago.

2216
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Ubisoft's been fucking up this year. I think we need to do the 2015, the 2015 prediction, big video game company fuck up that we predict for 2015.

2217
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Activision.

2218
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Yeah, but not just necessarily the company, but what will the fuck up be?

2219
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:48,000
No, no, I'm with him. Activision.

2220
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Well, that's a very logical conclusion.

2221
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:52,000
It's sort of a verb and a noun.

2222
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Activision.

2223
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
What's going to be fucked up in 2015?

2224
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Activision. How are they going to do it? Activision. Booyah.

2225
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:05,000
I would like to get into a little more of like the how. How is it going to fuck up?

2226
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Activision.

2227
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
What?

2228
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
They're going to do something with Call of Duty. I don't know.

2229
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:18,000
I liked Advanced Warfare somewhat. I mean, it's just, I think that it's starting to trend downwards.

2230
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I mean, Ghost, no one really liked. Advanced Warfare is a little bit better, I think, than Ghost.

2231
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
But next year, I don't know.

2232
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:30,000
I'm going to put it out there. We'll do the listless officially at some point. We don't have time for it tonight.

2233
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
But I'm going to go out on a limb and say Sony is going to make the big fuck up next.

2234
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I think Activision is too easy. Sony's coming off a couple really, really good years.

2235
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:44,000
They've had some really good years. I think it's time for a really good fuck up.

2236
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Well, Sony, the Sony Pictures division, even though it's separate from the game side, that's going through a pretty big fuck up right now.

2237
02:22:52,000 --> 02:23:00,000
No. EA's fourth quarter, we're due for, I think, was it Titanfall 2 maybe? Maybe we'll see that.

2238
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:06,000
You know, Sony really only fucked up once. It was a big fuck up with the PlayStation 3.

2239
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Kind of that whole generation if they just deleted it. But the PlayStation 1 was a giant hit. The PlayStation 2 was the giantest of hits.

2240
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,000
PlayStation 3 was even successful if you gave it, what, 10 years.

2241
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:24,000
You're forgetting about another, Sony had more than one fuck up. They've had plenty more than one because you're forgetting about the Sony hack that happened on PlayStation.

2242
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Well, that's part of the PlayStation 3. That's part of the PlayStation 3. Like the whole PlayStation 3.

2243
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
The PSP Go was a fuck up.

2244
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,000
PSP Go was a fuck up. But I'm just saying, Sony's only, but PSP Go was a small fuck up.

2245
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
There are some people...

2246
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Because it was, you know, portable.

2247
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:46,000
There are some people that still stand for the PSP Go. Like I do have a couple friends that are like, the PSP Go's not that bad, it was just ahead of its time.

2248
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,000
It was really easy to steal games for.

2249
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
The Xperia Play.

2250
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Anyway, alright.

2251
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Well that was no.

2252
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Oh my god, Raginator actually has a pretty good idea. Like sometimes Raginator's jokes aren't funny, but this one actually kind of is.

2253
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Raginator says, OLR should hold its own annual award show and make one category the biggest fuck up of the year.

2254
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I love it.

2255
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:10,000
The Fuck Up Awards.

2256
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Winner!

2257
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
No, no, no. One category. You don't have to have the whole thing based on something.

2258
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
No, you need to have a whole thing based on something.

2259
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Here's the problem. We gotta walk a fine line. Because I don't want to be that show that's just, the gamers hate everything.

2260
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:33,000
The jaded, I hate everything, cynical gamer stuff. Like I kind of think if that's your angle, then you shouldn't be doing a show on games in the first place.

2261
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I'm sorry if that's going to be a shots fired comment for some of you, but if you carry your back on the fact that you're a cynical gamer, then get a new fucking hobby.

2262
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Why are you looking at me, Rob?

2263
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I'm not just looking in that direction.

2264
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
I'm not cynical. Jaded. Fair.

2265
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:57,000
At the end of the day, no matter what negative thing we say here on OLR, we talk about fuck ups and all that stuff. I love video games. We all love video games here at OLR, even on their worst days.

2266
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:07,000
So my thing is that if we're going to do an award show based around fuck ups or whatever, I still want the overall message to be, we do love video games though, but goddamn, stop fucking up.

2267
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Should be like the Orange Lounge Radio listless. Have the whole thing, all the categories be done in that manner and then have everybody vote on them.

2268
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Maybe. We'll have to think that one through a little more. We'll talk to our people.

2269
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Did I miss the joke that listless is like listless? Is that intentional?

2270
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Yes, totally.

2271
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Listless carries over. It's the one segment that has persisted since my college radio show.

2272
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
How come I never heard that term mentioned before today?

2273
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
I don't know.

2274
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
God damn.

2275
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
This is how old that segment is.

2276
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,000
I need to quit sniffing glue.

2277
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Dan, you ready for this? This is how old that segment is. My ex-girlfriend named it.

2278
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Damn.

2279
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
On that note, I think we're all done with emails, right, Jamie?

2280
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Oh yeah, we're done.

2281
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Gorgeous.

2282
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:00,000
I don't care if we're done. We're fucking done.

2283
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:02,000
We are so done.

2284
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I can't even.

2285
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,000
So let's then, clearly, if we are unable to even anymore.

2286
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
I so cannot.

2287
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
The even awards, because some days we just can't even.

2288
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
All right, it is time for the FUs of the week.

2289
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Here is punishment.

2290
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
This is fucked up.

2291
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:37,000
FU to randomly spraining or pulling my hip, whatever the crap I did to it.

2292
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Because I was a little sore earlier. Now I'm in a lot of pain.

2293
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
So FU to that.

2294
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Feel better.

2295
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Logie?

2296
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Um, I guess.

2297
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Um, I don't know. FU to my cat, maybe?

2298
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:00,000
She woke me up again early this morning. I hate her.

2299
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Well, just because of that.

2300
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
She's fine. Then she's also messing with the tree.

2301
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Trying to bat at it.

2302
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I thought you said Canada.

2303
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
No, I don't hate Canada. Canada's not knocking on my door early in the morning.

2304
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Don't live in the right neighborhood.

2305
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
I guess not.

2306
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
So, I don't know. That's all I've got. I'm not really mad.

2307
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
Let's see. My FU of the week.

2308
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Actually, things are pretty... FU to yard work.

2309
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Yard work sucks.

2310
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
And there's a reason I don't do it very often.

2311
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
But we finally decided, you know, there's a lot of leaves on the lawn.

2312
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
We should probably do something about that.

2313
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,000
So we did something about that the other day.

2314
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:42,000
And so FU to the fact that after I, you know, made my back sore, my legs sore during yard work.

2315
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:44,000
That today, lawn's covered in leaves again.

2316
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
That's why you have to wait until the leaves are on the ground.

2317
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Or until it floods and your neighbors are like,

2318
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Hey, you know, we should probably rake those leaves up.

2319
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Because it keeps blocking the gutters and the street flooded.

2320
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,000
And so that was my week.

2321
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
Yeah, right.

2322
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Or you just need to mow.

2323
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
I just told Alan, I said, can't we just mow them over with the lawn mower?

2324
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Can't we just get the lawn mower?

2325
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Nope, nope. I know that logic. I've tried it. It doesn't work.

2326
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,000
It just makes the leaves smaller and harder to pick up.

2327
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
So it's just... it's not...

2328
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Yeah, but once they're all mulched and chopped up...

2329
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Exactly. Leave them... Exactly.

2330
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Leave them there. It's going to make your lawn even better.

2331
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Because they're going to, you know, they're just going to rot away into a soil.

2332
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Your lawn needs it.

2333
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,000
No. They fucking stay there for a whole goddamn year and get covered with more leaves.

2334
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:21,000
It doesn't work. I've tried it. I've tried... I have a mulching mower.

2335
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
I went over them several times.

2336
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:25,000
That's the problem. You need to not have a mulching mower.

2337
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
You need a mower that just picks the shit up.

2338
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Dan, do you have any for you this week?

2339
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Uh, no. Everything is good.

2340
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I have nothing that I'm upset about.

2341
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Everything is awesome.

2342
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Everything is good.

2343
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Everything is good.

2344
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Everything is good.

2345
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Everything is awesome.

2346
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:45,000
You need to say F you to my hip.

2347
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
F you to Jamie's hip.

2348
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Alright.

2349
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Jamie is flipping me the bird.

2350
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
F you to Jamie's bird.

2351
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Um, I love this. Some people...

2352
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:57,000
But you love the cat.

2353
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
There's some people in the chat room trying to help us flesh out ideas for the OLR award show that we could do.

2354
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Act deft, suggesting the fuck up of a lifetime achievement award.

2355
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
That is a great idea.

2356
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I don't know if it has to be lifetime because there's always going to be bigger fuck ups.

2357
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
No, because I'm thinking...

2358
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:13,000
For like a fuck up icon type of award, like Jack Thompson should be the first inductee.

2359
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Like fuck up of a lifetime.

2360
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Engage.

2361
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:19,000
The Engage would be a great nomination.

2362
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Or maybe not necessarily Engage, but side talking.

2363
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:23,000
You know, I don't...

2364
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:25,000
That should be kind of a fuck up.

2365
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:27,000
No, no. You were right. The Engage.

2366
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Yeah, the Engage is a good fuck up of a lifetime.

2367
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
You know, the Engage was a misunderstood...

2368
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Not a good system, but a misunderstood system.

2369
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Now the Game.com, that was a fuck up of a lifetime.

2370
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I like where this is going. You guys are smart in your chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2371
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
And you don't hear that very often.

2372
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:48,000
No, I love our listeners. You stop.

2373
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Well, you can love them all you want.

2374
02:29:51,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Alright. Moving on. Loki, let's get some more news and then we'll take your calls pretty soon here at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

2375
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Okay, so there was this issue with Nintendo and Philips over, I guess, this patent for virtual body control device.

2376
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:16,000
And apparently they've resolved their dispute by signing a licensing agreement with Philips.

2377
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:23,000
And I guess per the agreement, Nintendo and Philips will cross license portions of each company's patent portfolio.

2378
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
This is a really old story, right?

2379
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:28,000
No. This is...

2380
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:29,000
It's about the CDI and like Mario Brothers.

2381
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:36,000
No, no, no. Stop. No. Yeah. I can see the whole reason they came down the agreement. It's like, really? You're going to sue us?

2382
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Look what you did to Mario and Zelda on the Philips CDI.

2383
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:45,000
But in good news, Philips will be making the Nintendo Wii U CD-ROM next year.

2384
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Anyways, so I guess, yeah, this was from back in 2011. They had a notice because of this patent, the virtual body control device.

2385
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:02,000
And then there was another one, user interface system based on pointing device.

2386
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,000
I love these very, very generic patents. That's fantastic.

2387
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:17,000
And apparently that second one was used for the Wii, Wii U and DS consoles and other most interesting tech and cameras.

2388
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:25,000
But, I don't know. Yeah, so yeah, really, they should be paying Nintendo for what the fuck they did to Zelda.

2389
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:30,000
So Philips is so far gone at this point, they're patent trolling? That's sad.

2390
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:34,000
They deserve it for what they did to Zelda, though.

2391
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:40,000
All right. Well, you know what? Speaking of money being thrown around aimlessly, this is crazy.

2392
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
So I think last week we probably talked about this. You know those little Amiibos?

2393
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Nintendo's new niche they're trying to get into are these little Amiibo.

2394
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:54,000
And there was a misprint or a mispressing of some of the Amiibo for Samus.

2395
02:31:55,000 --> 02:32:02,000
And there was a Samus floating around out there that had two arm cannons, which if you know Samus, she does not have two arm cannons. She has one.

2396
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:03,000
But that's awesome.

2397
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Yeah, it looks awesome, because that looks like Samus.

2398
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
It's awesome until she falls on the ground and she's like...

2399
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Tips over because the guns are too heavy and the Amiibo won't stand out.

2400
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:14,000
But Samus doesn't have that problem, she'll just turn into a ball.

2401
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Yeah, good point.

2402
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:22,000
But the dual gun Samus looks amazing because that's what she should look like in the movie trailer.

2403
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Like as she's walking out with the fire, like the two guns on the side.

2404
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
Incidentally, Metroid Prime 4.

2405
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Yes, right? But anyway, so somebody bought one of these Samus with the two gun figures at Best Buy and sold it on eBay $2,500 to buy a Samus Amiibo phone.

2406
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Now that's not exactly accurate. He did include a regular Samus Amiibo with it.

2407
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:58,000
So really, if you look at it, they're only $1,250 a piece. And that right there is only, what, $1,000 premium on each?

2408
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:13,000
It was bought at Best Buy for $13. And the seller was asked on Reddit if he'd considered keeping the Samus Amiibo or donating it to a museum or donating it to Nintendo.

2409
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
He's like, fuck no, I want money.

2410
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Yeah, he said, the thought had not crossed my mind. However, if approached by Nintendo, I probably would have. I was considering hanging on to it to sell at a later date if the value increased.

2411
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:33,000
However, with the high level of interest shown at the time when I posted it, I thought I'd go ahead and sell it now in case the value went down or a whole tub of them was discovered at a later date.

2412
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Meanwhile, Nintendo's got a warehouse full of these that they're pissed off at the manufacturer for and they're just like, wait a minute, these things are worth $2,000 a piece?

2413
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Hate this guy all you want? He's fucking smart. I'm sorry. That's the most American thing I've heard of, what he just did.

2414
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,000
The only thing that would have been more American is he was eating one of those KFC bowls at the time.

2415
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:07,000
That's awesome. The thing is, it's not like he bought something that was unusual and he bought them up and then has trotted them out on eBay.

2416
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:15,000
He found something that was a one-off and someone said, probably, you know, I want it. Someone's probably worth something and he threw it out there to see what he could get.

2417
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:23,000
It wasn't like he threw it up there for like a $2,500 buy it now. I mean, you know, more power to him. It's not like he's playing a slimy game.

2418
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:28,000
He probably at the very least, he's going to make his money back and what he purchased it for it.

2419
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I get this more than the ET cartridges. At least the Samus doll wasn't thrown away and dug out of a landfill.

2420
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
But it was thrown away by Atari.

2421
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:46,000
I'm sure Atari's thrown a lot away. Do you want like a stick of gum that Nolan Bushnell once chewed? Is that a value?

2422
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Yes.

2423
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Actually, then again, one of the coolest Christmas presents I ever got.

2424
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Stick of gum?

2425
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:03,000
No, a friend of mine got me index cards that were actually used on the 1970s match game that had questions on it.

2426
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
There you go.

2427
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Richard Dawson might have touched those.

2428
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Right? And so that's why I'm like, okay, actually this is one of the coolest presents I've ever gotten in my life.

2429
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:17,000
So anyway, Charles Nelson Reilly might have spit on it.

2430
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Maybe. He might have had like skin cells from Betty White.

2431
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Anyway. Okay, so there we go. That is it for the news tonight, which means we are ready to go to the Skype line.

2432
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,000
We're ready for your calls. So now's your chance. Time zones don't usually get to participate.

2433
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, if you'd like to talk about anything we've talked about tonight.

2434
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:46,000
PlayStation Experience, the Game Awards, Steam Broadcasting, anything. It's been a very busy week.

2435
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:51,000
I will turn to Loki real quick and see if there's any last minute stories while we wait for those calls to come in.

2436
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Nope. No. No, they are not.

2437
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
No, they are not. Well, luckily we have a call coming in so at least we can get to that.

2438
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
And we will take this call now.

2439
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2440
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Do you see me?

2441
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
I do. Is that Ravenstaufen?

2442
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,000
It is Ravenstaufen.

2443
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Oh. Amiibos. Hey, wait. That Samus only has one gun. It's less cool.

2444
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,000
I know. It's only worth $1250.

2445
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:21,000
I got so much stuff in here, man. I mean, I went crazy. Like bipolar crazy.

2446
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I heard a rumor, and this is still rumor status, but you held up that Villager amiibo. You might want to keep that in the packaging.

2447
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:34,000
The rumor I'm hearing, Villager, Marth, and Wii Fit Trainer already discontinued.

2448
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Oh, I already have? I have all of them.

2449
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
How many of those things have you bought, sir?

2450
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
All of them. I bought all of them for that reason.

2451
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,000
I want a Villager.

2452
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Every single amiibo.

2453
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. Sorry. Let me go get them. Yeah, I got the Marth one, you're saying. I got them all, man.

2454
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Pikachu, Marth.

2455
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Just so you know, Nintendo is proud of you. You've completely bought into the marketing and bought them all.

2456
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,000
That's right.

2457
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Because consumerism always wins for me.

2458
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
How does it feel to be a consumer whore for Nintendo?

2459
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:16,000
I am a consumer whore. I admit it, but yes, I've been keeping a few in the box.

2460
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:23,000
But yeah, to that day, just like that guy, you said it, Dan. You said, nothing wrong with that, and then when the day comes, cash in.

2461
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
That's right.

2462
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Like I said, it's not like you bought them all on the shelf and you're trying to sell something that some five-year-old wants.

2463
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:39,000
That's true. Just saying, it will happen because someone will go out there and say, maybe Rob will go like, I want Wii Fit Trainer. Guess who has it?

2464
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Actually, I do kind of want Wii Fit Trainer, but I wish they'd had, I mean, you know, I just, I prefer male Wii Fit Trainer because of, you know, some of my...

2465
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
It's all good.

2466
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Yeah, exactly. If you're going to wear a skin tight outfit, I prefer...

2467
02:37:54,000 --> 02:38:00,000
I want to see, like, someone make a mod of those, like, fat Wii Fit Trainer. That'd be hilarious.

2468
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Why not? Alright, so I don't think you just called in tonight to talk about your various collection of amiibo.

2469
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:13,000
God, no. No, no, this is, uh, I wanted to talk about the VGAs some more if I could. Not the VGAs, but the Game Award.

2470
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Did you check out who won Trending Gamer?

2471
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:20,000
Uh, that was the one that Total Biscuit won, right?

2472
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
That is so weird, because guess who else was on there?

2473
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,000
PewDiePie!

2474
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Yeah, and he's, he's super famous, huh? Here's, I'm gonna, Raven's Dolphin, can I be honest with you in the listenership for a minute?

2475
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Yeah, please.

2476
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:38,000
This is gonna really surprise some of you guys. You ready? I didn't know who any of those people were. I didn't know who any of them were.

2477
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:47,000
And I, I do, I do have a familiarity with PewDiePie because I see his articles on Yahoo about how he's the biggest YouTube celebrity out there.

2478
02:38:47,000 --> 02:39:01,000
So I'm not gonna say like, oh, I'm so hipster, I don't, but I watched maybe two minutes of one of his videos and I was like, alright, I've seen this a million times on Twitch and various channels and I would just rather watch my friends than these guys.

2479
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I'm like Total Biscuit, I mean, he seems to be, you know, interesting, but that's about it.

2480
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I don't, I don't know any of those guys and I don't know a thing about him.

2481
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Well, I was ready for, you know, oh geez, this guy got 30 million people, it's going to PewDiePie, it's going to him, it's going to him, and they said Total Biscuit. I went like, this thing's saved, thank God.

2482
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:31,000
I went like, I don't know, I don't know the 30 million people, but they seem quite a, I mean, like I said, I'd rather have a chat room full of 100 smart people than have 30 million blah people.

2483
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Yeah.

2484
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:39,000
PewDiePie's videos are annoying. I can't understand why people are so into...

2485
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Wasn't his big thing, he got big because he did the scary games and would scream really loud?

2486
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:48,000
He got big because of the scare cam. The scare cam was his invention.

2487
02:39:48,000 --> 02:40:03,000
I don't, you know, just, I can't, I mean, maybe I haven't watched enough of a sample of the material, but man, it's just really just, you try to watch his videos and it's just like, oh, it's 30 million people want to watch video games played by the world's most annoying person. This is totally sweet.

2488
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:15,000
The viral phenomenon is very strange because it's very interesting who goes viral and who doesn't. I mean, look at us, we've been doing this fucking thing for 12 years and we're not a big show by any means.

2489
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:25,000
There's still a lot of people out there that listen to a lot of podcasts, have no idea. There's been a gaming podcast for 12 years, but I'm okay with that because like you hit the nail on the head.

2490
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:35,000
We're fortunate here at OLR that the people we do bring in are all pretty cool and the people that have bad attitudes tend to leave pretty quickly and I'm totally okay with that.

2491
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:41,000
You hit the nail on the head, the 100 cool people outweighs 30 billion trolls, you know what I mean?

2492
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Dozens and dozens of hardcore fans.

2493
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:46,000
That's right.

2494
02:40:46,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Like I said, I watch you guys and you guys are pretty genuine people. Everyone's been chasing that dollar and don't get me wrong, I chase the dollar too, but my first thing when I consider Tekken Games is the first goal is to not make the dollar first, but to make the community happy.

2495
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Yes. And you know what, I'm not slamming on these guys. Congrats to them, they did something right, they caught that viral wave. I'm happy for them, I am. I'm not familiar with their work because the great thing about the internet is that anybody can do this, so I prefer to just, there's plenty of content out there with friends and other indie people that I know that do stuff that keeps me busy.

2496
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:36,000
One other thing, me, Hitstun and everyone else, we're on InstagibTV, no relation, but we do our thing on there and people are liking it.

2497
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Awesome. That's just a plug, right?

2498
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:54,000
For both of us, yeah, like I said, we do our direct capture thing and we do our help thing, but I'm not concerned about like, oh man, one day I'll be 30 million because those 30 million will be hanging on every word you're saying.

2499
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:05,000
That's true. And yeah, if PewDiePie says the wrong thing, there's going to be like a hate campaign on Twitter and all that stuff and I'm kind of glad on one hand that we don't have to deal with a lot of that yet.

2500
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:15,000
I mean, I fear the day when one out of context thing I said in 12 years of broadcasting goes fucking viral. I mean, that is a fear we have to kind of live in a little bit.

2501
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Yeah, we're not that far above the radar for that to happen.

2502
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Hashtag I hate Rob.

2503
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Maybe. Who knows? Who knows? Go into our chat. I'm over at live.vognetwork.com. Martan is in our chat saying, you're right, Rob. You are the trending gamer, aw shucks.

2504
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:36,000
And Fabrice says Sky is the mother of all social gamer celebrities. The drag mother, perhaps.

2505
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
And how? You bet at stream.

2506
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Alright, Ravenstauff, anything else? Any other plugs?

2507
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:50,000
One last thing I want to say. I want to say thanks for doing an early stream. Your stuff, when I do my stuff, is around your stuff.

2508
02:42:51,000 --> 02:43:03,000
So I'm never around to like to be a witness to a live broadcast and I want to say thank you for doing. I know this is for the international listeners, but I like that you're taking chances and saying, alright, three o'clock people.

2509
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Because I was listening to your last show, playing Halo, doing my thing. We're like, I'm going to join. I'm going to join. I'm going to join. I'm going to join.

2510
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:13,000
And I'm glad that you did it. Thank you for making me a part of it.

2511
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:21,000
It was for anybody who could be here. In all honesty, it was really so that we could go to dinner somewhere else tonight. But usually the early hour doesn't work for us.

2512
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,000
So I'm happy it worked to get some other people in. Because we do want to be the show where every gamer has a voice.

2513
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Yeah, I appreciate it. I just want to say thank you and have a nice night. And Jamie, congrats on the MacBook. I am too poor for a MacBook.

2514
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Trust me, we'll talk. It took me a bit of doing.

2515
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:43,000
So is she.

2516
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:45,000
Take care, my friend. Bye.

2517
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:51,000
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. But the Skype line is lighting up with more calls, so let's get to it.

2518
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2519
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Hi, it's Fabrice.

2520
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Fabrice? Oh, this is one of our listeners in Belgium, isn't it?

2521
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Yeah, that's right.

2522
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:09,000
What is up? Welcome to the show. I'm so excited that we get different people on tonight. I mean, I love the people that we hear from every week, don't get me wrong.

2523
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:13,000
But I love that we mix it up a little bit tonight. Well, how are you, my friend?

2524
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Well, I'm fine. Thanks for doing the show.

2525
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:20,000
You're welcome. Thank you for calling in. What's on your mind tonight?

2526
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Well, nothing really. I'd really like to call to say thank you for doing the show for so long.

2527
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:34,000
So I've been through a rough time last couple of months, so you've kind of helped me get through it.

2528
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Wow. I'm blown away by that. You're welcome first.

2529
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:52,000
And that's always the compliments that carry the most weight to hear people say that, like, I was having a shitty day and you took my mind off of it for three hours.

2530
02:44:53,000 --> 02:45:00,000
And I'm just like, that's such a huge compliment. Like, you don't even know. Because I know I have those shitty days.

2531
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:06,000
I know how it makes me feel when somebody can kind of take me out of that mood. So thank you so much. That is such a huge compliment.

2532
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:14,000
And thank you for telling us that because it just motivates us to go another 12 years. Right, Dan? Want to go for 12 more?

2533
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I guess. I ain't got nothing to do. I'll show up once every six months or so.

2534
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Go ahead.

2535
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Yeah, well, I'd like to tell that I miss the Sega that used to live a long time ago. I really miss their arcade games.

2536
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
We do too.

2537
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Anybody with taste does, sir. I miss the Sega games. Well, at least there was that Sega Humble Bundle. I mean, is that kind of stuff open to the international crowd? Were you able to pick up that Sega Humble Bundle?

2538
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Yeah, but I already own most of those games.

2539
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Well, yeah, that happens too. That's like when they're giving away Mirror's Edge for free and you're like, oh, but I already own Mirror's Edge. Oh well.

2540
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Or Injustice is the PlayStation Plus game of the month. Oops, sorry about that. Oh well. That happens.

2541
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:14,000
When they finally release the game again, you know, I buy it day one because they only release a couple of games a year anymore. So yeah.

2542
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Yeah, that's true. Sega's only going to put out a few things a year. Well, actually, I was hearing not so good things about the latest Sonic game on the Wii U.

2543
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:30,000
I'm hearing it's Sonic 06 bad, and that's not good. That's really not good to hear. Yeah, it's pretty bad.

2544
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Yeah, I didn't even bother playing it.

2545
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:38,000
I just want to see more outruns and Space Harriers and stuff like that, and it's gone.

2546
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:44,000
Well, they have that one game that's supposed to come into the Wii U that was a Kickstarter, that 90s racing game or whatever. I forget what they call that.

2547
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Oh yeah, but that wasn't really, that was some personalities from Sega.

2548
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
Not another 90s racer. That's what they should call it.

2549
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:56,000
It wasn't even that. It was just a game done in the style of like Daytona USA and Sega Rally.

2550
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I don't know if it ever came out.

2551
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:00,000
It's not out yet, but it looks good.

2552
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,000
No, it's been postponed for like a year and a half now.

2553
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Of course. That's what happens to games. Of course that's what happens.

2554
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Yeah, they had all the trouble with the AI of the other 40 cars on track.

2555
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Oh my gosh.

2556
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
And it's like, really, how hard can it be?

2557
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:20,000
You know, you've made like a thousand games like this, you know?

2558
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Well, no, this was an indie guy that was doing it. It was someone that was making it in Unity or whatever.

2559
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Oh, that's cool.

2560
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Did you say it was going to be 40 players?

2561
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:35,000
The thing that bugs me most about Sega right now is what's going on with Phantasy Star, because they refuse to release that shit in the US.

2562
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Like, Japan just got Phantasy Star Nova on the Vita, and I really want to play that, and it's like a Vita game, right?

2563
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:46,000
And they're, nope, not coming out in the US. Nope. Unless there's a surprise announcement at E3 or something.

2564
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:50,000
It's very frustrating. But at least we're getting you Cruise of Five, I guess.

2565
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:54,000
And you've got to wonder why Sony's not on that. Why Sony's not just like, hey, Sega.

2566
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Yeah, right?

2567
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Let's make it worth your while, because in Japan, Phantasy Star is what's keeping that shit running.

2568
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
That's the reason there is a Vita.

2569
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Let's get your nose out of Nintendo's butt and put it in ours.

2570
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Exactly. See, I'm upset because Phantasy Star hasn't been Phantasy Star since, like, the days of the Genesis.

2571
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:22,000
You know, I would love to have a Phantasy Star game that's an RPG and not like its weird little quasi-MMO.

2572
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:30,000
But MMOs today owe a lot to Phantasy Star Online. Like, Phantasy Star Online defined, you know, we're talking about generation-defining games.

2573
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Phantasy Star Online is a generation-defining game of its day.

2574
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Sure. Yeah, there's no doubt that it's the first kind of online adventure. Yeah, it was a big thing.

2575
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
But I would love to see a Phantasy Star game.

2576
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Dungeon Buster, in your camp over at our live chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, I'd really like to see another Phantasy Star in the same vein as Phantasy Stars 1 through 4.

2577
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,000
It'll probably never happen, but I can always hope.

2578
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:58,000
I would love to see real localizations of Generation 1 and Generation 2, which were on PS2.

2579
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:03,000
I played a fan translation of Generation 1. It was awesome.

2580
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Yeah? Awesome. Well, Fabrice, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?

2581
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Yeah, well, you know, Shenmue 3.

2582
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,000
No kidding, huh?

2583
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Yeah. It'll probably never happen, but you know.

2584
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:17,000
No, no.

2585
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Well, never say never, because who ever thought that we would finally get Final Fantasy VII on the PlayStation 4? And here we are!

2586
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
We did it! We did it, everybody!

2587
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Shenmue 3 is more important than Final Fantasy VII.

2588
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:39,000
I actually agree with you there. Honestly, coming out of the PlayStation Expo, this is the first time this has ever happened, and some people have been waiting decades for this.

2589
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:44,000
People walked out of the PlayStation Expo more excited for Suikoden than they were for Final Fantasy.

2590
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Do you know how long some people have been waiting for this day?

2591
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
What, for Suikoden?

2592
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
People were more excited about Suikoden news than Final Fantasy news.

2593
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Right, they're doing a new Suikoden?

2594
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:58,000
No, they're just re-releasing an old one, and it's still more exciting than Final Fantasy VII.

2595
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
How's it going? Can Ami get the...

2596
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:08,000
Fabrice, I gotta let you go so we can get some more callers, but thank you so, so, so much for calling in and the nice words. We really appreciate it.

2597
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Okay, thank you guys.

2598
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:12,000
Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.

2599
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:18,000
That's so awesome that we have people international in a country that I'll never be able to afford to fly to.

2600
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Who likes Sega.

2601
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Yes, who loves Sega. It has such good taste.

2602
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
You chose a good day to call.

2603
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
I'm glad we could do the earlier show to make it work.

2604
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2605
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Let me quickly go to the Twittersphere and see if, as I thought I saw some tweets coming in earlier before the show,

2606
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:42,000
but you know, I am such a great radio host that I didn't bring up the Twitter in advance,

2607
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,000
but I'm doing it now, because live radio is a joy.

2608
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Production!

2609
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
And everybody on the house is on the internet.

2610
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Kidman Project tweeted us and said,

2611
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Bloody typical, I'm missing the convergence of our time streams,

2612
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:00,000
so here's a big cheers for always making my Mondays less shit.

2613
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:04,000
So, he's over in the UK, but it sounds like he couldn't make it today anyway.

2614
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
So, that's too bad.

2615
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Let's see, yeah, there's some thoughts from Twitter, so let's go to another call.

2616
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2617
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Hi, this is Raginator.

2618
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,000
Hey, Raginator, buddy. How you doing?

2619
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Pretty good, how are you?

2620
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:26,000
Eh, no, we're doing really good. What's on your mind?

2621
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Well, I was going to touch on something that you were mentioning earlier in the news segment.

2622
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Go for it.

2623
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Yeah, you were mentioning how Steam, just the other day, introduced the Steam broadcasting feature on their server.

2624
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Yeah, they're like answering a Twitch in a way that's built into the service, yeah?

2625
02:51:53,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Yes, well, to go into a little detail to really participate in terms of broadcasting yourself,

2626
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:12,000
you have to opt into their beta program, which you do there by going to your options on Steam.

2627
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Yes, it's a good reminder to check, because I thought I was already opted in, and apparently I wasn't.

2628
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:24,000
So, when I couldn't see broadcasting in there, I was like, what the hell, I thought I was in the beta stuff, but I wasn't.

2629
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,000
So, yeah, check that out.

2630
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:40,000
The trouble is, the update that they released, I think it was on Thursday night, or Friday night, I think it was on, probably Thursday night,

2631
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:46,000
but anyway, the update had a major flaw.

2632
02:52:46,000 --> 02:53:00,000
It worked, completely and utterly worked, this one file, I think it's called steamui.dl, for a lot of people,

2633
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:13,000
and to the point where if you were to close Steam for whatever reason, and that file was worked for you,

2634
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
you would not be able to relaunch Steam.

2635
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:24,000
How do you know that this happened to you? Because I, of course, am getting all the updates, so now you have me a little worried that I'm going to have to reinstall everything.

2636
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Do you get an error message that makes it very clear that this happens to you?

2637
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:40,000
Yeah, if you were to close, let's say for the sake of conversation, you were to close Steam right now, and then try to launch it again,

2638
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:57,000
you'll see like a little dialog box that says fatal error, and then it'll list SteamUI.dll as being the issue.

2639
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:08,000
So you can't just have it scan your computer and find all the games again, you actually have to go in and redownload everything, which that's a lot, oh my gosh, that's so much.

2640
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Yeah, yeah, well, some people are saying that you can rescan, assuming that you got the games on like a separate hard drive.

2641
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Now, if the problem is with me, A, I didn't know that, and B, I get my games between two drives, an internal hard drive and an external hard drive.

2642
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:45,000
And at least with the stuff that's on the Steam hard drive and the Steam application itself, when I went to uninstall Steam, it deleted the games that were on the Steam hard drive, so I had to reinstall those anyways.

2643
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Well, Raginator, I think this might be a challenge, but only install those games you're actually playing, and that should cut it down to like 100 megs.

2644
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Only install the games you're actually playing.

2645
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Yeah, well, you know, the trouble with me is, you know, sure, there's certain games that I consider my go-to games, like, you know, me, I go on and on and on about the Magic the Gathering games.

2646
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Of course, that's alright, it's like Me and WoW, or Final Fantasy.

2647
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Yeah, but at the same time, you know, I have a lot of games that I haven't touched yet, and now I've been always the type to, yeah, I'm probably going to get around to it.

2648
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:43,000
And a lot of times when I'm not playing the Magic the Gathering games or, you know, the Geometry Wars, you know, well, I end up choosing a status usually just totally seemingly random.

2649
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:48,000
You know, one second I could feel like playing Sam and Max, and the next second I could see them.

2650
02:55:49,000 --> 02:56:00,000
Alright, so because you have what I lovingly refer to, because I have this too, as gamer ADD, you just, you need all your games there at a moment's notice, because you might have to switch from one, you know, to another in five minutes.

2651
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:02,000
I understand, I understand.

2652
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Exactly.

2653
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Alright, so lesson learned, wait another week, maybe don't opt into these betas, because you might lose everything, who knows, or back things up, or just be careful, be careful.

2654
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Alright, Rachel, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but take care my friend.

2655
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Sure, bye, have a good one.

2656
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Bye, good luck with all the restoration.

2657
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:31,000
At least, you know, I mean, especially if you're capped on your bandwidth, I don't know how you're going to manage in that situation, that's just going to suck.

2658
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:45,000
But at least he didn't lose the digital rights, because I still remember that guy had a problem a few years ago on his PlayStation 3 or something, where he tried to download all this video, and then like, it disappeared, and he couldn't, like, re-download him. I just remember that was a huge issue.

2659
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:51,000
I think you can just re-download the DLL, the Steam UI, you don't have to re-download all your games.

2660
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:55,000
I don't know, but I would think Rage Nator probably poked around on the Steam forums, and you know.

2661
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Well, who knows.

2662
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:08,000
Hopefully, who knows, who knows. That's usually what I do. The first thing I do is I Google it, and I narrow down the search to the last 24 hours, or today, to try to see if other people are posting and bitching about the problems.

2663
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Alright, we are going to take one more call, so we've got one more call coming in here, and then we'll wrap up. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2664
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:15,000
This is Eric RPG.

2665
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:17,000
Hey, Eric RPG, how you doing?

2666
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Fine.

2667
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Good to hear from you.

2668
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Going on, undergoing a cold, I think.

2669
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Oh, no. I somehow have avoided the sick thing, knock on wood, somehow avoided that. Well, what's on your mind today, my friend?

2670
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:33,000
I just want to talk about one game in particular I played this week that I should warn everybody not to play.

2671
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Uh-oh, what's that?

2672
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:41,000
This is a game called Haunted House Crypt of Graves, which is actually a remake of the original Atari Haunted House game.

2673
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Oh, we've reported that this was a thing on this show before, because I remember, I don't know if you're old enough to remember the 2600 version, but I remember the 2600 version.

2674
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
It was, for its day, it was awesome.

2675
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,000
It was brilliant.

2676
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:58,000
It's not exactly the game that I go, gosh, they should remake that.

2677
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Yeah, but when you're, like, five years old, that game is, like, awesome.

2678
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Yeah, it was awesome. So it doesn't hold up well, huh, Eric?

2679
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Yeah, basically what they did is they made it a first-person adventure type of game, but they also made it kind of like Amnesia, but they failed miserably in every conceivable way.

2680
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Oh, no.

2681
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:24,000
The controls are sluggish and awkward, and there's lots of graphical glitches.

2682
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Like, I was running away from invisible enemies, and apparently the only way to see them is to use this, like, supernatural vision that this character has.

2683
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:39,000
But I was jumping up around trying to get away from them, and I ended up on top of them for some reason.

2684
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Whoa.

2685
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
Yeah, unfortunately the house has trouble rendering.

2686
02:58:44,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Not only that, but the staircase that you took to get down to that place, you can go down it just fine, but you have to actually jump up the stairs because they didn't design it in such a way that you could just walk back up it, and it's awkward as heck to get back up there.

2687
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:06,000
You can go down the stairs, but you can't go up. What kind of house is this? This is like the Winchester Mystery House. What is this?

2688
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:08,000
It's like a roach motel.

2689
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:19,000
There's really terrible voice acting, and for some reason the voice acting of the old man character is somehow worse audio quality than the main characters.

2690
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Wow. Oh my god. It's like people probably recorded it over Skype, which is fine for doing a show like this, but not for voice acting. You're going to actually put it in a video game.

2691
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Waynein1 in our chat room says, I just saw a video of Haunted House today on YouTube. Looked pretty bad. DungeonBuster says, the original is awesome, just a pair of eyes bumping into walls and the scary lightning.

2692
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Never mind the games using Unreal Engine 4, but it's like totally not taking advantage of it, and it looks terrible, and it's so unoptimized that even my PC can't run it very well.

2693
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:58,000
My PC isn't the greatest. I'm still using a dual core, but it should be running somewhat confidently.

2694
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
It should be better than it is. I'm sorry to hear that.

2695
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:09,000
I'm going to give this game a 1 out of 10 on GameTactics.com. I'm not even going to bother finishing it because it's that bad.

2696
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:14,000
It's so bad. Don't check it out. Now everyone's going to check it out because they want to see how bad it is.

2697
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:21,000
So what you've done is unwittingly lead people into the trap. You're part of the problem. You're not the solution.

2698
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Is it showgirls bad? Because that's kind of good when it's that bad.

2699
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:27,000
It's not so bad. It's good.

2700
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Okay, that's too bad. It's just bad.

2701
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Yeah? Well you don't know shit.

2702
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:37,000
You are a whore, darlin'. Alright, well we gotta go. We're going to go eat some brown rice and vegetables.

2703
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Alright, take care my friend.

2704
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
I'm ordering a hamburger. Rob's going to have dog chow.

2705
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
I don't think Eric got the joke, the showgirls joke, but yes.

2706
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,000
Hi, Alan's here. Hi Alan.

2707
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:49,000
Hi. What's up? Do you want candy?

2708
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Yes, candy, candy, candy, candy. Yay. Ooh, he brought me the really yummy. Oh, in theme with tonight's show, we were talking about Australia earlier.

2709
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
This is Australian black licorice.

2710
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Dude, sweet. I love black licorice.

2711
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:04,000
We can eat it in the car with Jamie.

2712
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:06,000
I'm going to be so nauseous.

2713
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:11,000
I know some people can't stand black licorice, but I love it. Dan, it must be a Dutch thing.

2714
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:13,000
Maybe.

2715
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:18,000
I can't stand black licorice, so when I get that I'm being super nice because it's candy that I can't have.

2716
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
I've bought Dan some before and then I left the house.

2717
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
I've bought him mayonnaise and you all know how I feel about mayonnaise.

2718
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:26,000
I love mayonnaise.

2719
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Alan, let's have a mayonnaise party.

2720
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Do you have a mayonnaise and black licorice sandwich?

2721
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:35,000
The worst thing in the world is a tuna, because canned tuna is also, I can't stand.

2722
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:40,000
So he makes those fucking tuna fish sandwiches. That's what, canned tuna and mayonnaise.

2723
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:45,000
It's like licking up, like, you know, oozing up a side of mayonnaise.

2724
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,000
God, I gotta shit. Alright.

2725
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:54,000
Alright, well that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight. Thanks to everybody who called in, appreciate it.

2726
03:01:55,000 --> 03:02:00,000
If you didn't get through or you'd like to participate with the show, maybe you forgot that the show was early tonight, so you're listening at the six o'clock hour.

2727
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:07,000
You can always tweet us at twitter.com slash o-l-r or you can always email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2728
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:16,000
But we are going to go around and start to wrap up the show because I don't believe Loki had any last minute stories, nor does Jamie or Dan, so that's it.

2729
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Thank you guys very much for being here. Those of you guys that tuned in live at the earlier hour, appreciate it.

2730
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:27,000
Those of you guys that forgot, that are kicking yourselves, that are listening on the repeat, sorry, but we'll be back at our regular time next week.

2731
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:31,000
And those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're all still awesome.

2732
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:35,000
And I would love to hear from those of you guys, we had an emailer this week that said he'd been listening for like nine years.

2733
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
I'd love to hear from more of you, especially those of you that have been listening for years and years.

2734
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,000
Yeah, well I've been listening for twelve years.

2735
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:42,000
I've been dealing with this crap for twelve years.

2736
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:44,000
I've been ignoring for twelve years, no I'm kidding.

2737
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:51,000
That's what I want for Chris McQuanzica. I want emails from listeners that have never emailed us before that have been listening for a long time, or even a short time.

2738
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:56,000
That's what I want. You want to give me a really easy Chris McQuanzica gift? Give me that. Why is Alan wagging his finger?

2739
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:58,000
A dozen unique emails.

2740
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Yeah, right.

2741
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:09,000
The only caveat to that is that if you've been listening to the show for like nine, ten, eleven years, don't say, I started the sixth grade and now I'm at a bar.

2742
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:11,000
So don't do that.

2743
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:17,000
No, no, that's awesome. You should totally do that because if you're listening to this show in the sixth grade, you've got problems.

2744
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
And we've contributed to those problems.

2745
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:25,000
Yeah, don't tell me that you were in elementary school and you started listening and now you have your own kids. That I don't need to hear.

2746
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:31,000
Oh come on, one of our listeners was in high school when he started and now he's my coworker.

2747
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:33,000
I can't, I can't.

2748
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Anyhow, Dan, I want to thank you so much for being here tonight. You're always a fun time to have on the show.

2749
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:40,000
I didn't have anything better to do.

2750
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
I understand. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

2751
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:45,000
No, no I do not.

2752
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:47,000
Alright, sounds good.

2753
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:49,000
You know you can just take that cabinet because he's just not going to use it.

2754
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:51,000
No, you can't take that cabinet.

2755
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,000
I want to use it.

2756
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:55,000
He just said I could take it, so it's happening.

2757
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:57,000
No, take it back. Alright, let's see. Loki, your final thought tonight.

2758
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Speaking of cabinets that aren't being used, I have to dust off my arcade cabinet at home.

2759
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,000
It's not easy is it?

2760
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:12,000
We're turning that room into a playroom, so it's still going to stay there because thank God I don't have to move it out because I don't, I barely made it.

2761
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:25,000
My hallway, the way it is, I have to make like two sharp 90 degree turns to get the arcade cabinet in there and there literally was like maybe a half quarter of an inch clearance.

2762
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Is it the same one that was in your guys' apartment?

2763
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,000
No, oh God.

2764
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
No, we moved, we moved that thing upstairs.

2765
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:42,000
We moved to an upstairs apartment like, ah, that is getting dismantled. That is not coming with us. I am not lifting that upstairs.

2766
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
No, I have a Sega Astro City that I have.

2767
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:47,000
Okay, you have a candy.

2768
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Yeah, so I have that and it's all nice and redone, but I don't use it ever.

2769
03:04:51,000 --> 03:05:02,000
I have Street Fighter IV on it though with my nice octagonal restrictor plates and shit that still doesn't make me any better at the game, but it's nice.

2770
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:13,000
Alright, my final thought tonight is I want to thank Dan for running and getting tacos during the show. There's no, there's no better way to say I'm a good friend than to buy somebody a taco.

2771
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:15,000
Add a hungry wife.

2772
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:19,000
Alright, and speaking of hungry wife, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

2773
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:23,000
I fucking love my new computer. It's so fucking pretty.

2774
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:28,000
Hey, by the way, the local Toys R Us has those ColecoVision flashback consoles.

2775
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:30,000
It sucks. Don't get it.

2776
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:31,000
I got the Intellivision one.

2777
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:35,000
The controllers are not good at all. The Intellivision one is sweet.

2778
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Yeah, I got the Intellivision one. I haven't got the ColecoVision one.

2779
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:43,000
I was thinking of it as more a gift for my dad because he had a ColecoVision that he gave me a long time ago, so...

2780
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
The controllers are almost unusable.

2781
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
Alright, and it seems like you guys liked really...

2782
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,000
Oh, yeah.

2783
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:02,000
Dan, sorry, I didn't realize Dan was talking and not into a mic. Sorry, guys. That's definitely the time to...

2784
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:04,000
Sorry, we're having a side conversation about it.

2785
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:06,000
Yeah, clearly, clearly, and I'm trying to wrap up the show.

2786
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
We can talk about ColecoVision flashback for like 45 more minutes.

2787
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:11,000
No, no, no, no. We got to wrap up.

2788
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:17,000
I do want to say, Wayne in one in chat says, thanks guys for doing this early show. Great to be able to tune in live for the first time since 2006.

2789
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:21,000
You know, it seems like a lot of you guys like the earlier show, so it's something we'll have to consider.

2790
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:26,000
I mean, we can't do it all the times, and certainly the folks that are used to six o'clock that can't be here at this time don't want us to do it all the time.

2791
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:31,000
But we will definitely consider doing more of these in the future as we can work it out in our schedule.

2792
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:33,000
It'll be random OLR times.

2793
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Man, this is so much easier to do with a laptop than on my old iPad.

2794
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:43,000
You know, we have to do a show some week at like four in the morning, so that way our friends in Japan can tune in and listen.

2795
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,000
Okay.

2796
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
That's it, guys. Thank you so much for tuning in to another edition of Orange Laundry.

2797
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:55,000
We'll be back next week, normal time, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at vognetwork.com, but 24-7 on the podcast feed.

2798
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Have a great week, everybody. Happy gaming.

2799
03:06:58,000 --> 03:06:59,000
Stay black.

2800
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
See you next week.

2801
03:07:55,000 --> 03:08:02,000
.
