7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight we interview Max, Philip, and Jeffrey of Cooking with Unity, a web series of YouTube videos that teaches you how to create video games using Unity step by step in detail. We'll take your questions live and chat along with your comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	56000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this, our 579th episode, December the 14th, 2014, live as we are every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
56000	66000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts. Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
66000	69000	Maybe I should just go by Madame Spanky, I don't know.
69000	75000	You do have a very hoarse voice tonight, I don't mean like a...
75000	77000	What happened? Are you okay?
77000	79000	I had the plague.
79000	84000	Oh, I thought maybe you went to a New Kids on the Block concert and were screaming really loud or something.
84000	97000	No, everyone at Locat has had the plague and I starved it off for a solid two to three weeks and then it finally got me and then when it got me, it really freaking got me.
97000	99000	Well, as long as you don't give it to us here in the studio.
99000	107000	You know, that's so rude. You should be like, oh, I hope you feel better and then go take some vitamins. I'm kidding.
107000	115000	People always say that and I'm just always like, you know what, maybe it just always strikes me as a little bit odd.
115000	120000	Because all I've been hearing is, don't get me sick, don't get me sick. I'm like, don't you want me to feel better?
120000	123000	Of course we want you to feel better, but you know...
123000	124000	I'm not getting you sick.
124000	128000	I mean, either you're going to feel better or you're going to die. There's no like...
128000	132000	I don't know, death might sometimes make you feel better. No, I'm kidding.
132000	133000	Kidding, kidding, kidding.
133000	136000	But it turned into an upper respiratory infection, so...
136000	137000	Yikes.
137000	139000	Yeah, I took codeine today.
139000	143000	Well, you know what'll fix you right up is some coffee. That's what you need.
143000	146000	I'm drinking some, but I can't taste it.
146000	148000	Well, good luck, but...
148000	150000	It tastes vaguely like coldies.
150000	154000	If we hear a little less from you tonight, this is why, because you're obviously...
154000	157000	Even when you walked in here, you were sign languaging me, basically.
157000	161000	Or that, or you just really wanted to flip me off for something I did. I don't know.
161000	162000	No.
163000	167000	All right. And they're even asking in chat there, does Jamie need to be turned up a little bit?
167000	171000	Probably, but she's just also a little... She's just quiet, because...
171000	173000	I could try talking like this.
173000	175000	Hey, what's up, bitches?
175000	179000	You're fine. Your audio's fine. You're just a little... You're a little weak tonight.
179000	185000	Well, he's not weak tonight. He's here, strongest ever. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
185000	187000	I eat too much too fast, I think.
187000	188000	Uh-oh.
188000	189000	Yeah.
189000	190000	I hope you don't get the other kind of sick.
190000	195000	No, no, no, no. I skipped lunch today, because I was working on the show, rolling stuff,
195000	198000	and then I was just tired and I was gonna take a nap because of the kids.
198000	205000	And so I didn't bother to get up from the couch to make lunch.
205000	211000	And so then I just got the bacon ultimate cheeseburger. I know, a very light meal.
211000	216000	And then I just ate that really fast, and I'm like, oh, wow. I'm really full now.
216000	217000	Oh, that hurt. That hurt.
217000	219000	A power meal to get you through the show.
219000	221000	I'm just uncomfortably full, but that's all right.
221000	222000	All right.
223000	229000	Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate with our show,
229000	232000	because, again, we tape live on Sunday nights at vognetwork.com.
232000	236000	You can join us in the chat, live.vognetwork.com.
236000	240000	Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's on before us, saying,
240000	244000	Jamie channeling her inner Travis Donovan with that what's up, bitches.
244000	250000	Our good pal from under Sedation Live, which is Saturdays here.
250000	252000	So there you go.
252000	256000	Let's see, DarkSakura, you wonder. I just have to say this comment because you're talking about this.
256000	259000	I wonder if I should try making a webcomic in Unity.
259000	262000	Well, why not? Maybe you should.
262000	266000	I want to do it dating sim style, you know, with image, image, image,
266000	269000	because I love Homestuck, how it's got all the animations and whatnot,
269000	271000	but I hate how all the text is at the bottom.
271000	274000	You have to scroll through 50 million piles of, you know, stuff.
274000	276000	Well, if you make it, you can put it at the top.
276000	279000	They do have, I have seen in the assets store,
279000	283000	they did have something for, like, dating sim style game,
283000	286000	like a system already built out, you know, for that.
286000	291000	So, but I've had the idea of doing it that way for a little bit, so.
291000	294000	Well, let's talk about why our chatters are talking about Unity tonight,
294000	299000	because we do have some special guests coming on the show in about 45 minutes here.
299000	301000	Loki, I'm going to have you talk about these guys,
301000	305000	because this is actually a show that you've referenced quite a bit
305000	308000	in the making of your own game that you're trying to make right now,
308000	311000	amongst, you know, New Job, amongst Raising Kids,
311000	313000	amongst Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger.
313000	318000	Yes. So, yeah, so I don't even remember how I came across them.
318000	323000	I'm sure probably just looking up information about Unity on YouTube
323000	326000	and stuff like that, just kind of trying to learn wherever.
326000	331000	And I found the show, and it was just very informative, very entertaining.
331000	336000	You know, that's incredibly important, and it's just fun to listen to.
336000	339000	Like, even, you know, while I'm working on my stuff and programming stuff,
339000	341000	I just love listening to them, and just...
341000	343000	Does this show have a name?
343000	345000	Yes, I'm getting there. Hold on.
345000	347000	Oh, sorry, you're building anticipation.
347000	350000	So, anyway, so, yes, well, the show is Cooking with Unity,
350000	354000	and hosted by Maximilien Moreau,
354000	358000	and, of course, he has Jeffrey and Phil on the show as well.
358000	361000	Occasionally, sometimes they're there, sometimes they're not.
361000	365000	But they do a show twice weekly, or originally it was twice weekly,
365000	368000	on Monday, and then also on Thursdays.
368000	371000	Thursdays tends to be, like, a 2D episode.
371000	374000	So they'll do, for example, two different games kind of at the same time.
374000	380000	So, one, I think they were working on, like, was it last week?
380000	382000	It was, like, a rail shooter.
382000	386000	So kind of like House of the Dead, I guess, if you want to,
386000	388000	you know, something like that, for the 3D show.
388000	392000	And then on the 2D show, they're working on a project called Fight Go Right,
392000	396000	which is kind of like a beat-em-up, you know, 2D arcade game,
396000	401000	like Ninja Turtles or, you know, the Simpsons arcade, or Final Fight,
401000	402000	or something like that.
402000	406000	And so, kind of the two different styles in there.
406000	412000	Plus, now Max has been doing a show in the mornings called, you know,
412000	414000	Breakfast with Unity, which actually started off about,
414000	416000	it'd be like 10 to 15 minute shows.
416000	418000	I've been noticing they've been getting longer and longer,
418000	423000	which is cool, because he goes over kind of quick little tips on-
423000	425000	That's okay, when the Orange Launch Radio podcast started,
425000	427000	it was supposed to be 45 minutes.
427000	428000	And now-
429000	430000	Oops.
431000	433000	But yes, absolutely entertaining.
433000	437000	What's kind of cool though is they interact with the people that are listening
437000	441000	or watching the show live, and so you can ask questions about things,
441000	443000	you can make suggestions on stuff,
443000	446000	and it's just kind of nice to have that live feedback, you know.
446000	450000	And also, you know, he invites everyone on every show, you know,
450000	451000	hey, if you have a question about something,
451000	454000	or you just, you know, need some help on something,
454000	456000	just send me an email and, you know, I'll help you out.
456000	458000	And it's really nice.
458000	463000	And I love their attitude, you know, I can't profess to know as much about Unity,
463000	466000	I'm not as into, quote unquote, the programming side,
466000	470000	but I love that these guys, at the end of their videos,
470000	473000	they talk about, you know, in their descriptions too,
473000	477000	they say, you know, go download Unity and make a game.
477000	479000	You know, that's very much kind of like their message,
479000	481000	is that more people should, you know, basically be making games.
481000	484000	And I love that, because that's kind of the type of thing
484000	485000	I've always said about podcasting,
485000	487000	because I've had people come to me and say,
487000	490000	well, Rob, I want to start my own video game podcast,
490000	492000	but I don't want you to be mad or see me as competition,
492000	493000	because I know you've got a video game podcast.
493000	495000	I'm like, it's not, no, no, no, it's not like that.
495000	498000	I want you to make your, that's like the ultimate compliment
498000	500000	if somebody goes and creates their own podcast.
500000	502000	We need more indie voices out there.
502000	505000	Go forth and podcast, please.
505000	506000	That's a great thing.
506000	509000	So I love that they bring that kind of message to games.
509000	512000	We need more people making games.
512000	513000	I love that.
514000	517000	And I haven't caught up on all the back videos I missed,
517000	519000	because I came into it a little bit late, but...
519000	521000	There's a lot. I had no idea where to begin.
521000	523000	Yeah, they've got like a couple series,
523000	526000	highly recommend that they've done.
526000	529000	One recently, which I just think is fantastic,
529000	531000	and I'm probably going to go look at it a bunch
531000	533000	when I'm actually getting to publishing,
533000	535000	but it's from scratch to publish,
535000	537000	where they literally make a game,
537000	539000	and I even have it on my phone, you know, it's fun,
539000	541000	because my phone actually tries to play it on its own sometimes,
541000	542000	because it's possessed.
542000	545000	But they start, and they make a game from scratch,
545000	549000	and he goes through all the steps to even getting it published
549000	552000	on iOS, on the Android store.
552000	554000	I noticed that.
554000	555000	Windows store, yeah.
555000	557000	It got into a lot of like, not just here's how you program,
557000	559000	but here's how, you know, all that other stuff
559000	562000	that sometimes a programmer doesn't want to have to get involved with,
562000	563000	but you do.
563000	565000	Yeah, so it was very informative,
565000	567000	and then he's got like some other series.
567000	571000	He did one which was like a Star Fox style game.
571000	574000	I think I saw one, a pinball in there.
574000	576000	One that I looked at, because it was short,
576000	578000	and it was their little featured video on their page,
578000	580000	was the one where they made the game in three minutes.
580000	582000	It was kind of like the reverse kaboom,
582000	585000	where you don't try to catch the bombs, you try to avoid them.
585000	587000	Instead, it was such a like,
587000	589000	it kind of gets back into what we were talking about, you know,
589000	591000	and it's kind of been almost a running theme on this show
591000	596000	over the past month ever since YYR unveiled pixel sheds here on,
596000	597000	yes, that was the game he made,
597000	599000	and I think he did that in Unity, right?
599000	601000	I don't know if he's used their videos,
601000	604000	but he used Unity to make that very Atari 2600 game,
604000	607000	and we've talked about how sometimes it's just the idea.
607000	611000	Like, you don't necessarily need all these like gung-ho
611000	613000	Final Fantasy-esque graphics,
613000	615000	although that's a nice thing for games to have.
615000	616000	You don't necessarily need that.
616000	620000	So, I mean, this game that they did in three minutes,
620000	623000	and they're like, time me, and the whole thing,
623000	625000	was a stupidly simple concept.
625000	627000	I mean that in a complimentary way
627000	630000	that was executed quickly and easily,
630000	631000	so it was really cool,
631000	633000	and it just kind of went to show like,
633000	635000	oh yeah, you really can do this if you're just willing to,
635000	638000	you know, put a little time in learning it.
638000	642000	So, they will be on the show 45 minutes, give or take.
642000	644000	We'll have them on the show,
644000	646000	and you can ask your questions live,
646000	647000	if you happen to be listening,
647000	649000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
649000	651000	Before we get there, though,
651000	652000	to the Cooking with Unity guys,
652000	654000	which, quick plug for their site, of course,
654000	655000	if you want to look at their videos,
655000	657000	you know, when you're done with the show, of course,
657000	660000	cookingwithunity.com just takes you right to their YouTube page.
660000	662000	Yeah, they also have a Patreon,
662000	665000	and also, I believe, YouTube slash pushypixels
665000	667000	is their channel, I want to say.
667000	670000	Alright, we'll let them plug all their stuff they want to plug.
670000	671000	They got Twitters and all that stuff.
671000	673000	We'll get that a little later on,
673000	676000	but let's get into, we got to talk about video gaming,
676000	677000	and what's been going on,
677000	682000	because this week was a little less crazy than last week.
682000	684000	Obviously, last week was a very atypical week
684000	690000	for a December news pattern with the PlayStation experience going on
690000	692000	and the game awards happening.
692000	694000	We had a lot of news come in last week,
694000	697000	so things have started to slow down a little bit this week,
697000	700000	but there's still quite a bit going on,
700000	704000	and so I want to talk about this big one to start,
704000	708000	because this is something that's outside of even just gaming.
708000	711000	This is something that has started with something you've heard about
711000	712000	on the nightly news.
712000	713000	You've heard about it everywhere,
713000	717000	and that is about the hack that took place of Sony Pictures.
717000	722000	The two are not tied together, Sony Pictures and PlayStation,
722000	724000	other than the obvious partnership,
724000	726000	because at the end of the day, it's the same parent company,
726000	729000	so a lot of the stuff they pitch to you on the PlayStation Network
729000	732000	are movies made by Sony Pictures, right?
732000	735000	But that's, I mean, just because Sony Pictures got hacked,
735000	739000	it didn't really affect the PlayStation side of things at all,
739000	743000	but certainly this is the second time in less than five years
743000	748000	that Sony has had to deal with a major, major hacking issue,
748000	753000	and there's been a lot of stuff exposed because of this hack,
753000	756000	and some of that has to do with very tabloid sorts of stuff,
756000	759000	like what did this director say in this confidential email
759000	762000	about Angelina Jolie and so forth,
762000	767000	but it's also been very interesting into how Hollywood really works,
767000	770000	and it's really been eye-opening for a lot of people,
770000	773000	not always in a positive way.
773000	776000	And certainly there's an ethical debate to be had about that,
776000	781000	about should we be analyzing all this stuff that came out of a hack,
781000	784000	but I don't really want to have that debate today
784000	789000	because I can't really talk about should it or should it not have happened.
789000	794000	It did happen, and now all this stuff is out there for us to sort of analyze,
795000	798000	and us turning our back to it and saying,
798000	801000	La-la-la, it didn't happen is not going to necessarily make it go away, right?
801000	806000	So that all being said, one of the big things that's catching a lot of gamers' attention
806000	811000	is this talk of is Sony about to make a Super Mario Bros. movie,
811000	816000	and how the fuck does that even work when Super Mario Bros. is a Nintendo thing?
816000	818000	Nintendo has said we're never doing a movie again
818000	821000	because that John Leguizamo Bob Hoskins movie was so bad,
821000	823000	Dennis Hopper, right, in that too.
823000	825000	It was so, so bad we're never doing a movie again.
825000	829000	How does it even work when Nintendo teams up with their quote-unquote enemy to make a movie?
829000	831000	Now quickly, if you haven't heard about this,
831000	834000	some of the information that came out of the Sony Pictures hack
834000	839000	were some emails that went back and forth between producer Avi Arad
839000	842000	to Sony studio chief Amy Pascal.
842000	846000	And in the emails, which were dated, like this is recent.
846000	850000	This is not like, this is a project that happened four years ago that got shelved,
850000	852000	this email was from October 23rd.
852000	857000	And the producer said, I am the proud father of Mario the Animated Film.
857000	862000	And he sent pictures with Shigeru Miyamoto, Satoru Iwata,
862000	867000	and one of them actually said, happy CEO, let's get together, it's the mother lode.
867000	873000	So essentially this producer went over to Japan, had a meeting with the Nintendo higher-ups,
873000	877000	and apparently, and we were having to kind of read between the lines a little bit,
877000	881000	you know, again, consider that this information, we're not supposed to know.
881000	884000	We are not supposed to know this, but it got out.
884000	886000	So take it with a huge grain of salt.
886000	890000	But apparently what happened, the Sony producer went over there,
890000	892000	or the producer went over there and pitched the movie.
892000	894000	It's supposed to be an animated film.
894000	896000	Yeah, I was going to say, I could see that as an animated film.
896000	900000	Which also makes a little more sense as to why Nintendo might be on board,
900000	903000	because it wouldn't necessarily be like a live action thing.
903000	907000	Nintendo has been experimenting a little bit with the animated film.
907000	912000	They had the Pikmin movies that showed up at that Japanese film festival
912000	914000	that Miyamoto actually was a big part of.
914000	919000	So certainly Nintendo's dipping their toe in the water of these animated films.
919000	922000	But I'm sure a lot of people are asking, well, why Sony?
922000	925000	But, well, why not Sony?
925000	927000	Because they're a motion picture studio.
927000	929000	They've got, you know, an animation studio.
929000	932000	Nintendo doesn't have an animation studio.
932000	937000	I mean, so your choices are, I think, I mean, I don't know if they're limited,
937000	939000	but if you're looking at really big animation studios,
939000	944000	I mean, you've got Pixar and Sony Pictures Animation, DreamWorks Animation,
944000	946000	and there's a lot of other smaller ones out there.
946000	949000	But, I mean, it makes sense.
949000	952000	I mean, look at, and also kind of look at how they treated their properties.
952000	955000	You know, Sony, I mean, they've got a Ratchet and Clank movie coming out
955000	957000	that looks pretty awesome.
957000	962000	And I don't know about the, what was it, the other PlayStation 3 title
962000	964000	that they made an animated movie, whatever.
964000	965000	That one wasn't that great,
965000	969000	but the source of material wasn't that great to begin with either.
969000	970000	Let me jump in here in the chat room
970000	973000	because a lot of people saying this in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
973000	975000	and Rama starting us off saying,
975000	978000	Sony Pictures is technically different from SCEI,
978000	981000	so it's plausible for this to happen.
981000	984000	And, yeah, I think that's the important thing is that even though at the end of the day
984000	988000	you have Sony, and then these are different divisions of Sony,
988000	993000	that agreement that Nintendo may or may not have with Sony Pictures
993000	996000	doesn't necessarily have to carry over into PlayStation.
996000	1000000	Like, and I'm sure that is very explicitly stated in the contract.
1000000	1005000	This does not mean that Mario's going to show up on the PlayStation,
1005000	1007000	so get those fanboy images out of your head.
1007000	1010000	You're not going to have Super Mario the Game,
1010000	1012000	or Super Mario the Movie the Game.
1012000	1014000	What was it called when they did it with Street Fighter II?
1014000	1016000	The movie was, the game was so bad.
1016000	1017000	It was Street Fighter the Movie the Game.
1017000	1018000	Street Fighter the Movie the Game.
1018000	1020000	You're not going to have Super Mario Brothers the Movie the Game
1020000	1021000	show up on the PlayStation 4.
1021000	1023000	That's not going to happen.
1023000	1026000	And I bet Nintendo has that all very clamped.
1026000	1031000	There would be no, and Nintendo probably has 100% control over the merchandise
1031000	1034000	because merchandising is something Nintendo really wants to get into now,
1034000	1038000	probably especially after what's going on with all this amiibo crap that we get in later.
1038000	1039000	I got to say it.
1039000	1041000	Merchandising.
1041000	1042000	Right?
1042000	1048000	So I'm sure the agreement is very much this is about a movie and only a movie.
1048000	1053000	And, you know, but as they say in the email, it's the mother lode.
1053000	1057000	I mean, an animated Super Mario Brothers movie,
1057000	1058000	I mean, there's an instant audience for that.
1058000	1060000	You don't even need to see a trailer for it.
1060000	1061000	You really don't.
1061000	1063000	Heavenly Sword was the title I was thinking of,
1063000	1066000	because they did a direct-to-video animated movie and it was just crap,
1066000	1070000	but Heavenly Sword wasn't that great to begin with.
1070000	1071000	Yeah.
1071000	1072000	Directed to you in chat saying,
1072000	1074000	who was behind Final Fantasy The Spirits Within?
1074000	1075000	Was that Sony?
1075000	1076000	That was Sony.
1076000	1080000	Yeah, but Square Pictures was a part of that.
1080000	1083000	That was a division that Square created and faded away real quick.
1083000	1086000	A company that I wish would really do more stuff,
1086000	1087000	because it wasn't bad.
1087000	1089000	It was just not Final Fantasy.
1089000	1093000	It's just they kind of it's as much Final Fantasy as was like,
1093000	1097000	I don't know, the Castlevania game.
1097000	1100000	Honestly, there was a lot in that movie that was kind of ahead of its time,
1100000	1101000	but we digress here a little bit.
1101000	1106000	So what do you guys think when you hear about a Super Mario Brothers animated movie?
1106000	1109000	Do you think this is something that should happen,
1109000	1112000	or let's stop with these video games?
1112000	1113000	Video games should be video games.
1113000	1114000	Movies should be movies.
1114000	1117000	When they cross over, it rarely does well.
1117000	1119000	No, no, I think it's fine.
1119000	1120000	I mean, especially if it's animated.
1120000	1122000	That'd be fine, because it's when you do the live-action stuff
1122000	1124000	that doesn't really make any sense.
1124000	1127000	Look at how many Pokémon movies have we had.
1127000	1131000	I mean, seriously, it's based off a game, so there's no problems there.
1131000	1133000	I don't see why this would be a problem.
1133000	1135000	Animal Crossing movie, I don't know.
1135000	1137000	I didn't see it, but I heard it wasn't bad.
1140000	1145000	My biggest concern about a Mario movie would be the voice of Mario
1145000	1149000	would be so, so important, because Mario, I mean, Mario has a very distinctive voice.
1149000	1150000	Obviously, Charles Martin.
1150000	1152000	Of course, it's going to be still him in the movie.
1153000	1159000	But Charles Martinet never says anything besides the wahoo, yahoo, and all those voices.
1159000	1161000	Mario doesn't really have...
1161000	1162000	He'll just get Troy Baker to do it.
1162000	1165000	He does everybody, so that's fine. He can do it.
1165000	1170000	But I can imagine that Charles Martinet is going to be asked to voice the entire movie.
1170000	1174000	With all due respect to the fantabulous man that Charles Martinet is,
1174000	1181000	I would just think that Sony would probably want to barter for some name-recognizable talent
1181000	1183000	as painful as that is for a lot of you guys to hear.
1183000	1186000	That's the reality of the harsh business in Hollywood.
1186000	1191000	Look at some of those other emails about Andrew Garfield and Spider-Man for what I'm talking about.
1191000	1192000	I think it'll be fine.
1192000	1197000	Just like, you know, there are people that can do the Mario voice that aren't him.
1197000	1205000	Right, and I do think, well, Captain Lou, rest in peace, also pulled off an amazing Mario.
1205000	1210000	It was a different Mario, but it was an amazing, memorable Mario that was a big part of our childhood.
1210000	1215000	So to say that nobody else besides Charles Martinet can portray Mario would not exactly be right,
1215000	1219000	because Captain Lou had a different, but awesome Mario.
1219000	1224000	But that's where we get into the tricky thing, because if we bring in another talent,
1224000	1227000	then should it be different from the Mario we know in the games?
1227000	1228000	Here's the tricky thing is...
1228000	1229000	Then is it really based off the game?
1229000	1232000	Here's the tricky thing is when you bring in talent and they're better than the source material.
1232000	1233000	Perfect example.
1233000	1235000	Heath Ledger as the Joker.
1235000	1239000	No one's going to be able to compare to Jack Nicklaus' Joker.
1239000	1241000	He was fantastic, and then...
1241000	1243000	I mean, the guy that played golf.
1243000	1244000	Jack Nicholson.
1244000	1245000	Jack Nicholson, whatever, yes.
1245000	1246000	The golf guy was good, too.
1246000	1252000	But anyways, Jack Nicholson, you know, hey, I'm a fan of both, so that's fine.
1252000	1255000	So, you know, no one can compare to him.
1255000	1257000	Heath Ledger, that's a terrible casting.
1257000	1262000	And then they saw it and they're like, oh, never mind.
1262000	1264000	No one's going to be able to...
1264000	1269000	Now when, you know, the next, you know, was it the Batman Superman movie comes out, you know,
1269000	1272000	now it's like, I think there's going to be another Joker in there.
1272000	1274000	Or, I don't know, Suicide Squad.
1274000	1279000	Yeah, the new Joker's in Suicide Squad, and that, I mean, not to digress into a movie podcast,
1279000	1282000	but I mean, they're lining up some huge talent for that movie.
1282000	1284000	They're talking about Will Smith in that movie.
1284000	1290000	And I don't know if it's fan wank or whatever, but there's been talk about Oprah playing Amanda...
1290000	1293000	What's... Jamie, who's the head of the Suicide Squad?
1293000	1296000	Well, it's DC. I mean, who's the head of the Suicide Squad? Amanda?
1296000	1300000	This is why I give you this flat look, like, the fuck do I read DC? No.
1300000	1304000	Okay, well they're talking about putting Oprah Winfrey in the damn movie, and I'm like,
1304000	1307000	is she really going to be... But then the comic book movies are huge.
1307000	1309000	Oprah was in The Color Purple.
1309000	1310000	Yeah, I know, I know.
1310000	1311000	She was awesome in The Color Purple.
1311000	1315000	If there was going to be a real-life Suicide Squad run by, like, you know, a powerful woman,
1315000	1317000	then yes, Oprah I could see doing that.
1317000	1319000	But anyway, and then who's the...
1319000	1321000	What is the guy's name that got to play the Joker?
1321000	1322000	Jared Leto.
1322000	1326000	Who I think all the way back to... Wasn't he on My So-Called Life?
1326000	1327000	Wasn't that where he started?
1327000	1328000	I don't remember, but...
1328000	1331000	Or one of those, like, 90s shows or something.
1331000	1335000	And then he did the band. He had that band for a while, and now he's doing this.
1335000	1337000	And so he's going to be the Joker, and now you're right.
1337000	1340000	Everybody's going to inevitably compare him to...
1340000	1341000	Heath Ledger.
1341000	1342000	Heath Ledger.
1342000	1345000	Same with Batman. I mean, Batman, they've been doing that, you know, comparing...
1345000	1346000	It's true.
1346000	1349000	It's just, it's a different take on it, and honestly...
1349000	1350000	I don't know, I think...
1350000	1352000	Amanda Waller, thank you.
1352000	1355000	So that's why I'm not seeing if they come out with...
1355000	1357000	If he's going to have a different voice in the movie.
1357000	1358000	It's not a big deal.
1358000	1359000	I don't think it's going to...
1359000	1362000	As long as it works, I don't have a problem with it.
1362000	1363000	Yeah.
1363000	1367000	If it's really weird, then yeah, that's going to be...
1367000	1369000	Okay.
1369000	1373000	What other quick thought on this, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.
1373000	1375000	This could be interesting.
1375000	1378000	I mean, who knows what's going to happen because of the hack now.
1378000	1382000	Mario may get cold feet and pull out of this all together, and the hack may have fucked this movie.
1382000	1383000	I mean, who knows?
1383000	1384000	No, I doubt it.
1384000	1387000	Movies end up in development hell all the time.
1387000	1392000	Just because this conversation happened doesn't mean the movie was ever, ever going to end up really being a thing.
1392000	1394000	But it does open this interesting door.
1394000	1401000	I mean, if Mario's going to end up being an animated thing, you know, every Friday on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show...
1401000	1403000	What did they have every Friday?
1403000	1405000	The Zelda cartoon.
1405000	1410000	Screw that show Monday through Thursday. It was all about Friday with no disrespect to Captain Lou.
1410000	1414000	But it really was all about Fridays and the Zelda cartoon.
1414000	1419000	And again, creating that very distinctive character that wasn't necessarily the same one from the games.
1419000	1422000	Excuse me, princess.
1422000	1425000	When has that ever been uttered in one of the games?
1425000	1427000	They really should reference that.
1427000	1428000	They really should, actually.
1428000	1431000	But anyway, you can see the point I'm getting to.
1431000	1435000	If a Nintendo Mario movie comes out, could Sony soon make a Zelda movie?
1435000	1439000	Is an animated Zelda movie the type of thing you guys would want to see?
1439000	1446000	Or do we need to see IGN's April Fools trailer from six years ago expanded into a full movie?
1446000	1448000	Both.
1448000	1449000	You want both.
1449000	1458000	Also, speaking of IGN, I would also like to see their series. What was it? The Hogwarts Detective series or whatever that they had?
1458000	1464000	Where it was like a cop drama set in the Harry Potter world. Yeah, I'd totally be down for that, too.
1464000	1469000	Alan Alchemy in our chat room confirming that Jared Little's big break was my so-called life.
1469000	1472000	Thank god I haven't forgot my 90s pop culture trivia. Phew.
1472000	1475000	I could still kick butt in a game of Trivial Pursuit.
1475000	1479000	Some various people in chat talking about Amanda Waller and the different portrayals.
1479000	1483000	We have Brad from Pod Culture coming right out and saying, fuck the new 52.
1483000	1488000	So, not always popular, the reboot there.
1488000	1491000	So anyway, and Akuma JP singing along.
1491000	1494000	Friday, Friday, gotta get down.
1494000	1495000	No. Stop.
1495000	1499000	You know what? She did a sequel song called Saturday and it was actually kind of good.
1499000	1501000	She milked that 15 minutes of fame.
1502000	1505000	Well, the Saturday one is totally just making fun of Friday, but it was pretty funny.
1505000	1509000	Back to the movie chat. We get on tangents sometimes on the show. Back to the movie chat.
1509000	1510000	What you don't say?
1510000	1514000	Dark Sakura, Mario animated movies, is that something you'd be down for?
1514000	1518000	I think the Robitussin face that I just made sort of applies to that, too.
1518000	1522000	So no, that was a very much do not want or it's nope o'clock face.
1522000	1525000	It might be good for me, but I don't really want it.
1526000	1530000	I'd be down with a Mario movie as long as it's set in like the Super Mario RPG universe,
1530000	1533000	because they had some pretty awesome characters for that.
1533000	1534000	All right.
1534000	1538000	I do kind of miss the old Super Show cartoon, because that was fun.
1538000	1542000	Actually, the ones I liked were the Saturday morning ones that was set in the Mario world.
1542000	1544000	Oh yeah, the later ones, right?
1544000	1547000	Yeah, those were good. Those were good. I like those.
1547000	1551000	All right, well, we will maybe see what comes of this, because my other big question,
1551000	1554000	would it be traditional cell animation like the old cartoons,
1554000	1559000	or would it be like that more modern CGI, Viva Pinata looking thing?
1559000	1561000	Well, I was actually going to say if they did a Zelda one,
1561000	1566000	it would have to be a bit more serious and not the 80s cartoon style.
1566000	1571000	Right. Viva Pinata. There's a franchise that Microsoft really wanted to force down our throats
1571000	1574000	into becoming popular. It just didn't happen.
1574000	1579000	I'd like to see something the way that you know how Street Fighter IV is done,
1579000	1583000	with that sort of 3D yet 2D-esque.
1583000	1586000	Kind of that jump out at you animation?
1586000	1590000	Right, where it's got the appearance of cell shading, but not quite.
1590000	1591000	A comic book in motion.
1591000	1592000	Yeah.
1592000	1593000	That's kind of what that looks like to me.
1593000	1594000	Or like Borderlands.
1594000	1595000	Yeah.
1595000	1600000	So, was it a cartoon shading with an outline?
1600000	1602000	Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS, basically.
1602000	1606000	I just think that it would lend itself well to Zelda.
1606000	1607000	All right.
1607000	1609000	If it was going to be an animated thing.
1609000	1612000	Some quick comments from chat to wrap this all up,
1612000	1613000	and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.
1613000	1615000	Because it is a show where every gamer has a voice,
1615000	1616000	and some of the voices in chat right now.
1616000	1617000	Raginator says,
1617000	1622000	Hell, I'll take any Zelda movie, live-action or animated, so long as it's good.
1622000	1626000	Rama saying a live-action Super Mario Brothers movie would be great,
1626000	1629000	provided it's his fantasy setting like Willow.
1629000	1630000	And some comments on Viva Pinata.
1630000	1633000	YYR saying Viva Pinata was actually a pretty good game.
1633000	1635000	Magma Lemur. I don't think I've seen that before.
1635000	1636000	Magma Lemur.
1636000	1637000	Magma Lemur, sorry.
1637000	1641000	Saying Viva Pinata was a fine game.
1641000	1643000	And if I remember correctly,
1643000	1646000	I want to say it's one of the free games of gold games that's coming up pretty soon.
1646000	1647000	I think it was a while ago.
1647000	1648000	A while ago.
1648000	1649000	Oh yeah, because I didn't download it.
1649000	1651000	I'm like, Viva Pinata.
1651000	1655000	I played it when it came out.
1655000	1656000	All right.
1656000	1658000	We're going to get into our gaming weeks.
1658000	1659000	We've got plenty more news to get to,
1659000	1661000	but let's talk about our gaming weeks first
1661000	1663000	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week
1664000	1666000	to help you establish, like where's our head at
1666000	1667000	when we're talking about all these games this week?
1667000	1670000	What games have been filling our brains this week?
1670000	1672000	Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.
1672000	1674000	I've been playing a lot of Dragon Age.
1674000	1675000	Oh yes.
1675000	1676000	A lot.
1676000	1677000	A lot.
1677000	1681000	I hit 40 hours on my starting my second playthrough.
1681000	1682000	And she's still in the Hinterlands.
1682000	1683000	No, I'm not.
1683000	1688000	Actually, I keep going back to the Hinterlands whenever I need elf root.
1688000	1690000	Although I did find, of all places,
1690000	1693000	a really good place to get elf root and blood lotus
1693000	1696000	in the western approach in the desert.
1696000	1698000	Why 40 hours?
1698000	1701000	What has grabbed you about this game for 40 hours?
1701000	1703000	I'm just running around doing shit.
1703000	1704000	Really.
1704000	1706000	I'm MMOing it.
1706000	1708000	It keeps you a busy bee?
1708000	1709000	I'm MMOing the lawn.
1709000	1713000	So Dragon Age, I almost want to say Dragon Age Origins,
1713000	1716000	but Dragon Age Inquisition is like an MMO without the other people.
1716000	1717000	Exactly.
1717000	1718000	That makes it perfect.
1719000	1721000	I'm serious.
1721000	1726000	Because then I can just have, because I run it through Steam so I can screen shot it.
1726000	1734000	After this playthrough though, I'm going to go in and set up the cinematic tools.
1734000	1737000	So I can go in and take pretty screen caps and whatnot.
1737000	1743000	But I've been doing this odd thing where because I've been delirious on coding for the last couple of days,
1743000	1746000	I've been creating my own dialogue in my head.
1747000	1754000	So now my Inquisitor is just this utter airhead who's like, everyone's like,
1754000	1756000	we're dying, we're being killed.
1756000	1758000	She's like, look, I found blood lotus.
1758000	1759000	Help me gather.
1759000	1762000	But the quillbacks, blood lotus.
1762000	1765000	Is that like when Alan and I watch the nightly news and we mute it
1765000	1768000	and then we just talk instead of the anchors when they're saying to each other?
1768000	1770000	That sounds awesome.
1770000	1772000	We're really good at that game, by the way.
1772000	1775000	I've actually just been tempted to make a stupid video.
1775000	1778000	I've been tempted to make a stupid Tumblr just for the weird dialogue
1778000	1780000	that goes on in my head during that game.
1780000	1784000	I've already started putting some on my regular Tumblr and I'm like, I can't.
1784000	1785000	I don't know.
1785000	1789000	D-A-I-M-H. Dragon Age in my head.
1789000	1796000	Well, actually a few someones have said, are you going to do Dragon LoL?
1796000	1797000	Like you do LoL Effect?
1797000	1799000	And I'm like, fuck no.
1799000	1802000	Do you know how long it takes me just to think of something for Mass Effect?
1802000	1804000	Haven't you talked about, you were mentioning to me the other day,
1804000	1807000	you were trying to do some broadcasting with it, but it was kind of bumpy.
1807000	1809000	No, no, no. I wasn't trying to do broadcasting.
1809000	1811000	Raginator kept wanting to watch me play.
1811000	1813000	Oh.
1813000	1816000	And it worked fine a couple of times, but every other time it's like,
1816000	1821000	freeze the game and it would eventually unfreeze and I could save this last time.
1821000	1824000	Here I was freshly on a dose of Coding Cough syrup
1824000	1832000	and when I am on opiates, I will switch from moods like you will not believe.
1832000	1836000	And I was like, I can't, I can't, I got to turn off the game.
1836000	1839000	It better save. My last save corrupted. What am I going to do?
1839000	1841000	And then it worked.
1841000	1845000	And then I ended up playing like another fucking 15 minutes.
1845000	1849000	That's probably the whole conflict between the fact that Dragon Age is not really a Steam game
1849000	1851000	because it's all on Origin.
1851000	1857000	And then I was like, but wait, I play this game so I don't have to play with other people.
1857000	1860000	I don't want anyone to watch. Watch me run around in circles.
1860000	1861000	Well, turn off the broadcasting then.
1861000	1864000	Well, no, I'm gonna, I'm just going to deny him in the future.
1864000	1869000	But like half the thing that I do is like, can I jump up on this cliff?
1869000	1872000	I found half the shit I found by trying to climb rocks.
1872000	1877000	I just keep, I keep my broadcast channel open all the time.
1877000	1880000	I don't care. I still try to do that.
1880000	1883000	If somebody wants to watch me stream when I'm playing, then that's fine.
1883000	1885000	I am not an exhibitionist like you, Rob.
1885000	1887000	Well, but I always say, don't expect me to entertain you.
1887000	1892000	Like if I do a Twitch stream, then I'm going to be on cam and make witty commentary.
1892000	1895000	But if you're going to tap in and watch me playing something on Steam,
1895000	1897000	that's what you're going to see is me playing something on Steam.
1897000	1902000	I'm not, you know, I'm usually trying to relax and do that.
1902000	1908000	But at any rate, my big thing lately is I'm just really running around and exploring.
1908000	1913000	You know, I want to, I'm actually customizing my castle right now, which is like,
1913000	1917000	oh, we've got this big guy out of here with red shit growing out of his face.
1917000	1920000	We got to stop him or he's going to destroy the world.
1920000	1923000	And I'm like, blood Lotus.
1926000	1929000	All hail Skyhold. It is the best castle ever.
1929000	1931000	I will decorate it with all the things.
1931000	1935000	Can you quickly tell us about that funny thing we were talking about on Steam chat the other day,
1935000	1937000	the staff of sad or whatever it was called.
1937000	1939000	The sad weapon.
1940000	1942000	Whoa.
1942000	1946000	I have, I have slayed dark soccer with this sad weapon.
1946000	1949000	It's like Mark something mace.
1949000	1952000	It's a banana nailed to a stick.
1952000	1958000	You find a schematic for it and it requires three sad splinters to make it.
1958000	1963000	It is a banana nailed to a stick.
1963000	1967000	So I've decided that maybe if, if, you know,
1967000	1971000	when a gamer X happens this next year,
1971000	1976000	I'm actually thinking about doing some kind of dwarf cosplay because I'm short and you know,
1976000	1981000	buxom and I have decided that if I cosplay a dwarf,
1981000	1983000	she's going to carry around the sad weapon.
1983000	1984000	Nice.
1984000	1986000	The banana on a stick.
1986000	1988000	The question is who will get it.
1988000	1992000	But I bet that there'll be a lot of people probably that actually get that.
1992000	1997000	So I also have a slight regret and that's putting a Varick in the scout meal
1997000	2002000	because he needs to show off his, his carpeted chest,
2002000	2004000	his carpeted dwarven chest.
2004000	2005000	All right.
2005000	2006000	Manly chest hairs.
2006000	2007000	All right.
2007000	2008000	I played other shit.
2008000	2009000	Okay.
2009000	2010000	Well God, you could talk for three hours just about dragon age.
2010000	2014000	Clearly I played some final fantasy today so that I wouldn't get kicked out.
2014000	2015000	14.
2015000	2016000	Right?
2016000	2017000	Yes.
2017000	2019000	So I wouldn't get kicked out.
2019000	2022000	And um, I've played some flux.
2022000	2023000	Okay.
2023000	2028000	And I have an odd addiction to a game called Moonlight Mahjong.
2028000	2033000	Makes me feel like I'm 70 years old, but I fucking love that game.
2033000	2040000	I have no idea why, but whenever I just need something mindless to do, it's Moonlight Mahjong.
2040000	2041000	That's it.
2041000	2042000	Awesome.
2042000	2043000	All right.
2043000	2045000	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2045000	2052000	I just, my son has been playing a ton of Lego Marvel superheroes, so I had to play the game too.
2052000	2055000	So I finished the game, at least the story portion of it.
2055000	2058000	And I'm still trying to, I guess trying to platinum it.
2058000	2063000	But the thing is, now that I've been playing it more, I'm starting to notice all the bugs.
2063000	2070000	And um, yeah, it's, first off, okay, I had to reinstall the game because it crashed,
2070000	2074000	it would crash like all the time and it was really annoying.
2074000	2077000	So I finally reinstalled it and that seems to fix that part.
2077000	2082000	But now I'm getting weird glitch issues where, you know, I'll play as a character or something.
2082000	2086000	And like I had one the other day where I couldn't control the character very well.
2086000	2089000	Like it would only go in one direction and not the other directions.
2089000	2094000	And end up having to kill him with another character in order to get control of him again.
2094000	2096000	But um, what else?
2096000	2101000	Oh, and then for some reason, they have like these racing segments you have to do in the game.
2101000	2108000	And the flying controls aren't very good, so you either go slow or you go super fast and can't control it.
2108000	2115000	And you know, trying to go a little bit faster or just kind of control things, it just goes out of control very often.
2115000	2118000	And the racing, they have racing controls.
2118000	2123000	So your driving controls are just, you know, gas break and left right and that's steers.
2123000	2126000	Okay, well that's how it is for the cars.
2126000	2129000	But then they have these little RC car type things where they're like,
2129000	2133000	Hey, you know what, let's just fucking change the steering control altogether.
2133000	2138000	Let's just have it gas break and then you have to push in the direction that you want to go.
2138000	2144000	So like if I want to turn and I'm going to the left, I have to push down, which makes no fucking sense.
2144000	2152000	And so I was getting super frustrated with it because I'm trying to go, it's literally like just an oval track that happens to be on a roof.
2152000	2155000	But the car just veers off the edge and just flies into the ground.
2155000	2158000	I'm like, fuck this, I don't want that stupid car that this thing unlocks.
2158000	2166000	Anyways, but I can't get platinum in the game if I don't finish it and it's really annoying.
2166000	2175000	But it's fun. I have been unlocking some characters, you know, my son's now a fan of the song that plays.
2175000	2183000	Well, in the credits and also in the home screen for the game, which is the Mary Marvel marching song or something like that.
2183000	2191000	It's basically, I think, the Stanley's fan club's official song or something. So he's like really into that.
2191000	2197000	And then he's been enjoying playing Loki because now I have Loki unlocked. So it's fun.
2197000	2199000	And then I finally figured out how to customize my character.
2199000	2205000	So I have a character with Thor's hammer and Loki's helmet and a goatee and stuff.
2205000	2210000	That sounds awesome that you've been able to be doing a lot of gaming with your kid.
2210000	2216000	Yeah, he's been very obsessed with it though. Like he gets mad if you have to turn the game off.
2216000	2219000	So yeah, we're working on that. But yeah, he can actually play it now.
2219000	2225000	I'm just trying to get him to be able to do it without me having to help him.
2225000	2228000	Switching characters is what he has trouble with usually.
2228000	2231000	Alright. My gaming week, if you're all done.
2231000	2232000	I am.
2232000	2235000	My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff to talk to you guys about.
2235000	2239000	I've been playing a lot of the same stuff, you know, because not a lot of new stuff's come out.
2239000	2246000	I've continued to play Final Fantasy XIV, which I decided to level a gladiator who's now a paladin for no particular reason.
2246000	2252000	But Alan made my little female lala, I play a little female lala, an entire set of all-pink armor.
2252000	2256000	So I look adorable. So that's kind of one thing I've been doing in Final Fantasy XIV.
2256000	2259000	I played Geometry Wars 3 earlier this week.
2259000	2264000	And I actually played over SharePlay because Extifer saw me playing and he's like,
2264000	2268000	I don't know much about that game, but I really like twin-stick shooters because he's really into super stardust.
2268000	2271000	So Extifer, if you listen to my other show, Hoard House, you know Extifer.
2271000	2273000	He was like, can we do the SharePlay thing?
2273000	2274000	And I was like, sure.
2274000	2278000	So we hopped on SharePlay and then I realized, oh, he doesn't just have to watch me.
2278000	2281000	Geometry Wars has that whole co-op built in.
2281000	2287000	And it has the, you can play online mode, but then there's also the couch co-op.
2287000	2290000	But thanks to SharePlay, you don't really need the couch.
2290000	2291000	You can have the virtual couch.
2291000	2294000	So we actually played a little bit of that and it actually ran.
2294000	2296000	You would think there'd be a lot of lag, especially in a shooter.
2296000	2302000	It ran really well and Extifer was able to hold his own pretty good on Geometry Wars over SharePlay.
2302000	2309000	So thumbs up to that SharePlay technology because it's really unlocking new uses in these games.
2309000	2314000	So being able to play Geometry Wars on the big virtual couch was a really awesome thing.
2314000	2315000	So that was cool.
2315000	2316000	So more Geometry Wars 3.
2316000	2323000	And then one new but not really new thing that I've been playing a lot of this week,
2323000	2324000	and this might surprise some of you guys.
2324000	2330000	I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIII on Steam.
2330000	2335000	As you guys probably know, Final Fantasy XIII came out on Steam a couple months ago
2335000	2340000	and a lot of people weren't happy with it because it had some really weird issues with the graphics.
2340000	2346000	Such as you could play in a window that was 720 pixels, that's it.
2346000	2350000	Or you could play it full screen, 720 pixels, that's it.
2350000	2353000	And there was just a lot of weird, crappy bugs with it.
2353000	2356000	Well, they released this week a graphic patch.
2356000	2361000	So now you can play in a window that's 720 pixels or you can play in a 1080 pixel window.
2361000	2365000	And they actually have the 1080p modes are kind of in this now.
2365000	2369000	And you can play a whole lot of custom resolutions full screen.
2369000	2373000	So I can play my native resolution full screen, which is what I've been doing.
2373000	2376000	And the game looks great.
2376000	2380000	Now not everything in the game is 1080p because like some of the pre-rendered movies and things like that,
2380000	2383000	like that is stuck at the way they were rendered.
2383000	2385000	They haven't really gone back and upped any of those things.
2385000	2389000	But I'll tell you what, maybe it's because my machine's a little newer.
2389000	2391000	I upgraded a lot of it this year.
2391000	2395000	But some parts of the game run smoother at like 60 frames a second,
2395000	2398000	like smoother than it does on the PlayStation 3.
2398000	2404000	And just the way a lot of the colors and things are kind of even more vibrant on a computer monitor
2404000	2407000	than they are necessarily on the TV while I'm playing on the PlayStation 3,
2407000	2413000	I can just sit there and just watch the beauty of this game really unfold.
2413000	2416000	And I know the game itself gets a lot of shit for some of its characters
2416000	2421000	and the fact that the first few hours of the game is press A to win type of thing.
2421000	2426000	But I think if you can get over that little hurdle, there's a really great story in there
2426000	2428000	that's a lot of fun to experience.
2428000	2431000	And I'm having fun kind of going back and experiencing it again
2431000	2436000	because this is really my second full proper playthrough.
2436000	2440000	And I'm noticing a bunch of shit this time that I didn't notice the first time,
2440000	2443000	such as characters that don't show up until partway through the game
2443000	2446000	are actually in the game early on if you look for them.
2446000	2450000	They're in the background or like in a side type of thing, but they're there.
2450000	2453000	So I'm kind of having fun looking at that.
2453000	2459000	So kudos to Square for putting out that patch that actually fixed the damn game.
2459000	2463000	Mostly, though, I do have one thing I've got to still complain about,
2463000	2468000	and that is that I was really thrown a fit on Twitter and IRL
2468000	2471000	because I got the graphic patch installed and I started running it,
2471000	2473000	and I'm like, why is it skipping?
2473000	2477000	And what would happen is that it would run 20 frames skip, 20 frames skip.
2477000	2479000	And it was this very noticeable skip.
2479000	2482000	It would be like, go, stop, go, stop, go, stop.
2482000	2485000	It was just really, really annoying. I can't play the game like that.
2485000	2487000	It's too distracting.
2487000	2490000	Well, I get really frustrated, and I'm like, God damn it.
2490000	2493000	Why don't they put out a fucking demo so I can see that this is a piece of shit port
2493000	2496000	before I start playing it, da da da da da da.
2496000	2500000	And Alan looks over my shoulder and he goes, oh, I have that same problem,
2500000	2503000	and that's happening because your Xbox controller isn't plugged in.
2503000	2505000	If you plug it in, it'll stop doing that.
2505000	2510000	And I'm like, really? And I plugged it in, and sure enough, it stopped doing that.
2510000	2512000	That doesn't make any fucking sense.
2512000	2516000	That doesn't make any fucking sense, but swear to God, that's what fixed it.
2516000	2519000	And I don't know, I don't think an Xbox controller is required,
2519000	2522000	so I don't know if it's because I used one previously.
2522000	2527000	It shouldn't still cause any frame skips if it's an Xbox controller's plugged in.
2527000	2534000	Yeah, so a lot of that stuff was annoying to say the least,
2534000	2539000	but if you can clear some of those technical issues, the game is really good.
2539000	2545000	Not that I can necessarily give Square a buy on a lot of these issues that are just like,
2545000	2550000	really? Really? It skips if the controller's not plugged in, really?
2550000	2553000	There's a lot of those little issues that it's hard to give Square a buy on,
2553000	2557000	but if you can get past them, I would argue that the Final Fantasy 13 PC port
2557000	2560000	may actually be better than the PS3 port.
2560000	2564000	And I'm really excited to get into 13.2 at some point,
2564000	2569000	even though I hear not all the DLC carried over because of licensing issues.
2569000	2574000	I'm really excited to beat 13 and then get into 13.2, which just released on Steam this past week.
2574000	2578000	So there you go. I've been spending a lot of time playing 13.
2578000	2584000	I do have my broadcast channel open, so if you happen to see me online, you can jump in.
2584000	2589000	And I used to with Steam, I used to only accept people on my friends list that I knew,
2589000	2593000	like IRLs I used to beat, but I'm not such a stickler anymore,
2593000	2597000	so for whatever reason I said no to your request before, just request again and I'll accept.
2597000	2600000	So that broadcasting stuff is actually working now on Steam?
2600000	2606000	Yeah, it's working. It's not as rich as, say, Twitch, but what I can do is I can say,
2606000	2611000	I have a little thing that is, you check the box, and if a friend right-clicks my name
2611000	2615000	and wants to watch my game, then they can. It'll just start streaming the game to them.
2615000	2618000	Yeah, and it'll show me in the corner a little, because Alan and I are playing this a little bit,
2618000	2621000	because I want to see what it'll look like. It'll show a little record light in the corner,
2621000	2626000	it'll say one viewer or two viewers, whatever, and then in the top left in a really tiny font,
2626000	2628000	if anybody says something in chat, it'll show.
2628000	2634000	So it kind of uses that Steam overlay a little bit to be able to pop the important broadcasting information in there.
2634000	2639000	But there's still no webcam, there's still a lot to be desired for,
2639000	2643000	maybe a broadcaster that really, really wants to go pro.
2643000	2646000	So do you have to turn that on, or is that just on by default?
2646000	2647000	You can turn it off.
2647000	2650000	Because I can imagine that would use a lot of bandwidth if...
2650000	2654000	No, you can disable it altogether if you want. Most people have it set to the way that Jamie has it set,
2654000	2658000	where somebody can request to watch your stream.
2658000	2662000	But I just open my... if you're on my friends list, you can just tap in and watch whatever I'm playing.
2662000	2667000	But I just say, when I do a Twitch broadcast, that is performing.
2667000	2670000	That is, I'm going to talk through the game, I'm going to give some explanations,
2670000	2672000	I'm going to tell you what I'm thinking, and all that stuff.
2672000	2677000	When I'm Steam broadcasting a game, that's just you peeking in my window looking at my TV.
2677000	2679000	You know, I'm not going to...
2679000	2680000	That's a little stalker-ish.
2680000	2683000	It is a little stalker-y, but it's not like it's a webcam in my home,
2683000	2687000	it's just Final Fantasy XIII, so it's not too big a deal.
2687000	2693000	Alright, well, in just a couple minutes, we're going to get to our interview here,
2693000	2696000	but I think we have time to squeeze in one story.
2696000	2698000	Oh, I've got to do housekeeping real quick.
2698000	2702000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R, of course, and if you want to follow us on Facebook, you can.
2702000	2706000	Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and we're also on Google.
2706000	2710000	Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
2710000	2713000	And we are on YouTube as well, OrangeLoungeRadio,
2713000	2717000	and old episodes of the show available on YouTube.
2717000	2719000	Since I know we're interviewing a YouTube channel tonight,
2719000	2724000	we may have some YouTube people that are listening or viewing or what have you tonight,
2724000	2729000	so we do have the YouTube, although the YouTube is just static pictures
2729000	2731000	over the show that Jason puts together.
2731000	2736000	We do not at this time have a camera in our studio because it's OrangeLoungeRadio,
2736000	2737000	and we're really not that excited.
2737000	2741000	If you want to see me in gym shorts bundled up in a Snuggie, then so be it,
2741000	2744000	but otherwise it's not that interesting to look at, I don't think.
2744000	2747000	And I still need a haircut, so yes.
2747000	2751000	All right, you can see I did some light remodeling in Studio N7,
2751000	2754000	that arcade cabinet that Loki was complaining about last week.
2754000	2755000	Last time.
2755000	2757000	We finally got it lifted and on and working.
2757000	2759000	It's been a lot of fun, actually.
2759000	2760000	I was playing BurgerTime on it earlier.
2760000	2761000	Nice.
2761000	2763000	That's all I ever wanted was a BurgerTime cabinet in my house.
2763000	2765000	All right, let's get into some news.
2765000	2768000	We'll do one story here, and then we'll get to our interview tonight.
2768000	2771000	Okay, so Amiibos have been selling pretty well.
2771000	2772000	That's good for Nintendo.
2772000	2776000	I mean, I guess everybody will be willing to buy anything that's in figure form nowadays.
2776000	2784000	But apparently they've sold, well, Smash Brothers has sold nearly 700,000 copies,
2784000	2791000	and they're saying that apparently the Amiibos themselves have sold quite a few as it is,
2791000	2794000	almost as many copies as the game.
2794000	2799000	So, wow, you guys will really buy a lot of this stuff.
2799000	2800000	I don't know.
2800000	2802000	Personally, I just don't get the Amiibo thing.
2802000	2805000	I mean, it's a cool add-on.
2805000	2808000	I mean, if I want figure for my desk or something, that might be a cool thing to buy,
2808000	2811000	but the functionality is just not there for me.
2811000	2815000	I have a lot of Nintendo friends, like Nintendo fan friends, on my Twitter,
2815000	2817000	and let me tell you, the thirst is real for these things.
2817000	2822000	I have people, somebody I follow on Twitter actually said,
2822000	2825000	I am so frustrated over this, I'm going to cry,
2825000	2828000	because they couldn't find the figures that they want.
2828000	2831000	Like, I guess Nintendo released three new figures today,
2831000	2835000	the Little Mac and the Diddy Kong came out today, and Zelda.
2835000	2838000	Oh, yeah, because that's obviously one people want is Zelda.
2838000	2840000	And so people really want these figures, right?
2840000	2846000	But they're so hard to find because Nintendo and hardware equals lull.
2846000	2849000	And I guess these things are really hard to find,
2849000	2852000	and people are getting really, really frustrated at how hard these things are to get,
2852000	2855000	because now that we know Nintendo's pulling them from shelves,
2855000	2859000	you know, it's like maybe they're not going to get one.
2859000	2860000	I don't know.
2860000	2866000	Well, I think that you guys are just pointing to their hands if you ask me, but that's fine.
2866000	2873000	And yeah, they're saying Nintendo did confirm that they're discontinuing some Amiibo figures after initial shipments.
2873000	2877000	They're saying we will aim for certain Amiibos to always be available.
2877000	2881000	These will be for our most popular characters like Mario and Link.
2881000	2883000	Do the shelf space constraints.
2883000	2889000	Other figures will not return to the market once they've sold through their initial shipment.
2890000	2897000	I think that's a load of crap if you ask me, because I think that the reason they're doing that is not necessarily shelf space,
2897000	2904000	but they want you to feel the urge, like, oh crap, if I don't buy this right now, I'm never going to get it.
2904000	2907000	It's just like the fucking Wii U was.
2907000	2915000	They're trying to give you that impression that if you don't buy it now when you see it on that shelf, you're never going to get one.
2915000	2920000	I don't believe that for one second, because they know that they're making money off of this.
2920000	2922000	They're going to keep reprinting this.
2922000	2932000	If it's any indication, like they've done with other games, they will have variants that they'll make.
2932000	2937000	Or they'll be a different color one or something that comes out later on or something.
2939000	2947000	Of course, they're saying that certain Amiibos are sold out, and they may return later on.
2947000	2951000	They're saying that some Amiibos were very popularly launched, and possibly some Amiibos in the United States.
2951000	2955000	Canada and Latin America may not be available right now due to the high demand efforts.
2959000	2962000	I guess that's the expected, because people are really clamoring for these.
2962000	2967000	I don't understand why, but once again, it's Nintendo. People are fans of Nintendo.
2967000	2972000	I'm not going to buy for a second, though, that if there's an Amiibo that's sold out,
2973000	2980000	I don't think that there's any figure that's in low demand right now, so I'm just not buying that.
2980000	2983000	Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2983000	2987000	YYR says, I called Nintendo because of a problem redeeming a prepaid card.
2987000	2991000	I asked the phone rep about whether they were going to make more Wii U GameCube adapters.
2991000	2994000	Exact quote from rep. I know, right?
2994000	2998000	Bottom line, NOA has no clue as to whether more stuff is being made.
2998000	3001000	I would expect the same to be true of Amiibos.
3002000	3005000	Once again, I think their strategy, and this has been their strategy since the Wii came out...
3005000	3007000	To starve the market?
3007000	3009000	To starve the market to drive up demand.
3009000	3013000	It fucking worked, and people are buying into it, so why wouldn't they do it?
3013000	3018000	The fact that they're saying that, once we sell through this, we may not bring it back.
3018000	3022000	Yeah, I could see that as possible.
3022000	3027000	It's a possible scenario if you have an Amiibo figure that just is not popular.
3028000	3033000	Say that they came out with, I don't know, a Birdo figure or something, and no one fucking...
3033000	3035000	I will be fucking buying that thing once, bitch.
3035000	3038000	I understand that you would buy it, but let's just hypothetically throw out there.
3038000	3043000	How dare you? How dare you say that Birdo has no fans out there?
3043000	3045000	I'm not saying that Birdo doesn't have any fans.
3045000	3048000	I'm just trying to throw out a random new character.
3048000	3052000	I'm not going to go down the list of every single character in Mario games until we get to the...
3052000	3055000	Okay, I got one for you, Ice Climbers.
3055000	3058000	Aww, too soon, too soon.
3058000	3064000	I'm just saying, let's just say, hypothetically, that they have a character that's just not popular.
3064000	3066000	The dude in Hogan's Alley.
3066000	3068000	Because when has Nintendo ever revisited that game?
3068000	3069000	Alright, that's fine.
3069000	3074000	Dude from Hogan's Alley, or how about CDI Mario?
3074000	3076000	CDI Mario or Zelda.
3076000	3079000	Those are figures that they're either derpy, no one wants them.
3080000	3084000	Hypothetically speaking, yes, I can see if they're not selling, they're not going to make more.
3084000	3087000	Once they sell out of their initial shipment, that's it.
3087000	3088000	That's going to be gone.
3088000	3092000	But I think for any of these figures at launch, they're going to totally be restocking that stuff.
3092000	3094000	They're not just going to be...
3094000	3095000	Why would you do that?
3095000	3097000	Why would you stop selling a figure for the hell of it?
3097000	3101000	If it's selling through, you would keep doing it until it stops selling through.
3101000	3105000	I think if you're the person that's getting really frustrated at not being able to find these figures,
3105000	3107000	let Nintendo know.
3107000	3109000	Tweet them, email them.
3109000	3113000	I wouldn't necessarily say call them, because I don't think the people answering the phone can really...
3113000	3115000	Apparently they're in the same boat you guys are.
3115000	3117000	But make sure Nintendo knows.
3117000	3119000	You want these figures and they're not making enough of them.
3119000	3123000	And that's probably going to be the best thing to get another shipment.
3123000	3128000	That's how we ended up getting Earthbound on Virtual Console,
3128000	3133000	a western release of The Last Guardian and all these rainfall games.
3133000	3137000	Now, SSJ100Matt was saying, listen, Nintendo isn't losing money on them.
3137000	3140000	He was jerking people around like this and manipulating the market.
3140000	3142000	I don't think that they're...
3142000	3145000	They're not sitting on shelves.
3145000	3148000	They're selling out immediately, so they're going to keep making them.
3148000	3149000	I just think that they're...
3149000	3155000	But it always sucks when it's selling out immediately because it's eBay scalpers and buying it up.
3155000	3156000	And you know that's what's happening.
3156000	3161000	And also, and I've got to double check here because I know I didn't put these stories on our show roll,
3161000	3166000	but they had some news about upcoming figures and the bullshit that they're doing.
3166000	3170000	That crap where it's like, oh, hey, hey, you really want Rosalina?
3170000	3172000	Well, it's going to have to go to Target for that.
3172000	3173000	Or, hey, you want this figure?
3173000	3174000	Well, you got to go to Toys R Us.
3174000	3178000	Or there's the rumor about that Shulk GameStop is purposely...
3178000	3181000	This is a huge grain of salt because it's one of those, I work for GameStop,
3181000	3182000	but I'm not going to tell you who I am.
3182000	3187000	Where apparently GameStop is going to hold half the Shulks to sell as used.
3188000	3190000	I mean, it sounds really...
3190000	3193000	I'm almost like, even GameStop's not that low.
3193000	3194000	Sell them as used?
3194000	3196000	They did that with another title.
3196000	3197000	They did that with the...
3197000	3198000	Yeah, Metroid Prime Trilogy.
3198000	3199000	No, no.
3199000	3200000	They did that with...
3200000	3203000	No, they did that with the reprint of...
3203000	3205000	Was it The Last Story or something like that?
3205000	3206000	Xenoblade.
3206000	3207000	Xenoblade, yeah.
3207000	3209000	And they sold it for more than retail because of high demand.
3209000	3210000	Jamie, quick comments.
3210000	3212000	We got to get to our interview with Jamie.
3212000	3215000	Just that my coworker picked up four amiibos,
3215000	3218000	and all they do is sit on the wall between our cubicles
3218000	3221000	so that we have the eternal battle between Link and Red Ring Rico
3221000	3223000	from Phantasy Star Online.
3223000	3224000	Nice.
3224000	3225000	Just saying.
3225000	3228000	Well, those amiibos seem to be doing very, very well for Nintendo,
3228000	3234000	so whether it is artificial or natural, who knows?
3234000	3235000	That's anyone's guess.
3235000	3237000	All right, but we are going to shift gears here quite a bit
3237000	3241000	because we want to bring onto the show here tonight
3241000	3245000	our friends from the YouTube series Cooking with Unity.
3245000	3248000	We're going to get Max, Phil, and Jeffrey, all of them.
3248000	3250000	They're all actually in the same room,
3250000	3252000	and we're going to talk to them all here tonight,
3252000	3253000	the guys from Cooking with Unity.
3253000	3254000	And if you have questions for them,
3254000	3258000	you can submit it in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
3258000	3260000	but I believe we have them on the line.
3260000	3261000	You guys there?
3261000	3262000	We are.
3262000	3263000	We are here.
3263000	3264000	Yep, I'm here as well.
3264000	3265000	Hello, hello, guys.
3265000	3267000	Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.
3267000	3268000	Hello.
3268000	3270000	Thank you so much for taking time to be with us tonight,
3270000	3273000	and you guys are all in the same room just like we are.
3273000	3275000	Yeah, yeah, we're all in the same room,
3275000	3276000	and thank you for inviting us.
3276000	3277000	It's exciting to be on your show.
3277000	3278000	No worries.
3278000	3280000	Actually, I got to give credit to Loki here.
3280000	3283000	Loki's kind of our game maker here on staff,
3283000	3285000	and he really likes you guys an awful lot.
3285000	3287000	He's the one that showed me about the show.
3287000	3289000	I love the show and the banter.
3289000	3291000	The banter's the best part.
3291000	3292000	All right, well, I'm glad you do
3292000	3294000	because a lot of times when we do the banter,
3294000	3297000	we're like, oh, no one is watching this for this.
3298000	3301000	So it's good to hear that the banter's coming across, too.
3301000	3302000	Usually when we're bantering,
3302000	3303000	we're talking about stuff
3303000	3305000	because we've run out of intelligent things
3305000	3306000	to say on the show.
3306000	3308000	And we don't want YouTube to clip the video.
3308000	3309000	Yeah, exactly.
3309000	3313000	So for those who don't know, Max is the first guy that talked.
3313000	3316000	I'm Phil from Cooking with the Unity.
3316000	3317000	I'm Max.
3317000	3320000	And I'm Jeffrey.
3320000	3322000	And, yeah, we enjoy doing the show,
3322000	3324000	and I'm really happy that you guys,
3324000	3327000	I'm really happy that Loki is enjoying the show,
3327000	3329000	and it's really great that we got an invite
3329000	3330000	to do the show with you guys.
3330000	3332000	And hopefully we can answer some questions
3332000	3334000	and give people a place to actually start
3334000	3337000	for making games and starting their career making games.
3337000	3339000	Excellent, because that's where my head's at.
3339000	3341000	It's like, well, you can't say I'm not a fan.
3341000	3345000	I'm still not understanding the subject matter fully,
3345000	3346000	but I want to get there.
3346000	3347000	I want to get to that point someday.
3347000	3349000	So that's really exciting.
3349000	3350000	And I don't know if you guys heard earlier in the show,
3350000	3351000	I was kind of talking about
3351000	3353000	a lot of what you guys seem to do for game creation.
3353000	3355000	There's a lot of what I've said about podcasting.
3355000	3356000	I don't know if you know,
3356000	3358000	we've been doing Orange on its Radio for 12 years.
3358000	3359000	That's wild.
3359000	3362000	Especially considering how early podcasting was
3362000	3363000	at the time that you started it.
3363000	3364000	Yes, absolutely.
3364000	3366000	Well, there was no podcast when we first started.
3366000	3367000	Yeah, exactly.
3367000	3368000	You were a radio station, right?
3368000	3369000	Yeah, we were live through 65,
3369000	3371000	and then that kind of evolved into that.
3371000	3374000	But we love it when people create their own shows,
3374000	3376000	just like you guys really empower people
3376000	3379000	to make their own games, which I think is so important.
3379000	3381000	Well, let me take a step back and ask you guys,
3381000	3384000	for those that don't know what Cooking with Unity is,
3384000	3385000	tell us about it.
3385000	3387000	What is Cooking with Unity?
3387000	3389000	So, what the show is,
3389000	3394000	it's my attempt to educate people on how to make video games.
3394000	3398000	I realized, so I started in the industry at Sony,
3398000	3401000	and I went to DigiPen for school and stuff,
3401000	3404000	and so I kind of got immersed in how to make games and stuff.
3404000	3405000	And when I was growing up,
3405000	3408000	there wasn't as much internet resources for things,
3408000	3410000	and there wasn't even as much internet.
3411000	3414000	And it just seemed like, with Unity,
3414000	3416000	this is the time to actually start showing people,
3416000	3418000	in general, how games are made
3418000	3420000	and what people do when they make games,
3420000	3422000	and what does it mean to make a game.
3422000	3424000	Like, my biggest problem was,
3424000	3427000	if you were to ask a random person on the street,
3427000	3428000	how do you make a movie,
3428000	3431000	they wouldn't be able to give you a very specific answer,
3431000	3432000	but they'd be able to say,
3432000	3433000	okay, you get a camera,
3433000	3435000	you get a bunch of people in costumes
3435000	3436000	on the other side of the camera,
3436000	3437000	you shoot the scene,
3437000	3438000	you do some editing,
3438000	3439000	maybe you have a green screen
3439000	3441000	and use the magic of a computer or something,
3441000	3443000	but they'll have a general idea.
3443000	3446000	But if you ask a random person how to make a video game,
3446000	3448000	they're going to just give you this blank stare.
3448000	3449000	They're going to be like,
3449000	3451000	I think you use a computer at some point in the process,
3451000	3453000	and that's like all people know.
3453000	3456000	And making games has gotten a lot easier
3456000	3458000	in the last few years
3458000	3461000	because of all the middleware and engines
3461000	3464000	and tool chains that are available for free or for cheap.
3464000	3467000	We've got Unity, we've got Unreal,
3467000	3470000	we've got Crytek, CryEngine,
3470000	3472000	we've got smaller, lesser known ones
3472000	3476000	like Cocos2D and Erlicht and a few other things.
3476000	3478000	But if you want to actually get started making a game,
3478000	3481000	you no longer have to start by making the game engine.
3481000	3483000	You can actually just start making your game,
3483000	3486000	which is exciting.
3486000	3489000	Why Unity in particular?
3489000	3491000	Well, in my case,
3491000	3494000	it's because it just fit my organization style.
3494000	3497000	I started using Unity during a game jam,
3497000	3499000	and I had never used it before,
3499000	3501000	and I was able to make a very simple game in two days
3501000	3504000	without having ever touched Unity before.
3504000	3506000	It's just very well organized.
3506000	3509000	I like the way that it's a component-based organization
3509000	3511000	for building things.
3511000	3513000	And the thing is, if your question is
3513000	3515000	why Unity over anything else,
3515000	3517000	I'm not going to say that you should use Unity
3517000	3518000	over anything else.
3518000	3521000	I think you should use whatever works best for you.
3521000	3524000	If you download Unreal and it just clicks
3524000	3526000	and you just love the Blueprint system
3526000	3528000	and you can understand you start making a game,
3528000	3530000	I want you to make a game.
3530000	3532000	I don't care if you use Unity or not.
3532000	3536000	But I use Unity because it fits my workflow.
3536000	3538000	I'm very familiar with it.
3538000	3540000	I use it for my own projects,
3540000	3542000	and therefore I can teach it to people
3542000	3544000	and teach how to use it on their projects.
3544000	3546000	You know why you guys are awesome?
3546000	3548000	Because in that sentence there,
3548000	3550000	you said, I want you to make a game.
3550000	3552000	And I think that is such a great message.
3552000	3553000	Absolutely.
3553000	3555000	That's something that I hear in your videos as well.
3555000	3557000	So let me ask this question.
3557000	3559000	Why is that important?
3559000	3561000	Why should you go make a game?
3561000	3563000	Why shouldn't you make a game?
3563000	3566000	I mean, honestly, if you're passionate about something,
3566000	3568000	then you should absolutely go out and do it.
3568000	3570000	You should get that passion out there into the world
3570000	3572000	and develop something.
3572000	3574000	I mean, it's an art form just like anything else.
3574000	3576000	Oh, God, I went into the art form thing.
3576000	3578000	Oh, sorry.
3578000	3581000	Video games as art is a whole other discussion,
3581000	3584000	but I'm sure you guys have had that one before.
3584000	3588000	So the thing is, yeah, why shouldn't you make a game?
3588000	3592000	The thing is, I talk to a lot of people who play video games,
3592000	3595000	and I always hear game designs from people.
3595000	3597000	I'm like, you know what would be a really cool game?
3597000	3599000	And sometimes it'll just be a really high-level thing.
3599000	3601000	It'll just be like, if it was Call of Duty,
3601000	3604000	but it had motorcycles.
3604000	3606000	It might be something as simple as that,
3606000	3608000	or it might be someone who has a really cool idea
3608000	3610000	for a puzzle game or something, and everyone has these ideas,
3610000	3612000	and very few people get the opportunity
3612000	3614000	to actually build something
3614000	3617000	that works towards making these games a reality.
3617000	3620000	And the other thing I'm worried about is,
3620000	3624000	the games industry, because of how hard it is,
3624000	3626000	or how hard it was, I think it's getting a lot easier,
3626000	3630000	but how hard it is to learn how to make games,
3630000	3632000	it was attracting these people
3632000	3634000	that might not even be interested
3634000	3636000	in the games themselves, but are interested
3636000	3638000	in solving the challenges, and that's great.
3638000	3639000	I have no problem with that.
3639000	3641000	I have no problem with non-gamers making games.
3641000	3645000	But I want to see more gamers making games,
3645000	3647000	because gamers know what they want,
3647000	3649000	and they can actually iterate on the previous art
3649000	3652000	and create something new and interesting,
3652000	3654000	and they already know the limitations
3654000	3656000	that they're working within,
3656000	3658000	and they're going to be able to figure out
3658000	3660000	how to work around those limitations
3660000	3662000	and change the expectations for games
3662000	3664000	from a perspective of someone who is themselves
3664000	3666000	a consumer of game products.
3666000	3668000	And so that's really important.
3668000	3670000	You raise a really good point there,
3670000	3672000	that there's a lot of non-gamers in the game industry,
3672000	3674000	and we've kind of hit on this before
3674000	3676000	when we talk about management decisions
3676000	3678000	that screw games up,
3678000	3681000	that cause buggy things to be released
3681000	3683000	because it's more important to get a game out
3683000	3686000	at a certain day and date to satisfy an XYZ person.
3686000	3688000	We get that all the time,
3688000	3690000	and I think that's great,
3690000	3693000	to get more gamers involved in making games.
3693000	3698000	Y-Y-R in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
3698000	3700000	The feeling of playing something
3700000	3702000	that I created with my own two hands
3702000	3705000	is one of my favorite feelings in the world.
3705000	3707000	If you have questions for our guests tonight
3707000	3709000	from Cooking with Unity,
3709000	3713000	you can ask that in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3713000	3715000	Have you guys heard of any games
3715000	3717000	that you may have helped through your YouTube series
3717000	3719000	or inspired to create?
3720000	3723000	We're still early in our history for that kind of thing.
3723000	3726000	I have seen some really cool projects
3726000	3729000	from people who might not have started with our show
3729000	3731000	but are definitely using our show now,
3731000	3735000	and I'm really excited to show more of that
3735000	3737000	on the show as things progress.
3737000	3739000	The thing is right now,
3739000	3744000	I want to show what people have made on my show.
3744000	3746000	We want to have more segments
3746000	3748000	that show what other people have made using Unity
3748000	3750000	and what other people have made using whatever they want to make it with.
3750000	3752000	It doesn't have to be Unity specific.
3754000	3756000	We've seen some really good projects,
3756000	3758000	but they're all in progress.
3758000	3761000	They will need an audience later.
3761000	3763000	I don't want to just jump the gun,
3763000	3765000	show something that I think is kind of cool now.
3765000	3767000	Other people might not get why it's cool yet,
3767000	3769000	and then when they need the exposure,
3769000	3771000	it might be harder for them to get it.
3773000	3776000	I don't have any direct examples for you right now,
3776000	3778000	but there will be some soon
3778000	3781000	as these projects come to fruition.
3781000	3783000	Well, I know of one. I know of at least one.
3783000	3784000	Right, Loki?
3784000	3786000	Yeah, absolutely.
3786000	3788000	I just wish I had something to show right now.
3788000	3791000	It's just redoing the engine three or four times already.
3791000	3793000	But the great part, though,
3793000	3795000	is when I was learning,
3795000	3797000	and I'm still learning
3797000	3800000	because I'm just teaching myself everything,
3800000	3802000	I just started in March
3802000	3804000	to actually start working on a game idea.
3804000	3810000	But just trying to skip doing it the hard way,
3810000	3812000	and then having to learn to do it the hard way,
3812000	3815000	which is a good way to learn things, I guess.
3815000	3817000	Oh, it's always good.
3817000	3819000	It's a constant learning experience.
3819000	3821000	I mean, you never know all the answers,
3821000	3823000	and there's always new ways to do things.
3823000	3827000	It's really exciting to try to solve problems dynamically.
3827000	3829000	Sometimes you even find old ways to do things.
3829000	3832000	I found that, especially in the days of mobile,
3832000	3835000	some of my knowledge about how PlayStation 1 games cut corners
3835000	3837000	is actually useful
3837000	3840000	because those same corners can be cut on mobile
3840000	3843000	and give you great-looking visuals with less performance.
3843000	3846000	And so there's a lot to learn.
3846000	3849000	You started in March, and as Phil said,
3849000	3851000	you never run out. We haven't run out yet.
3851000	3855000	I learn a new thing every day making games.
3855000	3857000	At least one thing every day.
3857000	3860000	And that's not an exaggeration by any stretch of the imagination.
3860000	3862000	And sometimes it's really simple stuff too.
3862000	3864000	Occasionally someone will be watching my show
3864000	3867000	and point out a feature in Unity that I didn't even know was there.
3867000	3870000	And I'm just like, wow, that saves me 20 minutes every time
3870000	3872000	that I would normally have to do it this other way
3872000	3874000	that I had already figured out
3874000	3876000	because I just didn't know that this was built in.
3876000	3878000	I'm sorry that I'm not giving concrete examples here,
3878000	3881000	but I'm sure that you've run into this yourself
3881000	3883000	in the short time that you've been working
3883000	3885000	where you find a way to do something,
3885000	3887000	and it totally works, and it's fine.
3887000	3890000	And it doesn't have really many disadvantages or anything,
3890000	3892000	but you find out later you could have done the same thing
3892000	3896000	in one line of code and even less worry,
3896000	3898000	and it's a little bit more efficient and stuff.
3898000	3901000	That being said, the super important thing to remember,
3901000	3904000	and this is something where I differ from a lot of teachers and stuff
3904000	3907000	where they're like, you need to learn the right way to do things.
3907000	3910000	There's a million right ways to do anything in game development.
3910000	3913000	There's a million. This is not an exaggeration.
3913000	3916000	And there's a few that are terrible,
3916000	3918000	and there's a few that are awesome,
3918000	3920000	and there's everything else that's in between.
3920000	3922000	And the thing is, most of the in-between stuff
3922000	3924000	will do what you need it to do.
3924000	3927000	So my rule is, if it works, use it,
3927000	3929000	especially when you're learning.
3929000	3931000	If you have a solution to the problem,
3931000	3933000	don't worry that it's the best solution.
3933000	3935000	I have a lot of people who are like,
3935000	3937000	did I do this right? And they've done it totally right.
3937000	3940000	And they're like, but is there a more efficient way to use it?
3940000	3942000	And my answer is always, yes,
3942000	3944000	there's always a more efficient way to do it.
3944000	3946000	It is efficient enough, and it works,
3946000	3948000	and that's the most important part.
3948000	3951000	What needs to be important is you can always optimize later on.
3951000	3953000	If you've encountered a situation where,
3953000	3955000	yeah, the game's running terribly
3955000	3957000	because of the way that I've implemented this thing,
3957000	3959000	well, you can always go back and refactor it
3959000	3962000	into a way that's using a different solution to the problem.
3962000	3965000	You can always optimize later on.
3967000	3970000	This is great to listen to,
3970000	3972000	but for me, I've got to admit,
3972000	3974000	my knowledge of game making is so-so.
3974000	3976000	I used to be able to make stuff in ZZT.
3976000	3979000	That game was awesome. I used to use that.
3979000	3982000	And maybe Commodore 64 Basic back in the day.
3982000	3984000	All right.
3984000	3987000	I love Commodore 64. We can talk Basic all day.
3987000	3989000	God, that system was so flippin' amazing
3989000	3991000	and kind of ahead of its time in many ways.
3991000	3993000	But anyway, let's say I want to make a game.
3993000	3995000	I'm going to do this. I'm going to download Unity.
3995000	3997000	I don't have a whole lot of programming experience
3997000	3999000	except maybe like 10 print,
3999000	4001000	Rob is awesome, 20 go to 10.
4001000	4003000	So I have very little programming experience.
4003000	4007000	So now what? Where is Word 1 in chapter 1?
4007000	4009000	Where do I start?
4009000	4012000	So we made a series actually specifically for this.
4012000	4014000	It's called From Scratch to Published.
4014000	4016000	And we cover...
4016000	4018000	So it starts in episode negative 1,
4018000	4020000	which is a strange episode number to start at.
4020000	4022000	But the reason I did that is the first episode teaches you
4022000	4025000	how to download and install Unity and start using Unity.
4025000	4027000	Episodes negative 1 and 0
4027000	4029000	are for how to set up your computer
4029000	4031000	and how to get an email address.
4031000	4035000	So we cover the most basic stuff you can possibly have.
4035000	4037000	We talk about every single thing.
4037000	4039000	And we go all the way up to the point
4039000	4043000	where we actually publish on several stores,
4043000	4047000	namely the Windows Store for both phone and PC,
4047000	4050000	the iOS and Mac app stores,
4050000	4052000	and the Android Play Store.
4052000	4054000	And the thing is,
4054000	4056000	so when you're watching this one,
4056000	4058000	there's going to be points,
4058000	4060000	especially if you're a fresh beginner,
4060000	4062000	you haven't done much programming in a while,
4062000	4064000	or maybe no programming whatsoever,
4064000	4066000	there's going to be some stuff
4066000	4068000	where you're going to just have to take it on faith
4068000	4070000	what I'm saying.
4070000	4072000	I try to explain things very thoroughly,
4072000	4076000	but sometimes in the effort to just get the next section done,
4076000	4078000	I have to just say,
4078000	4080000	here's the code, here's what we're doing,
4080000	4082000	I try to explain it,
4082000	4084000	but it's not going to click at first.
4084000	4086000	And so you've got to just work with it.
4086000	4088000	Don't stop there.
4088000	4090000	It's not going to teach you everything you need to know.
4090000	4092000	It's going to teach you enough that you can get started.
4092000	4094000	And from there,
4094000	4096000	you'll start forming questions
4096000	4098000	and start answering your questions yourself,
4098000	4102000	and you'll be able to figure out how these things actually work.
4102000	4104000	The important thing is,
4104000	4106000	on the series, because we start from scratch,
4106000	4108000	we start literally on a PC
4108000	4110000	that doesn't have Unity installed,
4110000	4112000	or any program installed,
4112000	4114000	we show installing Unity,
4114000	4116000	we show installing Source Control,
4116000	4118000	we show how to use Source Control stuff.
4118000	4120000	Most people don't even know what Source Control is,
4120000	4122000	and most people don't use it,
4122000	4124000	and this is terrible.
4124000	4126000	People should be using it.
4126000	4128000	What Source Control is is basically a backup system
4128000	4130000	slash collaboration system
4130000	4132000	so that when you make changes to the project,
4132000	4134000	everyone else working on the project gets those changes,
4134000	4136000	and more importantly,
4136000	4138000	if you make a change and something's wrong,
4138000	4140000	you can go back later and be like,
4140000	4142000	hey, that change was wrong,
4142000	4144000	and it keeps that history
4144000	4146000	of everything that you've done.
4146000	4148000	That way, mistakes are less costly.
4148000	4150000	What's fun about games
4150000	4152000	versus pretty much any other industry
4152000	4154000	is there's the only cost
4154000	4156000	involved in making them
4156000	4158000	effectively, once you have the tools,
4158000	4160000	which the tools are free now,
4160000	4162000	is the cost of time.
4162000	4164000	The worst mistakes in the world
4164000	4166000	that you can make will only cost you time.
4166000	4168000	They will never cost you manufacturing resources.
4168000	4170000	You will never have to replace things
4170000	4172000	because you did something wrong in code.
4172000	4174000	Well, okay.
4174000	4176000	Yeah, I mean, if you drop your iPhone on the floor,
4176000	4178000	it'll be your test device.
4178000	4180000	There's little problems like that,
4180000	4182000	but it's from the physical world.
4182000	4184000	It's not from the digital world
4184000	4186000	that these problems are occurring.
4186000	4188000	So mistakes should be embraced.
4188000	4190000	You really do learn from mistakes.
4190000	4192000	So don't feel bad
4192000	4194000	when something doesn't work right.
4194000	4196000	Feel good when you make it work right afterwards.
4196000	4198000	And so, yeah,
4198000	4200000	From Scratch to Publish will give you
4200000	4202000	probably the best kind of overview
4202000	4204000	front to back of game development
4204000	4206000	using Unity.
4206000	4208000	And then you can start to get more specific on videos
4208000	4210000	and by downloading
4210000	4212000	text content or using assets
4212000	4214000	from the Asda store to try and figure out
4214000	4216000	the rest of the way, how things work.
4216000	4218000	Remember, there's always
4218000	4220000	more to learn. There's always tricks that
4220000	4222000	like, I don't know all the tricks.
4222000	4224000	I try to teach as many tricks as I know.
4224000	4226000	When I find a new trick, I try to tell people about it.
4226000	4228000	But I will never know everything.
4228000	4230000	And no one will.
4230000	4232000	But try to know as much as you can.
4232000	4234000	And get into it. And I know you will enjoy it.
4234000	4236000	Alright, I'm going to check that out.
4236000	4238000	In fact, I even see why YR just linked that
4238000	4240000	to episode negative one in our chat room
4240000	4242000	over there at live.vognetwork.com
4242000	4244000	And if you are just joining us live, we are talking
4244000	4246000	with Max, Phil, and Jeffrey all from
4246000	4248000	Cooking with Unity.
4248000	4250000	If you go to cookingwithunity.com
4250000	4252000	it will just take you right to their YouTube channel
4252000	4254000	that has everything there.
4254000	4256000	Do you guys have any other, like, I don't know
4256000	4258000	if you guys do Twitter feeds or Facebook
4258000	4260000	or anything else we should be following you guys on?
4260000	4262000	Oh, I'm on Facebook, or on Twitter.
4262000	4264000	Twitter is MagmaLemur
4264000	4266000	Awesome. And I'm on
4266000	4268000	Twitter as Drakfire, that's
4268000	4274000	D-R-A-K-F-Y-R-E
4274000	4276000	Alright. I'm also in the channel as Drakfire
4276000	4278000	so if you just spell my name in there.
4278000	4280000	Sounds good.
4280000	4282000	And if you guys have questions, wait, there's three of you
4282000	4284000	Wait, am I in the channel out there?
4284000	4286000	There's three of us, but I don't think Jeffrey has a Twitter.
4286000	4288000	No, I don't have a Twitter.
4288000	4290000	Alright, that's alright. That's alright.
4290000	4292000	Darsakra has a Twitter, but she doesn't ever use it.
4292000	4294000	So I tag her in things. I use it sometimes.
4294000	4296000	Yeah, she'll reply to it like a month later.
4296000	4298000	And I'll complain about Pinkberry being closed ten minutes early.
4298000	4300000	Yeah, why did you tag me in this?
4300000	4302000	Alright, anyway.
4302000	4304000	So, awesome, awesome.
4304000	4306000	Loki, I want to go to you, because
4306000	4308000	surely you've got some things you want to ask these guys.
4308000	4310000	Yeah, I mean, the
4310000	4312000	one general question. First off,
4312000	4314000	I was going to mention, they do have a Patreon as well.
4314000	4316000	So there's some cool stuff
4316000	4318000	that you get access to, like they have a
4318000	4320000	repo with some cool
4320000	4322000	code and stuff in there that you can
4322000	4324000	check out. So definitely
4324000	4326000	go check that out and support them
4326000	4328000	if you can. The other thing I was
4328000	4330000	going to say is, now I know you
4330000	4332000	guys have done quite a few different types of
4332000	4334000	games in the past,
4334000	4336000	different projects and stuff.
4336000	4338000	Looking forward, what are some
4338000	4340000	different types of games that you're looking to tackle
4340000	4342000	in future projects?
4342000	4344000	Well, I know
4344000	4346000	for one, I'm working
4346000	4348000	very close with Justin Morovitz
4348000	4350000	on Vanguard
4350000	4352000	V, and I really hope that we get funding
4352000	4354000	for that project, because that's going to be awesome.
4354000	4356000	Justin is
4356000	4358000	trying to start a studio
4358000	4360000	that's VR centric.
4360000	4362000	And I think that's
4362000	4364000	important.
4364000	4366000	I do think that's actually ultimately
4366000	4368000	where the games industry is going to move towards
4368000	4370000	is virtual reality.
4370000	4372000	I'm not saying that we're going to get rid of TVs.
4372000	4374000	I think that's silly to think that.
4374000	4376000	I don't think we're going to be getting rid of tablets or anything.
4376000	4378000	But we're going to be adding VR to the mix.
4378000	4380000	And I think that the people who have been
4380000	4382000	playing games the longest
4382000	4384000	are going to be very interested in seeing
4384000	4386000	what actually comes to pass with virtual
4386000	4388000	reality. So I would say that
4388000	4390000	in my future at least, what I'm hoping
4390000	4392000	for is to get to work on more virtual reality
4392000	4394000	related games
4394000	4396000	and projects. It's an interesting
4396000	4398000	challenge because you have the physical aspect.
4398000	4400000	You don't want to give people
4400000	4402000	whiplash when they're playing your game. You don't want
4402000	4404000	people to get motion sickness.
4404000	4406000	Although I do think motion sickness
4406000	4408000	is going to be less of an issue as people get
4408000	4410000	their sea legs, so to speak.
4410000	4412000	Just like how
4412000	4414000	people forget, but when the games first started
4414000	4416000	just games scrolling left to right would make some
4416000	4418000	people sick. And now
4418000	4420000	you would never even worry about that. You would
4420000	4422000	scroll the game however fast you want it left
4422000	4424000	and right. You can jiggle it
4424000	4426000	back and forth and no one's going to get sick.
4426000	4428000	And it'll be that way for VR at
4428000	4430000	some point.
4430000	4432000	Cool.
4432000	4434000	Speaking of VR, I see in our chat room
4434000	4436000	Bobby Blackwell says, I demoed Vanguard V
4436000	4438000	at a recent VR meetup with the
4438000	4440000	KOR FX vest. Bobby
4440000	4442000	by the way is our guy on the network that is really into
4442000	4444000	this VR stuff.
4444000	4446000	He wants to know when the Proton Pulse talk is starting.
4446000	4448000	Well,
4448000	4450000	Proton Pulse is available on Google Cardboard
4450000	4452000	right now. Go get it. Go get a cardboard
4452000	4454000	and go download it.
4454000	4456000	Full games available, so
4456000	4458000	yeah.
4458000	4460000	They just released the Cardboard SDK for
4460000	4462000	Unity, I just saw.
4462000	4464000	Yeah, we've had a beta
4464000	4466000	version for a while and actually I think it's been
4466000	4468000	publicly available too, but we've had
4468000	4470000	some close interaction with Google which has been great.
4472000	4474000	Speaking of
4474000	4476000	Bobby, there's always a really funny debate
4476000	4478000	that you and him
4478000	4480000	have, Loki, going back and forth
4480000	4482000	when you first got into programming.
4482000	4484000	I don't think there really is a right or wrong
4484000	4486000	answer, but I thought I would consult the experts
4486000	4488000	here for the Cookie with Unity and
4488000	4490000	ask this, when we talk about your very first
4490000	4492000	project, I'm going to start my first project
4492000	4494000	and my first game.
4494000	4496000	In your opinion, do you think it's better to
4496000	4498000	build clones of existing
4498000	4500000	games or to just,
4500000	4502000	you know what, I'm going to do my own thing. Do your own thing.
4502000	4504000	This is a really, really good question.
4504000	4506000	Oh,
4506000	4508000	yeah, I mean, my first project
4508000	4510000	ended up being that little game robot alone
4510000	4512000	that I made.
4512000	4514000	And that's only on iOS
4514000	4516000	unfortunately, I still haven't gotten around to
4516000	4518000	porting it to anything else, even though it takes
4518000	4520000	no time and effort, I just need to boot up the project.
4520000	4522000	Apparently I'm too lazy to do that.
4522000	4524000	It was my first game
4524000	4526000	and it's basically a clone of Puro 2
4526000	4528000	from WarioWare,
4528000	4530000	the first WarioWare game
4530000	4532000	for the Game Boy Advance. It's a very small
4532000	4534000	mini-game there, but it was something
4534000	4536000	that's small in scope that I knew how it
4536000	4538000	functioned and I think it's very important
4538000	4540000	to take something that you kind of understand
4540000	4542000	how it works and just make something simple
4542000	4544000	and once you make that simple thing work,
4544000	4546000	just step up the complexity a little bit more.
4546000	4548000	Like starting with Pong is not necessarily
4548000	4550000	bad or Space Invaders,
4550000	4552000	something like that, something small and
4552000	4554000	simple that you know kind of mechanically how it
4554000	4556000	works so you can kind of just
4556000	4558000	get a feel for what you need to
4558000	4560000	implement. Yeah, and on the show we model
4560000	4562000	our episodes based on
4562000	4564000	genres and we try to basically
4564000	4566000	make it based on another
4566000	4568000	game that's similar in that genre.
4568000	4570000	Our very first episodes were
4570000	4572000	well actually my very first episodes, it was
4572000	4574000	before we had multiple people on the show,
4574000	4576000	were Space Invaders
4576000	4578000	and I believe Space Invaders
4578000	4580000	is probably the best place to start
4580000	4582000	and not necessarily on my show
4582000	4584000	because it's terrible, I had
4584000	4586000	no showmanship or anything back then.
4586000	4588000	But some people still say they like the
4588000	4590000	episodes, but I'd say starting with
4590000	4592000	Space Invaders is good because it teaches you
4592000	4594000	a lot of the basics about game development.
4594000	4596000	It teaches you how to
4596000	4598000	make bullets happen.
4598000	4600000	That's a very common thing, how to spawn something
4600000	4602000	and make it move on the screen.
4602000	4604000	It teaches you movement
4604000	4606000	and it teaches you how to create and destroy
4606000	4608000	things on the screen that you're destroying.
4608000	4610000	And all those things are really important in games.
4610000	4612000	Pong is a really good example
4612000	4614000	as well except for it doesn't really teach
4614000	4616000	it teaches very basic instantiation and
4616000	4618000	destruction, there's only one object. I like
4618000	4620000	Space Invaders because there's a few more objects to work with
4620000	4622000	so it feels like there's something to sink your teeth into.
4622000	4624000	As far as to whether everyone
4624000	4626000	should do this, what I
4626000	4628000	mainly want to say is
4628000	4630000	it probably doesn't matter that much as long as
4630000	4632000	you have a really clear idea in your head what you're making
4632000	4634000	whether you duplicate something that's
4634000	4636000	existing or if you go with your own design.
4636000	4638000	But the scope
4638000	4640000	is important. So if your
4640000	4642000	dream project is, and I know a lot of people
4642000	4644000	have this and I'm not dissing the
4644000	4646000	dreams here, if your dream project is
4646000	4648000	an MMO where you
4648000	4650000	can do real time combat
4650000	4652000	and wherever you strike the shield
4652000	4654000	on the opponent is exactly where the
4654000	4656000	damage happens and there's a
4656000	4658000	damage model for it. You have this
4658000	4660000	pages and pages and pages. Don't start
4660000	4662000	with that game. Please don't
4662000	4664000	start with that game. Even if
4664000	4666000	your high concept starts with
4666000	4668000	is a multiplayer game, don't start with
4668000	4670000	that game. Start with a single player game.
4670000	4672000	If you do want
4672000	4674000	to work towards your dream project though
4674000	4676000	start with a small project
4676000	4678000	that represents
4678000	4680000	a portion of your larger
4680000	4682000	project and then just keep doing that
4682000	4684000	and then build them together.
4684000	4686000	And what I mean by that is
4686000	4688000	honestly a really good example
4688000	4690000	I think is the Metal Gear series.
4690000	4692000	In that
4692000	4694000	if you've ever played Metal Gear Solid
4694000	4696000	which
4696000	4698000	Metal Gear Solid, sorry
4698000	4700000	Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake, the MSX version
4700000	4702000	it's on the anniversary
4702000	4704000	collection. It's the
4704000	4706000	last 2D game before they went to 3D.
4706000	4708000	If you play through that game you'll see
4708000	4710000	that pretty much everything that happens
4710000	4712000	in that game happened
4712000	4714000	in Metal Gear Solid later
4714000	4716000	in 3D. Even
4716000	4718000	smoking to display
4718000	4720000	lasers and go through them
4720000	4722000	that's in that game first.
4722000	4724000	Crawling under tanks is in that
4724000	4726000	game first. Pretty much
4726000	4728000	every single interaction, all the elevator interactions
4728000	4730000	all of the communication
4730000	4732000	between characters, all the codex stuff
4732000	4734000	was in that game first. And that game
4734000	4736000	is a 2D game.
4736000	4738000	So he had tried
4738000	4740000	this formula already
4740000	4742000	before they moved to 3D. Before they did
4742000	4744000	something that was ground breaking.
4744000	4746000	And Metal Gear Solid was truly ground
4746000	4748000	breaking for the time. And
4748000	4750000	I think that company still just does amazing
4750000	4752000	work. I love Kojima's work.
4752000	4754000	So think about it from
4754000	4756000	a perspective of make the
4756000	4758000	simple version of your game.
4758000	4760000	Do stepping stones and then once you have the simple version
4760000	4762000	you can kind of already work some of the problems
4762000	4764000	out and then you can make a slightly more complex version.
4764000	4766000	And then before you know it you'll have
4766000	4768000	you'll be working on the networked multiplayer
4768000	4770000	massively multiplayer online version of your game.
4770000	4772000	I mean it's all about iterations upon
4772000	4774000	your development basically like
4774000	4776000	yeah just start with something simple. You know like Metal Gear
4776000	4778000	maybe didn't eventually originally have
4778000	4780000	like pressing up against a wall in the first
4780000	4782000	version so they added it in the second one
4782000	4784000	so you could start hiding around corners.
4784000	4786000	And so on and so forth and they just kept going
4786000	4788000	with these ideas and that's how you get
4788000	4790000	these really complicated games is you start
4790000	4792000	off simple and just kind of keep iterating
4792000	4794000	ideas and adding functionality
4794000	4796000	to things.
4796000	4798000	Alright well to be fair to Bobby he is saying
4798000	4800000	in chat room I stressed more something that
4800000	4802000	was small in scope not necessarily
4802000	4804000	a full clone but that seems to definitely be in line
4804000	4806000	with the message you guys are saying is that if you want
4806000	4808000	to make this gigantic dream game
4808000	4810000	MMO focus on that one little
4810000	4812000	part first that maybe you can build into
4812000	4814000	the larger game later. And yes Black Wolf
4814000	4816000	I did say simple was boring. It's just not for
4816000	4818000	me. That's not what I want to do and that's fine
4818000	4820000	you know the fact that I didn't start with a simple project
4820000	4822000	means I've learned
4822000	4824000	so much more so and not to say that I
4824000	4826000	would you say that even though you maybe didn't take
4826000	4828000	on a simple project at first Loki you still
4828000	4830000	you're building one piece at a time. Yes
4830000	4832000	and I'm also not crazy enough to do an MMO
4832000	4834000	no one I don't want to ever
4834000	4836000	do an MMO ever ever
4836000	4838000	ever ever ever just
4838000	4840000	it sounds too too crazy
4840000	4842000	so never no idea how many
4842000	4844000	times that I've heard someone say oh I've got
4844000	4846000	this really good game idea I want to make it
4846000	4848000	I'm working on an MMO like that's
4848000	4850000	that is usually surprisingly
4850000	4852000	it happens all the time.
4852000	4854000	Oh gosh well gosh a dungeon
4854000	4856000	buster in our chat says this is a great interview lots
4856000	4858000	of great advice you know what I agree this is
4858000	4860000	this has been so informative and there's
4860000	4862000	so much more information that I
4862000	4864000	hope folks will go check out over on your YouTube
4864000	4866000	channel over at cookingwithunity.com
4866000	4868000	I do have to wrap things up here
4868000	4870000	pretty soon because we've almost been on the line
4870000	4872000	for a good half hour talking about making games
4872000	4874000	but before I let you go
4874000	4876000	I do always ask the people on our
4876000	4878000	show what games are you
4878000	4880000	playing you know besides the ones you're making
4880000	4882000	what games are you playing these days
4882000	4884000	so can we go around the room there real quick with you three
4884000	4886000	alright one two
4886000	4888000	three GTA 5
4888000	4890000	yeah I've been playing GTA 5 on the PS4
4890000	4892000	that game is astounding
4892000	4894000	no wonder you like these guys
4894000	4896000	listen I don't need the love you guys anymore
4896000	4898000	I mean seriously
4898000	4900000	the scope of that game
4900000	4902000	and like the amount of detail they put into
4902000	4904000	it is just unreal
4904000	4906000	they must have
4906000	4908000	actually put human souls into that
4908000	4910000	game to make it run the way it does
4910000	4912000	like the
4912000	4914000	amount of things they network we've been playing
4914000	4916000	it online together and
4916000	4918000	it's just outstanding
4918000	4920000	I do not know how
4920000	4922000	they network all this information
4922000	4924000	Loki was like a top 100 player on GTA 4
4924000	4926000	yeah I used to play multiplayer
4926000	4928000	a lot on GTA 4
4928000	4930000	a lot a lot but
4930000	4932000	I've been playing a lot
4932000	4934000	was it Playstation 4? I know I saw a video
4934000	4936000	I don't remember if it's from Playstation 4 or not
4936000	4938000	but yeah we need
4938000	4940000	the hookup online
4940000	4942000	because I haven't played any online yet
4942000	4944000	Jeffery what games have you been playing
4944000	4946000	because you probably have a more diverse
4946000	4948000	library than we do
4948000	4950000	well I usually play a lot of
4950000	4952000	Steam games lately
4952000	4954000	Gauntlet came out not too long ago
4954000	4956000	I've been playing the 2014 Gauntlet
4956000	4958000	I still play Monaco
4958000	4960000	from time to time
4960000	4962000	that's a really great stealth game
4962000	4964000	Monaco was fun
4964000	4966000	I actually really was impressed with that game
4966000	4968000	when you started showing that at work
4968000	4970000	Jeffery and I used to work together at a place
4970000	4972000	called Play Habit that unfortunately is not around anymore
4972000	4974000	it was really cool
4974000	4976000	the person who ran the place actually
4976000	4978000	came up with the marketing
4978000	4980000	well effectively came up with the marketing slogan
4980000	4982000	that Sega used
4982000	4984000	for so long of
4984000	4986000	blast processing, he was actually the originator
4986000	4988000	of that phrase
4988000	4990000	so that was pretty wild
4990000	4992000	of blast processing?
4992000	4994000	I've got an interview with him
4994000	4996000	I need to post it online sometime
4996000	4998000	he's giving me permission but I want to make sure
4998000	5000000	it has impact when it happens
5000000	5002000	well you guys are awesome
5002000	5004000	and I love the message you guys carry
5004000	5006000	that I want you to make a game
5006000	5008000	so I want to say something here real quick
5008000	5010000	this is kind of a little bit of an announcement
5010000	5012000	but I want you guys to be able to hear this too
5012000	5014000	because I think you guys will really like this
5014000	5016000	this is kind of like an ongoing theme that's been going on
5016000	5018000	with our show
5018000	5020000	and with Bobby's show and some of the other shows on the network
5020000	5022000	from talking about
5022000	5024000	Loki's game and how he's been making a game
5024000	5026000	to when Bobby did the
5026000	5028000	Flappy Vog project, it's kind of like a joke
5028000	5030000	thing to when YYR
5030000	5032000	did the O.L.R. Dream
5032000	5034000	maybe you guys probably don't know about this
5034000	5036000	but we have a list of dream games
5036000	5038000	or things we mentioned
5038000	5040000	in Jess, that would be a great game
5040000	5042000	and one of our listeners, YYR, actually turned
5042000	5044000	one of those into a game, it was called Pixel Shits
5044000	5046000	and
5046000	5048000	it's something
5048000	5050000	he actually
5050000	5052000	you got to get the link in chat, it's great
5052000	5054000	it's 2600 inspired, YYR please
5054000	5056000	please post the link
5056000	5058000	it's a 2600 inspired game
5058000	5060000	where you go around and you try to stop
5060000	5062000	joggers from running through a park
5062000	5064000	by taking a giant shit
5064000	5066000	oh that's amazing
5066000	5068000	the genius mechanic
5068000	5070000	is that when you run out
5070000	5072000	because you know a person can only do so much
5072000	5074000	there's a little taco cabana in the corner
5074000	5076000	that you go to and refill
5076000	5078000	your mirror
5078000	5080000	oh that's amazing
5080000	5082000	that's where the game went from
5082000	5084000	like LOL to just
5084000	5086000	freaking genius
5086000	5088000	yeah it was great
5088000	5090000	oh no, that's what I love to see
5090000	5092000	people making things like this
5092000	5094000	I love silly creative games and stuff
5094000	5096000	the sillier the better
5096000	5098000	I want to just put a shout out there
5098000	5100000	Jake Kaufman Vert, he's a really great game composer
5100000	5102000	you probably know about him
5102000	5104000	but he made a game called Dick Hand
5104000	5106000	that you probably don't know about
5106000	5108000	definitely check that out
5108000	5110000	that sounds inspired by Cards Against Humanity
5110000	5112000	well
5112000	5114000	the reason why I bring all this up is because
5114000	5116000	we've been doing some talk behind the scenes
5116000	5118000	and I was talking with YYR and I was talking with Bobby
5118000	5120000	and we've decided that we want
5120000	5122000	people to create things
5122000	5124000	just like you guys do
5124000	5126000	we think there needs to be more voices out there making games
5126000	5128000	so we are going to host
5128000	5130000	a vog jam
5130000	5132000	and that's video game jam
5132000	5134000	that's v-i-d-o
5134000	5136000	game jam
5136000	5138000	so it's the vog jam
5138000	5140000	and we just want people to create something dammit
5140000	5142000	so whether you have unity
5142000	5144000	and you're comfortable using unity
5144000	5146000	you want to learn unity
5146000	5148000	you can use that
5148000	5150000	but we're also going to encourage people
5150000	5152000	and if you only feel comfortable making
5152000	5154000	a level in LittleBigPlanet
5154000	5156000	or using RPG Maker
5156000	5158000	then do that
5158000	5160000	we are going to be doing our own game jam here at VOG Network
5160000	5162000	and I'm going to give you all some more details
5162000	5164000	in just a little bit
5164000	5166000	we're going to do Iron Chef style
5166000	5168000	where there's going to be a mystery ingredient
5168000	5170000	and we will talk about how we're going to come up with that ingredient
5170000	5172000	as a community next week
5172000	5174000	that is fantastic
5174000	5176000	it's not pixel shit
5176000	5178000	pixel shits will not be the game
5178000	5180000	I just want to say that's super awesome
5180000	5182000	game jams are actually what got me started
5182000	5184000	it's not what got me started as a programmer
5184000	5186000	it's what got me started as making games on my own
5186000	5188000	it's what got you started in unity too
5188000	5190000	yeah it is what got me started in unity
5190000	5192000	actually we were going to use
5192000	5194000	a different engine and it didn't work
5194000	5196000	for collaboration so I ended up using unity
5196000	5198000	because a friend of mine said it was really cool
5198000	5200000	and the rest is history
5200000	5202000	so yeah
5202000	5204000	game jams are awesome
5204000	5206000	drop us an email
5206000	5208000	we'll promote and we'll be on it
5208000	5210000	we love game jams
5210000	5212000	that's awesome and this is very important too
5212000	5214000	and I want to stress this because there might be some people that feel
5214000	5216000	very overwhelmed any prizes that we do
5216000	5218000	with this game jam we will not be giving away
5218000	5220000	prizes on quality
5220000	5222000	we will only be giving away prizes on
5222000	5224000	participation and I think that's very important
5224000	5226000	because we want to make sure this is a very accessible
5226000	5228000	thing for people to participate with
5228000	5230000	but anyway I just thought
5230000	5232000	you know you guys helped inspire
5232000	5234000	a lot of that conversation that happened behind the scenes
5234000	5236000	this week so you know
5236000	5238000	if you guys want people to make games
5238000	5240000	we want people to make games too and

5354000	5356000	alright I wanna give you guys
5356000	5358000	a little more details on the game jam I talked about
5358000	5360000	with the guys from Cooking With Unity we will have
5360000	5362000	all the details next week but
5362000	5364000	the contest is going to be called the
5364000	5366000	VoG Jam and in this
5366000	5368000	case VoG will mean video game
5368000	5370000	not necessarily what you're used to but VoG
5370000	5372000	Jam and our little
5372000	5374000	tagline with this is
5374000	5376000	create something dammit
5376000	5378000	create something dammit I mean
5378000	5380000	you know maybe I'm not gonna be comfortable with using
5380000	5382000	Unity but I know how to use Commodore 64
5382000	5384000	basic I know how to make programs
5384000	5386000	in the little big planet there's some other things I know
5386000	5388000	how to use so I am gonna participate
5388000	5390000	in this game jam YYR
5390000	5392000	has committed to participating in this game jam
5392000	5394000	Bobby Blackwolf will be participating
5394000	5396000	in the game jam I'll participate Loki's participating
5396000	5398000	in the game jam I'll just put my game on hold for now
5398000	5400000	in this like video
5400000	5402000	so this is what's gonna happen
5402000	5404000	we're gonna use the time honored
5404000	5406000	scientific method that's proved
5406000	5408000	true in the past 12 years of Orange Lounge
5408000	5410000	Radio and that is
5410000	5412000	listless so next
5412000	5414000	week on Orange Lounge Radio we are going to do
5414000	5416000	a listless segment to
5416000	5418000	determine what the mystery
5418000	5420000	ingredient for the game is going to be
5420000	5422000	and that is going to be
5422000	5424000	basically a
5424000	5426000	I would say a title but I don't wanna say that
5426000	5428000	that title has to be the name of your game
5428000	5430000	for example
5430000	5432000	cause I don't know like a theme
5432000	5434000	it should be the theme there we go
5434000	5436000	so for example let's
5436000	5438000	say we were to go over to
5438000	5440000	the Orange Lounge Radio list of dream games
5440000	5442000	which we're not gonna do we're gonna come up with something new
5442000	5444000	but just as an example let's say I go to the
5444000	5446000	OLR dream games page and I decide that
5446000	5448000	puzzle sluts is gonna be the theme
5448000	5450000	and we're not gonna throw something
5450000	5452000	that adult at you but puzzle sluts
5452000	5454000	ends up being the theme then you would have to
5454000	5456000	make your game or your level or whatever
5456000	5458000	it is somehow incorporating
5458000	5460000	puzzle sluts into it
5460000	5462000	and whether that's just something that kinda
5462000	5464000	happens on the side or whether that's the focus
5464000	5466000	so it's just like cooking right
5466000	5468000	just like those guys cook with unity
5468000	5470000	this is the mystery ingredient so
5470000	5472000	what is that theme
5472000	5474000	going to be we wanna take
5474000	5476000	suggestions from you guys even though usually
5476000	5478000	with listless it is what
5478000	5480000	DarkSakura, myself and Loki ultimately
5480000	5482000	decide that goes into the pot we
5482000	5484000	wanna take your suggestions
5484000	5486000	so if you have a suggestion
5486000	5488000	you can do one of two things you can e-mail us
5488000	5490000	participate at orangelandstrator.com
5490000	5492000	make sure that subject line says
5492000	5494000	game jam and then tell us
5494000	5496000	what is the mystery ingredient you believe
5496000	5498000	should be included in the game jam
5498000	5500000	or you can comment on the posting of this
5500000	5502000	show over at vognetwork.com
5502000	5504000	just comment and that
5504000	5506000	way the little thumbs up and thumbs down will tell
5506000	5508000	us what we ought to think of using
5508000	5510000	for the theme in listless next
5510000	5512000	week so we will be choosing that mystery ingredient
5512000	5514000	you will have over the holidays until
5514000	5516000	the end of january
5516000	5518000	to submit your project
5518000	5520000	and if you need help hosting
5520000	5522000	even let's say you create a
5522000	5524000	project in unity but you have no where to put it
5524000	5526000	bobby blackwolf has offered help
5526000	5528000	so at vognetwork we can actually
5528000	5530000	post some of those creations for you
5530000	5532000	guys over at vognetwork if you need a
5532000	5534000	place that's not required though if you
5534000	5536000	post something on your own site we
5536000	5538000	just wanna give you the tools we don't want anybody
5538000	5540000	to say well I would have participated but I didn't
5540000	5542000	have a place to host it no no we're gonna
5542000	5544000	solve some of those problems mega.com or
5544000	5546000	whatever it is nowadays mega
5546000	5548000	something though so there you go
5548000	5550000	I do wanna say one quick very
5550000	5552000	important thing with the themes
5552000	5554000	cause we gotta get back to the news cause we're running really
5554000	5556000	long tonight with the themes
5556000	5558000	please nothing that is already
5558000	5560000	copyrighted keep that in mind
5560000	5562000	yeah nothing infringing please don't make a Mario
5562000	5564000	game exactly so you can't we
5564000	5566000	can't do like garris does calibrations
5566000	5568000	cannot be the game theme because
5568000	5570000	garris is a character
5570000	5572000	but you can make that game for me personally
5574000	5576000	so keep that in mind we are not
5576000	5578000	out to make sequels it has to be
5578000	5580000	an original idea calibrating with garris
5580000	5582000	I'm sure there's already the shakarian calibrator
5582000	5584000	out there somewhere I'm sure there is
5584000	5586000	Brad from Paw Culture says what about
5586000	5588000	collaborations I'm
5588000	5590000	always going to refer to the golden rule of the
5590000	5592000	game jam which is create something
5592000	5594000	dammit so if the only way you're gonna
5594000	5596000	be able to create something is to work with somebody else
5596000	5598000	then I'm gonna say yes
5598000	5600000	create something dammit that's the golden
5600000	5602000	rule I'm gonna refer to throughout the game jam
5602000	5604000	so partner up yes
5604000	5606000	just create something dammit
5608000	5610000	to register participation for this weeks
5610000	5612000	episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com
5612000	5614000	use the pass phrase fork
5614000	5616000	alright so
5616000	5618000	we'll have more information we're gonna have a big
5618000	5620000	prize pool there will be
5620000	5622000	no grading done on quality
5622000	5624000	that is ultimately up to the community
5624000	5626000	if one of these games goes viral
5626000	5628000	that is the community that makes
5628000	5630000	that happen but we
5630000	5632000	will be giving out prizes based on participation
5632000	5634000	we have accumulated a
5634000	5636000	crap ton of prizes throughout the year
5636000	5638000	so I don't
5638000	5640000	want to say cause I don't know how many
5640000	5642000	participations we'll get I
5642000	5644000	want to say if I almost want to say
5644000	5646000	everybody who participates will get something
5646000	5648000	but then I go well that's
5648000	5650000	only allowing for like 20 people
5650000	5652000	if we get like 200 submissions which would be
5652000	5654000	amazing boxes I know
5654000	5656000	right so I will say this
5656000	5658000	we are going to try well I will
5658000	5660000	we do know this we have the
5660000	5662000	loot system on vognetwork.com for sure
5662000	5664000	100% everybody will get exclusive
5664000	5666000	loot on vognetwork.com even
5666000	5668000	though it's virtual you'll at least get that little badge
5668000	5670000	of honor that you participated in the game
5670000	5672000	jam the first one which we hope
5672000	5674000	of many now I have a question
5674000	5676000	since I totally
5676000	5678000	don't even realize this is there a way to see what
5678000	5680000	loot other people have on their profile
5680000	5682000	click on their little profile
5682000	5684000	you're already 100% better than playstation 3
5684000	5686000	and playstation home problems with the trophy
5686000	5688000	so there you go
5688000	5690000	100% better
5690000	5692000	we got to get back to some news more info on the game jam next week
5692000	5694000	but submit your ideas but we got to
5694000	5696000	run through the news and I'm going to say
5696000	5698000	I'm going to take this a little bit of an accelerated
5698000	5700000	pace just because this first
5700000	5702000	part of the show is running really long so let's talk
5702000	5704000	quickly about street fighter 5
5704000	5706000	street fighter 5 more news is
5706000	5708000	coming out about street fighter 5 and Charlie
5708000	5710000	has been revealed as a character
5710000	5712000	that will be in street fighter 5 Charlie was not
5712000	5714000	in street fighter 4 if I recall
5714000	5716000	you have the pointy hair but Charlie
5716000	5718000	was in what was it alpha?
5718000	5720000	alpha 3?
5720000	5722000	he was in alpha
5722000	5724000	and alpha 2 and alpha 3
5724000	5726000	so they've modernized him a little
5726000	5728000	bit it looks like for this game because we don't see
5728000	5730000	an awful lot of them we only see just kind of
5730000	5732000	Charlie wasn't in like
5732000	5734000	cross Tekken was he?
5734000	5736000	I don't think so
5736000	5738000	but yeah so Charlie was announced
5738000	5740000	for street fighter 5 which by the way showed
5740000	5742000	off the first footage
5742000	5744000	of the gameplay and literally
5744000	5746000	you know it was like a splash screen that was pressed
5746000	5748000	start and then it went right into a Ryu vs
5748000	5750000	Chun-Li battle I
5750000	5752000	thought that was pretty funny what oh just
5752000	5754000	did you watch did you watch all the
5754000	5756000	reactions of the guys going oh my god
5756000	5758000	it's got the oh my god no not that there's
5758000	5760000	there's a part in it like where
5760000	5762000	um Ryu knocks Chun-Li into
5762000	5764000	like at the end of one of the rounds he knocks her
5764000	5766000	into a wall in the kitchen
5766000	5768000	and a bowl of noodles falls on her head
5768000	5770000	and it stays there for the whole next round
5770000	5772000	there's a bowl of noodles on her head
5772000	5774000	it's hilarious
5774000	5776000	yeah people details I love
5776000	5778000	details it's great
5778000	5780000	so people getting excited at that first
5780000	5782000	footage of Street Fighter 5 and
5782000	5784000	yeah there's like a revenge bar at an EX bar
5784000	5786000	and there's I noticed
5786000	5788000	that speaking of getting knocked through the wall
5788000	5790000	then that next stage started
5790000	5792000	in the middle of the room they were in so
5792000	5794000	it's kind of neat how those environments are coming into play
5794000	5796000	as well so I think we'll be having
5796000	5798000	Street Fighter 5 news a lot I mean they could
5798000	5800000	announce like a character a week probably leading up to
5800000	5802000	the release we'll see
5802000	5804000	DarkSakura what do you have for us?
5804000	5806000	I have some stuff
5806000	5808000	specifically something about Borderlands
5808000	5810000	there's going to be a Borderlands
5810000	5812000	remastered apparently this
5812000	5814000	was information released
5814000	5816000	from the Australian age rating
5816000	5818000	board they didn't
5818000	5820000	actually say exactly what Borderlands it is
5820000	5822000	but there's going to be a Borderlands remastered
5822000	5824000	edition with
5824000	5826000	an MA 15 plus rating
5826000	5828000	supposed to be on Xbox One
5828000	5830000	Playstation 4 and likely
5830000	5832000	PC the
5832000	5834000	thought is that it's
5834000	5836000	well at least it's a speculation that it's going to
5836000	5838000	be the original one but honestly
5838000	5840000	I think it's all three
5840000	5842000	for the guess see that would
5842000	5844000	be really I mean
5844000	5846000	I don't think it would be that hard
5846000	5848000	really to update graphics wise
5848000	5850000	and
5850000	5852000	well yeah they don't have to do anything graphics wise because it's on
5852000	5854000	PC so they already have the high res graphics
5854000	5856000	they just redo the engine for console
5856000	5858000	and
5858000	5860000	port it over probably want to
5860000	5862000	have maybe more smoothing
5862000	5864000	for the PC iteration
5864000	5866000	we talked a lot last week about that whole Final Fantasy
5866000	5868000	7 reveal which is a PC
5868000	5870000	port on the PS4 so we know this
5870000	5872000	is an outlet that a lot of people are using
5872000	5874000	so
5874000	5876000	I'd say if you
5876000	5878000	don't have the games yet just keep your eyes open
5878000	5880000	there's of course not exactly
5880000	5882000	a release date on this this is
5882000	5884000	just coming from
5884000	5886000	the Australian ratings
5886000	5888000	board but it's something
5888000	5890000	to think about
5890000	5892000	it's not the only game that's looking like this
5892000	5894000	later in the show we have news of another
5894000	5896000	game so this seems to be
5896000	5898000	could be a theme where
5898000	5900000	a lot of the PS3 classics
5900000	5902000	so to speak end up getting remade for PS4
5902000	5904000	this year alone
5904000	5906000	we've had Tomb Raider, Sleeping Dogs
5906000	5908000	they had
5908000	5910000	well it's a PC port but
5910000	5912000	Shadow Warrior came over
5912000	5914000	Saints Row
5914000	5916000	4 and
5916000	5918000	God of Hell is going to be in January
5918000	5920000	which I'm totally picking that up again
5920000	5922000	I own it on 4 systems
5922000	5924000	already but I'll buy it again
5924000	5926000	even though I really didn't care for
5926000	5928000	4 too much but
5928000	5930000	whatever
5930000	5932000	Grand Theft Auto 5
5932000	5934000	but hell I'll buy that 4 times if I need to
5934000	5936000	I'll buy it on PC when it comes out again
5936000	5938000	when you love something enough Loki
5938000	5940000	exactly you'll buy multiple
5940000	5942000	now you understand okay next time
5942000	5944000	you ask me why do you own the
5944000	5946000	Mass Effect trilogy 5 different times
5946000	5948000	okay well that's a little
5948000	5950000	different okay let's talk
5950000	5952000	about how that's different one Grand Theft Auto 5
5952000	5954000	on PlayStation 4 is a significant
5954000	5956000	upgrade of Grand Theft Auto the only reason
5956000	5958000	I bought it on the other 2 systems
5958000	5960000	in the past was because
5960000	5962000	I was going to play it on
5962000	5964000	Xbox but then my
5964000	5966000	my boss wanted to play it on
5966000	5968000	PS3 and he promised that we would so
5968000	5970000	play this game multiple times on PS3
5970000	5972000	and we'd just be playing all the time because we'd play
5972000	5974000	tons of Grand Theft Auto 4 and
5974000	5976000	that never happened that's why I bought it on
5976000	5978000	3 systems
5978000	5980000	otherwise it would have been 2 systems and to be fair
5980000	5982000	I've sold back my copies on the other systems
5982000	5984000	but if Mass Effect trilogy ends up
5984000	5986000	being one of those games that ends up on PS4 as well
5986000	5988000	I know you'll be buying it
5988000	5990000	I'm doing it
5990000	5992000	and I guarantee you it will
5992000	5994000	at some point right before
5994000	5996000	Mass Effect 4 comes out or whatever they're going to call it
5996000	5998000	Loki promised you guys, Loki promised
5998000	6000000	alright let's travel around the world
6000000	6002000	and check out some games we do know are coming
6002000	6004000	out to a store near you although I imagine
6004000	6006000	for most of the world not much right
6006000	6008000	Loki? I wasn't going to say
6008000	6010000	I haven't even looked at it yet but I'm going to
6010000	6012000	go out on a limb here and say I don't think
6012000	6014000	anything's coming out this week in fact I'm
6014000	6016000	going to say nothing's coming out this week I think
6016000	6018000	digitally I think you get Tetris
6018000	6020000	well digitally there's going to be stuff coming
6020000	6022000	out but I'm not talking digital I'm talking
6022000	6024000	you know physical releases and
6024000	6026000	there is not a
6026000	6028000	thing coming out in fact I would be willing
6028000	6030000	to bet that you won't see anything until January
6030000	6032000	well it is that slow
6032000	6034000	time of the year but going to Japan it's
6034000	6036000	a little bit different they still are trickling out
6036000	6038000	a few games on some of the systems including

6168000	6170000	free but it's not

6172000	6174000	getting it anyway cause they crazy
6174000	6176000	and I mean that in the best possible way

6192000	6194000	and then the classic game of the week
6194000	6196000	Loki
6196000	6198000	so um
6198000	6200000	Sega is trying to figure out
6200000	6202000	how to adapt their properties
6202000	6204000	into other forms
6204000	6206000	of media and entertainment
6206000	6208000	including TV
6208000	6210000	I'm hoping that the fact that they're hiring
6210000	6212000	this media exec
6212000	6214000	means we're gonna get some better
6214000	6216000	stuff other than Sonic Boom cause I don't
6216000	6218000	know, I don't know if that
6218000	6220000	new cartoon's any good
6220000	6222000	from what I hear but apparently
6222000	6224000	even Choflin
6224000	6226000	is going to, is set to
6226000	6228000	adapt some of
6228000	6230000	their old franchises into
6230000	6232000	you know, television
6232000	6234000	web series, you know
6234000	6236000	you name it, movies
6236000	6238000	they're seeing adaptions of
6238000	6240000	Altered Beast, Crazy Taxi
6240000	6242000	Shinobi, Streets of Rage
6242000	6244000	and other titles
6244000	6246000	I can only think, you know
6246000	6248000	we've seen Sonic so far
6248000	6250000	and I'm just hoping that they reboot
6250000	6252000	that at some point
6252000	6254000	that actually works for them
6254000	6256000	but man, I would like to see some of those old
6256000	6258000	Shenmue, Shenmue
6258000	6260000	Shenmue
6260000	6262000	come on, lucky hit
6262000	6264000	hits the big screen
6264000	6266000	you know, as weird as it would be
6266000	6268000	I would love to see like
6268000	6270000	a Moonwalker series
6270000	6272000	or something like that, even though I understand
6272000	6274000	that's, you know, based off of the Moonwalker film
6274000	6276000	I'd still
6276000	6278000	love to see that as a spin-off series
6278000	6280000	or Space Channel 5
6280000	6282000	hello, yeah, that's what Fifth Dream in our chat says
6282000	6284000	Space Channel 5 the series
6284000	6286000	YYR in chat says, go home
6286000	6288000	Sega, you're drunk
6288000	6290000	or can we do like some
6290000	6292000	you know, not the
6292000	6294000	I fear that Crazy Taxi
6294000	6296000	will be it, it's gonna be like really
6296000	6298000	like, just like second-handed
6298000	6300000	can we do like something with like all the Dreamcast
6300000	6302000	you know, characters and stuff
6302000	6304000	and like a sort of Captain N type of environment
6304000	6306000	but not stupid
6306000	6308000	you know, can we do something like that, you know, have Ooh La La
6308000	6310000	and maybe, you know, get
6310000	6312000	the nameless characters
6312000	6314000	from Crazy Taxi or whatever
6314000	6316000	and hell, let's throw in some
6316000	6318000	what was it
6318000	6320000	I don't know
6320000	6322000	other series that they had
6322000	6324000	on Dreamcast
6324000	6326000	Fifth Dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
6326000	6328000	suggests Hatsune Miku the animated series
6328000	6330000	now that one I could actually see happening
6330000	6332000	because Hatsune Miku is a pretty big deal
6332000	6334000	for Sega, so especially overseas
6334000	6336000	so, yeah
6336000	6338000	I don't know, maybe
6338000	6340000	Daytona
6340000	6342000	do do do do do do
6342000	6344000	don't even
6344000	6346000	alright, well
6346000	6348000	a lot of people cry
6348000	6350000	a lot of people on the internet
6350000	6352000	saying don't even to this
6352000	6354000	character that was announced for Tekken 7
6354000	6356000	and this was
6356000	6358000	a character kind of like
6358000	6360000	a, I guess you could say like a
6360000	6362000	cosplay
6362000	6364000	fan girl, kitty girl
6364000	6366000	the name was Lucky Chloe
6366000	6368000	was the character unveiled during a
6368000	6370000	livestream celebrating the 20th anniversary
6370000	6372000	of the Tekken franchise
6372000	6374000	she's wearing pink cat ears
6374000	6376000	and like a pink
6376000	6378000	like cat paws thing
6378000	6380000	and she's got on like a little black tutu
6380000	6382000	with a tail that actually kind of looks like a cat
6382000	6384000	so I mean she looks just like
6384000	6386000	a cute, you know, anime
6386000	6388000	girl that
6388000	6390000	could show up in the Tekken series, right?
6390000	6392000	maybe she works at a cat girl
6392000	6394000	cafe, perhaps
6394000	6396000	but they announce Lucky Chloe for Tekken
6396000	6398000	and all of a sudden
6398000	6400000	a lot of negativity on the
6400000	6402000	internet get out, but negativity
6402000	6404000	hit the internet
6404000	6406000	and the series producer Katsuhiro
6406000	6408000	Harada was alerted
6408000	6410000	to a thread on NeoGaf
6410000	6412000	where a bunch of people were saying
6412000	6414000	things like, God, I hate her already
6414000	6416000	but first off
6416000	6418000	why did you go to NeoGaf?
6418000	6420000	but NeoGaf, they hate everything
6420000	6422000	sorry, not sorry
6422000	6424000	I'm just keeping it real, you guys
6424000	6426000	but anyway, I'm sure Twitter
6426000	6428000	was no better, speaking of Twitter
6428000	6430000	Harada ended up tweeting out
6430000	6432000	quote, are you Western, only one
6432000	6434000	bulletin board? Hello, small world
6434000	6436000	I'll make muscular and skinhead
6436000	6438000	character for you
6438000	6440000	probably in reference to
6440000	6442000	stereotypes of American characters
6442000	6444000	I can see the meme already
6444000	6446000	they have
6446000	6448000	the Heath Ledger Joker
6448000	6450000	sitting there
6450000	6452000	Felicia!
6452000	6454000	Catgirl, Felicia, and Dark Sockers
6454000	6456000	no one blinks an eye
6456000	6458000	bye Felicia
6458000	6460000	alright, anyway
6460000	6462000	he went on to say that
6462000	6464000	American fans shouldn't
6464000	6466000	be upset because Chloe is just one of the
6466000	6468000	game's many characters
6468000	6470000	which, if I recall
6470000	6472000	involved a fighting
6472000	6474000	panda bear
6474000	6476000	and a wooden dummy
6476000	6478000	a wooden dummy
6478000	6480000	a kangaroo
6480000	6482000	a dinosaur
6482000	6484000	give me a fucking break, this is
6484000	6486000	Tekken, people
6486000	6488000	and Yoshimitsu, I mean, come on
6488000	6490000	if a catgirl wants to catgirl, then let her
6490000	6492000	catgirl
6492000	6494000	here's the thing that I have to say, it's his
6494000	6496000	fucking game, he can put whoever
6496000	6498000	whoever the hell he wants in it
6498000	6500000	if you don't like that character, don't play as that
6500000	6502000	character, I don't really care for Dalzim
6502000	6504000	I don't play as Dalzim
6504000	6506000	not that I hate the character itself, it's just I don't like the way he controls
6506000	6508000	nobody bonks when Dead or Alive
6508000	6510000	had a Teletubby
6510000	6512000	Dead or Alive had a Teletubby?
6512000	6514000	What's his face
6514000	6516000	with the Teletubby outfit?
6516000	6518000	since we are talking about
6518000	6520000	game creation and game creators a lot
6520000	6522000	tonight with that special theme, and I should have asked the guys
6522000	6524000	from Kooky with Unity about this
6524000	6526000	here's a tip
6526000	6528000	from me to the guy here, producer
6528000	6530000	of the Tekken series, don't read the
6530000	6532000	comments, do not ever
6532000	6534000	ever ever read the comments
6534000	6536000	don't read them, don't let NeoGaf
6536000	6538000	influence your game, don't let any
6538000	6540000	website influence your game like that
6540000	6542000	just make a good game
6542000	6544000	that you love, and that is what's most important
6544000	6546000	I'm not even going to get into any of this
6546000	6548000	so, but yes, I whole
6548000	6550000	hardly agree, you know, if you're making
6550000	6552000	a diverse set of characters, that's fine
6552000	6554000	this is the character you want to make, that's cool
6554000	6556000	they have other characters, there's
6556000	6558000	I don't think Tekken suffers
6558000	6560000	from non-diverse characters, they have
6560000	6562000	plenty of diversity in characters
6562000	6564000	and species
6564000	6566000	and sex
6566000	6568000	orientation, whatever
6568000	6570000	it's
6570000	6572000	that's not even a complaint of that
6572000	6574000	series, it could be Dead or
6574000	6576000	Alive, I mean that's, you know
6576000	6578000	a little bit worse
6578000	6580000	Rama in our chatroom over at live.fognetwork.com says
6580000	6582000	I'm amused at the cosplay
6582000	6584000	fandom who got mad because they assumed
6584000	6586000	Lucky Chloe was based off of Jessica
6586000	6588000	Negri
6588000	6590000	I hope I said the name right, I don't even know who she is
6590000	6592000	she's the one that did the
6592000	6594000	Lollipop Chainsaw
6594000	6596000	cosplay, and she's down on her stuff too
6596000	6598000	sorry, I believe that she's also
6598000	6600000	the one though who did
6600000	6602000	I may be getting her confused
6602000	6604000	but she also did cosplay in Blackface
6604000	6606000	at the end of the, oh, well
6606000	6608000	at the end of the day, at the end of the day
6608000	6610000	if this was inspired by a real
6610000	6612000	life person or whatever, so what
6612000	6614000	so what
6614000	6616000	I mean, god, they put that one girl
6616000	6618000	in Mass Effect... Law? Hello?
6618000	6620000	Yeah, right? Law?
6620000	6622000	I mean
6622000	6624000	No, he's totally original, not inspired
6624000	6626000	by anybody named Bruce Lee
6626000	6628000	They put that one IGN girl in Mass Effect 3
6628000	6630000	and it didn't ruin the game
6630000	6632000	Who's did, uh...
6632000	6634000	It might not have been her, by the way
6634000	6636000	I might be confusing her with somebody else
6636000	6638000	Yeah, alright, yeah, don't start
6638000	6640000	rumors here, I'm just kidding
6640000	6642000	No, Rama told me who it was
6642000	6644000	but anyway
6644000	6646000	No, who I'd want to see a fighting game done by
6646000	6648000	Rama clarifies that wasn't her
6648000	6650000	I know, it was somebody else though that looks
6650000	6652000	very similar to her
6652000	6654000	I would love to see a fighting game done by Platinum Games
6654000	6656000	That would be fucking amazing with all their character designs
6656000	6658000	You never know
6658000	6660000	Alright, let's
6660000	6662000	travel back to a time when things were
6662000	6664000	simple, because, like, we're gonna go back to
6664000	6666000	a time when, you know what, who
6666000	6668000	knows what it looks like, because it's a big square box
6668000	6670000	moving around your television
6670000	6672000	Alright, maybe we're not talking about a game
6672000	6674000	that old this week, but we are gonna take
6674000	6676000	a trip to the vault, where Dark Soccer's gonna
6676000	6678000	open up the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey
6678000	6680000	you should show a little respect
6680000	6682000	to the games that came before you
6682000	6684000	This is the classic game of the week for this week
6684000	6686000	Dark Soccer, what'd you pick?
6686000	6688000	Well, my whole logic
6688000	6690000	behind this was trying to find a game
6690000	6692000	that was ten years old
6692000	6694000	that people would go, holy shit, that's ten years old
6694000	6696000	So, I picked
6696000	6698000	Silent Hill 4 The Room
6698000	6700000	Holy shit, that's ten years old?
6700000	6702000	Yes, it is
6702000	6704000	At any rate
6704000	6706000	this one
6706000	6708000	was published by Konami
6708000	6710000	of course, developed by Team Silent
6710000	6712000	It came out in
6712000	6714000	Japan in June 2004, and in
6714000	6716000	North America and Europe in September
6716000	6718000	This was at my
6718000	6720000	second or third E3
6720000	6722000	and they had the whole
6722000	6724000	big kitchen set up and everything, it was really awesome
6724000	6726000	I have pictures of it somewhere
6726000	6728000	But this one, instead of being set
6728000	6730000	specifically in Silent Hill
6730000	6732000	is set in a town called South Ashfield
6732000	6734000	and it follows this dude named
6734000	6736000	Harry Townsend around
6736000	6738000	He's locked in his apartment
6738000	6740000	and he finds different ways to
6740000	6742000	escape through his bathroom
6742000	6744000	through other ways, and
6744000	6746000	goes through all these different craziness
6746000	6748000	where he's chasing an undead serial killer
6748000	6750000	named Walter
6750000	6752000	because Walter is totally
6752000	6754000	a serial killer's name, don't you think?
6754000	6756000	A little bit, yeah
6756000	6758000	So basically
6758000	6760000	you've got the one save point
6760000	6762000	which is his room
6762000	6764000	The room will restore his health
6764000	6766000	but there are
6766000	6768000	hauntings that happen
6768000	6770000	in the room during the second part of the game
6770000	6772000	Whatever you do, don't
6772000	6774000	get the Robbie the Rabbit
6774000	6776000	to take him back to your house
6776000	6778000	Seriously, it will fuck you up
6780000	6782000	He also is
6782000	6784000	spending the second half of the game
6784000	6786000	helping his neighbor Eileen
6786000	6788000	who
6788000	6790000	she has to go around with him
6790000	6792000	She takes damage as she gets
6792000	6794000	possessed over and over again
6794000	6796000	and so basically
6796000	6798000	however much damage that she takes
6798000	6800000	directly affects the ending
6800000	6802000	that you get
6802000	6804000	So
6804000	6806000	basically though
6806000	6808000	you beat shit up
6808000	6810000	You can shoot things
6810000	6812000	You've got different
6812000	6814000	talismans as well that can protect you from damage
6814000	6816000	can protect your
6816000	6818000	room from being haunted
6818000	6820000	and you can
6820000	6822000	charge your melee attacks
6822000	6824000	You can actually do more damage
6824000	6826000	You also have unkillable ghosts
6826000	6828000	that are
6828000	6830000	Walter Sullivan's victims
6830000	6832000	and the ghosts can hurt you
6832000	6834000	and can only be nullified by two items
6834000	6836000	and you can also
6836000	6838000	exercise hauntings from your apartment
6838000	6840000	with those same items
6840000	6842000	and you can knock down
6842000	6844000	ghosts
6844000	6846000	It's basically two bullets that will knock them down
6846000	6848000	or you pin them permanently with a sword
6848000	6850000	So there are certain
6850000	6852000	ways you can kill things
6852000	6854000	So there's also
6854000	6858000	another
6858000	6860000	character that actually you see
6860000	6862000	I don't remember how many
6862000	6864000	Well I'm sure everyone remembers the
6864000	6866000	remakes of
6866000	6868000	the songs they did for DDR from this game
6868000	6870000	but
6870000	6872000	one of the characters who
6872000	6874000	dies early on in the game is in the
6874000	6876000	beginning
6876000	6878000	is in the video
6878000	6880000	with Cynthia
6880000	6882000	but I mean
6882000	6884000	the game is
6884000	6886000	it's weird
6886000	6888000	It's one of the last of the good Silent Hill games
6888000	6890000	And then of course
6890000	6892000	don't worry
6892000	6894000	you also get the special endings
6898000	6900000	Well actually
6900000	6902000	in this one
6902000	6904000	actually I'm wrong
6904000	6906000	this one does not have the UFO ending
6906000	6908000	I was going to say I thought it
6908000	6910000	Yeah this one didn't have the UFO
6910000	6912000	It's the first one that didn't have the UFO ending
6912000	6914000	Oh bummer
6914000	6916000	You have
6916000	6918000	four endings
6918000	6920000	Mother, Eileen's death
6920000	6922000	The
6922000	6924000	Twenty One Sacrament
6924000	6926000	and
6926000	6928000	hold on because I know I've never gotten the dog
6928000	6930000	not the dog but the UFO ending
6930000	6932000	Yeah there's no UFO ending
6932000	6934000	There's not a disco party ending?
6934000	6936000	No there should be a UFO ending
6936000	6938000	PT better have a dog ending
6938000	6940000	I know right
6940000	6942000	There's actually a picture
6942000	6944000	of
6944000	6946000	how they set up the whole kitchen
6946000	6948000	thing
6948000	6950000	which is not a very good picture
6950000	6952000	I'll have to find a better one for the chat room
6952000	6954000	but the soundtrack
6954000	6956000	is just really amazing
6956000	6958000	of course like all the Silent Hill soundtracks
6958000	6960000	that were done by Yamaoka
6960000	6962000	The
6962000	6964000	Japanese soundtrack had a second
6964000	6966000	disc that had
6966000	6968000	music
6968000	6970000	done by Yamaoka
6970000	6972000	that was done to reading of
6972000	6974000	traditional Japanese stories and then the
6974000	6976000	American version had 13
6976000	6978000	exclusive tracks and
6978000	6980000	remixes and then there was
6980000	6982000	Your Rain that was redone for DVR
6982000	6984000	and
6984000	6986000	there was also a
6986000	6988000	UMD out called The Silent Hill Experience
6990000	6992000	Track 22
6992000	6994000	was also called
6994000	6996000	No Way to Escape
6996000	6998000	and it was a special recording for the soundtrack
6998000	7000000	so
7000000	7002000	there you go I have picked
7002000	7004000	Silent Hill
7004000	7006000	4th Room
7006000	7008000	probably like I said one of the last
7008000	7010000	good Silent Hill games
7010000	7012000	I haven't played it since the game first came out
7012000	7014000	I think I still have your copy
7014000	7016000	On what? Xbox right?
7016000	7018000	No I thought it was
7018000	7020000	Yeah it was
7020000	7022000	No I had it on Xbox
7022000	7024000	I remember playing the game when I was living with
7024000	7026000	Loki I must have been 10 years ago I was living with Loki
7026000	7028000	and I got so scared at one part and Loki
7028000	7030000	looks over and goes what the hell is going on over there shut up
7030000	7032000	I didn't say that
7032000	7034000	Yes you did!
7034000	7036000	I would never tell you to shut up
7036000	7038000	I may have inquired what's going on
7038000	7040000	Alright walking into
7040000	7042000	studio a connoisseur
7042000	7044000	of the Silent Hill series
7044000	7046000	a friend of the show
7046000	7048000	Shana Lee goes here in studio with us
7048000	7050000	So I have to talk about this for a second
7050000	7052000	Is there a dog ending yes or no?
7052000	7054000	No it only has 4 endings
7054000	7056000	That was the start
7056000	7058000	of the downfall
7058000	7060000	That's what I should have done
7060000	7062000	as the fortune cookie
7062000	7064000	You go bark bark bark bark bark bark bark
7064000	7066000	I heard there talk of
7066000	7068000	your reign being in
7068000	7070000	Silent Hill in DDR
7070000	7072000	it did not get mentioned at least by the time
7072000	7074000	I got up that there was another Silent Hill 4 song
7074000	7076000	in DDR
7076000	7078000	Did you guys talk about that?
7078000	7080000	I don't think so
7080000	7082000	No Shana
7082000	7084000	Is that the one from 3?
7084000	7086000	No no not in PS2 DDR
7086000	7088000	UltraMix
7088000	7090000	2
7090000	7092000	has
7092000	7094000	from the US CD sampler
7094000	7096000	the remix of Waver
7096000	7098000	from
7098000	7100000	cause that was all my doing
7100000	7102000	and then they did a really bad cut of it
7102000	7104000	so I feel bad in a way
7104000	7106000	but I do not feel that bad cause I like that song
7106000	7108000	So you pushed to get that song in the game and then
7108000	7110000	I'm the only one that said anything about that song
7110000	7112000	and they brought it into the game
7112000	7114000	Yay Shane
7114000	7116000	Well there you go
7116000	7118000	So who knew you had a little piece of the classic game of the week
7118000	7120000	How does it make you feel to hear that Silent Hill 4 is 10 years old
7120000	7122000	Really old
7122000	7124000	Cause I remember that E3
7124000	7126000	That was my first E3
7126000	7128000	Also remember we had
7128000	7130000	the
7130000	7132000	scoop on that song
7132000	7134000	We had the world premiere of your reign
7134000	7136000	from DDR and that was Shane who
7136000	7138000	made that all happen
7138000	7140000	We had to talk over half of it for people recording it
7140000	7142000	Yes cause that was back in the day
7142000	7144000	when people would do that
7144000	7146000	People were obsessed with DDR
7146000	7148000	And then
7148000	7150000	I got a bajillion copies of the sampler
7150000	7152000	because of Dan
7152000	7154000	And that's actually what happened
7154000	7156000	is that Shane had an early
7156000	7158000	print of that sampler
7158000	7160000	so that's how we were able to use it
7160000	7162000	And I want to say
7162000	7164000	cause that's one of my favorite Silent Hills
7164000	7166000	I love 4
7166000	7168000	The scariest ones cause I don't like Walter chasing me around
7168000	7170000	It's not fun
7170000	7172000	When that game came out in Japan
7172000	7174000	I used an import site
7174000	7176000	to import that game
7176000	7178000	overnight
7178000	7180000	weekend just so I could have the CD
7180000	7182000	that came with it for a car trip
7182000	7184000	I was taking on that Saturday
7184000	7186000	How much did that
7186000	7188000	set you back?
7188000	7190000	Well the game I think itself at the time was maybe like 60 or 70
7190000	7192000	and it was the collector's edition
7192000	7194000	which made it a little more expensive
7194000	7196000	Pretty sure it was like 180
7196000	7198000	at that point to hear the CD
7198000	7200000	You know what? I've done that
7200000	7202000	Because when Rival Schools
7202000	7204000	the evolution for Rival Schools came out
7204000	7206000	I had that shit
7206000	7208000	I paid 120 bucks for that
7208000	7210000	Alright
7210000	7212000	Well we gotta go to break you guys
7212000	7214000	because we still have plenty of show coming up
7214000	7216000	and we're like 2 hours into the show
7216000	7218000	so we're gonna skedaddle through part B
7218000	7220000	so we can get to your calls, your emails and much more
7220000	7222000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
7222000	7224000	right after this
7230000	7232000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
7232000	7234000	live on this Sunday evening
7234000	7236000	December the 14th of 2014
7236000	7238000	the 579th episode of our show
7238000	7240000	We're running a little long tonight
7240000	7242000	because we had an awesome interview
7242000	7244000	with the guys from Cooking with Unity
7244000	7246000	and you know what? Can't complain
7246000	7248000	if that's gonna hold us and make us run a little long
7248000	7250000	it's for damn good reason
7250000	7252000	as you know, encouraging people to get out there
7252000	7254000	and create and make games
7254000	7256000	it was a great interview, a great time
7256000	7258000	We are gonna try to make up a little of the time
7258000	7260000	here by running through some more news
7260000	7262000	here with our rapid fire news
7262000	7264000	Loki! Yes, so let's talk a little bit
7264000	7266000	about free stuff
7266000	7268000	and this is awesome
7268000	7270000	You know, Origin does
7270000	7272000	these kind of free games
7272000	7274000	for a while, on the house
7274000	7276000	they call it, and they've been swapping
7276000	7278000	out different games and pretty much
7278000	7280000	this is my entire Origin collection anyways
7280000	7282000	but SimCity 2000 is now up for grabs
7282000	7284000	so you can
7284000	7286000	get that for free if you have
7286000	7288000	the Origin client installed on your system
7288000	7290000	and check it out
7290000	7292000	and then I guess they said
7292000	7294000	normally they're also offering
7294000	7296000	I guess the $5 special edition
7296000	7298000	oh, it was the $5 special edition
7298000	7300000	that they were offering on the house
7300000	7302000	pretty cool
7302000	7304000	so go check it out, rather old SimCity game
7304000	7306000	and it's not a bad SimCity game
7306000	7308000	and then of course
7308000	7310000	with the popularity of
7310000	7312000	Theatrythm Final Fantasy
7312000	7314000	we are now gonna be seeing
7314000	7316000	Theatrythm Dragon Quest
7316000	7318000	as a next game coming out
7318000	7320000	from Square Enix
7320000	7322000	kind of along the same lines
7322000	7324000	except now instead of music from the Final Fantasy series
7324000	7326000	you'll have music from the Dragon Quest series
7326000	7328000	and it's expected now
7328000	7330000	to be coming out in Japan
7330000	7332000	on the 3DS
7332000	7334000	March 26, 2015
7334000	7336000	there's yet ones coming over the west
7336000	7338000	but you better believe it probably will at some point
7338000	7340000	well, I assume some of the music
7340000	7342000	will come from Dragon Quest X
7342000	7344000	which is a game we don't even have here yet
7344000	7346000	but I guess Theatrythm Curtain Call
7346000	7348000	had some Final Fantasy games that weren't out here
7348000	7350000	either yet anyway
7350000	7352000	with the Type-0
7352000	7354000	I don't know, I don't think it's as sure of a thing
7354000	7356000	as you seem to think
7356000	7358000	I think that they would bring it over here
7358000	7360000	I hope so, if nothing else
7360000	7362000	just freaking make it a digital only game
7362000	7364000	and buy it, exactly
7364000	7366000	and then Final Fantasy
7366000	7368000	X and X-2
7368000	7370000	are getting another
7370000	7372000	well, a port
7372000	7374000	of the HD remaster
7374000	7376000	so I don't even know how much better it's going to look
7376000	7378000	but it's going to be coming now to
7378000	7380000	PlayStation 4
7380000	7382000	and they said that it's going to be priced
7382000	7384000	at $50
7384000	7386000	so next spring
7386000	7388000	PlayStation 4, Final Fantasy X and X-2
7388000	7390000	almost pretty much a year since the last one
7390000	7392000	was released on PlayStation 3
7392000	7394000	so
7394000	7396000	I don't know, I'll check it out I guess
7396000	7398000	they haven't really said what's going to be unique about it
7398000	7400000	other than that there's going to be some system exclusive features
7400000	7402000	thanks
7402000	7404000	that's very vague
7404000	7406000	I worry when they say
7406000	7408000	system exclusive features
7408000	7410000	that means share play
7410000	7412000	and broadcasting on Twitch
7412000	7414000	because those are features that are built into the system
7414000	7416000	I really would take that
7416000	7418000	to mean nothing more than
7418000	7420000	just things that are on the PS4 that aren't on the PS3
7420000	7422000	I think that they're just porting it, I don't think it's going to look any better
7422000	7424000	I would not
7424000	7426000	get your hopes up about this at all
7426000	7428000	and then
7428000	7430000	unless you have a PS4 and not a PS3
7430000	7432000	then get your hopes up
7432000	7434000	and then finally they've confirmed that the
7434000	7436000	Final Fantasy XV demo will be
7436000	7438000	exclusive to day one copies of Type 0
7438000	7440000	HD
7440000	7442000	it will not be coming out separately
7442000	7444000	they're saying it's intended to be
7444000	7446000	a special gift for those who purchase
7446000	7448000	early
7448000	7450000	so pre-order that game if you want it
7450000	7452000	the demo
7452000	7454000	and they're saying that
7454000	7456000	is that going to be coming to North America as well
7456000	7458000	or is that just the Japanese copies
7458000	7460000	because I'm not really sure yet on that
7460000	7462000	Final Fantasy XV
7462000	7464000	or I should say Final Fantasy
7464000	7466000	Type 0 HD
7466000	7468000	March 17
7468000	7470000	2015
7470000	7472000	lots of stuff to look forward to
7472000	7474000	and we have to buy an early
7474000	7476000	copy so I can play the demo
7476000	7478000	it looks good
7478000	7480000	I would have bought the game anyway
7480000	7482000	but for the demo
7482000	7484000	certainly that just cements it
7484000	7486000	alright well moving on to some other quick news here
7486000	7488000	as far as expos and conventions
7488000	7490000	go GX3
7490000	7492000	which was once known as
7492000	7494000	GamerX3
7494000	7496000	GX3 has been dated for next
7496000	7498000	year this is now moving from a
7498000	7500000	summer convention to a winter convention
7500000	7502000	we knew that was going to happen but it is now
7502000	7504000	dated December 11th through 13th
7504000	7506000	and they have a new venue
7506000	7508000	they have moved it out of San Francisco
7508000	7510000	it will now be in San Jose
7510000	7512000	at the San Jose area
7512000	7514000	is that less of a drive or
7514000	7516000	more of a drive?
7516000	7518000	it's more of a drive but quicker because of traffic
7518000	7520000	and less of a cost ideally
7520000	7522000	yeah and actually they're saying
7522000	7524000	they haven't said officially but they're saying that the rooms
7524000	7526000	will be like $100 cheaper a night
7526000	7528000	this year so that's already
7528000	7530000	which is funny you know what's funny if you go back and listen
7530000	7532000	to some of the talk I said
7532000	7534000	on an earlier show when I was kind of summarizing GamerX
7534000	7536000	I said they really should think about moving it to
7536000	7538000	San Jose and they can have it
7538000	7540000	there's the convention center and all the hotels right there
7540000	7542000	well guess where the Marriott is?
7542000	7544000	it's one of the hotels connected to the convention center
7544000	7546000	so I like to think
7546000	7548000	I called it and maybe I helped
7548000	7550000	see I used to say like Santa Clara
7550000	7552000	would have been a good place but now that they built the Niner
7552000	7554000	stadium right next to it that's probably not good anymore
7554000	7556000	and you know there are some people are very
7556000	7558000	happy to hear it's moving to San Jose because it's closer
7558000	7560000	to him some people where San Francisco is closer
7560000	7562000	not as happy to hear about it
7562000	7564000	I think at the end of the day
7564000	7566000	you know you don't hear a lot of bad stuff about
7566000	7568000	this con by the way disclosure
7568000	7570000	or whatever or encouragement VOG
7570000	7572000	network is a sponsor of GX3
7572000	7574000	we will have a table at the show
7574000	7576000	myself and Dark Soccer are for sure going
7576000	7578000	I'm hoping Loki can go depending on
7578000	7580000	the situation we'll see I have a year notice
7580000	7582000	just for one day if nothing else
7582000	7584000	I would like to go I haven't been to a con
7584000	7586000	in I don't know
7586000	7588000	a very long time
7588000	7590000	well you'd have a good time here so
7590000	7592000	again it's December 11-13 at the San Jose
7592000	7594000	Marriott and tickets are available right
7594000	7596000	now and they have all different
7596000	7598000	levels and platforms right now the cheapest
7598000	7600000	is $70
7600000	7602000	to $5.95 but if you really do want to
7602000	7604000	go Loki let's talk off air because
7604000	7606000	I have an opportunity for you
7606000	7608000	alright
7608000	7610000	that is that so GX3
7610000	7612000	will see you there in December
7612000	7614000	moving on to some more stories about
7614000	7616000	The Witcher 3 is up next
7616000	7618000	Witcher 3 got delayed and
7618000	7620000	this is what I think the second time
7620000	7622000	this game has been delayed it's been pushed back
7622000	7624000	now from February to
7624000	7626000	May 19th is the new date
7626000	7628000	and a big apology letter going
7628000	7630000	up on the Witcher.com the official site
7630000	7632000	we owe you an apology we set the release
7632000	7634000	day too hastily it's a hard lesson
7634000	7636000	wanted to take heart for the future you know what
7636000	7638000	you know what exactly I rather
7638000	7640000	you push it back like EA
7640000	7642000	do with Dragon Age Inquisition and Battlefield
7642000	7644000	and have it be a good game when it comes out
7644000	7646000	then to put it out like Assassin's Creed
7646000	7648000	you know I don't
7648000	7650000	we'll wait the extra three months
7650000	7652000	I realize you're going to get shit from Twitter now
7652000	7654000	like oh you pushed it back again
7654000	7656000	can't make your deadline
7656000	7658000	but when the game comes out if the game kicks
7658000	7660000	a lot of ass then people
7660000	7662000	are going to shut the hell up about the delays
7662000	7664000	and enjoy the game or Grand Theft Auto
7664000	7666000	right Loki that series never gets delayed
7666000	7668000	well yeah exactly and
7668000	7670000	it's not and people aren't complaining
7670000	7672000	because well they're just complaining because
7672000	7674000	they don't get to play as early as they'd like
7674000	7676000	to and that's really you know
7676000	7678000	that's not a bad thing
7678000	7680000	alright and lastly
7680000	7682000	it's your last chance to check out
7682000	7684000	After Burner Climax
7684000	7686000	now this game came out a little while ago
7686000	7688000	but it is going to be delisted from
7688000	7690000	Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network
7690000	7692000	on Christmas Eve December 24th
7692000	7694000	so if you were at all interested
7694000	7696000	in the game you might want to grab it because again
7696000	7698000	it will be pulled on December 24th
7698000	7700000	and you will not be able to buy it
7700000	7702000	if you should accidentally delete the game
7702000	7704000	or something you can download it again
7704000	7706000	that won't be a problem but this has to do
7706000	7708000	with some of the license
7708000	7710000	agreements between Sega and the
7710000	7712000	aircraft makers of some of the
7712000	7714000	planes that are in the game those license agreements are
7714000	7716000	expiring so much like
7716000	7718000	Outrun got delisted
7718000	7720000	and you know some other things that have licensed
7720000	7722000	content and they get delisted
7722000	7724000	that's why it is fictional aircraft
7724000	7726000	that are like those aircraft
7726000	7728000	fictional aircraft
7728000	7730000	that's why Ridge Racer was so cool because they have fictional
7730000	7732000	cars or Punch Out when they just replaced
7732000	7734000	Mike Tyson with Mr. Dream it was easy
7734000	7736000	but anyway alright well whatever
7736000	7738000	they got to do what they got to do so After Burner
7738000	7740000	if you want to get that last chance Dark Sakura

7864000	7866000	alright let's go to
7866000	7868000	the FUGL question of the week
7868000	7870000	it's my vehicle
7872000	7874000	ha ha
7874000	7876000	each week we visit
7876000	7878000	Facebook and Google Plus
7878000	7880000	you slam that together you get FUGL and we ask
7880000	7882000	a question of our communities
7882000	7884000	and tonight we wanted to know you know we were talking about creation
7884000	7886000	tonight we knew that was going to be a theme
7886000	7888000	of the show tonight so we asked our audience
7888000	7890000	what's something you've created
7890000	7892000	in the video game world did you program a small
7892000	7894000	game or work on a large one maybe you made
7894000	7896000	levels for a game of yours what did you
7896000	7898000	create we also kind of put in there if you really
7898000	7900000	really really haven't made anything
7900000	7902000	a. we hope you start
7902000	7904000	b. what do you hope to create someday
7904000	7906000	so a couple
7906000	7908000	different questions there depending on your situation
7908000	7910000	act deaf starts us off on Google Plus
7910000	7912000	saying the closest I've been to video game
7912000	7914000	programming has been translation
7914000	7916000	I haven't been directly involved in it but I
7916000	7918000	helped some friends with translations and editing
7918000	7920000	hey you know what important
7920000	7922000	very important I wouldn't have got to play
7922000	7924000	Final Fantasy 5 when I did if it hadn't been
7924000	7926000	for some people translating the original
7926000	7928000	Super Nintendo ROM
7928000	7930000	translation didn't end up perfect but at least it got me
7930000	7932000	through the game so translation important
7932000	7934000	role makes the game more accessible to people
7934000	7936000	Redertainment in chat
7936000	7938000	saying there's a book I put out a couple years
7938000	7940000	ago that no one read called volume 11
7940000	7942000	when I originally dreamed it up it was supposed to be
7942000	7944000	a stealth action game complete with long sections
7944000	7946000	spent sneaking around and trying to avoid groups
7946000	7948000	of people looking to kill you and all of
7948000	7950000	your people since I have no visual
7950000	7952000	artistic skill and coding is hard
7952000	7954000	volume 11 became a
7954000	7956000	book so interesting you had like a game
7956000	7958000	idea that ultimately you poured into a book
7958000	7960000	very interesting
7960000	7962000	let's check out some of the answers over on
7962000	7964000	Facebook Raginator says back in my elementary
7964000	7966000	school days I modded
7966000	7968000	an edutainment typing game
7968000	7970000	originally called turtle trot
7970000	7972000	during the down time at the end of
7972000	7974000	computer class I made it a very
7974000	7976000	obscene pervy renaming it turtle
7976000	7978000	twat and the game talked dirty to
7978000	7980000	you and made poop and fart
7980000	7982000	jokes you alright over there dark sara
7982000	7984000	unexpected turtle
7984000	7986000	unexpected twat oh what
7986000	7988000	Raginator making a game out of poop and
7988000	7990000	fart jokes is unexpected I beg
7990000	7992000	to differ
7992000	7994000	no I mean just I was
7994000	7996000	the word twat to me
7996000	7998000	is intensely hilarious
7998000	8000000	and whenever I hear it
8000000	8002000	I just
8002000	8004000	twat are you talking about I can't hear you
8004000	8006000	I thought you live on twat avenue
8006000	8008000	that was the old one sorry
8008000	8010000	anyway one thing I
8010000	8012000	wish to make is a new OLR dream
8012000	8014000	game a moral combat clone or parody
8014000	8016000	featuring wilford brimley the golden
8016000	8018000	girls matt lock angela
8018000	8020000	landsbury etcetera
8020000	8022000	which I entitled in the chat room earlier
8022000	8024000	as smash tv land
8024000	8026000	love it or golden gladiators
8026000	8028000	golden gladiators love it
8028000	8030000	monty boggs says in banjo
8030000	8032000	kazooie nuts and bolts there was a mission
8032000	8034000	to defend a statue from enemy planes for a
8034000	8036000	set time instead of building
8036000	8038000	a combative plane as most would I
8038000	8040000	created a giant cone cover with
8040000	8042000	propellers to simply cover the statue
8042000	8044000	and absorb all the damage that
8044000	8046000	game was fantastic at rewarding
8046000	8048000	creativity so kind of
8048000	8050000	talking about a game there that has
8050000	8052000	you create as part of the game
8052000	8054000	mechanics
8054000	8056000	febreeze mentions on facebook
8056000	8058000	I programmed a version of the tron light
8058000	8060000	cycle game for a school project
8060000	8062000	I really want to pick up programming again but don't know
8062000	8064000	what to choose there's so many programming
8064000	8066000	languages I have no idea where to start or
8066000	8068000	which is the most useful well I hope you got something
8068000	8070000	out of tonight's show I do have
8070000	8072000	a dream game I want to make a pure
8072000	8074000	sega arcade racer like daytona
8074000	8076000	sega rally and
8076000	8078000	those awesome games well surely
8078000	8080000	he knows about that kickstarter from a few
8080000	8082000	months ago right yes exactly
8082000	8084000	that looks pretty awesome and
8084000	8086000	er says I did some flash games in high school as
8086000	8088000	part of my web design class pretty much
8088000	8090000	all were clones of existing games for
8090000	8092000	example one was a mario clone where
8092000	8094000	you played as link nintendo ripped me
8094000	8096000	off for nes remix now
8096000	8098000	I know he said that comment very tongue in cheek
8098000	8100000	but it made me think of when people used to hack roms
8100000	8102000	like people put
8102000	8104000	zelda in mario because they would hack the
8104000	8106000	rom and put the little
8106000	8108000	picture of link in there although
8108000	8110000	I realize it's a questionable
8110000	8112000	legality territory the reality
8112000	8114000	is people have done it and some people got
8114000	8116000	their start doing it and of course
8116000	8118000	you know somebody made like super penis
8118000	8120000	brothers where they were all naked yep
8120000	8122000	they did we played all of those roms
8122000	8124000	to see who they were and and they're all
8124000	8126000	garbage and
8126000	8128000	uh
8128000	8130000	dark tetsuya says I've been writing games off
8130000	8132000	and on ever since I learned basic on the apple
8132000	8134000	2 series back in the day wrote some simple
8134000	8136000	dragons lair esque text adventures
8136000	8138000	uh twine sounds
8138000	8140000	right up your alley dark tetsuya because that's uh
8140000	8142000	what that does text adventures uh lately
8142000	8144000	I've been tinkering with programs like the games
8144000	8146000	factory writing some simple arcade
8146000	8148000	style games and other game makers the
8148000	8150000	most recent of which is called construct 2
8150000	8152000	the first paid edition is pretty
8152000	8154000	pricey but the free one does plenty
8154000	8156000	if you're just getting your feet wet
8156000	8158000	and lastly steven d on
8158000	8160000	facebook says I was 8 in
8160000	8162000	1984 and my friend's father made
8162000	8164000	us a little stand up arcade cabinet with a back
8164000	8166000	board to be used for the screen we
8166000	8168000	drilled pathways in the back board and would
8168000	8170000	take leds on hangers
8170000	8172000	and move them around like spaceships
8172000	8174000	can't remember what we did for the controller but
8174000	8176000	it was awesome
8176000	8178000	so there you go a lot of uh cool little
8178000	8180000	answers very diverse the way people have been
8180000	8182000	making their games uh on
8182000	8184000	facebook and google plus
8184000	8186000	uh hopefully lots more people gonna
8186000	8188000	participate in our game jam
8188000	8190000	the vog game jam all the details
8190000	8192000	next week and you know I realized
8192000	8194000	something by the way I as much
8194000	8196000	as I would love to give a tangible prize
8196000	8198000	to everybody that participates I have to
8198000	8200000	pay shipping on everything out of my own pocket
8200000	8202000	so it probably it probably will be limited
8202000	8204000	to like 10 something
8204000	8206000	and we can take any leftovers
8206000	8208000	that we have still we'll take with us to
8208000	8210000	gx next year I have lots of steam codes left
8210000	8212000	over so there's always digital stuff
8212000	8214000	that's true there is a lot of digital stuff
8214000	8216000	so we'll try to put it all together this week
8216000	8218000	honestly talk of this idea
8218000	8220000	started on thursday
8220000	8222000	and I loved it so much I was like we
8222000	8224000	need to make it happen and bobby put a good
8224000	8226000	idea out there he said well people
8226000	8228000	should probably have the holidays to work on their
8228000	8230000	projects cause a lot of people have downtime
8230000	8232000	from work I was like oh crap you're right
8232000	8234000	so we better make it happen fast so
8234000	8236000	we will anyway let's
8236000	8238000	get on to some more news tonight
8238000	8240000	we have a few more stories for you guys Loki
8240000	8242000	alright so as much as I like
8242000	8244000	the call of duty series the last few years it's been
8244000	8246000	kind of not doing as well as
8246000	8248000	it used to it used to be kind of record
8248000	8250000	setting each year where it would sell
8250000	8252000	out you know beyond
8252000	8254000	what you know the previous years edition
8254000	8256000	did and unfortunately that
8256000	8258000	kind of gone downhill since
8258000	8260000	I want to say black ops
8260000	8262000	2 which is sad
8262000	8264000	because black ops 2 is actually a really good title
8264000	8266000	but they're saying
8266000	8268000	basically advance warfare
8268000	8270000	is down
8270000	8272000	27% year over year
8272000	8274000	and that's
8274000	8276000	that's not good and that's
8276000	8278000	kind of sad cause I thought that was gonna be a
8278000	8280000	little bit more of an interesting
8280000	8282000	game but I guess people
8282000	8284000	just aren't getting the call of duty as much as
8284000	8286000	ever and honestly they're just
8286000	8288000	milking it too much maybe they need to
8288000	8290000	sleep it for a year maybe
8290000	8292000	I think it
8292000	8294000	they tried some different stuff with it but it
8294000	8296000	still did feel a little bit like black ops
8296000	8298000	2
8298000	8300000	I don't know it's
8300000	8302000	it's an interesting game it's just
8302000	8304000	and
8304000	8306000	maybe it's just not peeling maybe it's
8306000	8308000	not different enough year over year where people
8308000	8310000	are like yeah I don't really need to
8310000	8312000	get this one I
8312000	8314000	can understand that and honestly like
8314000	8316000	even like the new mechanics in the game it does
8316000	8318000	enhance some things but it's not
8318000	8320000	you know completely
8320000	8322000	different but I don't know
8322000	8324000	I mean you know like Madden
8324000	8326000	and stuff like that they enhance things and they don't really
8326000	8328000	change everything so
8328000	8330000	people still buy that
8330000	8332000	it did well it still was you know one of the
8332000	8334000	best selling games this year it's just
8334000	8336000	unfortunately not a lot of people
8336000	8338000	are buying it I think also still
8338000	8340000	we're kind of in that phase where maybe
8340000	8342000	people are picking it up right now because they're
8342000	8344000	gonna pick it up on another console later on once
8344000	8346000	they decide to you know bump up
8346000	8348000	to a current gen console
8348000	8350000	maybe that's the situation
8350000	8352000	or maybe they're skipping it this year because
8352000	8354000	they're saving up for that console or maybe
8354000	8356000	because there's too many fucking games that
8356000	8358000	come out you know in the month of November and
8358000	8360000	October I think it
8360000	8362000	could be a lot of those things or
8362000	8364000	you know there was this big shooter game that came
8364000	8366000	out that was kind of an MMO called Destiny
8366000	8368000	that did really well
8368000	8370000	so I think
8370000	8372000	a lot of those factors play into it but
8372000	8374000	I think if next year if it's
8374000	8376000	kind of still
8376000	8378000	on the down turn then maybe they have
8378000	8380000	milked all they can out of it
8380000	8382000	I don't think that they have
8382000	8384000	but maybe I'm sure
8384000	8386000	they'll try to figure it out maybe go back to
8386000	8388000	World War II again I don't know
8388000	8390000	do something different
8390000	8392000	maybe you should fucking buy the rights
8392000	8394000	of time splitters and put out a new time splitters
8394000	8396000	game because that's really what I would want to see
8396000	8398000	now you're fishing now you're fishing I know
8398000	8400000	well maybe people aren't playing the new Call of Duty
8400000	8402000	because they can't let go of the shooters they've
8402000	8404000	been playing for like seven years now
8404000	8406000	one of those big popular
8406000	8408000	shooter games is Team Fortress 2
8408000	8410000	it's also popular because
8410000	8412000	it's free and Team Fortress 2
8412000	8414000	is going to be getting a new
8414000	8416000	I guess update
8416000	8418000	I don't want to say expansion because they're calling it an update
8418000	8420000	but the update is called End of the Line
8420000	8422000	and I went oh does that mean this is
8422000	8424000	the last one and Team Fortress 3
8424000	8426000	imminent? Not really
8426000	8428000	can't count to three
8428000	8430000	even though End of the Line will have
8430000	8432000	21 cosmetic items
8432000	8434000	and it'll have a new taunt for the pyro
8434000	8436000	and a new multi-class melee weapon
8436000	8438000	and apparently a big
8438000	8440000	focus on ducks
8440000	8442000	like collectible ducks and duck tokens
8442000	8444000	and so forth okay this whole
8444000	8446000	thing is actually based on a community film
8446000	8448000	that's actually also called
8448000	8450000	End of the Line so they were
8450000	8452000	oh my god is it
8452000	8454000	oh that sounds awesome then because that film
8454000	8456000	was fucking rad so
8456000	8458000	yeah it's a fan film that runs
8458000	8460000	14 minutes on End of the Line
8460000	8462000	yes yes please more
8462000	8464000	of that that is pretty that is pretty rad
8464000	8466000	it is something that they are
8466000	8468000	building into the
8468000	8470000	official canon then of Team Fortress 2
8470000	8472000	so lots of folks looking forward
8472000	8474000	to that and bless Valve
8474000	8476000	for keeping this game going that
8476000	8478000	honestly you know with
8478000	8480000	some of those Team Fortress 2 videos
8480000	8482000	you're missing that VoG Team Fortress server
8482000	8484000	right about now aren't you no no no
8484000	8486000	I once again
8486000	8488000	too much stuff to play but I
8488000	8490000	honestly would love to see a
8490000	8492000	Team Fortress movie I think that would be awesome
8492000	8494000	because they have some really great characters
8494000	8496000	they have a lot of machinima they do but
8496000	8498000	I would love to see something that was like a few
8498000	8500000	hours long that was actually in theaters you know
8500000	8502000	Seattle in our chat room not a fan saying
8502000	8504000	End of the Line was such a disappointment
8504000	8506000	Tigerclaw in chat says
8506000	8508000	they should have partnered with Disney and done
8508000	8510000	End of Line as DLC to dress up your characters
8510000	8512000	as Tron characters that's what I said
8512000	8514000	when I first saw the story I was like
8514000	8516000	oh shit is Tron in Team Fortress oh
8516000	8518000	it's End of the Line
8518000	8520000	got it that's what everybody says
8520000	8522000	our guild in Final Fantasy is actually
8522000	8524000	called End of Line and it's because of Tron
8524000	8526000	but we get like people
8526000	8528000	send tells their ass all the time shouldn't it be
8528000	8530000	End of the Line
8530000	8532000	no in this case
8532000	8534000	it is End of Line because it is a quote
8534000	8536000	from a movie anyway
8536000	8538000	and also it was a legit
8538000	8540000	statement command
8540000	8542000	I know I know
8542000	8544000	anyhow Dark Soccer
8544000	8546000	you got some legit news for us
8546000	8548000	I do
8548000	8550000	actually you know
8550000	8552000	Valve had the big holiday
8552000	8554000	auction thing going on
8554000	8556000	they actually had to shut it down
8556000	8558000	and restart the holiday auction
8558000	8560000	because
8560000	8562000	there were some activity done
8562000	8564000	by a few people
8564000	8566000	where they were
8566000	8568000	basically just
8568000	8570000	let me
8570000	8572000	start over basically they figured out
8572000	8574000	there was a Reddit thread that said
8574000	8576000	that there were some weird
8576000	8578000	things going on basically that you could
8578000	8580000	use a duplication exploit
8580000	8582000	and people were exploiting it
8582000	8584000	and they were just getting tons
8584000	8586000	of freebies
8586000	8588000	you know by
8588000	8590000	actually even creating a second hand market
8590000	8592000	to sell gems for
8592000	8594000	money so
8594000	8596000	basically Valve just
8596000	8598000	rebooted it started it over
8598000	8600000	and have been doing
8600000	8602000	the cases
8602000	8604000	item by item so
8604000	8606000	they just started it over they're like
8606000	8608000	fuck you guys for doing this we're just starting it over
8610000	8612000	screw you guys I'm going home
8612000	8614000	well yeah
8614000	8616000	no but I mean
8616000	8618000	it sucks that people have to
8618000	8620000	I don't know anyway
8620000	8622000	if you've got a system that someone
8622000	8624000	I know that has a manipulation
8624000	8626000	in it I know
8626000	8628000	I know it just sucks it's the holidays
8628000	8630000	people
8630000	8632000	people are monsters I know
8632000	8634000	it sucks
8634000	8636000	alright so twitch kind
8636000	8638000	of going the route of esports
8638000	8640000	because they know that that's popular
8640000	8642000	and hell a lot of people
8642000	8644000	stream their esports stuff on
8644000	8646000	twitch so it makes sense
8646000	8648000	that they've acquired
8648000	8650000	Goodgame which I guess
8650000	8652000	they're saying it's a company that the world's
8652000	8654000	first full service agency dedicated
8654000	8656000	to esports and live video game
8656000	8658000	broadcasting communities
8658000	8660000	so is that like a recruiter
8660000	8662000	I don't know but basically
8662000	8664000	there is a good game has an amazing
8664000	8666000	reputation in the industry for its
8666000	8668000	expertise in both sponsors
8668000	8670000	sponsorship sales and talent
8670000	8672000	support their passion for helping
8672000	8674000	the content creators and pro players achieve
8674000	8676000	success has elevated the entire
8676000	8678000	industry in the minds of
8678000	8680000	brands worldwide so it's kind of
8680000	8682000	like a promoter you know
8682000	8684000	talent scout type thing it sounds like
8684000	8686000	I'm sure now
8686000	8688000	that you know
8688000	8690000	it would be a good angle for them to go I guess
8690000	8692000	because esports are pretty big
8692000	8694000	and they kind of have the
8694000	8696000	grasp of you know
8696000	8698000	streaming on their site so
8698000	8700000	I don't know
8700000	8702000	advertisers
8702000	8704000	interesting
8704000	8706000	apparently
8706000	8708000	I didn't see how much so they purchased them for
8708000	8710000	but
8710000	8712000	it'll be interesting to see how they take
8712000	8714000	that if they're going to try to maybe make
8714000	8716000	esports more like
8716000	8718000	well mainstream
8718000	8720000	it's interesting to see twitch acquiring companies
8720000	8722000	when they themselves were just acquired by Amazon
8722000	8724000	I mean I realize that you know it's still
8724000	8726000	in a lot of ways business as usual
8726000	8728000	but it's just interesting that all those chess pieces
8728000	8730000	are moving the way they are well now that they have
8730000	8732000	an extra almost billion dollars to do
8732000	8734000	that with they could probably spend
8734000	8736000	some of that you know on this
8736000	8738000	kind of thing we're for sale by the way no I'm kidding
8738000	8740000	I'm kidding alright moving on
8740000	8742000	talking about games
8742000	8744000	for windows yeah no really
8744000	8746000	I'm going to talk about games for windows or at least
8746000	8748000	what the hell is Microsoft's future
8748000	8750000	in gaming on the PC
8750000	8752000	because we don't really know a whole lot
8752000	8754000	about what that has in store
8754000	8756000	you know we talk about things like valve and
8756000	8758000	all these other store in fronts you know Microsoft
8758000	8760000	wants a piece of that and they've tried before
8760000	8762000	and surely they're going to come back
8762000	8764000	at some point and what's interesting
8764000	8766000	is there's been a
8766000	8768000	tweet that Phil Spencer
8768000	8770000	actually responded to
8770000	8772000	the tweet asked Phil Spencer
8772000	8774000	Phil can we expect some UI
8774000	8776000	footage of windows 10 on
8776000	8778000	xbox one in January
8778000	8780000	and Phil responded to it saying
8780000	8782000	I'll be focusing more on what we are
8782000	8784000	doing on windows 10 in January
8784000	8786000	it's time for us to talk
8786000	8788000	about gaming on windows
8788000	8790000	hmm so
8790000	8792000	what are they going to do with windows 10
8792000	8794000	a new store that's so exciting
8794000	8796000	I can't wait to
8796000	8798000	see what windows 10 brings
8798000	8800000	nope sorry I don't care
8800000	8802000	I honestly I'm just like
8802000	8804000	you know they've it seems like Microsoft likes
8804000	8806000	to try to do things that other people
8806000	8808000	do and don't get
8808000	8810000	me wrong they do a great job
8810000	8812000	on their gaming platform but as far as
8812000	8814000	like some of the other platforms
8814000	8816000	that they try like PC is a
8816000	8818000	art phones and tablets
8818000	8820000	and you know
8820000	8822000	mp3 players haven't
8822000	8824000	exactly been stellar and
8824000	8826000	like I'd say their PC storefront
8826000	8828000	is not
8828000	8830000	excellent but I would
8830000	8832000	assume that whatever this is going to be is
8832000	8834000	going to tie together xbox one
8834000	8836000	as well as
8836000	8838000	you know windows phone
8838000	8840000	as well as the PC
8840000	8842000	I know the idea
8842000	8844000	is that they want you know
8844000	8846000	those cross platform applications
8846000	8848000	to where okay say I get
8848000	8850000	you know
8850000	8852000	say I buy a game or something
8852000	8854000	on my PC
8854000	8856000	well it runs on my PC it now runs
8856000	8858000	on my xbox one and it runs on my phone
8858000	8860000	is the perfect world scenario
8860000	8862000	of that but I just
8862000	8864000	I don't know I just don't think
8864000	8866000	anyone's really really care
8866000	8868000	what exclusive apps could you possibly
8868000	8870000	have that would
8870000	8872000	that anyone really
8872000	8874000	really care if they ran across all those platforms
8874000	8876000	minecraft
8876000	8878000	yeah but minecraft already is on those other
8878000	8880000	platforms minecraft 2
8880000	8882000	cool I guess
8882000	8884000	I'm waiting to see that
8884000	8886000	that seems to be
8886000	8888000	that's going to be the key piece I'm very curious
8888000	8890000	to see if that's that's what they pull out
8890000	8892000	and put out on the table that's
8892000	8894000	their only card I mean then that's
8894000	8896000	I mean cool that well it's an expensive
8896000	8898000	card exactly their ace of spades
8898000	8900000	and more power
8900000	8902000	to them if that helps drive their
8902000	8904000	platform but you can't
8904000	8906000	just run a platform
8906000	8908000	it's just like me okay I have origin
8908000	8910000	installed in my system because I wanted to play
8910000	8912000	titanfall I played the
8912000	8914000	titanfall demo I didn't uninstall it but doesn't
8914000	8916000	mean I'm shopping for games on origin

8920000	8922000	their store if this is the only way I can
8922000	8924000	buy the game is through their storefront then sure I'll
8924000	8926000	buy it through their storefront doesn't mean I'm going to use their
8926000	8928000	storefront to buy more games
8928000	8930000	I just I don't know what they're
8930000	8932000	trying to do with it whatever let's see
8932000	8934000	I really want to see what windows 10
8934000	8936000	does to enhance the experience of the
8936000	8938000	xbox one that's what I'm curious to see
8938000	8940000	that and directx 12
8940000	8942000	or whatever it is that they're on now
8942000	8944000	I'm curious to see how
8944000	8946000	because that's actually supposed to do a little bit more
8946000	8948000	but we'll see I mean
8948000	8950000	don't fuck it
8950000	8952000	up
8952000	8954000	good advice good advice
8954000	8956000	some comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
8956000	8958000	bonds 006
8958000	8960000	says they killed game for windows
8960000	8962000	and I won't go back
8962000	8964000	rama is saying that windows 10 is pretty fucking sweet
8964000	8966000	I haven't
8966000	8968000	I guess they do have the whole like preview build
8968000	8970000	or whatever but I haven't really checked it out
8970000	8972000	I feel like when it comes to OS's
8972000	8974000	I don't want to screw around with something that's not
8974000	8976000	like finished
8976000	8978000	if I had an extra computer
8978000	8980000	maybe but I don't really have that luxury
8980000	8982000	alright
8982000	8984000	let us get to the
8984000	8986000	mailbag every week you guys send us
8986000	8988000	emails
8988000	8990000	participate at orange lounge radio
8990000	8992000	.com and usually
8992000	8994000	dark soccer will dive in head first and read the
8994000	8996000	emails but I believe I'm doing it tonight right
8996000	8998000	yes because dark soccer
8998000	9000000	is still got a little bit of the voice we don't want her
9000000	9002000	to use it too much
9002000	9004000	she has to use her
9004000	9006000	she needs her voice
9006000	9008000	for complaining
9008000	9010000	not to read emails tonight
9010000	9012000	alright
9012000	9014000	I'm going to read some emails here instead
9014000	9016000	so let's get to it
9016000	9018000	I'm going to go ahead and stop the music now
9018000	9020000	because I got to multitask here
9020000	9022000	so let's go to AZHP first off tonight
9022000	9024000	saying just wanted to submit a small
9024000	9026000	correction from last week's podcast
9026000	9028000	where Rob stated that instead of Marvel
9028000	9030000	or Star Wars being included or considered
9030000	9032000	for Kingdom Hearts 3 that it would only
9032000	9034000	be frozen that would be added to the game
9034000	9036000	I pulled a quote from the source interview
9036000	9038000	which will clarify the vague quote Rob
9038000	9040000	quoted last week well how dare you try
9040000	9042000	to correct me on something how dare you insinuate
9042000	9044000	that I thought that was a joke not necessarily
9044000	9046000	well let's get
9046000	9048000	to the quote that AZHP
9048000	9050000	emails us here saying and by the way I'm kidding
9050000	9052000	AZHP says when I asked whether
9052000	9054000	I could safely infer that Star Wars
9054000	9056000	and Marvel are not off limits
9056000	9058000	Yase confirmed
9058000	9060000	that they are being considered well
9060000	9062000	yeah they're all under consideration he
9062000	9064000	said nothing's off limits we're considering
9064000	9066000	all of the worlds there are so many
9066000	9068000	wonderful concepts we're happy about
9068000	9070000	that but at the same time it's really tough
9070000	9072000	to choose the
9072000	9074000	email goes on from AZHP
9074000	9076000	while I would honestly prefer if Star Wars and Marvel
9076000	9078000	were in Kingdom Hearts 3 myself
9078000	9080000	since I would prefer more cartoony characters
9080000	9082000	in the game I wanted to let you guys know that it
9082000	9084000	actually is what they're considering
9084000	9086000	that sounded like
9086000	9088000	though honestly thank you for the clarification
9088000	9090000	but that did sound like a lot of a non-answer
9090000	9092000	answer he just said
9092000	9094000	oh yeah you know we're considering everything
9094000	9096000	but it's so hard to choose and
9096000	9098000	I'm not telling you shit
9098000	9100000	I still stand by
9100000	9102000	what I said last week though that Frozen's
9102000	9104000	got a better chance of either of these things
9104000	9106000	on showing up in the game
9106000	9108000	real world stuff doesn't always tend to show up
9108000	9110000	in Kingdom Hearts I do realize Pirates of the
9110000	9112000	Caribbean made an appearance
9112000	9114000	that was a pretty rare exception and that's still
9114000	9116000	a very very very very
9116000	9118000	Disney grown thing at heart
9118000	9120000	I just
9120000	9122000	you know when we talked about this
9122000	9124000	story last week we were coming off all this other
9124000	9126000	Frozen mania and I just
9126000	9128000	I just see it happening
9128000	9130000	for Kingdom Hearts 3
9130000	9132000	that doesn't mean the other stuff can't happen
9132000	9134000	but I just don't get your
9134000	9136000	hopes up people don't get your hopes up Star Wars
9136000	9138000	has their own line of video games as does
9138000	9140000	Marvel I think in some ways
9140000	9142000	it would be really weird if they showed up in
9142000	9144000	Kingdom Hearts I wouldn't hate it I'd actually
9144000	9146000	kind of like it but it does make
9146000	9148000	sense to instead
9148000	9150000	showcase these other properties that may
9150000	9152000	never show up otherwise I don't know
9152000	9154000	regardless it was a huge
9154000	9156000	non-answer answer in my opinion and
9156000	9158000	we just we don't know we're going to continue
9158000	9160000	to speculate and fan wank
9160000	9162000	all the way until we see some
9162000	9164000	more concrete information I would assume
9164000	9166000	at the next E3 maybe
9166000	9168000	actually it'll probably be two years from now because next E3
9168000	9170000	will be all about Final Fantasy 15
9170000	9172000	maybe in 2016 we can finally
9172000	9174000	fucking talk about Kingdom Hearts
9174000	9176000	yyr emails us
9176000	9178000	saying I found the discussion on
9178000	9180000	quote games that define last generation
9180000	9182000	from last week's show to be really interesting
9182000	9184000	partially because I'm not quite certain that one can
9184000	9186000	define last generation with a list of games at all
9186000	9188000	how do we define define
9188000	9190000	anyway I would take it to mean something like
9190000	9192000	this games that have the look and feel
9192000	9194000	made possible by that generation
9194000	9196000	and that influenced many games to
9196000	9198000	come both as part of that
9198000	9200000	generation and for generations afterwards
9200000	9202000	it's easy to put games like Super Mario
9202000	9204000	Brothers Sonic the Hedgehog and Final Fantasy
9204000	9206000	7 on lists such as this but the
9206000	9208000	sheer length of time between last generation and this
9208000	9210000	one along with a massive number of and diversity
9210000	9212000	of titles released makes this almost
9212000	9214000	impossible gaming has transformed since
9214000	9216000	the release of the 360, PS3 and Wii
9216000	9218000	some things that define the generation
9218000	9220000	for me include the Gears of War trilogy
9220000	9222000	the introduction of achievements
9222000	9224000	the first Dead Rising, the indie games channel
9224000	9226000	and the availability of online fighting games
9226000	9228000	these are all revolutionary in their own way
9228000	9230000	but for many people none of these things will have
9230000	9232000	even been on their radar which leads
9232000	9234000	me to my point there is just too much
9234000	9236000	about this generation to fit on a short list
9236000	9238000	for example I personally
9238000	9240000	wouldn't define it with such events as the rise
9240000	9242000	of motion gaming or the popularity
9242000	9244000	of the American music game because outside
9244000	9246000	of the genre faithful
9246000	9248000	both of these turned out to be fads and are no
9248000	9250000	longer popular at all but
9250000	9252000	both definitely belong on a bullet list
9252000	9254000	of things that defined it for many people
9254000	9256000	it's just that this will wind up becoming a very very
9256000	9258000	very long list don't forget that
9258000	9260000	the very same hardware that ran the brand new
9260000	9262000	Grand Theft Auto 5 also ran the brand new
9262000	9264000	Ridge Racer 6 with an 8 year
9264000	9266000	gap in between I guess what I'm trying to say
9266000	9268000	is this I would not want to attempt taking
9268000	9270000	on this task because I believe it would be nearly
9270000	9272000	impossible let me stop
9272000	9274000	there because the rest of the email gets into something else
9274000	9276000	it is a huge task
9276000	9278000	but so is trying to name the game of the
9278000	9280000	year yet people seem to do it
9280000	9282000	anyway and I think it's really too hard sometimes
9282000	9284000	to name just one game of the year
9284000	9286000	and that's going to change from person to person
9286000	9288000	just depending on your experiences
9288000	9290000	and you know what you like and that's
9290000	9292000	why diversity is great because everybody
9292000	9294000	brings different things to the table
9294000	9296000	I do want to clarify though I don't know if
9296000	9298000	the rise of motion gaming was a reference to
9298000	9300000	Wii Sports but I just want to clarify
9300000	9302000	I put Wii Sports on
9302000	9304000	not just because of the motion gaming
9304000	9306000	but because the accessibility is a huge thing
9306000	9308000	and more people that started playing
9308000	9310000	games as a result
9310000	9312000	but I would agree with the fact that it is very
9312000	9314000	hard
9314000	9316000	to define the one game
9316000	9318000	that changed the generation that is a very hard thing
9318000	9320000	to do but I could try to pick
9320000	9322000	the one that I think
9322000	9324000	is a huge opinion I think
9324000	9326000	did it the most out of all of them
9326000	9328000	and that's why I picked Wii Sports and I think Wii Sports
9328000	9330000	out of all of them did it the most
9330000	9332000	but certainly is not the only game
9332000	9334000	that would define a generation which you're right
9334000	9336000	is kind of a vague concept to begin with
9336000	9338000	but then again so is game of the year
9338000	9340000	does that mean the best game the most fun
9340000	9342000	game the prettiest game
9342000	9344000	who knows
9344000	9346000	anyway the rest of the email here from
9346000	9348000	YYR also thank you for the information
9348000	9350000	on the upcoming Wii U CD-ROM attachment
9350000	9352000	but the latest news suggests that while it is capable
9352000	9354000	of playing CD-ROM discs it will not
9354000	9356000	actually allow users of the Wii U to play
9356000	9358000	music CDs oh well
9358000	9360000	finally thank you for suggesting a subtitle for
9360000	9362000	Pixel Shits 2 projectile explosive
9362000	9364000	diarrhea however I heard
9364000	9366000	the PED is illegal for most athletes
9366000	9368000	some game developers and
9368000	9370000	a few podcasters
9370000	9372000	anyone else play Acrophobia back in the day?
9372000	9374000	Aaron YYR
9374000	9376000	uh yes yes
9376000	9378000	really I played
9378000	9380000	Acrophobia back in the day I sure did
9380000	9382000	that was a fun game that's why
9382000	9384000	I think that's why I do have
9384000	9386000	such a soft spot for like when we had the
9386000	9388000	uh guys from Jackbox Games on a couple weeks ago
9388000	9390000	cause a lot of the old Berkeley stuff
9390000	9392000	like that's where most of them ended up
9392000	9394000	so uh that's why I probably have a
9394000	9396000	soft spot cause I loved the old
9396000	9398000	uh Berkeley games
9398000	9400000	alright lastly but not leastly
9400000	9402000	actdeft emails us hello
9402000	9404000	from your friendly neighborhood Mexican actdeft
9404000	9406000	you know how amiibos have been actually
9406000	9408000	quite popular running out in places and even
9408000	9410000	selling for more than their worth but so
9410000	9412000	far the only game that has given them some use is
9412000	9414000	Smash Brothers granted they're still new
9414000	9416000	and all but I hope that Nintendo does more with
9416000	9418000	them in the future and try to give them more than
9418000	9420000	an quote use an amiibo
9420000	9422000	in game to unlock items thing that they have
9422000	9424000	going right now in fact I do have
9424000	9426000	an idea I think it's a really great one
9426000	9428000	since Animal Crossing Wii U is apparently
9428000	9430000	coming either next year or in 2016
9430000	9432000	it will probably have amiibo support
9432000	9434000	but instead of just giving you items in game to decorate
9434000	9436000	your house how about they make the amiibo unlock
9436000	9438000	a neighbor of that same character
9438000	9440000	like you place the Kirby amiibo on the game pad
9440000	9442000	and the game will give you Kirby as a
9442000	9444000	neighbor for your town wouldn't it be fantastic
9444000	9446000	having your regular neighbors and special
9446000	9448000	neighbors maybe have the amiibos
9448000	9450000	live in an apartment complex or something like that
9450000	9452000	oh see I like that idea it would be like
9452000	9454000	um Tomodachi life or something
9454000	9456000	where they all live in a building
9456000	9458000	I posted this idea on other sites like Reddit
9458000	9460000	and got a somewhat mixed reception
9460000	9462000	as you will get on Reddit
9462000	9464000	but I wanted to know what you guys in the chatters
9464000	9466000	and other emails or callers think of this idea
9466000	9468000	anyways thanks for reading hope you're having a great Sunday
9468000	9470000	and he does end with a PS
9470000	9472000	I have a code for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade
9472000	9474000	Edition on Steam and since I got the Lego
9474000	9476000	movie code for PS Vita a few weeks back
9476000	9478000	I thought I should pay it forward
9478000	9480000	or back I don't know either any of you
9480000	9482000	can keep it or give it away in chat
9482000	9484000	enjoy well thank you for that
9484000	9486000	steam code I'm going to put that
9486000	9488000	over in the prize pool for the vog jams
9488000	9490000	there you go that's the first thing going in the prize pool
9490000	9492000	steam code for Super Street Fighter 4
9492000	9494000	Arcade Edition on Steam we'll just put that in the prize pool
9494000	9496000	for people to participate
9496000	9498000	um as far as the part
9498000	9500000	about amiibos your idea is cool
9500000	9502000	um
9502000	9504000	I do realize Nintendo had
9504000	9506000	to kind of back the car in so to speak
9506000	9508000	with amiibos as far as
9508000	9510000	you know what they did with Hyrule Warriors
9510000	9512000	what they did with Mario Kart and so forth
9512000	9514000	so I don't judge them too
9514000	9516000	harshly on
9516000	9518000	what they did there
9518000	9520000	however I think the really telling
9520000	9522000	thing is going to be what do they do in
9522000	9524000	next year's games
9524000	9526000	the one to really keep an eye on in my
9526000	9528000	opinion I want to know how those
9528000	9530000	amiibo will work in
9530000	9532000	Splatoon I think
9532000	9534000	however amiibos function
9534000	9536000	is in Splatoon is going to be very
9536000	9538000	telling for the future of amiibo
9538000	9540000	is that what it's going to be hats
9542000	9544000	is it just going to be have amiibo unlock
9544000	9546000	crap or would there possibly be
9546000	9548000	that you could play some of those characters in Splatoon
9548000	9550000	or that you would level
9550000	9552000	up maybe you have the hat but you're kind of
9552000	9554000	doing like a level up thing that's the one thing I like
9554000	9556000	about the amiibo is that you're leveling it up
9556000	9558000	but it's like if I level it up in Smash
9558000	9560000	then what? I think that they're doing too much
9560000	9562000	I mean I don't have a problem with
9562000	9564000	them doing like the unlock crap stuff
9564000	9566000	because honestly it's unreasonable to
9566000	9568000	expect them to incorporate every single amiibo
9568000	9570000	that they're ever going to create into
9570000	9572000	all of these games like I shouldn't be able to play
9572000	9574000	Mario in like
9574000	9576000	Hyrule Warriors although
9576000	9578000	I would totally love
9578000	9580000	to see a kingdom was it
9580000	9582000	a mushroom kingdom warriors or something like that
9582000	9584000	would be fucking amazing but
9584000	9586000	I understand that it's unreasonable
9586000	9588000	for me to expect them to have
9588000	9590000	all these characters playable in every single
9590000	9592000	I mean Wii Fit Trainer it doesn't make any sense
9592000	9594000	I have a good idea here's my idea I'm going to pitch out there
9594000	9596000	Mario Maker is coming out soon
9596000	9598000	right? What if
9598000	9600000	in Mario Maker there's certain
9600000	9602000	new things not existing things
9602000	9604000	new things that you can use
9604000	9606000	if you have an amiibo
9606000	9608000	that you've leveled up to a certain
9608000	9610000	point in some other game
9610000	9612000	so for example like
9612000	9614000	maybe I get a Kirby picture
9614000	9616000	that I can have in a stage somewhere
9616000	9618000	or Kirby music oh even better
9618000	9620000	I get Kirby music and if I have the amiibo
9620000	9622000	I can use one song in a stage
9622000	9624000	yes I know I'm talking Kirby music in Mario
9624000	9626000	but roll with me here but maybe if I've
9626000	9628000	leveled my Kirby fighter to level
9628000	9630000	30 in Smash Brothers then I have a
9630000	9632000	second song I can use or maybe it just skins
9632000	9634000	everything to Kirby yeah
9634000	9636000	or maybe changes the colors to Kirby colors
9636000	9638000	or like you can have
9638000	9640000	like you know for Yoshi it changes everything
9640000	9642000	Yoshi Island style or something
9642000	9644000	but I love the idea of I would have to
9644000	9646000	and this would be really smart for Nintendo to do
9646000	9648000	you have to do something in this game over here to make it happen
9648000	9650000	over here but maybe not necessarily restricted
9650000	9652000	to just one game I kind of think
9652000	9654000	the amiibo should level up as a
9654000	9656000	whole so that way like
9656000	9658000	okay I level it in Smash Brothers
9658000	9660000	but then if I want to push it even further
9660000	9662000	and even though it might not do anything in Smash Brothers
9662000	9664000	my like amiibo level I would
9664000	9666000	use it Mario Kart and then I would use it Mario Maker
9666000	9668000	it'd be cool if like they'd have different
9668000	9670000	stats or something like you could up you know
9670000	9672000	if I play them in Smash Brothers become stronger
9672000	9674000	and you know they
9674000	9676000	gain fighting skills or something like that where if I
9676000	9678000	play them in Mario Kart
9678000	9680000	they gain driving skills or something
9680000	9682000	doesn't necessarily mean if I have a level
9682000	9684000	50 amiibo in Smash Brothers that's
9684000	9686000	good at driving or something I don't know
9686000	9688000	it's an easy thing to balance but
9688000	9690000	you know Nintendo has
9690000	9692000	gone down this path and I think there's a lot of really
9692000	9694000	awesome shit that they could do with this
9694000	9696000	but I just worry is Nintendo
9696000	9698000	going to be too stubborn to do it as
9698000	9700000	they often are I don't know
9700000	9702000	and maybe amiibos are too popular for their own
9702000	9704000	good I don't know
9704000	9706000	Tigerclaw in chat says they're probably
9706000	9708000	going to make amiibos specific to Splatoon no
9708000	9710000	doubt well with
9710000	9712000	as much as those things are selling
9712000	9714000	why not make more more more more
9714000	9716000	alright that's it for the mailbag if you want to participate
9716000	9718000	with the mailbag in a future week participate
9718000	9720000	at orangelaungeradio.com
9720000	9722000	let's get into the FUs
9722000	9724000	of the week
9740000	9742000	it might sound a little bit odd
9742000	9744000	there's a lot
9744000	9746000	of positive posts going on
9746000	9748000	about people
9748000	9750000	you know how people will do
9750000	9752000	romance mods for games
9752000	9754000	oh well I want to be able to romance
9754000	9756000	this person even though they're straight
9756000	9758000	or I want to romance this person even though
9758000	9760000	they're gay and there's a bunch of people
9760000	9762000	going around saying well you can't
9762000	9764000	change a person's sexuality don't
9764000	9766000	do it for the game
9766000	9768000	don't take but
9768000	9770000	then these are the same people who are also
9770000	9772000	shipping characters
9772000	9774000	in TV shows that are
9774000	9776000	canonically of a different
9776000	9778000	sexuality if it's
9778000	9780000	wrong to do it in one genre it's
9780000	9782000	wrong to do it in another genre
9782000	9784000	and it doesn't just apply
9784000	9786000	to wanting to make
9786000	9788000	homosexual characters straight it also
9788000	9790000	applies the other way around it applies to
9790000	9792000	wanting to make asexual characters
9792000	9794000	have attraction to
9794000	9796000	bits or something
9796000	9798000	respect the
9798000	9800000	way the author or the
9800000	9802000	creator of the universe has said it
9804000	9806000	they're not in control of it no more
9806000	9808000	than real people are in control of it
9808000	9810000	if you are going to write your
9810000	9812000	fiction I have no problem with you exploring
9812000	9814000	themes but accept that
9814000	9816000	it is not actually the way
9816000	9818000	that it was intended
9818000	9820000	and that you are creating an alternate universe
9820000	9822000	the end okay so I was just gonna say
9822000	9824000	devil's advocate like if somebody
9824000	9826000	is making fantasy
9826000	9828000	and that's fantasy then that's fine as long
9828000	9830000	as they acknowledge it as fantasy
9830000	9832000	there are people who say this is
9832000	9834000	like they'll try to insert
9834000	9836000	canon it's not
9836000	9838000	canon but don't push your fantasy
9838000	9840000	on everybody else exactly
9840000	9842000	and there are people out there saying oh well
9842000	9844000	it's just another canon no no no
9844000	9846000	it's an alternate reality
9846000	9848000	canon refer canon means the author
9848000	9850000	wrote it the word canon
9850000	9852000	relate originated with
9852000	9854000	religious canon in
9854000	9856000	a religious doctrine in this
9856000	9858000	case canon refers to something that is the
9858000	9860000	way that the author created you can
9860000	9862000	have a head canon which is
9862000	9864000	your addition to things that
9864000	9866000	happen in the canon that might
9866000	9868000	be plausible
9868000	9870000	in the canon but when you go
9870000	9872000	and you change something that
9872000	9874000	is completely outside canon
9874000	9876000	and
9876000	9878000	your little fantasy world does
9878000	9880000	not apply to how the author
9880000	9882000	created it and I'm writing a book now so I
9882000	9884000	start thinking about these things
9884000	9886000	and I was like I don't want people to take
9886000	9888000	this asexual character
9888000	9890000	that I'm writing and make
9890000	9892000	them you know completely interested in
9892000	9894000	this guy's dick no
9894000	9896000	dick's gross that's
9896000	9898000	how I'm writing her so
9898000	9900000	hey you know what else is not you know what else is not
9900000	9902000	canon the Star Wars
9902000	9904000	extended universe aww
9904000	9906000	too soon indeed
9906000	9908000	I approve of that one Rob
9908000	9910000	low key
9910000	9912000	um I guess
9912000	9914000	just the fact that I haven't had a lot
9914000	9916000	of time to work on the programming
9916000	9918000	stuff I literally get sometimes
9918000	9920000	at work just like 15 minutes
9920000	9922000	and it's just not enough time to even
9922000	9924000	sit down and open my laptop and
9924000	9926000	work on anything just
9926000	9928000	can't switch my
9928000	9930000	train of thought to something
9930000	9932000	different so it's kind of disappointing
9932000	9934000	you know that's all
9934000	9936000	uh my FU
9936000	9938000	goes to I have a
9938000	9940000	crazy week at work ahead I like
9940000	9942000	my job and all but oh my god FU
9942000	9944000	to the fact that I probably have to get up at 6 am tomorrow
9944000	9946000	not looking forward to that thanks
9946000	9948000	means I have to be in bed in less than an hour
9948000	9950000	that's not going to happen if I want 8 hours of sleep
9950000	9952000	that won't happen we all know that
9952000	9954000	alright uh
9954000	9956000	there it is the FUs of the week just a couple more stories
9956000	9958000	for you guys then we're going to quickly take some calls
9958000	9960000	but I warn you guys I'm not keeping the skype line
9960000	9962000	open very often if we don't get calls
9962000	9964000	we're wrapping up cause like I just said
9964000	9966000	I have to be at work I have to be up

9976000	9978000	quick stories here at the end though
9978000	9980000	so it's hard to believe that OC Remix has been around
9980000	9982000	for 15 years but that's
9982000	9984000	what they're celebrating is 15 years of
9984000	9986000	independent remixes
9986000	9988000	of video game music and that's pretty cool
9988000	9990000	in fact including with that
9990000	9992000	they have um
9992000	9994000	some new tracks
9994000	9996000	that they've been putting together 15 new
9996000	9998000	remixes uh that
9998000	10000000	from 15 different game consoles
10000000	10002000	and this is all in celebration
10002000	10004000	of you know
10004000	10006000	15 years and
10006000	10008000	man they've even had all these different
10008000	10010000	uh
10010000	10012000	albums that they put out I mean it's just
10012000	10014000	crazy I can't believe that they've
10014000	10016000	been around that long
10016000	10018000	yeah my gosh and sg100matt sums it up
10018000	10020000	perfectly in chat shit 15 years

10024000	10026000	congrats to them I mean
10026000	10028000	I look back on this show and I go god 12 years

10030000	10032000	OC Remix has us beat
10032000	10034000	OC Remix has us beat good job guys
10034000	10036000	uh lastly
10036000	10038000	but not leastly
10038000	10040000	prepare your wallet because uh
10040000	10042000	the steam holiday sale
10042000	10044000	oh it's coming
10044000	10046000	December 18th is the day
10046000	10048000	now this is now keep in mind Valve
10048000	10050000	hasn't announced this but this is
10050000	10052000	coming through some Japanese paypal
10052000	10054000	users apparently uh
10054000	10056000	some correspondence went out to them revealing
10056000	10058000	the launch of December 18th
10058000	10060000	uh a reddit user actually shared
10060000	10062000	the email that they received which
10062000	10064000	does mention that the sale will start on December
10064000	10066000	18th and run through January
10066000	10068000	2nd of course we do not
10068000	10070000	know what the uh thing will
10070000	10072000	entail but if it's if it's like
10072000	10074000	any previous steam sale you know it's gonna
10074000	10076000	be on sale everything
10076000	10078000	except maybe the new new
10078000	10080000	releases and the stuff that's still commanding
10080000	10082000	$60 call of duty will not be on sale
10082000	10084000	call of duty well you never know even call of duty
10084000	10086000	if it's not selling so well
10086000	10088000	maybe they'll even knock it down take a page from
10088000	10090000	Shadow of Mordor and I'm not even sure why Shadow
10090000	10092000	of Mordor is marked down so much but
10092000	10094000	shit that game was like
10094000	10096000	half off for like a long time
10096000	10098000	it just came out
10098000	10100000	I don't think it was selling that bad of course
10100000	10102000	uh Valve not commenting on these
10102000	10104000	rumors but uh of course but this is
10104000	10106000	how it's leaked out in the past so
10106000	10108000	it doesn't it makes perfect sense that's right
10108000	10110000	alright uh we're gonna open up the Skype line
10110000	10112000	right now here's your chance 1877

10114000	10116000	Skype is orange launch radio if you want to talk
10116000	10118000	about anything we've talked about so far on

10120000	10122000	meanwhile let me just check in real quick if we have any
10122000	10124000	last minute stories from Loki while we wait for a call
10124000	10126000	uh
10126000	10128000	they have a
10128000	10130000	cool hack that's going on for
10130000	10132000	uh remote play that you can get it to work on
10132000	10134000	an android phone
10134000	10136000	that's kind of neat I don't think that's
10136000	10138000	actually um yeah
10138000	10140000	it's uh an app that they have that
10140000	10142000	you can actually use a tablet device or
10142000	10144000	something to do remote play
10144000	10146000	on in case you don't have a Vita
10146000	10148000	alright we are gonna go to the phones
10148000	10150000	cause it's lighting up hi you're on orange launch radio
10150000	10152000	who's this uh hello this
10152000	10154000	this is Hitstun hey Hitstun how are you
10154000	10156000	we haven't heard from you in a long time what's up
10156000	10158000	yeah I'm doing alright I'm the man that used to do tech support
10158000	10160000	for the fastest internet in the chat
10160000	10162000	hahaha nice
10162000	10164000	alright um I'm really excited
10164000	10166000	you guys are doing like the vog jam
10166000	10168000	a game jam here that sounds great
10168000	10170000	me too so
10170000	10172000	officially count me in on that
10172000	10174000	yes that's awesome
10174000	10176000	I'm pretty hyped for that I'm hyped for it too
10176000	10178000	you know and it's scary uncharted
10178000	10180000	territory cause who knows people may
10180000	10182000	hate the theme but uh I think
10182000	10184000	you'll find a way to work with it even if you end up
10184000	10186000	hating the theme I think people will find a way to work
10186000	10188000	with it cause it doesn't mean that has to be
10188000	10190000	the central theme of your game you know or whatever
10190000	10192000	uh and it's scary I don't know if you can do worse
10192000	10194000	than the most recent Ludum Dare though
10194000	10196000	oh entire game on one screen
10196000	10198000	that's what they picked oh wow
10198000	10200000	uh like that you could do anything
10200000	10202000	with that but it's a little too wide you
10202000	10204000	know um when you guys are picking a theme
10204000	10206000	like I mean try to
10206000	10208000	try to give something that at least gives
10208000	10210000	us a little bit of direction about what the game
10210000	10212000	should be about or like a topic maybe
10212000	10214000	well I would think you know even if we did
10214000	10216000	something like Puzzle Sluts
10216000	10218000	like Puzzle Sluts maybe doesn't necessarily have
10218000	10220000	to be a puzzle game Puzzle Sluts
10220000	10222000	could be you know you're looking
10222000	10224000	for missing pieces of the puzzle
10224000	10226000	in a point and click adventure mystery game
10226000	10228000	you know what I mean like yeah and obviously I'm
10228000	10230000	making that up completely that's not
10230000	10232000	gonna be the theme but well that might be too
10232000	10234000	narrow but if you just do Sluts we might be
10234000	10236000	able to use more
10236000	10238000	we could do all kinds of games well
10238000	10240000	Puzzle Sluts, Fighting Sluts,
10240000	10242000	Action Sluts the ingredient is
10242000	10244000	Sluts!
10244000	10246000	Awesome!
10246000	10248000	So tune in next week to find out
10248000	10250000	that I'm really excited
10250000	10252000	about it and what's really exciting
10252000	10254000	is that we have a lot of people who have
10254000	10256000	experience jumping into
10256000	10258000	this like you know Bobby says
10258000	10260000	he'll do it you're gonna say you're gonna do it
10260000	10262000	YYR is gonna do it now even the
10262000	10264000	Cookie with Unity guys are saying
10264000	10266000	they're gonna they're gonna keep an eye on it and they might do it
10266000	10268000	too I know
10268000	10270000	right but remember this isn't about
10270000	10272000	quality and that's why I wanted to stress that because like
10272000	10274000	if somebody's like I don't
10274000	10276000	know how to like this
10276000	10278000	Unity stuff I don't have time it's too
10278000	10280000	scary like I appreciate it but you know what
10280000	10282000	I just want to make a slutty little big planet level
10282000	10284000	then cool
10284000	10286000	you know we want to do it
10286000	10288000	just don't get banned
10288000	10290000	So it'll be awesome to see what you guys come up with
10290000	10292000	Let's see
10292000	10294000	I don't really have to do Plug for the Instagib stream
10294000	10296000	because Raven's Dolphin did it for me last week
10296000	10298000	thanks dude
10298000	10300000	so instead I'm gonna Plug something else
10300000	10302000	there's a convention
10302000	10304000	coming up at the end of July
10304000	10306000	called Replay FX
10306000	10308000	I'll go ahead and
10308000	10310000	throw it in chat here but it's in Pittsburgh
10310000	10312000	and it's a gaming convention
10312000	10314000	and it's also attended by
10314000	10316000	PAPA, the Professional
10316000	10318000	and Amateur Pinball Association
10318000	10320000	also run out of Pittsburgh
10320000	10322000	and it's gonna have like 700 arcade machines
10322000	10324000	and I think, sorry
10324000	10326000	700 pinball
10326000	10328000	tables, 2000 arcade machines
10328000	10330000	and I'm kinda interested to see if there's
10330000	10332000	anyone else involved that's going to that
10332000	10334000	so we'll probably see without shakedown
10334000	10336000	maybe it'll be a forum topic or something
10336000	10338000	and we'll see
10338000	10340000	I don't know of a lot of listeners in the Pittsburgh area
10340000	10342000	at least I can't think of any off the top of my head
10342000	10344000	but if it's on the east coast
10344000	10346000	it's certainly possible Rama will go
10346000	10348000	yeah, that'll be cool
10348000	10350000	hopefully we can get Rama out of that one
10350000	10352000	I'm also going to PAX East
10352000	10354000	so I will see you there
10354000	10356000	yes, I will
10356000	10358000	pretty excited for that
10358000	10360000	and that's about it I think
10360000	10362000	alright, well hitstun I'm gonna let you go so we can try to
10362000	10364000	get a couple more calls in but excited to see
10364000	10366000	what comes out for the game jam
10366000	10368000	yep, doing my token
10368000	10370000	call in saying yeah I've been listening for 9
10370000	10372000	years and
10372000	10374000	keep going for a good 12 more
10374000	10376000	oh my gosh, we will try
10376000	10378000	that means so much, just don't tell me how old
10378000	10380000	you were when you first started listening because that always throws me
10380000	10382000	alright, have a good one
10382000	10384000	it's all good, have a good one
10384000	10386000	alright, take care
10386000	10388000	on orange lounge radio
10388000	10390000	we haven't heard from him in a long time
10390000	10392000	it's always good to hear from him
10392000	10394000	I love the people that call in all the time
10394000	10396000	but I love hearing from new people and
10396000	10398000	blast from the past as well
10398000	10400000	I was literally thinking of Jim Sally the other day
10400000	10402000	and I don't even remember what made me think of him
10402000	10404000	but I was like, we haven't gotten a call from Jim Sally
10404000	10406000	in so long
10406000	10408000	I must have, I heard a train
10408000	10410000	or somebody imitating a train
10410000	10412000	and I was like, oh my god, is Jim Sally here
10412000	10414000	I don't know, we got a call on the line, let's get to it
10414000	10416000	hi on orange lounge radio, who's this?
10416000	10418000	uh, yeah, this is Zormac
10418000	10420000	I'm sorry, Zormac?
10420000	10422000	I'm Zormac
10422000	10424000	oh yes, yes, yes, how are you my friend?
10424000	10426000	good, how are you?
10426000	10428000	am I coming okay? I don't know how well
10428000	10430000	we can hear you, it's a little bit
10430000	10432000	like a walkie talkie sound, but that's alright
10432000	10434000	it's good enough, we can hear you, what's up buddy
10434000	10436000	ok, great, so first of all
10436000	10438000	this talks to the
10438000	10440000	final hill 4
10440000	10442000	little music during the break
10442000	10444000	it was running late, I didn't get to hear the first part
10444000	10446000	but to just like, log in
10446000	10448000	and hear that was pretty awesome
10448000	10450000	um, well, Silent Hill 4
10450000	10452000	was actually our classic game of the week
10452000	10454000	this week, because believe it or not
10454000	10456000	that game is 10 years old
10456000	10458000	yeah, I uh, I actually remember
10458000	10460000	uh, running around
10460000	10462000	I'm not saying anything else, but
10462000	10464000	to play it at home, but uh, yeah
10464000	10466000	Silent Hill 4 The Room, correct?
10466000	10467000	correct
10467000	10469000	yeah, yeah, so I remember
10469000	10471000	playing that back in the day, it's been almost
10472000	10474000	forever, since I've actually heard it, so
10474000	10476000	uh, the other thing I wanted to talk about was
10476000	10478000	the
10478000	10480000	whole gaming, uh
10480000	10482000	people playing, making their own games and stuff
10482000	10484000	is that, could be a thing
10484000	10486000	that you guys are gonna start doing now, it looks
10486000	10488000	pretty interesting that you guys are
10488000	10490000	going into that, well, I wouldn't say
10490000	10492000	we're changing the whole show
10492000	10494000	but, you know, we're about
10494000	10496000	being the show where every gamer has a
10496000	10498000	voice, and I think one thing
10498000	10500000	you know, any show you watch on TV
10500000	10502000	is gonna have a story arc that
10502000	10504000	goes on for weeks and weeks sometimes
10504000	10506000	and I think right now, kind of the arc that
10506000	10508000	we're embracing is, why don't you use your
10508000	10510000	voice to actually make some games
10510000	10512000	um, because, there's
10512000	10514000	I think especially this year, it's kind of a
10514000	10516000	there's been a lot of
10516000	10518000	talk this year about
10518000	10520000	diversity in games, let's just put it that
10520000	10522000	way, right? And what better
10522000	10524000	way to diversify
10524000	10526000	games than get everybody
10526000	10528000	making games
10528000	10530000	to diversify the voices that are making them
10530000	10532000	it's kind of like they said in that interview
10532000	10534000	the guys from Cooking with Unity, we need to get more
10534000	10536000	gamers making games
10536000	10538000	is what we need, so I don't think there's
10538000	10540000	I kind of see that
10540000	10542000	I like embracing that idea
10542000	10544000	right now, now are we gonna turn into a
10544000	10546000	tech oriented how to
10546000	10548000	make your own games podcast?
10548000	10550000	Not necessarily, that's what
10550000	10552000	Cooking with Unity does, and there's plenty of other
10552000	10554000	resources out there to help you out with that type of stuff
10554000	10556000	but are we gonna do what we can to really
10556000	10558000	kind of nudge people and go
10558000	10560000	you ever thought about trying this, yo?
10560000	10562000	Nudge people and encourage people
10562000	10564000	to try in a place
10564000	10566000	where people, we will
10566000	10568000	say, you are not allowed to hate
10568000	10570000	here, this is not,
10570000	10572000	OLR is not about hate, it's don't be a
10572000	10574000	dick, I don't care who you are, where you're
10574000	10576000	from, what you do, but here
10576000	10578000	we respect each other, so
10578000	10580000	you're gonna create a game and
10580000	10582000	dammit, we're gonna embrace everything that is
10582000	10584000	made, and believe me, there are gonna be some shitty
10584000	10586000	entries in this game jam, because I'm participating
10586000	10588000	there will be some shitty entries in this game jam
10588000	10590000	but dammit, we're gonna love everything
10590000	10592000	as long as somebody tries, that's the important part
10592000	10594000	Alright, cool, so are you
10594000	10596000	going to maybe point out
10596000	10598000	your favorite
10598000	10600000	website to kind of look at
10600000	10602000	certain games being made in
10602000	10604000	a different environment, I know
10604000	10606000	Unity is gonna be pretty much the
10606000	10608000	primary language
10608000	10610000	to create the game, but I'm pretty sure there's gonna
10610000	10612000	be other websites that
10612000	10614000	utilize other tools
10614000	10616000	I would love to highlight
10616000	10618000	different things every week
10618000	10620000	to help people with ideas
10620000	10622000	and I just wanna say, even though we had the Cooking
10622000	10624000	with Unity guys on the show tonight, and
10624000	10626000	Unity is a great choice
10626000	10628000	I don't wanna say Unity is the official
10628000	10630000	platform of the competition, it's not
10630000	10632000	the theme of the competition is create something
10632000	10634000	dammit, so if you create it in Unity, awesome
10634000	10636000	if this is what gets you to learn Unity, awesome
10636000	10638000	but if this is what gets you to learn Unreal
10638000	10640000	or something else, and that's what you've
10640000	10642000	been wanting to do, then
10642000	10644000	then we embrace that just as much
10644000	10646000	I think a great source, like I always
10646000	10648000	tend to go, well for me, just
10648000	10650000	doing Unity and stuff, I tend to go
10650000	10652000	to Reddit a lot, so Reddit, you know
10652000	10654000	they have the, our Game Dev
10654000	10656000	and our Unity 3D
10656000	10658000	are pretty good sources, if you're looking to do
10658000	10660000	a different language, they have those as well
10660000	10662000	our Unity, our Unreal
10662000	10664000	Engine, they have, I'm pretty sure
10664000	10666000	they have one for the Coast Coast
10666000	10668000	2D or whatever it is
10668000	10670000	lots of different programming language out there
10670000	10672000	Game Maker, I think is free at some
10672000	10674000	points, so you can do that
10674000	10676000	RPG Maker
10676000	10678000	lots of resources
10678000	10680000	5th Dream in Chat with an excellent question here saying
10680000	10682000	fuck, does it even have to be electronic, can I make
10682000	10684000	a pen and paper RPG
10684000	10686000	well I'm gonna consult the golden rule
10686000	10688000	of the competition, which is
10688000	10690000	create something dammit, so
10690000	10692000	I actually think a
10692000	10694000	board game, a pen and paper game
10694000	10696000	if that's what you really wanna do
10696000	10698000	it's starting to push it a little bit
10698000	10700000	but I think I'm okay with that, because at the end
10700000	10702000	of the day, create something dammit
10702000	10704000	yeah, and that's pretty good too, because if anything
10704000	10706000	if it's a really good game, pen and paper
10706000	10708000	I'm pretty sure that they'll make some version of it
10708000	10710000	you know, so people can play on the
10710000	10712000	some sort of console
10712000	10714000	I think the rule for that is that it has
10714000	10716000	to be accessible online
10716000	10718000	that means
10718000	10720000	you have to publish the rules
10720000	10722000	publish the rules online, basically
10722000	10724000	indeed
10724000	10726000	if you've got
10726000	10728000	a board game, put the template up
10728000	10730000	online, Cards Against Humanity
10730000	10732000	great example, it's a game you play
10732000	10734000	in person, but it's something you can download
10734000	10736000	and print and make your own deck, right
10736000	10738000	it's a great example, it takes like
10738000	10740000	you can go in and make a 300 DPI
10740000	10742000	game board
10742000	10744000	I like that as a rule, so
10744000	10746000	yes, it's fine if you do
10746000	10748000	a board game or a pen and paper, but it has to be
10748000	10750000	something I get online and I
10750000	10752000	can, so that it is accessible
10752000	10754000	all who are participating in the game jam
10754000	10756000	ok, I like that, I like that, great
10756000	10758000	clarification there, Brad from Pod Culture
10758000	10760000	says, do drinking games count?
10760000	10762000	ok, now you're pushing it, now you're pushing it
10762000	10764000	ok
10764000	10766000	only the ones where I'm drinking
10766000	10768000	it's part of the development process
10768000	10770000	alright, well my friend, I gotta let you
10770000	10772000	go so we can try to squeeze in one more call
10772000	10774000	but do you think you might participate in the game jam?
10774000	10776000	um, yeah, I mean
10776000	10778000	I'm gonna be looking at some of the
10778000	10780000	websites for information
10780000	10782000	and we'll see, I love it
10782000	10784000	YouTube is a great help and
10784000	10786000	I even went through some
10786000	10788000	of these free courses for
10788000	10790000	I don't know, just like
10790000	10792000	even programming and stuff
10792000	10794000	I had to try to teach myself
10794000	10796000	and a lot of it was just kind of looking up
10796000	10798000	examples online and just seeing
10798000	10800000	how they do stuff and I'm still looking up
10800000	10802000	like, oh, how do I use this command
10802000	10804000	and how do I do this
10804000	10806000	I'm still waiting for your vlog
10806000	10808000	yeah, call him out
10808000	10810000	call him out
10810000	10812000	any information is good information
10812000	10814000	yeah, that blog, hopefully
10814000	10816000	I have a URL already
10816000	10818000	and I just have to make the webpage
10818000	10820000	someday, but that's time
10820000	10822000	it's time away from programming, so I don't know
10822000	10824000	we'll see
10824000	10826000	you take care my friend, thanks for calling
10826000	10828000	alright, bye
10828000	10830000	alright, we're gonna try to squeeze in one more call here
10830000	10832000	and this will be it for the night, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10832000	10834000	just the one and only
10834000	10836000	Rama, how is everybody tonight?
10836000	10838000	Rama, how are you?
10838000	10840000	I am good, I just want you to know
10840000	10842000	because of what Hitstun has said
10842000	10844000	I am starting a Kickstarter call
10844000	10846000	get Rama and the crew to conventions
10846000	10848000	hahahaha
10848000	10850000	you need a van
10850000	10852000	like they have in Scooby-Doo
10852000	10854000	well, I don't think
10854000	10856000	it'd be hard for us to get a van
10856000	10858000	because Mako-chan is pretty beastly
10858000	10860000	when she drives, so you know
10860000	10862000	we got nothing to worry about
10862000	10864000	I'm just saying, clouds of smoke come out of both those vans
10864000	10866000	well
10866000	10868000	there is a reason why she does drive
10868000	10870000	and does all the cooking, so
10870000	10872000	haha, what's on your mind my friend?
10872000	10874000	well this whole
10874000	10876000	fog jam thing
10876000	10878000	I might have to break out my visual
10878000	10880000	basic skills and do something or
10880000	10882000	learn Unity, since I now have free time
10882000	10884000	fuck yes, and by the way
10884000	10886000	AkumaJP in chat says, I don't want to be that guy
10886000	10888000	but Unity is not a language, don't worry
10888000	10890000	you're not being that guy, you're right, Unity is not a language
10890000	10892000	Unity is an engine, there is a big
10892000	10894000	difference, but at the end of the day, the golden rule
10894000	10896000	again, is create something, dammit
10896000	10898000	so if you are going to use an engine, if you're going to use
10898000	10900000	a language, if you're going to use, you know, whatever
10900000	10902000	whatever it takes to
10902000	10904000	get the job done, we encourage it
10904000	10906000	so, love it
10906000	10908000	yes indeed, yes
10908000	10910000	a couple more things, I'm going to get out of here
10910000	10912000	now this whole Lucky Chloe thing, now
10912000	10914000	you already said what I said
10914000	10916000	in the chat earlier
10916000	10918000	but also, I have a feeling
10918000	10920000	Lucky Chloe is going to be on the US release
10920000	10922000	because I don't see Namco
10922000	10924000	doing two separate presses
10924000	10926000	of the game for separate coding for this
10926000	10928000	I have a feeling
10928000	10930000	it's going to be there, but
10930000	10932000	it's just going to be locked
10932000	10934000	so you can't access it, and then
10934000	10936000	when all the drama dies down
10936000	10938000	for $3.99
10938000	10940000	you can have the character
10940000	10942000	yeah, DLC, that would be the best way to
10942000	10944000	stick it, is to give it to Japan for free
10944000	10946000	and make us pay for it, it would be hilarious
10946000	10948000	exactly, I just think dude's
10948000	10950000	pissed off at what he read on the internet
10950000	10952000	and I really don't think it's going to impact the final game
10952000	10954000	I think in a slow news week
10954000	10956000	people are really reaching for a headline here
10956000	10958000	I think he said something when he was really pissed off
10958000	10960000	and he was kind of like, well maybe I should make
10960000	10962000	this instead then, and people are reading
10962000	10964000	that to say, oh he's not going to do it
10964000	10966000	I think you're right, Namco's not going to
10966000	10968000	make two completely different copies
10968000	10970000	that's just not really what they're going to do
10970000	10972000	she'll be in the game
10972000	10974000	everybody just needs to pull their stick out of their
10974000	10976000	ass and get over it, because again
10976000	10978000	this is the same series that has
10978000	10980000	Panda Bears and Yoshimitsu
10980000	10982000	come on, let it go
10982000	10984000	let it go people
10984000	10986000	exactly
10986000	10988000	Loki thought I was going to break into
10988000	10990000	a song, that was last week
10990000	10992000	I'm moving on
10992000	10994000	the cold never bothered me anyway
10994000	10996000	alright
10996000	10998000	anything else Rama?
10998000	11000000	Final Fantasy, real quick
11000000	11002000	now I came across this on my
11002000	11004000	Facebook and it does remind me
11004000	11006000	of you and Al in a way of how
11006000	11008000	you two met, I have a long
11008000	11010000	time friend and she
11010000	11012000	just got married, what I didn't know
11012000	11014000	is that she met her now
11014000	11016000	husband while playing Final Fantasy
11016000	11018000	11, was this the
11018000	11020000	story that was on Reddit? Yes
11020000	11022000	and I tagged you in it because it was for a possible
11022000	11024000	article, the girl
11024000	11026000	Jen, that's one of my closest
11026000	11028000	friends, I've known her for like 10
11028000	11030000	11 years, how funny
11030000	11032000	we were a couple of conhors back in the day
11032000	11034000	how funny, you're right, I'm sorry I didn't throw that in there
11034000	11036000	tonight, just all the other stuff
11036000	11038000	sidetracked me a little bit, but
11038000	11040000	that's awesome that they met
11040000	11042000	in Final Fantasy 11 and what, they play
11042000	11044000	14 now right?
11044000	11046000	Probably, but right now
11046000	11048000	real life
11048000	11050000	has been taking over for them
11050000	11052000	because they just came
11052000	11054000	back from the honeymoon and this and this
11054000	11056000	and that, you know
11056000	11058000	Well to be fair, Alan and I didn't really meet in a video
11058000	11060000	game, although we did meet online
11060000	11062000	and we met on LiveJournal, which
11062000	11064000	I realize there's a lot of people now listening to
11064000	11066000	the show that don't even know what LiveJournal
11066000	11068000	really is, because it's kind of what
11068000	11070000	predated Facebook, there's actually
11070000	11072000	an Orange Lounge LiveJournal community, I don't think
11072000	11074000	it's been posted in since 2007, but it's
11074000	11076000	there, and I am a part of that
11076000	11078000	and the only reason I said Final Fantasy is because I remember
11078000	11080000	y'all two crossed paths that I think was
11080000	11082000	a Distant Worlds concert or something
11082000	11084000	like that, it was actually Video
11084000	11086000	Games Live, I was close
11086000	11088000	you were close, you were right
11088000	11090000	the first time we actually met in person
11090000	11092000	was at Video Games
11092000	11094000	Live, and we knew each other
11094000	11096000	virtually through LiveJournal, and it
11096000	11098000	was actually, believe it or not, it was
11098000	11100000	CaptainSpike from GameBooey.org who said
11100000	11102000	oh, you guys haven't met? And actually
11102000	11104000	introduced us, so
11104000	11106000	then we met in person at that concert
11108000	11110000	So, yeah
11110000	11112000	I know, right? Just looking at the chat room
11112000	11114000	it's hilarious, Fifth Dream
11114000	11116000	says, I just said LJ, and
11116000	11118000	onstov06 says, what's Hi5 or
11118000	11120000	my yearbook? No, we didn't
11120000	11122000	meet on Zynga, people, we didn't meet on Zynga
11122000	11124000	or was it, sorry, not Zynga, Zongo
11124000	11126000	what was that site called? Zynga
11126000	11128000	It's still around
11128000	11130000	Is it really? I believe so
11130000	11132000	I knew
11132000	11134000	people who used to post there, and don't forget
11134000	11136000	with LiveJournal, there was a
11136000	11138000	spin-off, there was Dead
11138000	11140000	Journal for the gods, Dream
11140000	11142000	Journal for the people who
11142000	11144000	were psychics, and you had Open
11144000	11146000	Journal, and this journal, and that
11146000	11148000	journal. Every time LiveJournal
11148000	11150000	did something to piss people off, it was like
11150000	11152000	I'm getting a dead journal, that's the day
11152000	11154000	And then there's the ultimate alternative
11154000	11156000	Dream Width
11156000	11158000	Still going strong
11158000	11160000	Crazy, crazy. Alright, my friend, I gotta let you go
11160000	11162000	so we can wrap up the show, but have a good one, thank you for calling
11162000	11164000	You too, thank you
11164000	11166000	I love that he's thinking
11166000	11168000	about starting a Kickstarter to get his
11168000	11170000	van, his
11170000	11172000	posse, the anime jam session posse
11172000	11174000	He needs to come back out here
11174000	11176000	and do a con
11176000	11178000	Or send me a plane ticket so I can
11178000	11180000	go out there
11180000	11182000	And you're
11182000	11184000	not even going to PAX East, I'm going to the East Coast
11184000	11186000	Finally
11186000	11188000	You know what?
11188000	11190000	See, this upcoming year
11190000	11192000	is going to be the year of lots
11192000	11194000	of money saving, not just by the house that we're in
11194000	11196000	Dan and I hit our 10 year
11196000	11198000	anniversary
11198000	11200000	And we're either thinking Disney World
11200000	11202000	Because I'm not going to
11202000	11204000	a con on my anniversary
11204000	11206000	Or Disneyland at the Grand Californian
11206000	11208000	Nice
11208000	11210000	So I'm going to be on the shoestring for
11210000	11212000	GX3, but yeah
11212000	11214000	My car has paid off this year, so I'm hoping
11214000	11216000	I do the smart thing and save a little more money
11216000	11218000	instead of spending it on frivolous things, but
11218000	11220000	there will probably be a few frivolous things here and there, let's be real
11220000	11222000	Anyway, if you didn't
11222000	11224000	get through tonight, I'm so sorry, but please consider
11224000	11226000	sending us an email, participate at
11226000	11228000	orangelaunchradio.com, but we are
11228000	11230000	waiting way long you guys, we have got to wrap
11230000	11232000	things up for the night, but what an
11232000	11234000	awesome show tonight, and
11234000	11236000	yeah, even though
11236000	11238000	to follow up on that one call,
11238000	11240000	Orangeland Radio is not changing, we're still the show where every
11240000	11242000	gamer has a voice, and we're going to talk about news every week
11242000	11244000	and comment
11244000	11246000	on it and give our opinions just like
11246000	11248000	we always have, but if we can
11248000	11250000	encourage more people to
11250000	11252000	make games, you know what?
11252000	11254000	Because one of you guys out there
11254000	11256000	might have the idea for the next great game
11256000	11258000	that we talk about on a future show
11258000	11260000	and so

11342000	11344000	which while I was high on coding
11344000	11346000	I did the dance of Hanukkah around my house and

11358000	11360000	will come out of the show
11360000	11362000	next week in an epic edition

11366000	11368000	now were we gonna have people submit
11368000	11370000	ideas as well?
11370000	11372000	we want your, yeah
11372000	11374000	if nobody submits an idea
11374000	11376000	fine, we'll make our own damn list
11376000	11378000	but what we want to do, and this is different than our usual
11378000	11380000	Listless, Latke, we want people to submit
11380000	11382000	their ideas for
11382000	11384000	us to consider for
11384000	11386000	putting on the list, we don't usually do that in advance
11386000	11388000	well that's good because I have no idea
11388000	11390000	so submit away
11390000	11392000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

11400000	11402000	you can leave your ideas there as well
11402000	11404000	again, it should be, what should
11404000	11406000	the theme of the game be?
11406000	11408000	Should it be about cats?
11408000	11410000	Cats who are
11410000	11412000	Now Rob, we have to specify
11412000	11414000	that it's felines
11414000	11416000	and not pussy
11416000	11418000	Should it be
11418000	11420000	Then we would have twat masters
11420000	11422000	Should it be cats with labels?
11422000	11424000	Should that be the theme of the game? Who knows
11424000	11426000	Send us your ideas, remember nothing
11426000	11428000	that's copyrighted, please, we have to
11428000	11430000	throw those out immediately
11430000	11432000	But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts
11432000	11434000	for the night. Dar Sacher, I'll start with you
11434000	11436000	our sick one, please feel better
11436000	11438000	and we'll see you next week
11438000	11440000	Is that your final thought?
11440000	11442000	Really? I hate that
11442000	11444000	Where's my mute button?
11444000	11446000	Alright, feel better
11446000	11448000	My final thought for the night, my final thought is
11448000	11450000	I don't think I've shaved in like ten days
11450000	11452000	I really should probably do that, it's a good idea
11452000	11454000	And I'm really excited that I finally
11454000	11456000	have a BurgerTime cabinet in my house
11456000	11458000	sort of
11458000	11460000	It's multiple things and there's more games
11460000	11462000	emulators on there
11462000	11464000	Super BurgerTimes on it too
11464000	11466000	There's more emulators on there, I will be
11466000	11468000	making a point this week though, Rob
11468000	11470000	to copy my ROM set off
11470000	11472000	of my other cabinet because it's a lot better
11472000	11474000	and it has Miss World nude
11474000	11476000	That was the one thing I needed on the cabinet
11476000	11478000	I had to make it work appropriate
11478000	11480000	it was on there and it
11480000	11482000	still actually may be on there, that's what I was looking at
11482000	11484000	earlier, but I couldn't find it
11484000	11486000	so I will copy my old ROM set
11486000	11488000	and I'll dump it on there and then you'll have
11488000	11490000	You'll have all the weird
11490000	11492000	games on there including
11492000	11494000	all the, was it
11494000	11496000	Are we allowed to do Twitch streams of Miss Nude
11496000	11498000	World 96 or is that against their terms of service?
11498000	11500000	It's probably against their terms of service
11500000	11502000	You can't do emulated stuff on Twitch
11502000	11504000	anyway, I feel like
11504000	11506000	I need to do a U stream or something
11506000	11508000	I don't know if that computer is
11508000	11510000	You could probably do it, it's not
11510000	11512000	that fast, I don't have to run it from the cabinet
11512000	11514000	I can run it from there, just thinking
11514000	11516000	Anyway, Loki last
11516000	11518000	but not least, your final thought tonight
11518000	11520000	I'm going to work on lots of programming this week
11520000	11522000	trying to make it a point that my son is going to want me to play
11522000	11524000	Lego Marvel with him, that's fine, I can play Lego Marvel with him
11524000	11526000	while he's awake, program him when he's not awake
11526000	11528000	so, sounds good, sounds like some motivation
11528000	11530000	this week, I am very motivated
11530000	11532000	I can't wait to work on some new
11532000	11534000	stuff, it'll be interesting
11534000	11536000	to start from scratch again, by the way
11536000	11538000	check your email, because our buddies
11538000	11540000	from Cooking with Unity told you how to play
11540000	11542000	Grand Theft Auto 5 with them
11542000	11544000	Yes! Damn it, that's going to take me away
11544000	11546000	from programming, but that's okay
11546000	11548000	that's okay
11548000	11550000	It's a good purpose, a good purpose
11550000	11552000	I need to get back into Grand Theft Auto
11552000	11554000	because I miss it
11554000	11556000	Thank you so much to our friends from Cooking with Unity
11556000	11558000	for coming on the show tonight, thank you for all of you
11558000	11560000	for showing up and making it an awesome show
11560000	11562000	a long show, but an awesome show
11562000	11564000	we couldn't do it without
11564000	11566000	all of your support, thank you so much
11566000	11568000	we'll see you in 7 days to do it all again
11568000	11570000	have a wonderful week
11594000	11596000	but you know they were all still true
11624000	11626000	Thanks for watching!
