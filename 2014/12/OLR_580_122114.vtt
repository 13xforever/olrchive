01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
We got lots of comments in our chat room, people talking about the holidays

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Let's talk about the holidays before we talk about the games we've been playing here in studio

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
With myself, Rob Roberts, and our co-hosts, say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
What? What? What? What? What?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Happy Hanukkah to you, Ms. Summers

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Thank you

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
You're welcome

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
How is the Festival of Lights treating you?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Flammable

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Highly flammable

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
It's a season of miracles, yo

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
Which, by the way, I gotta say, it is a miracle, all this fatty food that you've brought to the OLR studios tonight

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
It's amazing

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
I have brought truffle mint M&M's, not M&M's, Hershey's Kisses

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
I have brought cookies that are chocolate cookies with candy cane kisses on them

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Which come to us via Becky

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
From Becky

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Thank you Becky for listening

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Thank you Becky

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
And then Becky has given us a pie, this is Mary Jumas or December Wien

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Love it

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
It's apple pie, and Becky's apple pies are the best apple pies in the universe

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Everyone eats some now

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
And then she actually baked us a pie, that's love right there, that is love

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Thank you Becky

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Becky is the pie master

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Becky's the best

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Her pie knows no equal

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
And then later on, you are gonna get it all Jewish up in here

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
McLackas

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
McLackas

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
With applesauce

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
I'm excited

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Cause it's also Foodmas

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
You know what, this time of year, I celebrate everything because there's great food with every holiday

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
What did you get for the holidays?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Food

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Fat

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Exactly, exactly right

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Also say hello in the studio to Techmaster Loki

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Hello

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Hi Loki, how are you?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Doing alright

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Alright, we were reminiscing a little bit before the show

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
This week was Stephen Colbert's last show on Comedy Central

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
It was a little bit sad

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It was a little bit sad

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
I didn't watch it because I don't cable, but I did watch the YouTube of the last 10 minutes of the show

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Of course

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
And it's like, oh man, it's

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
It was well done, let me put it that way

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
It's disappointing to see him going off the air, but he'll move on to better things

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
It's only for six months because he's gonna be in a slot where he'll get exposed to even more people

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Taking over for David Letterman

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
And a lot of people I think are concerned because he hosted the Colbert Report as a persona

03:26.000 --> 03:31.000
And he's gonna be hosting the Late Show as himself

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
It's like, seriously, have you seen anything else?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah, he followed him for a long time, even on the Daily Show

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
And my favorite TV show of all time ever was one that he co-created called Strangers with Candy

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
Which I don't understand how that only ran for a few seasons because it was just brilliant

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
It was really brilliant

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, I don't know why, it got cancelled in favor of Strip Mall

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Which, you know, I love me some Julie Brown, but I just don't understand why Strangers with Candy

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
But anyway, it was the best TV show and Stephen Colbert was on it and he was hilarious

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
I actually, and you might be wondering, why are you talking about Stephen Colbert on your video game show?

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Well, A, because he's awesome, and does he have a video game? He really should

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
Technically he is involved video game wise because he did have a song that was in Rock Band, remember?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Oh, that's right, that's right

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Charlene, I'm Right Behind You

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
Yeah, but that was from the 80s, that wasn't even something he did recently

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
That was a long time ago when he was first starting out, that's right, I remember that

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
But I truly consider the man an inspiration, so I am like really happy for him

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
You know, some of you that listen to the show for a while know that I'm a corporate trainer by day

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
And so I consider his teacher character in Strangers with Candy like an inspiration

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Not that I literally do a lot of that stuff in class

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Where's your permission slip, Mr. Knoblet? Shut your dirty little mouth!

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
That's just amazing, anyway

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Ah, good times

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
There should be a Strangers with Candy video game

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
That would be an amazing idea for the video game jam that's kicking off tonight

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
If it wasn't something copier

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Or Telltale Games

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Maybe that's something Telltale Games can adapt

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
You know what, if he really wanted to, well, obviously he's gonna be really busy with the late show

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
But man, if he really wanted to bring Strangers with Candy back, I think he'd probably do it now

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
Bobby's in our chatroom saying that Stephen Colbert made that song recently

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
He just made it look like the 80s, but it was a new song

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I was convinced it was before from his XF57 days or something

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I was convinced it was from a long time ago

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
That's hilarious

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Alright, and in chat they mentioned that he's way into Lord of the Rings

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I heard he has a cameo in the movie

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
He does have a cameo in the movie

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
And he also did like a photoshoot where he was dressed up like all the characters

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
It's pretty awesome, they did some really good makeup jobs on him

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Amazing, amazing

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Let's get into some video game news

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
I know, I have, I think, officially lost interest in these things because it's just been too crazy

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
But if they made one out of Stephen Colbert, I might be interested again

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
And I'm gonna talk about the Amiibos

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
And, you know, we talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show when they were first launching

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
We didn't really know what they were

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And Nintendo really, I mean, for all practical purposes didn't really reveal what the hell these things were gonna do until the last minute

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
And I don't think people still understood it until they finally played Smash Brothers and got to use the Amiibo

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Or unlock stuff in Mario Kart or so forth

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
But this Amiibo stuff, I mean, I don't know if it's just the perspective of me as a gamer

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
But this stuff really feels like it's like the Beanie Babies of this year

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
It is nuts

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
It's just, I don't know, I still don't see the point to it

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I mean, yeah, it's cool, don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to have collectibles and stuff like that

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
If you wanna put that stuff up on a shelf and have it look nice, then that's fine

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Those things look pretty cool

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
But I just think, like, even looking at, like, the Pop figures and stuff like that

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
I think those look more interesting than some of the Amiibo figures

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
And that was always my complaint with not only just the Amiibos

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
But also the Skylanders and the Disney Infinity stuff

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
They're stuck to that base, you can't do anything for them

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
I think it would be awesome, like, you know, kind of like look at Legos or something like that

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Where, like, the figure would come off and you'd be able to do stuff with that

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
Now I understand that, you know, they would be afraid of losing the base or something like that

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
But somehow get that RFID chip in there where you could do that

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
I sort of understand why these things took off though

07:29.000 --> 07:37.000
And I think that just speaks to the volume of the classicness and pop culture infusedness

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
Of the characters that Nintendo has created

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
Which, you know, last week we were talking about the Sony hacks and the movie

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
That, you know, the Mario movie

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
And we talked about how, you know, this movie is gonna be big

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
No matter what, even if it's bad, it's animated

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
And there's gonna be tons of people that are gonna take their own kids to see a Super Mario Brothers movie

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Because they grew up with Mario Brothers, right?

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I mean, you did, you know, you did your kid's room in all Mario Brothers stuff

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Which was amazing, by the way

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
But it just speaks to the volume that these characters are

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
By the way, quick follow up, because I shouldn't work this in at some point

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
There is a quick follow up to the whole Sony hack and the movie leak stuff

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
And that is a little bit of a coyness out of Miyamoto about the Mario movie leak

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
And he said, I heard something about that this morning

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
What's interesting is that over the past 20 years

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
People come to us on a fairly regular basis about creating Mario movies

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
There are times that those ideas end right when they bring them to us

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
And other times we'll listen to presentations

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
It's not very unusual and it's something we've been doing for a very long time

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
I don't particularly have a vision that the next iteration of Mario is going to be in film

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Here's the thing

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I get that answer totally

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
But it is absolutely a non-answer answer

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And I think in Miyamoto's head

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
The next iteration of Mario Brothers will not be in film

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
I would think that Miyamoto probably never wanted that first film to happen

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
But I also think that

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
It's been enough time now to where we can kind of forget about that

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And I also think ultimately it's not up to Miyamoto

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Like yes, I understand, he's the granddaddy of it

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
But at the end of the day

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
If a boardroom signs off on it, it's going to happen

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Look at this way, okay

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
There's Batman and Robin

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And now there's the new Christopher Nolan movies

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Which, you know, one does not soil the rest

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I mean, if anything, it makes them better

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
So I don't think just because there was

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
And don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the Mario Brothers movie

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I know it was kind of stupid, but you know what?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
A lot of the movies that came out around the same time were kind of stupid

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Judge Dredd had some really stupid moments to it

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
You know, just something like that

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I'm okay with that

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Because that was just kind of the way things were

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Like Double Dragon, remember how terrible that movie was?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
It's just

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
It was loosely based on it, but it was just kind of like

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
That was just how it was going

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Anyway, not to digress too much

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
I consider that a non-answer answer out of Miyamoto

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
And ultimately, as rough as this is to hear

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I don't think it's up to him at the end of the day

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
And also that answer wasn't really him saying no

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
He just says, I think the next thing is not going to be a movie

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
But I don't know, it still strikes me as a non-answer answer

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
But anyway, rewinding a little bit

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
I want to talk about the amiibos

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Because, you know, the reason why these things are doing so well

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Is it just speaks to the strength of the characters

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Behind these amiibo

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
And I don't think it has really anything to do with the game functionality at all

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
I think grown adults want to collect those little toys

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Because it's okay

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It's okay, unlike Beanie Babies

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
For whatever, it's socially acceptable

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
For 30-year-old men and women to be collecting those toys

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Unlike Beanie Babies, which kind of got the grandma stigma

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
There's grown people that collect those Skylanders and the Disney infinity stuff as well

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
So, you know, I'm not surprised

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
So, anyway

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
So, amiibo is going crazy this holiday season

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
Whether you think they're useful in the games or not

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
People want those figurines

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
And it's kind of becoming a mess

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
And for me personally

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
This whole freak-out around it

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Is kind of turning me off to it in a big way

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
But for some people it just drives them even more

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
But some of the big news that came out about amiibo this week

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Is that Toys R Us started cancelling amiibo pre-orders and purchases

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Pretty much out of the blue

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
A big chunk of this was the Lucario amiibo pre-orders

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Which I believe, wasn't that the figure that's going to be exclusive to Toys R Us?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
I don't remember

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
I can't keep track of which ones are exclusive where

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Because it's a big mess

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
So, people have called Toys R Us to figure out what's going on

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
They've been advised that Nintendo did a product delay

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
And that amiibo are being cancelled as a result

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
Until there is a clear indication of how much stock there's going to be to get in

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Well, that sounds like Nintendo

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Now there's speculation that this wave 3 might be held back until beyond February

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
To make sure there is enough amiibo figures to meet the demand

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
Which is very high

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I can see that

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
And once again, before I was kind of under the suspicion that it was an artificial shortage

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
But maybe not anymore

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
But then again, I just

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I don't know how hard these things could be to manufacture

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
It's a piece of plastic with an RFID chip in it

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
I mean

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I can't imagine it being that difficult

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Some comments in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
YYR says Nintendo should capitalize on the amiibo popularity

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
By actually delivering some new games and long ignored franchises

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Next year is going to be really interesting

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
To see, you know, instead of having to back end amiibo into existing ideas

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Which I think they had to do for a lot of games this year

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Even Smash Brothers to an extent

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
I think they did it well in Smash Brothers

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
But I still think that was something that was kind of added on late in development

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
But next year as we start to look to games like Splatoon and Mario Maker

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
It's going to be very interesting to see how the amiibo work in the games from the outset

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Let's see, also some comments in our chatroom

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
We have

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Let's see

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Act F saying that I had a Lucario amiibo preordered and got cancelled

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Kaijuto says I'm an adult

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I buy amiibos not to collect them

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I buy them to train them to fight

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
I actually think, Kaijuto, while I certainly respect that perspective

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And I don't think you're alone in that

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I kind of actually think

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
I think more people are buying this not to use them with Smash Brothers necessarily

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
If what I see on Twitter and all that is any indication

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Granted, that's my perception of the world

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
But I just get the feeling that more people are buying these

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Just because they're Nintendo figurines than anything else

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I don't know, what do you think, Loki?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I think definitely that they would be buying them

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I don't know, I've seen better Nintendo figurines

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
I have some of the better Nintendo figurines in my son's room

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
That's kind of my thing

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
These are like, what, twelve bucks for a teeny tiny figure

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
And I've seen better action figures that cost less than that

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
It kind of bugs me that they're so expensive because of that

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Now by the way, Loki, this is kind of funny that you said that about the card

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Because I do want to throw out here

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
That Miyamoto has actually addressed that

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
In an interview that he did with ABC

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
He actually said

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
We're not making promises for certain figures

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
But the way amiibo is designed

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Is that certain games can have amiibo specifically for that game

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Other games can take advantage of past amiibo

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
That developers want to make their game compatible with

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
In the future, we have the option

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
If certain amiibo figures are no longer available in stores

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
To release an amiibo in card form with the same functionality

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
So they're out there

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
It's going to be a matter of time

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
That someone's just going to hack that anyways

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And then you'll just buy a card

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
And it'll be whatever amiibo you want

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I don't know

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I just

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
I'm not getting into it

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
It probably doesn't help that I don't have a Wii U

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
But even if I had a Wii U

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't think I'd really want to buy these things

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
It just seems like a big waste of money

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
But you know what

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
There's a lot of things I'd buy that are probably a waste of money to other people

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
That's true

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Whatever you want to spend your money on

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Jamie, I'm dying to check in with you and your perspective

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Let me get to a couple other comments in chat first

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Kaijuto, I love this comment

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
I was burned as a kid when I wanted Star Wars toys

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
And could never find them

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I had no idea grown men were buying them

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
To keep them in a bahox

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Sg100Matt says

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
They're Nintendo's beanie babies

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
People will collect the fuck out of them if there is a demand for them

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
Jamie, you're no stranger to video game collecting

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
You've done your own in the past

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But surely you've got to be looking at this going

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
This is big

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
What do you think?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Dan and I already decided it was a waste of money for us

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Really?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And I don't need to have any in my cubicle now

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Because my neighbor purchased them and put them up on our cubicle wall

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So I now have the never ending battle

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Between Red Rico and Link

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Now is that because you're not a Wii U owner at this time?

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
That you don't really have an interest in amiibo?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I probably wouldn't have an interest in it anyway

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Interesting

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
I could have played Skylanders if I wanted to

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
I could have played Disney Infinity if I wanted to

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I have a Rocket Raccoon

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
That's all I care about

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Which I have to thank Codeman for

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
But um

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I don't really care

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I hardly play my DS anymore

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I've been playing lots of Dragon Age

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
If there were you know

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Dragon Age amiibo

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Figures that I could

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Model

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I wouldn't even do that probably

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I don't know if they had a

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Garrus figure that unlocked something

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
in the game you'd probably be on that

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
So you think this

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
So I think I'm hearing this

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
I don't want to put words in your mouth

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
But this is what I seem to be hearing

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Is that maybe you're shifting away

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And you've kind of been shifting for the past couple years

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Away from consoles more to PC

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Pretty much

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
You know I um

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Actually right around the time I had my hand surgery

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Was when I started making the shift

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Just because it hurt to hold a controller for too long

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Makes sense

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
And um

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I was identifying my games

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Right

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Which was really Mass Effect and DA too for me

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Um

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I don't know

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Those are really more my thing right now

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I don't really want to

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I don't know and I'm also kind of

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Anti-competition these days too

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Because people are making competitions out of things

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
They have no business being competition

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Or being competitive

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
And

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
It's back into the whole you know

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
I just really

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I kind of look at the whole thing with a little

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Edge of disgust

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I don't care what you spend your money on

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
But you could be doing better things

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Now

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
ActDeaf actually sent along a little

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Update to this story

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
He sent me a private message being one of these people

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
That actually preordered saying

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Toys R Us sent an email today to everyone

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
That had their Amiibo preorders cancelled

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
They're reinstating orders

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And letting others make another reservation

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
For Amiibos but Toys R Us said

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
That they messed up the orders not Nintendo

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Very interesting little

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Follow up because I feel like I'm hearing

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
A conflict between what some of

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Their own customer service people were saying

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
And this but again that's no

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Real surprise there that you know

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Something was different

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Way at the top than it really was

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
So hmm

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Anyway I'm sure this is just going to

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Continue over the next few weeks

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
This whole Amiibo fever

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
But me like

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
I'm not willing to go camp

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Out at the store for two hours

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
To get one of these figures like

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I don't need them that bad

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I like them well enough I kind of want a Mega Man

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
One but I'm not going to fight like crazy

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
For one if I can't just go online

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And get it then I'm done and my understanding

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Is if I haven't already preordered one I ain't

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Getting one I guess at this point so

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Eh we'll see like I'm just

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I don't have to have one that badly

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I think they're cool like I do

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Really want the Mega Man one but

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Is my life going to be over

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
If I don't get one? Nah

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Will I be jealous of friends that have

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Them and I don't have it? Not really

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Actually I think I've

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Kind of hit that point so

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Anyway alright

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Let's travel around and look at

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Our gaming weeks and the types of games that we

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Have been playing this week

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Dark Sakura you haven't been playing 3DS

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
But what have you been playing?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I should have been bringing my 3DS with me because I'm doing

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
A puzzle now but um

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I'm playing Dragon Age

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
A friend of mine

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Actually started playing

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Final Fantasy 14

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
So I'll be playing that a bit more later

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Um

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
So uh

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Yeah pretty much just Dragon Age right now

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Um

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I am taking my sweet time

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
With it I've already talked to people who have beaten the game

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Several times over but

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I've been playing just a little bit after work

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Exploring, looking around

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
You know making up banter

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
In my head

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
And I've really

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Been finding it a fun creative

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Outlet lately so

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm content to

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Take my sweet time with it

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Do you do a lot of mods with Dragon Age

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Or is there not a lot available yet?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
It's funny that you say that there are

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
There's only one mod out there right now and it's

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
A camera mod

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I haven't put it in yet

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
But basically BioWare

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Said well Frostbite's really

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Going to be difficult for other people to mod

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
They're not going to be able to do the same mods with this

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Like they're doing for Mass Effect 3

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Or for the previous Dragon Age

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
And basically the entire modding community

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Has said oh yeah watch

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And they're working on breaking it

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Um the guy who did

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
The uh

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
The tools for uh Mass Effect

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Warranty voider I think is what his

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Name was um at least online

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Um has already started

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Working on uh tools to

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Uh go through the code

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
For uh Frostbite

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
So I think it's only a matter of time

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
We've already had people who have been able to rip

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
The character models and have done

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Their own uh models for

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
The characters but um

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Well the good news is that

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
They practice on Frostbite with Dragon

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Age and that way when the new Mass Effect comes out

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
All these tools will be ready to go

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
And I honestly think that the

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Oppression I've been getting from the BioWare folks

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
That is sort of like huh let's see if they can do it

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
You know

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Like we don't see how without

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
All this so let's see how

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Inventive you'll be and I

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Think that it's not necessarily an

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Active discouragement from doing it

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But of a we actually

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
Just don't think it's possible type of thing

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
So of course challenge

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Accepted

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Alright uh let's put her mic down

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
So that's it for her gaming week. Loki your gaming week

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Um really I just played uh

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Um I'm just

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
You know finishing up my son wanted to play

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
A bunch during the week so

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
While he was just running around the city doing stuff

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
I was busy knocking out all the

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
Races and all of the um

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Little activities

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
That I have to do to unlock all the characters

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And get 100% in the game

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Which brings me to a couple things

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
About this one some of the controls

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Are fucking terrible

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Like their flight controls I seriously

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
Want to punch the guy in the face

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
They came up with their fucking flight controls in that game

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Cause it's just it's

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
So god damn frustrating

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
That it doesn't work right cause basically

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
You tap the jump button twice

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
To go into like a flight mode or whatever

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
And then you would tap uh

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
What was it circle twice or whatever to

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
Get out of that and land

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
But also X and

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
Circle are you know

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
For elevation so X makes you go up

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Circle makes you go down

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
So you can kind of get where I'm

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Coming at here first off the uh

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Up and down vertical movement

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
And there is very sluggish so you have to

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Kind of hold it down but so if you're trying

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
To kind of fine tune it and get it

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
So that you're aiming at the right speed

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
A couple things happens either you tap

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
X too fast and so

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
That sends you into like a kind of a

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
Burst speed thing so you fly super fast

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
And you can't get out of it really fast

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Either or you just

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Land on the ground because you hit

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Circle twice and you just fall

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Out of the sky so

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
I seriously was like cursing this game like

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I fucking hate you stupid game I don't

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
Want to play this thing anymore then

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
They had certain races where they thought it would be

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
A great idea to lock the

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Fucking camera in a really awkward position

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
While you were playing that race

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I seriously want to strangle people that were in charge

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Of the camera and the flight controls in that game

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
The rest of the game is fine

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
A little buggy at times but

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Careful what you say on the internet Loki

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You want to strangle them with love and understanding

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
And a better understanding of physics

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
I just want to smack them upside the head until they realize

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
The error in their ways I mean come on

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
This is like how many

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Lego games have you made so far

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I mean this isn't the first one

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Of flight in it and you've had

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Several Batman games

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Anger leads to the dark side

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
And so

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
You can't tell me that you haven't figured out that this is

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
And then here's the other thing too

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
You have a controller with several buttons

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
That are not being used at all

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But you decide to map

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
The elevation and all this shit

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
On the two buttons

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Great that's good for kids to learn stuff

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
But it's fucking impossible to be able to

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Just maneuver accurately through the game

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
So that's really my only thing

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
But now that I'm done with that

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
All the races and stuff

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
It's kind of a big relief

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Because now I don't have to do that crap anymore

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I just have to go through all the levels and get all the

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Clocks and everything so

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I'm very close to platinuming the game

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Which will be my first platinum

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
As much as it drives you crazy

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You're determined to platinum it

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
At this point I've already suffered through it enough

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
So I need to platinum it

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Over at live.vognetware.com says

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Little Josh gets sent home from preschool

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
For saying bullshit controls fucking work

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
What the fuck after throwing his Power Ranger

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Action figures into the air

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
No we were

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
The other day my wife got

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Inspired by watching

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
It was Jimmy Kimmel or something like that on the internet

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
And she was asking him what

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Bad words he knew and so he only knew

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Like stupid and

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Something like

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Something like poop I don't remember what it was

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Poopy head or something like that

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Those are the only two words

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
That he could think of

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Probably for the best

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I have called the game stupid though

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
And under my breath I'm like fucking

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
That's when you

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Walk out casually in the backyard

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Shut the sliding glass door and go

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Fuck

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
God dammit this game is good but like

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
But seriously though one of the best

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Characters in the game though is squirrel girl

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Because she has like

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
The most useless powers

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
She has one power where you charge it up

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
And for no reason like squirrels run around

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Like they crawl all over her and then they kind of explode

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Off of her and she throws squirrels

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
At people as her attack she throws squirrels

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It's like bungee ferret tossing but with squirrels

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
You know what I don't think it made our show

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
World tonight but I'm very excited for

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
The Bravely Default sequel Bravely Second

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
They announced a cat girl

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Character like a cat girl class

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And so it's that involves cats

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
How can this be bad?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
If she throws cats at people or whatever has cats do her bidding

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm all for it it's like a summoner

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
But with cats? Heck yeah

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Sounds good

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
I just want my party to be for cat people

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Sounds good to me

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
So that was it I also tried to play a little bit more of

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
I Am Bread and the game is really frustrating

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
So I just pretty much stopped right away

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
It's like it's even worse

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Than like Surgeon Simulator for me

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I mean same people and it's just

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Like I can't figure out what I'm supposed to be doing

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
To get you know off the floor

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Once I hit the floor it's just like oh I'm gonna land on the skateboard

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And I'm gonna ride the skateboard over the counter

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
And I'm gonna crawl up the wall

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And that just didn't happen because there's like a

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Grip meter and stuff and so the more you hold

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Down on the grip you eventually

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Lose grip so I

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I'm just so frustrated

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
At that game it's funny but I just

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Don't wanna play it

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Well that's it for your gaming week I will talk quickly

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
And I haven't even bought anything on Steam

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
I've been very good for you so far I've been

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I've been good at not getting anything on the Steam sale

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Yet either but I've been voting every day

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
To get my card and I did

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
What I disenchanted some of the loot

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Which was a brilliant idea on Steam's

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Part by the way to get people to just destroy

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Things in their inventory that they would otherwise sell

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
I

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I disenchanted a bunch of crap

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
In my inventory like backgrounds I would never use

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And stuff like that and I bought like a pack of cards

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Or something I don't know so

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Yeah anyway let's see

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
So my gaming week I've been playing more

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Final Fantasy 13 on PC

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
My partner Alan bought me

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
A brand new monitor for the holidays

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
So now I have two widescreen monitors

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
That I'm using and this new one is bright

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And it looks great and it does

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Super resolution so I can play

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Final Fantasy 13 in these really

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Obscene graphic modes and I'm so happy

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
The game has come a long way

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Once I got past all the bullshit bugs

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Like the graphical issues from the initial release

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And you know the fact that it frameskips

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
If you don't have a controller plugged in like what the hell

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Once you get past all that it's so

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Beautiful on

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
PC and I'm

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
I'm on like chapter 7

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
So like I'm pretty committed

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
To this playthrough so

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I'm excited I've been having a good time with that

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
And continuing to play some other games

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
That I've been playing off and on Final Fantasy 14

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Return to Diablo 3

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Continuing with Seasons

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Alan and I had a little squabble over

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Diablo 3 about two weeks ago so I kind of put it on

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Ice for a little while

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
But I went back to the game and I found a really

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I really like in Diablo 3

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
That you can just respec your character at any time

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
If you find that the build you're

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Using doesn't work for you

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
That's fine respec

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
You can't even reroll the gear

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Thanks to Miriam the enchanter

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You can try to like I went from

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Ice mage to a fire mage

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And so I rerolled all the cold bonuses

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
And now there are things like either fire bonuses

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Or crit damage and I'm doing

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Way more damage and I'm way more efficient

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I'm having way more fun as a fire mage

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Now as opposed to the ice mage I was

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Playing and that's probably in part that I was getting

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
A bunch of fire mage drops

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
So I was like okay the game's trying to tell me something

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
So I switched and now I'm

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Flying through torment 1 rifts

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Like they're easy so I have to even

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Bump up the difficulty a little bit so I'm having a lot of

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Fun with Diablo 3 again

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
New games I have played

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
One new game this week I did play

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
One brand new game this week that came out on

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
PlayStation 4 I think it was one of the only

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
New game releases this past week

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I decided to plunk down the $10

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
For a classic game

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
It's very hard to screw this game up

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And do something wrong with it

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Tetris I bought Tetris Ultimate which was

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Released on the PlayStation 4 this week

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And it is Ubisoft that made this port

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And um

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I'm gonna tell ya there's

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Some things I liked that they're trying to do with this

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
You know they're trying to make Tetris more

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Social you know like make it more like a

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Social game which I get

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
That's where gaming's going so like apparently

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Some of my play sessions have been

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Ghosted and like Fifth Dream

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
In chat earlier was saying oh I was

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
Playing against one of your ghosts earlier and I was like

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Oh shit I didn't know the game was recording

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Me like I sometimes what I'll do

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Is if I screw up too early I'll just

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Drop all the pieces you know and I'll just fill up

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
The screen it's it's the rage quit of Tetris right

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You just eternally drop all your pieces and start over

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
So I'm like oh shit if Fifth

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Dream is playing one of my bots that just rage

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Quits that's not a lot of fun so it's good to keep in mind

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
There's a lot of different modes and yada

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Yada yada but here's the thing

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
That really gets me about Tetris

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Ultimate

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
It's buggy like

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Bad buggy like

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Really bad buggy like

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
How the fuck did they release

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
This in its current state buggy

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
And it's mostly

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
One major bug

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
But that bug is

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Frame hiccups

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Now let us think about the game of Tetris

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Especially when you're playing

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
On level 11

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
In endless mode

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Is that okay for the game to suddenly

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Hang for even just three frames

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
While you're trying to rotate a piece

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Or drop a piece at just the right moment

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Absolutely not

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
And it was to the point where I was like

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Did any QA happen

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
On this game at all because that would

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Have been noticed if it was played

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
On a real Playstation 4 maybe that's something

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
That didn't show up on a dev PS4

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I get that but was this even play tested

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
On a real PS4 was it cause I'm not the only

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
One that's noticed no I saw was

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I unfortunately went to IGN

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
To watch like the couple you know

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Now they call it let's plays but it's not really

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
They had some issues with the game

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I guess they had to literally unconnect

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
It from the internet in order to like drop

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Those frame skips or whatever

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
And it to the point where it was like

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Taking a super long time to load

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Stuff and like there was even frame

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Skips during like the whole Ubisoft

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Logo and everything

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
And to the point where like they're trying to

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Drop the piece and it was taking several seconds

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
To drop that piece and stuff

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
And apparently they said yeah we tried this

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Even on a retail

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
System a debug system

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
On several different ones and it was still

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Having the same problems

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
So

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't know what's up

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
With Ubisoft man it's bad

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
When you can't even get Tetris I mean Tetris is

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Not that complex of a fucking game

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I think the power of the Playstation 4

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
And from what I hear it's only the

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Playstation 4 version that's doing it

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I would think that the Playstation 4 can run Tetris

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Just I think it can

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Now 5th Dream says I was playing

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It on remote play and I had no issues

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
But then I don't play as fast as Rob's

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Ghost I'm gonna say you know I

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Was made aware of the IGN video via

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Twitter and it was

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
After I already bought the game and I was

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Playing it and I was like god damn it like

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Why is this game buggy and then I saw that

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Tweet come in because somebody retweeted it and I was like

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Oh okay it's not just me and I

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Watched the video now here's the weird thing

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
I didn't notice it as bad

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
As they do and

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
But that seems weird to me that there would be kind of

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
That variance there but I didn't notice it

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
As bad but I definitely noticed

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
It and it was definitely the point where

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
I'm like Ubisoft

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
You need to fucking fix your QA processes

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
You need something like something

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Clearly is broken

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Because how many games is that

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
Now that have gone out the door with very

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Obvious bugs in them

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Fix your

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Processes please

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
It's embarrassing

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
It's Tetris

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
For god's sake Tetris

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
I could play Tetris on an Apple

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
What was the very first it was made for

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
The PS like PS2

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Like old school IBM basics

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Right was the original Tetris I'm talking

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I'm talking the guy in Russia

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
I know right

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
So the power of the Playstation 4

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Cannot handle Tetris

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Give me a break

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
A TI calculator could play Tetris

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Now

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I do have faith that thanks to

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
I mean if I just sat here and bitched about it

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Nothing would happen but IGN's

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Got a lot more pull than I do I'm sure because

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Of them putting out that video the game will get

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
A patch and it'll be fine but it's like

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
It's yet another one of those things

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Why did we have to wait for the patch

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I mean you release the game

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The next to last week of December anyway

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Would have delay until February

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Have killed you it's not like I was sitting

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Here going I can't fucking wait

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
For Tetris yeah like

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
It was more one of those things where it's like oh Tetris

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Came out I like Tetris I'll get it

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I would have had the same reaction in February

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
After you fixed your shit

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Oh my god it just blows my mind

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Well that was the thing it was like a lot of people

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
When they bought it you know they're kind of

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
There's a few games Ubisoft has released that haven't

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Been that great that kind of little buggy

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
You know but it's Tetris

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I mean how hard can Tetris be to program

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I mean it can't be that bad

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
YYR in chat says don't worry Ubisoft will patch

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
It in in a few days not to fix the game

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Breaking bugs but to put a face on the faceless

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
L block it's funny you say that because

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
In battle mode like you actually get

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Blocks that have mustaches on them and other

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Little things that happen

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Just cute little things that

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Have to do with the

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Battle thing it's like

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
Playing Tetranet basically they basically

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
So there are some cool things about this game

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
That basically you can play Tetranet and that

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Type of thing but you know again

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
When you have frame skip in a game

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
That badly needs it like Tetris it's like it

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Ruins the whole fucking thing it doesn't matter

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
If they're doing all these other cool things to the game

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
The game is ruined it's tainted

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Jason says that Tetris on the Playstation 4

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Doesn't look or act like Tetris on

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
TI NES or whatever

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
To which I say I didn't ask for them to make me

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
A fancier looking Tetris it's fucking

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Tetris I don't need it to have like

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Fucking you know

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Clouds in the background

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Or shiny blocks or whatever it's

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Fucking Tetris it doesn't matter

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
And here I do

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Have one other this is a minor

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
More minor complaint about the game but it is

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
An issue I have with

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Tetris lately and I think

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
The last round of Tetris games did this too

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And I don't understand this and that is

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
What is the obsession with

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
T-Spins what is the obsession

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
With counting T-Spins

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
And having achievements for T-Spins

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
And getting T-Spins

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
As a statistic I don't understand

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Like

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
What I even had to look up like what

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
A T-Spin is and it's

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
By the way it's when you take the T-Block

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
And you rotate it in to fill a gap

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Like it's not you're not

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Dropping it to fill a gap you rotate

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
It over to fill a gap that like

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Might be on the side or something that's what a T-Spin

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Is and it's like oh I

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Thought I was already doing that but yet my statistic

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
For T-Spin I guess sit at zero but it's

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Like I don't know I don't

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I don't get why that has to be

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Tracked the only T-Spin I'm aware of

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Is you know with Baloo and where

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
They're flying a plane and

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I guess that was Tailspin though

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
So anyway

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
YYR in chat says yeah I think those are dumb

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Too and Alan Alchemy says the T-Block

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Is the most versatile block yet

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It's the line blocks that I always tend to

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Put in my hold queue anyway

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
The Nintendo DS version

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Of Tetris remains the definitive version for

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Me or the Game Boy if you want to go all the way back

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
To the Game Boy version that one too I think the

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
DS one is the best one out there and it still hasn't been

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Trumped on all these newer consoles

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Came out on 3DS as well

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
On 3DS but not this isn't the Nintendo version

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
With like the Mario

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
No this version that just came out from Ubisoft

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
No Nintendo did one on the DS

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Which certainly you could play on a 3DS

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But Nintendo did one on the DS that in my mind

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Is still the definitive version

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But maybe that has to do with the love

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Of Nintendo characters thing we talked about earlier

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Cause all that retro nostalgia is all

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Over that game but I even think without

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
That it's still the definitive version I mean because

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
It's the Game Boy version but modernized

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
And in many ways I think

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
If you said Rob the Game Boy version

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Is the definitive version I would be like

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
You know I respect that angle

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
That's a hard one to argue with

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
The Game Boy and the DS ones are really neck and neck

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
So anyway

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Alan Alchemy

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
In chat says everyone loves it when a T block

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Shows up unlike the square one

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
That's like hello I'm here sorry I'm so fat

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Frown no the ones

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
It's the Z blocks to get me

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
The Z and the S block because

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I can never visualize

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Ok what's the jagged pattern

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Is this the one that fits the jacket on the right

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
This is the ones that you use to slide in

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah and I've used it that way too

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
But do we count Z spins or S spins

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
No we count T spins

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Anyway, Jamie just rolled her eyes

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
That makes for great radio

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Alright

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
SSJ100Matt says I came back in the middle

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Of this discussion and my initial thought of

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
T spin stats were stats of how many times

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You spun the teacups at Disneyland

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Oh I'd win that fucking game

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Purple ones for life

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
It is not the teacups unless somebody barfs

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Alright that's what I'm saying

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
That's why you go in the purple ones they go faster

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
At night

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
They go faster at night for sure

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Everything goes faster at night

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Alright we're going to get into some news here

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
In a minute here also more information

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
On the VOG game jam coming up

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
In part B we're going to kick

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
This off tonight and

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Us and Bobby Blackwolf and hopefully some of the

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Other shows at VOG too teaming together

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
To encourage everybody out there to

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Create something dammit

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
You know last week we had the guys from Cooking with

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Unity on the show which I know Loki found

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Very very motivating and I thought those guys

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Were excellent motivators you know they've worked

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
In the industry and my favorite

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Thing out of that whole interview was when Max said

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
You know I just

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Want you to make a game I want you to make a game

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
And I thought yes I want you

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
To make a game too what can I do to help

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Alright we've got a network let's do this

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Let's do this VOG game jam

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
So together the

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
OLR live audience tonight we're going to pick a theme

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Through our tried and true list list

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Mechanism so we're going to get to that in part

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
B and that will be the theme for the game jam

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
But you know what if you're not comfortable programming

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
In Unity and you don't want to learn just yet that's okay

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Use RPG maker

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Use Twine

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Use Commodore 64

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Basic make a level in

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
Little Big Planet if you want or create

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
A level in another game but just

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Create something dammit that's all

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
We want we want people to create

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And get creative

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
So all we're going to throw you tonight is a spark

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And we want you to run with it

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
And create a fire and who knows

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Who knows sometimes

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Big big games come out of game jams

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
So wasn't super hexagon born

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Out of a game jam I could be wrong I don't remember there's

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
A lot of stuff there's a lot of stuff that suddenly

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
You know goes from game jam to like

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
You know steam release and I'm not necessarily saying

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
That that's going to happen

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
But it might so

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Stay tuned

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
So more info on that in part B

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
For now quick housekeeping

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
We will actually still be

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Here throughout the holidays

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
The holidays fall on pretty convenient days for us

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Not so much for Hoard House but for us

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So we will still be here next Sunday live

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And the Sunday after the holidays will not be

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Interfering with OLR scheduled this year

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
However

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I am foreseeing off in the future we will not

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Be here January 18th

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
That's way off in the future so I'll be giving you

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Reminders we're still determining if we're going

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
To pre-record that week or what we're going to do

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
We can't do an early show I'm going to be

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Out of town I guess I'm

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Okay to say this on the show I'm

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Going to Seattle Alan and I are going to go to Seattle

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Visit some friends of his that he's known

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Online forever and never met so

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
I'm going to go to Seattle over Martin Luther King weekend

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
So I'm excited about that I haven't been

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Up to Seattle in about five years but I love it up there

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
And I can't wait to do all that touristy shit

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Again Space Needle, EMP

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Aquarium

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
First Starbucks, Pikes Market I'm going to do all that shit

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
So maybe

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
If we rent a car maybe I can talk

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Alan into let's just

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Drive by Nintendo headquarters and see if I can see

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Reggie I just drive by I got to

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
After all these years I got to just drive by and wave

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Or something see if I can sneak

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Into the cafeteria who knows

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Alright

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
So anyway more info on that to come

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
When we get a little closer into January

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Tigerclaw asks

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
In chat will next week's OLR be a

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Best of show I am thinking

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
We will do something to cap off the end

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Of the year us being

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
OLR and haven't been around for so long

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
We seem to do something different for the last

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Show of the year every year I don't think we found our thing

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Yet but certainly we will be looking back

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
On 2014 and talking about

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Our favorite games of the year even

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Though you know what guys we don't

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Possibly have time to play everything

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
We can't sit here and say this is the definitive

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Best game of 2014 but we can't

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Tell you our favorite games so we will at least

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Go over that next week and I am still going back

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And forth in my head there is two that I keep

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Flip flopping so we will see

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Anyhow

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Let's get into some news after all that

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Let's get into what is going on

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
In the game industry this week not as busy

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Of a week but there is still some stuff going on

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
That is worth talking about right Loki? That's right

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
So of course you know some of the big news

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
This week had to do with Minecraft

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And the announcement

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Of Minecraft story mode a tell

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
Tell game series

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
And apparently it's going to be

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
A separate game

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Not necessarily an add on to Minecraft

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
But it's a separate game

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
That will be released on PC

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Mac mobile devices and

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Xbox and Playstation consoles they say

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
The game they haven't really said

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Too much about it yet other than you know

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
They are not creating an official story

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
For the main character Steve

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
But apparently it's going to have

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Some sort of story that revolves around you know

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
User created stuff

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
So I don't know

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
You know to be honest

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
They kind of already have this

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
It's actually a mode you can set up

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Your different worlds in I think it's

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I forget the actual name of it's called

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Like fantasy or something like that

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
But basically allows you you know someone to create

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
A world in creative mode

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And then basically to limit the amount

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Of building

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
And breaking that you can do in it

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And it has a lot of you know kind of narrative stuff

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Based off of that

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You can like you know set up events and things

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
But

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Cool I guess I mean that'll be

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Neat to check out

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
When it comes out

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
There's a lot of hate for this idea

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Out there a lot of people are really pissed off about it

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Don't buy it then

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
I kind of don't I don't get that though

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Like I understand that okay well

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
A Telltale Minecraft game is not going to be

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Really Minecraft in the traditional sense

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
But at the same time it's like

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Telltale has kind of done really

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Good things with a lot of the properties they

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Have a story for

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Minecraft is really not something that's been

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Explored at all I don't I don't

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Understand where the negativity is coming from other than

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
It's something different I don't like

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
It I don't know

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I think problem I don't see the problem

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
I just think they're immediately thinking that

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Oh another Minecraft game

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
After Microsoft bought a mode they must be selling

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Out or something but

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Now maybe maybe it's Minecraft

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
For saturation like that I could

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Maybe see that because you know

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Minecraft really is everywhere

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But it's not just this video game

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I mean you know

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Go into target or anything like they've got

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
All this Minecraft licensed shit everywhere

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Like another game is really

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Really the

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Least of it but you know

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
I gotta say as much as

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I'm not always really into like poking into

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
People's personal business and all this gaming news

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
You know it's out there that Notch

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Bought that mansion in Beverly Hills

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
You see that? It was

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Him and he outbid

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Beyonce and Jay-Z

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Like really

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Really just think about that for a minute

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
The monarchy

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Of Beyonce and Jay-Z

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Got outbid by some nerd

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
For this mansion

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I think that's absolutely hilarious

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
It's kind of awesome

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Probably did it for spite

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
You've gotta admit you gotta see Beyonce

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Sitting there going, who is this nerd?

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Just bought our house

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
You know what though

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Props to him

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
I saw that picture of him with his

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Legs up with the whole like candy

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Bar or whatever in the background and I was

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Just like

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
The only thing that picture is missing

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Is a gigantic bong I think

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
But anyway not that I endorse that

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
But I'm just saying it seems to be the one

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Thing that's missing

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
With his kind of money

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
He could just

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
It's like the fucking Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Of bongs

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
He can turn the pool into a giant one

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Anyway sorry Loki I don't mean to digress

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
He could build a fucking chocolate factory

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Like out of Willy Wonka

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
That's what I'd do with all that money

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Wouldn't you? No

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I just want an Oompa Loompa

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
I want it now

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
I want a golden goose

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Daddy I want the goose

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
That lays the golden eggs

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
And actually it was the squirrels

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
But anyway Loki

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
So then on top of that you know

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
The Minecraft film has had a little bit of a setback

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Apparently the director Sean Levy

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Has left the project

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Basically saying you know Warner Brothers

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Asked me to develop

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
How this might be a story

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
For a movie because it's a non-narrative

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Game and we came up with an

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Approach that felt good but when they discussed

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
It with Mojang they were like

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
That doesn't sound like what we want

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
So

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
So yes unfortunately he couldn't really

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Go from there

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I don't know I'm not

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Too terribly disappointed by that

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Maybe

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
We'll see something with this Telltale game

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
That's the direction he wants to go with it

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Or something you know maybe the story that we see

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
Laid out here because honestly

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
There isn't much

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Of a story there

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Alan does point out in our chat room over at

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Fognetwork.com Alan Alchemy says

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
The original Minecraft doesn't really have a story

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
But there is a long ass objective to find

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Farm Endermen, farm ore

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Go into the netherworld or hell

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Go to the Enderplane, kill the Ender Dragon

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Which most people don't even do they just fuck around and explore

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Caves and make badass asses with roller coasters

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
But if they wanted to explore that story

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
About the Ender Dragon I'd be interested

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
In it

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
I just think they need more to it it's kind of short

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
I mean it's kind of like oh we just put this there

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Because people wanted an end to the game

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
I also

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
I would have a concern for

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
The clock and I said this

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Back when Microsoft bought Minecraft

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
I sort of feel like the clock on

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Minecraft is ticking and I think the ultimate

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
Climax to this whole thing is going to be when

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Microsoft inevitably releases

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Minecraft 2 because you know they're going to

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
You know they're going to they release Minecraft 2

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
And I kind of think that will be the beginning of the end

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
I just you know

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I realize a lot of people might brand me a hater

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
For thinking that or that I don't get it because there's more

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
To it with all the licensing and all that

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
But I just kind of think the bubble is going to burst eventually

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
And then there's going to be because there will be another big

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
New thing that everybody gets into

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
That people can create and explore their own stuff

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
You know what I mean?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
I'd be down for a Minecraft that ran better

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
I mean it's just all Java

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Right now so I'd be fine you know running

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
A little bit better but

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Whatever it's all good

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
And then of course you know with that the

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Microsoft versions of the game

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Are actually getting another update

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
They have was it it's

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
The 1.64 update

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Now they're saying it's going to

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Add horses because horses

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Have been in the PC version for a while

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
But you can actually get horses

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
You can even you know

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Make a donkey you can put horse

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
Armor on them

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
All sorts of fun stuff

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Tame them and they're saying

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
That along with it they're going to add

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
New enemies

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Bats, witches, wither skeletons

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
And new fireworks

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
So it's kind of it's getting close to where

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
The Xbox version is actually meeting with

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Almost what the PC version is right now

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
So

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
I have to go back to the Xbox version

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
At some point or

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I may have to actually get one for the

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
PlayStation 4 in that version

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Alright

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
The PlayStation 4 version is pretty good actually

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
We'll get down with that. Alright moving

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
On let's talk about you know and honestly

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
I have a hard

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
Time quantifying this next story

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
As news because I really don't think this is

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
News but sometimes we have

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
To bring to the discussion

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
What other people are talking about

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Out there in the gaming world and that's where this

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Next story falls into

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Miyamoto obviously he did a big interview this week

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
With ABC and there was a lot that came out of this

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
And one other thing that he said in this interview

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Quote we're focused on providing

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
A robust lineup of Wii U software

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
For next year it seems like we've managed

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
To do that this year and people are very happy with

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
What we've done on Wii U which for the most part is pretty true

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
For the time being our focus

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Is on the Wii U hardware but Nintendo

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
As a whole has groups working on ideas

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
For new hardware systems

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
While we're busy working on software for the Wii U

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
We have production lines that are working on ideas

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
For what the next system might be

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
And so what's the headline on every fucking

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Game blog right now and every fucking tweet out there

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Nintendo working on

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Wii U successor

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Because the little

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
What they don't say in that

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Is that everybody wants

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
Nintendo to move on from the Wii U

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
So let's hear about their follow up already

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Click me, click me, click me, visit my site

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I sort of think that's that

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Unsaid piece there

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Is that people, there's a lot of people

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
That want to see Nintendo move on from the Wii U

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Because they already wrote it off

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I gotta say though Wii U has had a killer year

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
And I don't see

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
How you can have a top 5

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Games of the year and not have at least

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
One Wii U title on it

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
Maybe if you're talking about your own personal list

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
And you don't own a Wii U

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
I guess that's the way you do it

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
But I can't see how you do if you are considering

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Every single game that came out this year

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I don't see how you have a top 5

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
And you don't have at least one Wii U game on it

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Like they've had a pretty good year in that regard

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
So I still give them some credit

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Wii U's got a lot of life left in it

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
So if they don't bring out their next successor

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Right away then no big deal

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
But here's the thing

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
So that by itself

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
Not really a big deal

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
You know Sony's working on Playstation 5

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
It's years and years away but they're thinking about it

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Xbox working on Xbox 2

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Or whatever they're going to do next right

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
260 I don't know

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Whatever the hell Microsoft decides to do next

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
They're working on it

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
They're brainstorming that name right now

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Brainstorm really hard

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Here's the thing

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Here's what else Miyamoto said

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
It did nothing but add fuel to the fire

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Since we first created Mario

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
We have compared him to Mickey Mouse

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
I've always said Mickey Mouse evolved

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
With each evolution in animation

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
You saw Mickey Mouse each step of the way

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
From early on I wanted Mario to be that character

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
In the digital world

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
So that with each digital evolution

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
He was there to usher in the next era

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
I think that maybe when we release the next hardware system

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
You can look forward to seeing Mario

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Take on a new role or in a new game

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
And a lot of people are taking that to say

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
No more Mario until the next Nintendo system

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
But that's not really what I'm hearing in that quote

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
I don't know about you guys

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
But I'm just hearing in that

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
Mario is kind of the guy with the scissors

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
That cuts the ribbon

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
That says you know

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
It's now open for business

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
Not necessarily that every Nintendo console

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Has launched right out the gate with a Nintendo title

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
But pretty close right

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
Super Nintendo had one

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Nintendo had one at least here in America

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Nintendo 64 had one

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Gamecube had Luigi's Mansion

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
But Super Mario Sunshine

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
Wasn't that far from the get go

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Wii U had new Super Mario

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
The Wii

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Is the only one I can think of

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
That didn't have a Mario title right out the gate

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
But then you had some really strong Mario titles

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Between the new Super Mario Brothers

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
And Mario Galaxy of course

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
A lot of people really loved

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
New Paper Mario

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
I like New Paper Mario

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
But that's the other thing too

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Is that Mario is so much more

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
All these other things now

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
And so I think there's some people that assume

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
That this means there will be no Mario game on the Wii U

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
But I just

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I can't imagine

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
I cannot imagine

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
That Nintendo is not thinking about another game

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
In the Mario Galaxy series

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
They have to be

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Those games were so good

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
And they were so different

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
And they were always critically lauded

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I assume they sold well

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Didn't they sell pretty good?

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
First one did I'm pretty sure

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
Because they did make the sequel

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
They've got to be thinking of a Mario Galaxy for Wii U

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
I mean

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Or even a pretty easy

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Sequel to Mario 3D World

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
You would think would be up on the agenda

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I would think that would be a very

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
In some ways Captain Toad might kind of be that

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
But I digress

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
So I would think there's going to be Mario Galaxy games

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I don't think this necessarily means that no more Mario

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Can you imagine an open world Mario game

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Done in the same style as that new Zelda game

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Right?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
I don't know

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
To register participation for this week's episode

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Use the pass phrase

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Chair

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Let's see going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
Kaijudo says

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Wii U is the shit

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Anyone that hates on it has never really played it or owns it

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
The Wii U is an amazing system

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Only haters are the people that want HD shooters

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
And Mountain Dew perks

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Fuck those guys

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
There was no Star Fox game on the Wii

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
But we are getting one for the Wii U

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
So yeah Nintendo does skip some of their ideas sometimes

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
You know what else was sorely missing

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
From the Wii

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
F-Zero

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Act Def says

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Super Mario 3D World is still an amazing game

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
And I wouldn't mind a Super Mario 3D World 2

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Neither would I

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I really kind of hope they do

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
And I'm okay with that if they just try to squeeze another game out of that

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I'm sure it'll be great

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Nintendo does a really good job

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Of producing quality sequels

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
YYR says

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Nintendo has always been stupid about sequels though

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Never more than one Smash game

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Per platform per example

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Wasn't it because those games take years and years and years

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
For them to make

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
And that team was busy doing the Kid Icarus game

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
On 3DS for a while

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
So that's why there was a

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Big lull between Smash Brothers games

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
If I'm not mistaken

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Which I'm surprised they still haven't ported that over

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
To like the Wii U

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Maybe they just didn't do that well

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
They probably don't think it's worth the effort

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
I don't know, I don't know why

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Because there is a lot of Kid Icarus love in Smash Brothers

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I mean they made Palutena a character

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Which was a little bit unexpected

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
But I think

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
The studio that's making Smash

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Obviously is a little partial to their own games

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
There's also the fact that they have

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Kirby, Meta Knight

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
And Dedede

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
That's kind of a lot of Kirby in the game

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Which I'm sure Act Def is probably sitting there going

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I don't see a problem

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Neither do I but I'm just saying

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
In the big scope of things I'm surprised they have a lot

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
From these three franchises

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I'm surprised they haven't brought in more Donkey Kong

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Country stuff like King Krule or something like that

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I'm really surprised

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
From the Kid Icarus franchise

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
That the eggplant wizard didn't show up as a character

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
I would have thought the eggplant wizard would have been an awesome character

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
And that's kind of one that's been missing for a while

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
But maybe there's only so much you can do with that

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
DLC

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Yeah you never know, careful what you wish for right Rob?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Alright moving on

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Let's get into something a little different with Dark Sakura

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Well we do have

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
A group

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Are you familiar with the Electronic Frontier Foundation?

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Of course

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Yes they are

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
A very very worthwhile group

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
But they actually were celebrating

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
National Crossword Day

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Can I just say real quick

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Cause this is relevant and important

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
EFF I definitely recognize them

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
They were one of the people fighting the podcast

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
The EFF played a big part of

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Fighting that fight

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
So that I can podcast

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
And you can podcast

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Without somebody trying to say

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
That they're owed money because

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
They invented feed technology

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I mean I don't get with it

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
So anyway the EFF was a huge part of that

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Well anyway

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
They have

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
The official crossword day has happened

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And so they put out a digital crossword

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
That you can download

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
It's very cool

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
It's actually a PDF

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
And I'm gonna link it into our chat room

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Or there's also

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
An interactive version on

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
GitHub

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
But it's called 2014

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
The year in copyright news

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
So it's all copyright related stuff

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
So related back to

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
2014 so

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
Thought I would share that with our listeners

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
It's a very old school game talking about

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Some new school ideas

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
If you think about it

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Crossword that's one of the oldest

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Video games we have

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
You know before there were

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Video games I used to love and they still make

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
These books and once in a while

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
About once a year I will still buy

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
One of these books to play

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
On the airplane like while I'm flying

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Across country or something and that is the

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Variety puzzles

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
And games have you seen these books?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
They have all the logic

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Problems and crosswords and all this

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I'm sure somebody in chat has to know what I'm

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Talking about that's like

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Gaming without a console

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
For me that kind of leads into

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
They still do your crossword in the paper every Sunday

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
So yeah well every time I try

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
To do the crossword on a flight or something

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Somebody else has already done it

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Jerks in ink

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
In ink

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I don't want to bring my own I wanted a complimentary one

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Jeez Rob

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Cheapo

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Well thank you EFF for

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Providing a different crossword with a message

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
With a message

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Loki

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Alright so there's

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Apparently a new project

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
That Microsoft is working on called

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Arcadia and it's thought to be

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
A game streaming

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Technology

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Or service by the sounds

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Of it and this is

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
I guess coming from

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Some job openings that they have

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
One for a cloud based operating

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Systems group and one for listing

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
A project called Arcadia

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And they're saying that I guess

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
It's similar to

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
I guess it's built off of the Azure cloud

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
And something that's supposed to replace

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Microsoft's Rio game streaming tech

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
To me it sounds a lot like

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Technology that you would see with like

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
The

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Playstation streaming to

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
You know like the SharePlay

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
But like streaming to like the Vita

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
That type of stuff and that's what they're saying

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Like the listing they said

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
The new operating systems group

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
OSG streaming team is leveraging

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
The cloud to bring premium unique experiences

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
To Microsoft's core platforms

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
These experiences will take advantage

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Of the new geo distributed massive

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Scaling service to redefine

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
What is possible by today's services

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Or today's devices

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
The client team is building the user

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Interface applications

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Our user facing applications

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Bridging the service and

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Our team is small but growing

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Dedicated to solving Microsoft's one

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Biggest challenge in the creative fashion

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
So they're saying that also

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Possibly

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Going to be streaming to not only like

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Microsoft devices but iOS and Android

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
That type of stuff so

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Makes sense I think it would be kind of cool

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
If they did something like that

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
You know it seems to work

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
It's working out pretty well with

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
You know Playstation right now and I know that

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
It hasn't quite gotten to the point where

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
They can do it on well actually I take that

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
It has kind of gotten to the point where they

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Can do that on Android devices because I remember

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
I saw that hack last week that they

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Somehow got that working now where you can

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Play your Playstation 4 games on your

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Android tablets and stuff

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
So

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Cool hey if I can find a way to

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Game on the go you know and it works

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Well over Wi-Fi I'm all down for that

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Ever since Sony announced

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Like Playstation now and SharePlay

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I've been curious how Microsoft's going

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Honestly I would like

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And this is cool you know that you can do it

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
On a mobile device but I would like to be able to do that

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
On my laptop I would think that

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
There would be a way they're going to stream it to PCs

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Because you know

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Microsoft does have that Windows tie-in

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Can you imagine if you could stream your Xbox One console to a PC

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
That would be really neat

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
That would be fun

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Because I would just take my laptop with me

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And Sony I'd love to do the same thing

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
All my systems I'll just have them plugged in

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And I'll just play them on my laptop

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
If I'm down with that

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Doesn't mean you'll be able to use a keyboard and mouse with everything

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I don't want to but you know

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'm fine with using just the controllers

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But that would be really neat

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
If you have the Xbox One in the living room

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And you could just stream stuff to your PC desktop

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
And you could play the game

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Using an Xbox One controller plugged into your PC or something

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
That would be pretty cool

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Anyhow maybe one game that you are

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Streaming and still playing is

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Destiny I see a lot of people actually

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Streaming this on Twitch

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Well you should get on that

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Get on it because a lot of people

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I knew that were playing it kind of stopped

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And if you want me to play I'll still sign in and play with you

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
It's one of those things like

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Especially once you get into the game jam stuff

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It's like I haven't really been

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
You get to it eventually

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
The only reason I've been playing games at all

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Is because I'm playing while my son is still awake

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
It's not when I have free time or anything

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
I can work on my own stuff

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
So I haven't really been playing when he's going to sleep

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
But we'll see

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Anyhow Destiny had a little

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Minor patch this week

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And the patch has to do with the expansion

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
The Dark Below

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Which I'm not going to buy until they slash the price

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Which I know it's inevitable they'll slash the price

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Of this because I kind of don't think

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Everybody bought it

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I mean I don't know maybe some sales numbers will come out and prove me wrong

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
But I know a lot of people that have either sold the game back

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Or like I'm not buying this

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Because there's not enough there

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So very curious to see how that's going to affect things

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
But anyway a patch did come out

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
We tweaked some of the gear drop rates

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
With Crota's End

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Which is the Dark Below's raid

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And more players will get equipment with their efforts

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
So now raid gear in Crota's End

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Starts at level 30

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
And this will help you on an upgrade path to level 32

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
There's also a specific helmet item

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
And it will also spawn on normal mode now

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
And hard mode players have an additional chance

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Of getting it as a drop

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
There's also some issues regarding reputation gains

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Hive shield functionality

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Pocket infinity charging

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So I'm going to be playing a lot of Destiny 2

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
In a Destiny update that went live this week

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
So you know

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Despite the fact that I might feel a little more meh

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
On Destiny now than when it first launched

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
At least props to Bungie for staying on top of it

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
And doing regular updates with the game

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
But I still am not a big fan of the fact

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
That the raid content

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Kind of

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Or the new expansion content

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Kind of gates some old things

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Like you know the raid of the week

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Is only in the expansion

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So if you don't pay the $10 you can't do the same stuff

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
That you were necessarily doing before

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
A little silly to me

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And I hope they consider

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Some fixes with that

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
If they haven't already to be honest

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I haven't put the game in and played in a while

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Maybe I will this week or if Loki ever tells me

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Hey get on and play Destiny help me

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Dark Sakura

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Well we keep hearing about 38 Studios

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
The group in

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Rhode Island that didn't quite make it

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And pissed off the entire state

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I thought I really thought all that news

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Was done with I thought we were past that now

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I guess not huh?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Well it turned out that

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
38 Studios board

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Member fined for

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Well it was getting fined for unregistered

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Lobbying in Rhode Island

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
That

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Actually

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
It was there's a hearing

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Out there that says that

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Thomas

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Lobbyed state officials

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And different politicians

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
About the

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Company and

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
But he wasn't a registered lobbyist with the secretary

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Of state but that

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Lobbying is what led to the loan

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
That funded the company

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
So dude's gonna get

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Fined $2000 if he doesn't

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Fill in the proper reports

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
So nope

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
We haven't heard the last of them

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
File your report or else

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Or how about lobbying is

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Stupid

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Alright

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Let's move on

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
We're gonna travel around the world and check out

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Some release dates and check out some things coming

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
To a store near you although I think

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
This segment might be a little empty

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
This week I don't know Loki is there anything

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
In the US? It is that time of year there is

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Nothing coming out

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Yeah unfortunately there

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Is nothing coming out this week I mean

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Tuesday in the states is what Christmas Eve

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Eve as my sister calls it

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
So yeah there's not really

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I mean they don't normally put anything out around

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
This time and even it's pretty dead

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Up until March

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
The only thing I can say is if you have

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
You know your games with gold

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Or if you've got

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
PlayStation Plus don't forget to download the free

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Games I know right now starting

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
On the 16th they had SSX on

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Xbox so I

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Reminded myself today to go download that

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Even if I may not play it or not I still have

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Like money I gotta spend on there and I just

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I honestly haven't been touching my Xbox in a long time

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So I just have to

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Figure out what I'm gonna

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Buy for it I'm hoping

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I hope I'll get an Xbox One at some point and I can

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Just buy a digital game on that or something

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
But yeah

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Just unfortunately not a lot coming out until January

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Alright well

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Japan being a different culture has a

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Different pattern with their releases and so we are

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Seeing some releases in Japan this week

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
In fact on the 25th of December we have

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000

And Shadow of Mordor

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Middle Earth comes out on the Japanese

Version on the PlayStation 4

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Shadow of Mordor also making its way to the Xbox One

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
In Japan this week

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Looking at the last gen consoles

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
PlayStation 3 hey guess what

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Shadow of Mordor also on the PlayStation 3

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
This week and on the Wii U

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Nothing this week

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Wii U is not getting anything until Captain

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Toad Treasure Tracker next

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Year I didn't realize that game was not

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Out in Japan oh never mind cause that's the Europe date

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Not the Japan date oops

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So gosh Japan doesn't get

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
A Wii U game until

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
On January 22nd

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Which they should totally download or buy

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Which is also well it's gonna go up against

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
On the same day Kirby Super Rainbow

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000

Wii U game is on the 22nd

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
In Japan let's quickly

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Check the Vita and the 3DS

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
La Doll Collection

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Looks like another title in the

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I would say in the Atelier series but I don't think

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
That is what this is at all this is just a doll

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Dress up game coming out

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
On

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
It's those dolls what

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Jamie what do they call these dolls with the

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Giant eyes that look like that one Lady Gaga

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000

Or the Puleps I think the Puleps

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Yeah that looks like a Pulep

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
So it looks like that kind of little dress up

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Game there dress up and decoration

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000

Some other stuff

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Those are probably games that were

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Announced for this year but never dated

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So I'm thinking that's probably what it is

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
We'll see I'm gonna put file that under

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Bullshit so yeah

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Nothing no games for you guys in the UK

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Sorry you don't get to play anything

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Catch up on your backlog shit

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Get a Spectrum

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Speaking of the Spectrum just a couple more stories

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Than the classic game of the week

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Loki

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
So um

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
You know I think we talked about this a while back

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
You know how the whole

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Debate regarding

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You know 1080p and upscale

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
1080p and the whole you know

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Oh this game's not really 1080p

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
It's like 900p or whatever

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yes I do remember this debate

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
There was this lawsuit or

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
It was a class action lawsuit against

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Killzone Shadowfall

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And they were saying that you know

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
It was false advertising because it wasn't a native

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
You know 1080p

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And so

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Apparently the

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Federal judge has ruled

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I guess that a lot of the

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Complaints have been dismissed

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
So there is

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Only still one left I guess

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
And I'm trying to see here I believe it

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Was that they were saying

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Um

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Let's see here

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Something I think that still has to do with

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
The native or the razor sharp

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
1080p native resolution

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Is false advertising

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
And they were claiming that it was blurry

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
To the point of distraction which honestly

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Looking at the screenshots and

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Videos of seeing a Killzone it looked pretty

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Good I just don't understand why people

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Would be complaining about that game there's

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Plenty other games that look like crap

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Um

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But yeah basically

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
All but one argument

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Basically that shouldn't agree that

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
The negligent misrepresentation

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Claim cannot stand in its current

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
State as Ledor did

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Not present a non economic

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Loss such as personal injury or property

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Damage yes he caused property

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Damage because of the

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
The lack of pixels burned

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
My house down

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Um yes

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
And so you know because of that you know

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
They granted them 30 days to file an

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Amendment complaint in which case they say

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Um they can sufficiently

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Alleged that he or other punitive class

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Members suffered such non economic

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Damages I just

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
I the whole thing just seemed to be

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Kind of a grab for money in the first place

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I just don't see this

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I'd be surprised if that last

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Bit doesn't get dismissed

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Or if it does go to court that

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
They still don't win I mean cause

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I think they're just

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Kind of stretching at this point trying to

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I don't know if it ever

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Says it's native 1080p anywhere

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
On like any of the advertising

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Hey Murica

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Ah

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Anyhow uh alright

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I got a story about a series

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That I know a lot of you like I like this series

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
An awful lot it's pretty much all I use my 3DS

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
For now that Smash Brothers is on Wii U

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
And that game is Theatrhythm

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And guess what Theatrhythm Dragon

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Quest is going to be a thing

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
It was shown at Jump Festa 2015

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Which was a big Square Enix festival

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
That's going on right now

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
We have some other stories about what came out of Jump Festa

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
A little later on in the show

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
But yeah Theatrhythm Dragon Quest is going to be a thing

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Who knows if it will actually come out here

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
In America that's the big

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Question right now but Dragon Quest

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Theatrhythm will come out in Japan on March

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
26th of next year

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Again no Western release yet confirmed

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
For the game if they're going to do it

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
I would imagine they'd announce it at E3

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
For a holiday release kind of like what they did with Curtain Call

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
I don't know if this would be the type of thing

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
That might be download only

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Because I mean unfortunately over here

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Dragon Quest is a little more niche

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Especially when you consider

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
That there's probably going to be songs from Dragon Quest 10

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
In it which wasn't even released here

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
So I don't know but anyway there still

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Will be field and event music stages

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
That are in the game

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
There will also be apparently a top down

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Rock band type setup

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
That will take the four lane battle

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Layout that was found

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
In the previous Theatrhythm games and

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Turn it into something a little different there

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
So again March 26th

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
2015 is the big day

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
For that in Japan I'm sure some people will

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Be importing that

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Also good news for Japanese owners of

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Theatrhythm Final Fantasy Curtain Call

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Some more DLC

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Was confirmed for Final Fantasy

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Curtain Call now there was some

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Stuff that you would expect in this game such as the

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Ultima Battle music from Final Fantasy 14

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Which is really good by the way

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Hard to miss as well will be

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Coming out but those songs are going to be

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Free for two weeks when they come out in Japan

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
So that's pretty cool but also get this

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
The opening titles and

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Passionate rhythm from

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Romancing Saga and Romancing

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Saga 2

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Saga Frontier will be getting a song in the game

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
The Meridian dance

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
From Secret of Mana is going

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
To be in Theatrhythm Curtain Call

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And Chrono Trigger

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Is getting a song

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
In Theatrhythm Final Fantasy

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Which many people

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Were saying Chrono Trigger should just get its own

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Damn Theatrhythm game

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
But it's been so long

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I don't know if that will happen

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
No announcement yet if those

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Songs will make their way over

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
To the US I sure hope

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
So I think a lot of

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
People would really dig some

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Of these songs in America

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But we shall see

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
What do we have to do for like DLC

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
For Mario Kart 8 that's

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Chocobo Racing

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
What do we have to do for that?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Or hell just make

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
A racing game. Shit it can't be

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
That expensive they have the fucking Sanrio

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Games that come out that aren't that great

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Chocobo Racing is coming to Final Fantasy 14

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
With the Chocobo breeding

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Yeah but it's not Chocobo Kart Racing

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I understand that

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
You're actually going to get to control your Chocobo though

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
It's probably

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It's not going to be as robust as something that Mario Kart 8

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
There should really be like a whole

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Derby Owners Club type game

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Like Final Fantasy where you're just sitting there

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Like guiding on them

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I know I'm sounding fanboy

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And you know what sometimes I just can't help it

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
You made Polteri cry

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
With Final Fantasy 14

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
The fact that they're bringing Triple Triad into the game

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And Chrono

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Yes they're bringing Chrono Trigger into Final Fantasy 14

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
No they're not

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
It's not canon if it comes in there

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
But can they get like the Golden Saucer up in there

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
That's what it is it's coming in the next patch

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It's called the Manderville Gold Saucer

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Is coming in the 2.5 patch

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Before the expansion

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
There's more

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Fucking Hilda whatever

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
The fuck is it

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
They haven't said if it's part of the Hildebrand quest or not

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I hate him

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I love him you're a hater

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
I am a hater because he's stupid

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I like his dad though

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I don't know if it was Allen or Shane that suggested this

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
I think it was Allen that said this

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
That it could be that his

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
No it was Shane because I think we were talking about Skype

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
It could be his dad that owns

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
The Gold Saucer

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Or his mom

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
His mom has not been seen in the story

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Hildebrand's mom

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
She could be the one that runs the Gold Saucer

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
She probably got smart and left him

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
So what was the new

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
The new jobs that they added for 14?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
They announced

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
This didn't make our show roll but yes they announced

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
3 new jobs for Final Fantasy 14 that will be in the expansion

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Dark Knight which is a new

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Tank class it was not a tank in 11

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
But it will be a tank class now

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
They announced Astrologist which is the new healer class

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Machinist

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And Machinist

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Is going to be the DPS class

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I want to play an Aurra

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Aurra is the new race

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It's new to Final Fantasy

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
They look like Draenei but just not blue

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
They're pretty

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
They build mechs and stuff

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
That would be pretty bad

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Do you remember

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Edgar in Final Fantasy 6

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Why did they tell me this?

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
That sounds so awesome

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
They're going to actually use little

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Drones too

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Looks awesome

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
It's kind of like the Engineer class

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Come to the dark side

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Do the thing

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Sorry Nellie

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
That means

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I'm not going to remake Mulan

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
But I'm probably going to do a second character

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Edgar is like seriously my favorite character

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
From like pretty much all the entire series

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
They have the most bad ass weapons

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
This is why Final Fantasy 14

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Is doing so awesome

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And why the game continues to be awesome

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
The reason why

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Is they know that

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
And they're acknowledging that Loki

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
They know that people love Edgar and that's why they're making

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Machinist a class in the game

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Just for the same reason they made a fucking Magitek armor

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Something that you can actually get in the game

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And ride around on

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
It's that same type of stuff

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
I wouldn't doubt

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
At some point they'll put the fucking Opera House from Final Fantasy 6

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Somehow in the game

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
They have Ultros

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
With the old school battle music

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
In the game so

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
That's why the game is doing so well

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I'm on that quest line right now

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
They know what people like

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
That fight is kind of a bitch

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It's harder than the Shiva fight

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
You can teach me the mechanics before I try it

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
You get turned into an imp

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And you have to imp punch

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
The other guy

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Before he does his thing

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Can you imp punch him in his

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Imp junk?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Nelly can't hear you Rob

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
She's pouring sand in your car's gas tank

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Probably

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Alright you know what

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Let's travel back to a time when games were a lot simpler

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
You know they weren't

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Just self referential

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Although this game might have been a little bit

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
It's the classic game of the week

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Where Dark Soccer is going to go into the vault

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
And find a game and she thinks

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
You know what

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Since there's no games coming out in the US or Europe this week

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
You go fucking play this game

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
You do the thing

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
You get Loki subbed

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
To Final Fantasy 14

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And then you play this

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Dark Soccer what is

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
If you make your character by the way

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
No that will never happen

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
I will just name my

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I'll name him

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Just after what I had in my other class

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Alright

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Here it is your classic game of the week Dark Soccer

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I love love love this game and I'm so excited

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It's finally a fucking

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Classic game of the week

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I picked a game that came out the year I graduated high school

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Oh my god

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Why do you insist

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Is that your new thing you're going to come out here and go

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I picked this game because it's now officially

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Nine years old and so are you

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
No Rob this is more than

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Ten years old

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
This is 20 years old

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Remember I skipped my 20th high school reunion

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
To play this game

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Oh and the oven is preheated so we got

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
I better do this quick because Latkes

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Oh yeah

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Point blank also known as

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Gun Bullet

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I love that game

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Or it's also been nicknamed

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Gun Buddy

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
It came out by Namco

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
In the arcade Playstation

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It's got a version on the DS

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
But it first came out in 1994

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
For the arcade and it is the first

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Light gun game

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
That Namco has ever done

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Basically

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
It's a fucking light gun game

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
But you have different types of

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Quests that you have

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
And they're different puzzles

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Like the one on the video

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
That I'm linking here is actually one of the harder ones

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Where it's a cut out shoot

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That you go down a hall

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And you have to shoot all the bad guys

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
And none of the civilians

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
You got ones where you shoot

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Different targets of a color

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
You get

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Different

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Shoot all the balls

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Yes

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
You shoot the balls

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
And it's like Buster Brothers

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
The way that the balls work

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
You shoot them and they get smaller

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
That would be so easy to make

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It's funny

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
This game is so fucking good

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
I can't

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
You have to also protect Dr. Don and Dr. Dan

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
You have other challenges

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Some things that have in common

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
With police trainer

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Different difficulty levels you have

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Practice, beginner, advanced, and very hard

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Because some people like it very hard

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Determine how many stages

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
That you have to finish

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
To complete the game

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
As well as their difficulty

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And then you get four missions

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
In each of those types of groups

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
So you can do different ones

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
In different orders

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
So you lose your lives by failing to complete your quota

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Within your time limit

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Or shooting a bomb

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Or letting Dr. Don or Dr. Dan die

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
When you have to protect them

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Incorrectly answering questions

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
By shooting the wrong answers

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Shooting a cardboard civilian

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Shooting a cardboard geisha

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Failing to complete a quota

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
For multiple life things

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Letting meteors destroy the earth

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Because that's always a day ruiner

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Running out of bullets

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Shooting incorrect differences

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Letting aliens steal your shot

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
And more

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So the things that you're

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Gauged on is accuracy, intelligence, memory

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Simulation, visual acuity

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And speed

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So as far as the games that have come out

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
In this series

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
We have Point Blank, the first one in 1994

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Or Gun Bullet

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
As it's called

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Point Blank 2, which came out as

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Gun Body

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Ghoul Panic

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Or Baekhyun

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Which was a haunted house theme

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
In 3D graphics instead of the

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Yes, the cat bug level

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Yes, the cat bug level

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Point Blank 3

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Or Gun Ballina

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
And Point Blank DS

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Which was a

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Uno no Tatsujin Gun Bullet Trainer

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
But yeah, it actually

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Like I said, it was an arcade release

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
But then it came out on the Playstation

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Which I've got versions of this that I cannot play

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Because we can't use light guns on modern TVs

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And the Playstation had

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
The arcade mode included

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
But it also had like an RPG mode

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And then it was recreated in Point Blank 2

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
And then

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So basically the very last iteration that came out

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Was in 2006

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
With

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Sorry, Point Blank DS

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Or as I said, Uno no Tatsujin

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Gun Bullet Trainer

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
There you go

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
I really love this game, Point Blank

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Available

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
In the arcades

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
So you know, on main cabinets everywhere

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Or the more ethical way of

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
On the Playstation, even though

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
You're gonna have to get an old TV to play it on

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
It reminds me, where the hell are my gun guns?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I wish they'd bring this back

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Here's what you can do with the Morpheus

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
That's what I want with the Morpheus

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
The Move Controllers

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
They had the gun controllers for that

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
They had Time Crisis

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
They had the Toy Story game on Wii

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Which is a very similar type of thing

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Well they also have it on the Playstation 3

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Yeah, that's right

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Yeah, I'm down with that

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Come on Namco, it's been a

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It's been a long time

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Hell, just bring it to

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Well, I don't know if they could do it on Virtual Console

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
But that'd be awesome on Virtual Console

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Point Blank is the reason the CRT should never truly die

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
YYR wants to point out

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Shameless plug

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
My game, Sharpshooter, on Xbox Live Indie games

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Is basically Point Blank using the analog stick

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Instead of a gun

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Also crappy graphics, but the gameplay is there

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Hey, you know what?

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
YYR kind of planted the seed that led to this whole game jam idea

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
That we're going to get into tonight

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
So I have no problem plugging his stuff

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
YYR

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
YYR is doing the Lord's work

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
In my opinion, between

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Bungie ferret tossing and pixel shits

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
So you know what? Plug away

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Plug away

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Let's take a break

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
We're going to take a quick break, guys

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
But when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Including the

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
List tonight, guys

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
The OLR

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Bobby Blackwolf and other shows on the network

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Are going to be teaming up to prevent

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
To prevent, to present

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Not prevent

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
If we pick the wrong theme, it might prevent it

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
But we are going to present

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
The VOG

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
game jam

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And that is kicking off tonight

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And I know some of you have your Unity windows up

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Ready to go

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
You just need to know the theme

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
So we are going to pick that theme when we come back

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
After a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Live on this Sunday evening

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
December the 21st of 2014

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Episode number 580 of our show

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Already in progress

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
And a very happy

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Whatever it is you celebrate this December

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
It's Hanukkah

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Right now

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
It's Hanukkah

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
It is Hanukkah right now

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
But this week also sees

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
You know, Christmas

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Which is kind of a big deal to some people

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Which is kind of a big deal to some people

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Kwanzaa, what else

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Is Festivus this week?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
When is Festivus? I don't know

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Ramadan, I don't know

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Ramadan is in the middle of the year

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
What is the other holiday I am thinking of

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
This time of year

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Solstice for some people

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Saturnalia, which is today I believe

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
What is the other big one this winter

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
That is the Solstice, Yule

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Hanukkah going on

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Kwanzaa going on

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Boxing Day

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
That's the day after Christmas

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
It's like Black Friday in Canada

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
But instead of trying to kill each other

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
They all push each other and apologize

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Sorry, sorry

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Sorry

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Try to get that crockpot

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Anyway

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Let's move on

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And try to get into

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Some more gaming news

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
And we are going to start off with some rapid

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Fire news, Loki

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Which is kind of cool

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Even though we don't technically have our first

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Female character in a Grand Theft Auto

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Game, unless you can count

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Grand Theft Auto online

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Now, Payday 2 is getting its first

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Female gang member

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
In some new DLC

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Her pseudonym is Clover

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And I guess she is joining

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Joining in on the

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Heist scene

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Also they are going to have a unique weapon

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
Called the Shillelagh weapon

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
The Shillelagh, so is she Irish?

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
She is Irish

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
And there is also a new mission

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I guess called the Diamond Heist

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
They will try to swipe

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I guess you would try to swipe the

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
World's most famous diamond from a

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Heavily guarded museum

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
So the Diamond Heist

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
DLC, that would be $7

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And then

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I guess $5 for the character pack

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
So

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
That's pretty cool

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Definitely looks like

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
She would fit right in with Grand Theft Auto

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Or Payday 2

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I have to check out Payday 2

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I got Payday 1

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I got it free when they had it on there for a little bit

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
I miss chocolate Paydays, those were delicious

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
And then of course

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Grand Theft Auto 5, they kind of do stuff

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
For the holidays every now and then

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I haven't played my game

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Recently yet, but I know they are

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Going to have snow

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
In Los Santos, so you can check that out

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
But they also have Festive Surprise

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Update

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Which is going to add

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
A lot of Christmas and holiday themed

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Things, including

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
They've got brand new weapons

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Also Christmas sweaters

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Had scarves, they had a mask that looks like

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
A gingerbread man that's kind of creepy

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
A penguin mask

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
They are also going to have some

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
New Year's stuff

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Including a fireworks launcher

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Rocket ammo again, just like

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Last year

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Hot Rod, Christmas Rat Loader

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Slam Van

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Oh, proxy mines and a

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Homey Missile Launcher were added to the game as well

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
And of course, all that is free

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
So go check it out

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
And to go with that

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
They've been

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Heists have been promised for Grand Theft Auto Online

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Forever now

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
It was supposed to have been out around the time

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
That Grand Theft Auto Online launched

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And this week they had a new trailer

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
For heists that are going to be coming early

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
2015

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
And it looks pretty awesome

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Definitely going to

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
They even kind of poke fun at it a little bit

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
In there talking about

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Kind of a little bit of a delay

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
But it's showing off different types of missions

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
It can go on

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Breaking people out of jail

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And all sorts of

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Bank heists and that kind of stuff

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Looks pretty cool, should be coming to

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Platforms early next year

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Hopefully sooner than later

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Alright

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Let's see here

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Last but not least

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
More DLC for LittleBigPlanet 3

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I guess it would be for everything

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Because

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
I think those characters are interchangeable

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
But they're going to have

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Frozen characters

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Making their way to

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
LittleBigPlanet

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Oh, hooray

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
They're going to be able to have

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
Elsa, Anna, Sven, Kristoff, and

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Marshmallow in the medicine man skins

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Which can be purchased for

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
$1.99 a piece or in the whole

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Costume pack which would include

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
The exclusive Olaf skin

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
For $5.99

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And they're going to be releasing

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
A winter creator kit for free to go along with that

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Look, I love Disney

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
And I'm sure this is fine

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
I have not seen Frozen

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I don't know how the fuck I never saw it

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
I so rarely get out to movies anymore

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
I just never saw Frozen

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
But the more and more overexposed Frozen gets

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
The less and less I want to see the damn movie

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Because I'm just like, stop

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
There's like an entire

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Archive of Disney everything

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And it's still everything Frozen

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Like half of Disneyland is Frozentown

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Right now

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Why can't it be all like, you know, I don't know

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
Wreck-It Ralph or Big Hero 6

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Yes, exactly

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Exactly

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
Alright, anyhow

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
There is more news coming out of the Jump

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Festival over in Japan

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Including a new trailer for Final Fantasy

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
XV that showed up

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I'm very excited about this game

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Even though, I got to admit, seeing the English

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Voice acting in the game, I'm a little bit worried

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Because it wasn't exactly

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
The best, but well

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
It was better than Destiny's

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So we'll see

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
So this game will be coming out

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
I'm assuming they're trying to make it for holiday

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Next year, especially with the demo coming out

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
So we'll see if it makes it

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
But other notable things in the trailer

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
They showed a Titan summon

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
In the trailer and it looked amazing

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
He was gigantic

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And it looked like he was about to step on one of the guys

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
That was pretty cool

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And they revealed that they're going to have Sid

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
In the game, of course, but this time Sid is a woman

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Named Sydney

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
And Sydney is an engineer

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
And she has a bit of an accent

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
And she introduces herself as Sydney

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
And they call her Sid for short

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Why not?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Anyhow, they

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Also have announced

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Not Square, but Nintendo has announced

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
That Duck Hunt will be coming out to the Wii U

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
Virtual Console

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
We talked about that a while ago

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
I think that news just came out this week

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
That it's officially coming out to the Virtual Console

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
It's dated now

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Oh, they have the date now?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Christmas Day

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
When they were talking about Smash

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
They mentioned Duck Hunt

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
But I don't think they had a date yet

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Well now it has a date

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
So it's December 25th is the day that it's coming out

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
I have no idea how that is going to work

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
With the light gun

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I'm assuming it's using the Wiimote as the controller

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Maybe tapping the gamepad would be kind of cool too

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
But I doubt it

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Neat

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Don't forget, there's also the whole

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Many people remember the Duck Hunt part

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
But it's also the clay pigeon shooter thing

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
They have in there too

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
The original game that the whole thing was based on

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
But anyway

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Also coming out on the 25th

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Of this month

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
The same day

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Shantae and the Pirate's Curse

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Is finally coming to the Wii U

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
And I know some people have been awaiting this game

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
It's been out on the 3DS for a little bit

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
But of course the Wii U version will have

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
HD character portraits

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Off TV play

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Classic Controller Pro

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And Wii U Pro Controller support

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
And he's a very talented individual

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
So I'm sure a lot of people will be checking out Shantae

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
And hopefully enough people buy this game

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
So that the Nintendo

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
E-Shop can say, Shantae, you stay

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Alright

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
And one more little quick announcement here about

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Killer Instinct

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Of course the free to play fighting game on the Xbox

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Riptor

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Is making its way to Killer Instinct this week

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And December

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
17th was the day that Riptor hit the game

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
I guess that was

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
A little bit earlier or whatever

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Anyhow, the new design is similar to the old design

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
For Riptor

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
There you go, some extra little

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
New high definition features on

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Riptor

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
A game which I will certainly check out whenever

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
I finally get around to getting an Xbox One

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
I thought I would buy it this holiday

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
But

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Sadly didn't get one in time

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
For the big holiday

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Alright, Dar Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Rescued the latkes

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Alright

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
They look well done over there

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
They are done, they have to cool off a little bit

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
D-U-N

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Well, first of all for the holidays there are

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Some freebies going on

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
And some happiness to be had

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So first of all

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
The

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
There's a game called

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Enter the Gungeon

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
They are both free on Steam right now

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
And

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Especially in the Fork Parker game

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
You get features like

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Snow Helicopter, Dope Beat

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
Ethics

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Reverse Monetization, Hot Tubs

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Falling

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
And Ropes

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
So there you go

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Next up, Capcom though

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Is going to be delisting

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
Marvel vs. Capcom

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Origins very soon

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
So get it while you can

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
It's going to be taken off the Playstation Network

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
On December 23rd

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And Xbox Live Arcade on December 31st

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Get it while you can

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Right now it's $15

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
And then

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Last but not least, Halfbrick

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Studios is giving away

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Every game in its

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
IOS catalog for free right now

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
That's including Fruit Ninja

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Jetpack Joyride

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Out of Water, Monster Dash, Age of Zombies

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Freebies, get em

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I like free things

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
I do too

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Alright

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Bummer about those games

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Getting delisted but I guess it makes sense

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
With all the licensing and so forth

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Well one thing we don't plan on delisting from this show

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Anytime soon is the chance for you guys

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
To have your say in a segment we call

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
The Fugal Question of the Week

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
You take the words

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Facebook and Google Plus

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And slam them together and you get

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Fugal

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
And we're going to ask our community a question

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
As we do every week

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
And this week has to do with

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
The video game jam

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
That we are starting tonight

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
The video game jam kicking off tonight

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
We want all of our awesome listeners

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
To create something, dammit

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
And so we're asking you

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
What should the theme be?

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
So I don't think Loki has finished his list yet

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
And I don't think Dark Soccer has finished her list yet

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Finished, started, you know, same thing

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Alright

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Bobby hasn't finished his list yet

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I don't know

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
Or maybe he has

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
So we want you guys to have your say

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
On what should be on the list

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
So here it is, some of the answers from Facebook

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
We have some answers here on Facebook

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Such as Hitstun

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Who says three colors

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Should be the theme

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And Hitstun wants to remind us that

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Food and rotation

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Are also things that were submitted

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
On the comments to last week's episode

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I believe boobs was also submitted

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Twice as the theme

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
So you got three colors

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Food and rotation

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
You know why I like three colors?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Because it reminds me of the old school computer monitors

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Although I think technically that was CMYK

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
I think were the colors that it could do

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Black is technically not a color

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Alright

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Let's see, Milton H says

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Theater

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Theater should be the theme

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
Alright we'll see, we'll see

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Fifth Dream suggesting unicorns

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I think I brought that one up earlier in the show

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Unicorns, that would be a lot of fun

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
And Raginator

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
In typical Raginator suggestion

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Says either explosive projectile diarrhea

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Or ginger pubes

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Oh Raginator

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
And we only have one answer

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
One lone answer over on Google Plus

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And it's actdeft suggesting

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
And I like this one

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
How about hats?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Well how about hats?

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
Alright

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
There it is, some of the suggestions from you guys

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
We will see what makes the list here

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
In just a little bit

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
But we have a few more stories for you guys

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Before we get to that list list

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Alright so

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Let's talk a little bit about

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Let's see here

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Steam

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
So the Steam Controller

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Still not out yet

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
But it's been going

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Undergoing several revisions

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
And the newest revision of the Steam Controller

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Actually kind of is unveiled

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Based off of

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
An image that was in the Steam Client Beta

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
And it shows now

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Where the

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
You know how they kind of have those

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Crazy circle

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Touch pad things that were

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
The analog sticks

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I remember last time that they added

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Actually an analog stick to the controller

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Now there's a d-pad where one of those

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Circle pads is

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Or I guess it's still part of the circle pad

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
But there's like some sort of d-pad

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Cross mark on it

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
So I don't know

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
It's more and more becoming like an

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Xbox 360 controller

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
As time progresses

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
It's just slowly

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Evolving into like an Xbox

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
Controller or like a

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
New pro controller or something

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
But uh

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
I don't know

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
It'll be interesting to see

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
What that looks like when it's actually released

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Hell it'll be interesting to see what these

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Scene boxes look like when they're actually released

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Yeah won't it have been a year

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Since they were announced

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
When we finally get around to the CES

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Has it only been a year?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
I think CES was when they announced it

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Whoa why is our outro playing

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Sorry about that it's not over yet

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Be quiet Jason

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
My fault sorry

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
Um so yeah I'm not sure

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Um

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I'm surprised it's only been a year

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
But it's taking

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Taking a long time I guess

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
I don't know

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Definitely less excited about

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Them kind of taking over as like a console

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Though the buzz

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Is kind of dropped off

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Completely

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I think I don't know

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Alright one more story for you guys

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And this has to do with

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
World of Warcraft

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Which I've been playing a little bit thanks to the new

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Expansion and some updates were

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Finally posted this week I was curious when they were

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Going to finally talk about what their first

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Major patch will have for

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Warlords of Draenor and they finally talked a little bit about that

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
But

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
You know it doesn't really matter what else the note said

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Because

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
A lot of people very interested

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
In one of these points that was

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
On the blue post that was made about this

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
About potentially adding

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
A subscription currency

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
And they're comparing this

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
To the Plex currency in EVE Online

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
And what would happen is that you could buy

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
And sell game time tokens

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
For in game gold

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Saying quote our current thought on this is that

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
It would give players a way to use their surplus

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Gold to cover some of their

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Subscription cost while giving players

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Who might have less play time

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
An option for acquiring gold

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
From other players through a legit

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
And secure system

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
So this is going to cause a lot of people to perk up

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
When the world's biggest MMO

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Which a lot of people have been saying should go

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Free to play already

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
When they're talking about possibly

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Funding subscriptions through

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
In game gold

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Now granted it's not going to be like you just pay the gold

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
For the subscription there still has to be that exchange

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Of currency but this will

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
In some ways combat

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
The third party market that's out there

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
For gold buying

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And they tried to do this before with a pet

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
They sold a pet on the marketplace

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
But it was something that would be tradable

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
And you could actually sell it on the market boards

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
And what was interesting is that the market kind of

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Bottomed out on those pets really fast

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And so people bought them and

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
They wouldn't sell for a lot of gold in game

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
So it would be very interesting to see what happens

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Because when you're talking about subscription fees

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I mean that is literally the life blood of a game

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Much different than the pet so it's going to be very interesting

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
To see how that plays out

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
But would you be interested

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
In playing Final Fantasy XI if you could pay for your subscription

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
In Gil?

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
It's hard enough to earn Gil in the game

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I don't know if I'd want to

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
I ain't sure, why not

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
But I don't know if I'd want to do that

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Just drop the subscription down to like

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Five dollars a month or something

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Something ridiculously cheap

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
I don't know, even twelve bucks is not a lot

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
But it's been that for a long time

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Why would they drop it down that low

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
When people are still paying what's out there today

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Why would I pay twelve dollars for that

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
When I can, isn't it like twelve

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
Or fourteen dollars for fourteen

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
I don't know what the subscription fee is

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
I honestly can't remember either

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
It's something around that but like why would I pay

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Twelve when I can pay

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
You can also do like the multi month thing

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
And all that other stuff so

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Yeah

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I don't know

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Alright well it is time ladies and gentlemen

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Get ready because the

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
VOG Jam

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Kicks off right now

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
With a segment that we

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Call Listless

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
And I will explain it to you guys here momentarily

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
But we have to get an old buddy of ours here

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
On the line to play Listless with us

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Tonight so I'm going to hope that he is standing

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
By ready to

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Share the themes and ideas with us

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Hello Bobby are you there

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
I'm here what's up

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
Hey I should have said Atlanta

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Are you there? Did you always say Sacramento

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Or are you guys there?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
How are you doing my friend?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I'm doing good

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Are you excited about the game jam?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
I'm very excited

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Me too, what is exciting you about this in particular?

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
That I actually will have a reason to open up Unity again

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Have you opened up Unity

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Since Flappy Vog?

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Nope

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And why not?

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Time

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And inspiration

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
You're going to have to make time for the

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
And Bobby Blackwolf and do we know if any

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Other shows on the network have joined in on this?

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I don't know

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
But is the video game jam

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
But the nice thing is about those words video game

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
You got V, O, and G in the word

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Haha wink wink nudge nudge right?

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
We created something dammit

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
That's right we want everybody to create something

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Alright so let's go over the rules

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Here's the way it's going to work

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Let me stop the Listless music

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Because we're not ready to get quite into Listless yet

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
But let's go over the rules of the competition

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Well it's not really a competition

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Everybody joins in, it's a participation event

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
But here's the way it works

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
It is open for your submissions

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
Around this central theme

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
And you can make a game in Unity

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
You can make a game in RPG maker

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
You can make a level in LittleBigPlanet

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
You can do a pen and paper game

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
If you want to scan it as a PDF

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
Whatever works

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
We want you to create something dammit

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And the only question we're going to ask

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Is did you try

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Did you try

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
And that's a very subjective question

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And Jamie will be the ultimate judge

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Of the can you try or did you try department

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Because we don't want somebody just sending in

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
Like a piece of paper that says

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
You know frame one frame two

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
You know what I mean

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
You gotta try a little bit with this

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
But we realize everybody has different skill sets

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
So we want you guys to try

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And the theme should tie into

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Whatever it is that you put together

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Lightly or heavily

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
It's up to you

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
You're going to submit your completed

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
Game jams to the following

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Address jam

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
As in grape or jelly

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Jam at vognetwork.com

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
You can send those emails jam

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
At vognetwork.com

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And with a link to your finished product

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Now Bobby vognetwork.com

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Can actually host

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Some of the finished products right Bobby?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Right so what I'm offering

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Is because I've already got kind of a

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Thing in our backend system that we run

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
That I created for VOG

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Is so if your game

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Can be run in a browser

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Which is either Unity Web Player

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Which uses its own plugin

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Or if it's Flash

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Or if it's HTML5

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Something that can be run in a browser

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
And you don't have space for it yourself

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I'm willing to host it

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
On vognetwork.com for you

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
It'll actually appear in our drop down

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Because we have that arcade menu item

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
In our top drop down it'll actually appear in there

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
People can go in there and play it

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And essentially what I'll do

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Is I've created a forum

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
A sub-forum on our very

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Not used forums

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
At vognetwork.com

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Right up near the top about the video game jam

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
And I'll put technical specifications in there

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
As to what you need to send

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
We're also willing to host your file

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
For you

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
So that way you don't have to worry about

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Too much about like a Mega account

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Or a Dropbox account

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
We'll host the file on our servers as well

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
If you just want to distribute the zip file

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And have people install it that way

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
My only

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Rule on this

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And this is not censorship

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
This is because I don't want to have an awkward

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Conversation with our web host

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
That hosts VOG

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
No supreme gore and no supreme

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Sex and nudity

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
You could still do that

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
We're just not gonna host it

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
If you really want to make a porn game

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Go for it and I will totally play your porn game

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
However you just have to host it on your own server

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
So I just want to make that clear

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
We gotta keep all the super porn

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
And the super gore off of our own server

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
But if that's what you want to submit

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
You know what, more power to you

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Just create something dammit

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Alright

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
This is gonna be so much fun I can't wait

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
So there is a forum and people can actually collaborate on that forum

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Like I know Dark Tetsuya in our secret forum

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
He actually put together

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
A brilliant list of all these possible ways you could make a game

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
And Dark Tetsuya if you're listening

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
Go to that new forum right now

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
And like copy paste your post cause it's great

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
So

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Kaijuto says no sex I'm out

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Hold on we didn't say no sex

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
We just said we're not

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
You need to go hook up at someone else's place

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
That's what we're saying

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
You can still submit it

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
I'm just not hosting it on my website

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
That's right you gotta have your hook up

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Somewhere else

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Preem sex and nudity

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
What if we leave off the sour cream and diced tomatoes

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Oh stop oh you

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Fifth Dream says can it be

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Can it just be HTML

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Sure create something dammit

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Is it a game?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Oh there you go

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Oh deadline

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
You have until

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Drum roll please

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
You have until January 11

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Three weeks from tonight

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
To submit your finished product

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Tonight that we will start the evaluation process

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
It's probably gonna go on throughout the week

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
And when I say evaluate just mean

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
We're gonna play your game and we will

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
We're gonna give it a fair review and a mention here

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
On the show but we will be a lot

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Nicer if you're worried that we're gonna

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Make fun of your game or talk negative about your game

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
No that's not what we're here about

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
We are here to promote and encourage people

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
To create so we promise we will

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Only say positive things about your game

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
And keep the whole thing positive

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
We wanna encourage people to create things

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
And we'll live stream some of that

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
And some of the prizes

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
For participating you're gonna get some

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Special VOG network loot

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Which comes with points that you can only get if you

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Participate in this

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
OLR will also be donating

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Five mystery prize packs

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
Five tangible mystery prize packs

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
To random participants

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
And that is it

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
There is not gonna be any judging as far as first

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Second or third place because we just wanna say

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Create something dammit but we may still

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Give out some special acknowledgements

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
As need be

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
So I think I covered everything right Bobby?

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Yeah basically

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
That's pretty much it

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
I would say what like 5 PM Pacific

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Like when our show starts

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Sunday night that's when submissions should be closed

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Yeah 5 Pacific 8 Eastern so we can read them

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
All out on Bobby's show

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
Just like their chatters

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
And you can be in teams that's perfectly

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Fine you can even collaborate on the forums

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
And stuff YYR brought up a good point

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Maybe you know people should do status updates each week

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Just so we can kinda keep tabs on it

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Absolutely Because I could be mean

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And just submit flappy vog

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
If it fits the theme

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
If it fits the theme

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
And the theme I might suggest in a moment here is anything

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But flappy vog

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And preferably no copyrighted

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Works Oh yeah yeah try to stay away

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
From the copyrighted stuff

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
We ban them from the theme submissions

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Now a lot of people asking about

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
What qualifies as supreme gore

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Or sex and

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Tiger class says if the game has colorful language

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Is that allowed? Yes because our shows

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Have colorful language that's fine

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
And as far as supreme gore and sex

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
If your game is called like

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Decapitation corpse fucker

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Then you know it's probably not

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Gonna be okay for the game jam

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
To be hosted on our site

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
We did have decap attack on

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
I know I know look just use

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
We're talking about hosting you can make whatever you want

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
If it's like that it can't be hosted

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
On the site and I will be the

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Supreme dictator on what gets hosted

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Or not I will be like steam

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
And if I say that I'm not

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Gonna host it then I'm not gonna host it

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
And but you can still put it somewhere else

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
But again I want to really

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Encourage you guys to think outside

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Those don't get hung up on the

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Sex and gore good god people

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
There's so much more out there

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
It's just Raginator and if you yeah if you want

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
To do sex and gore go for it just

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
On your own server that's all just

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Get your own dropbox account or whatever so there it is

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
YYR in chat says

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Decapitation corpse fucker theme noted

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Alright

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Well let's talk about how list list works

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Cause it's been it's been quite some time

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Since we played list list here on the show

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
So I know not everybody may have heard this so this is the way it's gonna work

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
You guys listening live

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Get to vote on this as this unfolds

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So here's how it's gonna work

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
We have compiled all of our answers

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
As well as some of the answers we've seen you guys post

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Into a list of three

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Items a piece

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
So each of us will put an item up on the list

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
That's gonna leave us with a list of twelve

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Then comes the very hard part we go around

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
The room and we each remove one

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Item from the list hey it's tough

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
But it's a scientific process it has to be done

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
No host can have their list

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Decimated so if

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
If somebody gets

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
Two answers eliminated from their list the third

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Answer gets immunity

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
So through that process we'll be left with a list of

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Eight that you guys will vote on

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
So right now you're gonna see that pop up on the board

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
If you happen to be listening to the show

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
You're gonna see that pop up on the screen

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
What should the video game jam theme be

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And you can watch the list creation

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
As it unfolds

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
We are gonna let our guest go first tonight

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
With his first answer

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Bobby what is your number three

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Position even though it doesn't really matter for this

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
But we still say three two one what is your number three

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Answer for what should the video game jam

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
Theme be

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Okay well first thing I wanna say is that you have to be

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Logged into vognetwork.com to see

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
The list list pop up

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Oh yes very important thank you

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
So if you're not logged in if you're just anonymous

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
And haven't created an account you're not gonna see it come up

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Thank you

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
My number three answer

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Obviously because of who I am

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Drums or drumming

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I see so a little bit of percussion freaks there

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Drums or drumming

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Just because you have a personal

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
You have a personal interest

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
In this right

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Alright but just keep in mind guys

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Tycho drum masters already been done

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Alright drums or drumming

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Let's put that on the list

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Alright up next tonight

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Loki, Loki what is your

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Number three answer

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Not entirely original

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
But I used a random generator

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
So for some of these

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
But some of them are pretty good

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
So the first one I had was

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Buggy game

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
To win you have to work around the bugs

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Or die trying

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
That was one of my alternates

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
A buggy game

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Interesting

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Can I think of like

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
What was that game

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Rom check fail

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Or something like that

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
No but I think especially in light

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Of the year we've had and what I just complained

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
About at the beginning of the show with Tetris

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
And everything I think it's kind of funny

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
That now the intention would be to make

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
A buggy game I like that that's cute

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Alright a buggy game let's add it to the list

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Alright I'm up next with my

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Number three answer

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
My number three answer tonight

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
You know gosh I've been kind of going back and forth

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
A little bit with the ideas

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
And originally

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
I was going to put one called

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Revive the arcade on the list

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
But the more I was thinking about it

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I was kind of like ah I don't know if that

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I think that might be too specific

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
I'm not sure if everybody would get that so I'm going to

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And chatters this way

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
You guys can't say you didn't have your say of this

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I really like the idea

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Of three colors so I'm going to go ahead and add that

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
To the list because I think that's going to encourage

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
Some retro stuff but not necessarily

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Because there's a lot you could do with three colors

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Concept so I like that idea so much

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I'm going to put it on my list in the number three spot

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Alright DarkSakura ladies

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Last what is your

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Number three answer

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Typography

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Typography okay

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
The font fan in you

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Wants typography so

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Mavis Beacon teaches typography

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
I don't want it to be like

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
A word game

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
I just want typography

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
To be a theme

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
A theme in the game

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Alright I like that let's add it on the list

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Alright there it is the number three answer so far

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
A buggy game three colors and typography

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Alright let's add four more

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
To the list as we get the number two answers

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
Bobby Blackwolf

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Alright so my second theme

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Know when to quit

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Know when to quit

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Interesting again another very

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Kind of vague answer because

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
I don't know why but my mind instantly

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Went to well I don't know if I should even say this

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Because I don't want to steer the game so you know what

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
I'm not even going to say what my mind instantly went to

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I think it's the same place everybody else's would go

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
That's the beauty of it

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
That is the beauty of it you guys

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
See my other answers are very like silly

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
But you guys have these like really in

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Depth thought provoking things where's the dick and

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Fart jokes tonight Rage Nator is going to stop listening

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
You guys alright know when to quit

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
Let's put it up on the list I could have said twat but that's banned

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
That's right that just leads to

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Super porn alright

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Loki let's get

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Your number two answer

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
My number two answer is everything you know is wrong

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Now that song is stuck in my head

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Interesting everything you know is

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Wrong oh gosh

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
So kind of like take you put like a classic game

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
In there but have it play completely different

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Oh I love that idea

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Well that's one don't don't don't uh don't tilt

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
What happens I'm just saying give me an example

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I like that idea

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Oh that's a good one everything you know is wrong

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I like that alright

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
It is on the list

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Next up my answer my number two

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Answer I've decided now I thought about

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
What games do I really want to see

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
What do I want to see people make

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
And the game I would like to see the

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
VOG faithful create

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Is I want to see them make a game called

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Or involving

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Jamie joins the circus

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
What?

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Jamie joins the circus

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
What?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
No

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
But circuses are fun

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
It could be a freak show

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I'm afraid of clowns

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Oh that's a good tidbit to know

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
So maybe Jamie joins the circus

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
To eliminate the clowns who knows

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
They just need to die

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Alright there it is Jamie joins the circus

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
My number two answer and now it is on the board

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Alright DarkSakura

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
What is your number two answer

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
MS Paint

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
MS Paint

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Okay oh boy

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I fear what might happen if uh

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
MS Paint

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I will also throw Corell Dral in there

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
As long as it's the 16

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Color lack of tablet

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Poor drawing

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Alright

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
It's MS Paint

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
MS Paint or Corell Draw I like that one

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Alright it is on the list this is gonna be hard for the

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Elimination round tonight this is gonna be so hard

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Alright uh here we go

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Number one answers from everybody

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Here it is

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
The last one to put on the list Bobby Blackwolf

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I'm torn between two

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Cause I wrote down a bunch

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
But I'm gonna go ahead and say

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Programmer Art

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Programmer Art

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
That's almost like MS Paint

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
But it's a little bit better than MS Paint

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Almost

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
But is it?

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
It's just different I guess

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Alright

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Programmer Art

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Alright the number one answer from Loki

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
What is it

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
See I had two thoughts on this

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
And one thought though is if I did that

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
That that might win

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And I don't want that to win actually

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
But I just would like to

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
I'll keep that as an honorable mention I guess

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But um I'll just stick with also one of the ones

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
That came up on the random generator

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Unwanted Powers

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Unwanted Powers

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Would that be about the Sony Network TV show coming soon?

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
It could be

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
It could be alright

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
We're gonna add that to the list

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Unwanted Powers there it is

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Alright my number one answer

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
You know what you guys enjoyed the Jamie Joins the Circus

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Answer so much

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I thought we would do another one

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Involving some VoG personalities

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
And so my number one answer tonight

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Bobby and the Banhammer

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Is my number one answer

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
What no reaction from Bobby?

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
That's Flappy VoG right?

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
It could be

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
No submitting Flappy VoG though

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Alright there it is on the list

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Bobby and the Banhammer

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Alright here we go

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Dark Sacra

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Last chance for people to have their items on the list

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Dark Sacra what is your number one answer?

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Ink

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Ink

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
Alright you've got a very designed mindset tonight

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Ink is your final answer

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
I do because I like to challenge people to think outside of

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I want to

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Ink

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Specifically black ink

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
Excuse me

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
So do you want to know my

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Answer that I've

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Forgone

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
What was that?

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Oh my god

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
How did we not get President Cat on the list?

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Because it would win

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I don't want it to win

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
You don't want it to be that easy

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Bonus points for throwing in President Cat

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Bonus points for any

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
You know what though? You could do

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
President Cat for any of these other things

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Yeah I was going to say even though this isn't graded

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Bonus points to

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Any OLR, Bobby or

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
VoG references that you work into these games

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
I mean like think of something vague

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Like three colors of typography

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
You could totally do like a President Cat game out of that

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Alright

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
You want to know some of my honorable mentions that I threw out?

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
So I also

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
And I actually used the same random theme generator

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Just because I just clicked it like a thousand times

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
And picked out my favorites

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Losing to win

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Delayed reaction

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Please enter your name

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
And recurring dream

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
And then actually the buggy game

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Was the other one

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Oh funny

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Alright so here it is and be thinking about

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
What is going to be eliminated because it's going to

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Happen it's got to happen it's part of the process

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Y'all the elimination round here is the list as it stands

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Right now

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Drums or drumming? Know when to quit

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Program or art?

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
A buggy game

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Strong, unwanted powers

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Three colors

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Jamie joins the circus

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Bobby and the ban hammer

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Typography, MS Paint or Corel Draw

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
And black ink

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Alright

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Here it is the part none of us want to do

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
But we have to it's science people

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
It's science

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Bobby Black Wolf

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
You know when I'm looking at these

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
I'm trying to get something that's

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Not so straight

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Like a game jam a good game jam theme shouldn't

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Be something that's so straight forward

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Or so linear

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
You know like where it really constrains

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
People so I am going to eliminate Jamie

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Going to the circus

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Thank you but now I have to think of another one

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Oh come on you could have done like

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Just a regular circus theme

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Or something and just put Jamie as a character

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
In it that would have been easy

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Easy come on they did

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Circus on the Atari 2600 boo

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Alright whatever

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
It is stricken from the list

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And you're a jerk alright

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Loki you're next

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Only because I'm not creative enough right now

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
To understand how I'd even incorporate

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
This in there I'm sorry Jamie

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
I'm gonna have to take off typography

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Oh typography

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
And there's some concepts are beyond people

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Hey I'm fine with that

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
You know I gotta admit

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
I kinda wanted to do like a text adventure

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Typography is a tricky one Jamie

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
It's a tricky one

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
I will tell you though I did have an idea

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Of making a game

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Where the landscape is made out of text

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Okay

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Actual words

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Well you could do it in three colors

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Or one of these other ones we'll see

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
That's okay I'm probably gonna stick with my first idea

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Alright cool

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
For now though we've got to eliminate

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
A couple more from the list oh shit it's my turn

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
And I have to ask myself which of these

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Is not worthy of the list

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Um I am going to

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
Eliminate I'm gonna take a

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
I'm gonna do a revenge strike on Bobby

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And I'm gonna take off one of his answers

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Cause again this is one of those ones

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Like most of these I instantly had an idea

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
In my mind but I couldn't think

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Of one for programmer art

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I'm sorry I have to eliminate that from the list Bobby

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
I'm okay with that

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
But we're gonna call that a revenge vote

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Alright what do we have left

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
What do we have left Dark Soccer wants to know what's left

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Loki has a fully intact list

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
But Loki's list is a buggy game

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Everything you know is wrong and unwanted powers

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
And we also have drums or drumming

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
No when to quit

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Three colors, Bobby and the band hammer

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
MS Paint or Corel Draw

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
And black ink

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
I actually

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Am gonna go with everything you know is wrong

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Just because that Weird Al song is stuck in my head

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
And I would make

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I would make a Weird Al game

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
And I would be so distracted so

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Alright well this

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
You know what

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
The list worked out alright

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
This is the nice politically correct

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Positivity list because each

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
Person had one answer removed

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
That's the way we like to see it happen

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
So there it is

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
It is now up to you guys

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
How many people can say they've had their answer removed because of Weird Al?

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Same

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Well for me about that is that there's actually a game

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
That's done by some local Georgia developers

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Who once it comes out I'm gonna have them on my show

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
It's called Default Dan

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
And the entire premise of the game

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Is that it looks like Mario except

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
The enemies are good and the coins

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Kill you

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
It's basically it's everything you know is wrong

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
It's basically that and that's all I would be able to think of

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
If I was working on that theme

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Alright so fair enough fair enough

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
And to be fair also with the programmer art

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
I kind of thought it was really similar to the MS Paint answer

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
And it hit some points out in chat too

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
That makes me think about another idea that I did have to suggest

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
What's that? Power down

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
If you want to see a perfect example of programmer art

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Check out this week's Cooking with Unity

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
This on Monday

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
They made a snowman

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Out of primitives in Unity

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
That is programmer art right there

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Alright well it is in your hands now folks

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
It is answerable

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
You may submit your answers now

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Place your votes now

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
You can vote for your number 1 is your first click

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
And your number 2 is your second click answer

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Your votes are weighted

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Number 1 gets more points than number 2

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
So vote now at live.vognetwork.com

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
And a little later in the show we're going to tabulate it up

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
And reveal the big theme

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
For the first VoG game jam

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
I'm excited I think

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
I think some people's heads are turning already about some of these

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
In fact I think some people are going to be pissed if one of these doesn't win

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
I'm just

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I'm excited I can't wait

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
But again if the theme you like doesn't win

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
I still think you get bonus points

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
For incorporating two or more of these

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Into your jam or any other long running joke

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
So get creative people

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Get creative

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Alright Bobby before I let you go anything else you want to add to this?

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
No good luck

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And I look forward to playing everybody's game

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Alright me too I look forward to it

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Bobby I wish you were here to eat latkes with us

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I wish I was there too

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I'll throw one at you

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Yes I'm throwing you some applesauce right now

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Thanks guys

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Bye my friend take care

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Alright part 2 of this list was to come up

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Shortly in the show

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Place your votes now

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Please vote or die

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Meanwhile we've got some more segments to get back to

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Including the mail bag

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
So Dark Sakura is going to dive into the mail bag

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
She's going to find some emails that she believes are worthy of reading

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
So do my favorite Eddie Izzard quote

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
It's a little sticky

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Alright

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
We have a email

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
A email one singular email

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
One

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Alright

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Or as I learned recently

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
The way to say it in Hebrew is echad

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Alright

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Fair enough

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Hi OLR I wanted to give kudos to the nice

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Bunch of guest talks you've had in recent shows

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
They were very fun and informative

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
If I may I would like to suggest

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Someone to interview on the show

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
YouTube personality

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Ryan Letourneau

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Aka Northern Lion

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
He's Canadian that's all you need to know

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Sign him on and an email

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Anyway Ryan is best known for his long running

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Play series of The Binding of Isaac

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Though he has played through some other

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Notably difficult games such as Europa

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Universalis 4

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Spelunky FTL

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
And XCOM Enemy Unknown

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
On top of that he hosts

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Live streams with friends a few times a week

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
And also offers quick impressions on games

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
That have just released or are still in the works

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Typically more with indies than AAA games

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
I think it would be interesting to know

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
What it's like for Ryan to play video games

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
To entertain others for a living

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
When did it seem

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Viable to attempt this

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
And how risky was it to try

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
What sort of difficulties has he faced nowadays

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Why don't you just interview him dude

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Interview him for us

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
And send us the recording

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Has he faced any criticism

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Over his livelihood were there any unwelcome surprises

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Or cool perks to have come up since he began

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
What would he recommend to others

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Who want to start their own channel

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Yeah I bet he'd answer these questions if he emailed him

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
But in all seriousness

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I appreciate the referral

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
At first I was like well there's a lot of people that do let's play videos

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
What makes

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Kind of what I didn't get from this

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Email was what makes this guy

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Unique

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Why do you want this particular individual on the show

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Because I don't know the guy

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
He sounds like you really like him

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
I'm just curious like what it is

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
That really makes this guy unique

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
But then I did hear in the email

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
It appears he makes a living off doing this

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
So that is unique not everybody can do that

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
So this guy's doing something right

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Well there's more to the email

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
These are just some things I'm curious about

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
And I'm sure OLR can come up with

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Other interesting questions given the opportunity

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Even if Ryan doesn't get on the show

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I want to give my thanks for having my suggestion

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Read on air

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Or can I just bribe you all three

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
You like bribes involving tacos right

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
That'll work but latkes are kind of winning me over tonight

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
From the nasty canasta

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
We need to bust into that pie

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
We need to have a new segment just called pie

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
We do need to bust into that pie

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Let's make it happen

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
We are done with late emails

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
It's going to be a celebratory pie

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
For when we have our

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
VOG game jam theme determined

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Which by the way now is the time where I say

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Last call for listless votes

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Get your butt logged into the site

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
And vote

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Last call for those votes

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
Alright

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
It's after the mailbag segment

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
You have to give your FU

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
DarkSakura your FUs of the week

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Um

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
FU to the lingering bits of the plague

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
That I had last week

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
That make my lungs hurt

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Getting out of my wonderful codeine syrup

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
And um

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
FU to not having a

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Tron pinball table

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Those are pretty rad

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I played one a couple days ago

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Nice

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
I saw on Facebook

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I saw them just for you Rob

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I was wondering where the hell you were that had a table

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
It was a private party right

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Why wasn't I invited

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
It's a private party

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
I'm awesome

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
And then we went to the pinball party

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
I know like 20 people that work at little cat

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Why wasn't I invited

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I should have been somebody's date

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Next year you'll be my plus 2

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
Awesome

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
Loki your FU of the week

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Um

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Just to go back to what I was saying before

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
FU to telltale games for

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
I'm sorry not telltale

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Travelers tales

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Fuck them

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
For their really shitty flight controls

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
And lego marvel super heroes

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I swear to god

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
That game would have been awesome

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
But that right there kind of really pisses

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
Me off

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Thankfully the races

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
Because it's a game meant for kids

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Are really fucking easy

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Uh the driving races

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
But uh yeah fuck those flight controls

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
They're fucking terrible

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Alright my FU of the week

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
First one goes to the fact that I wasn't invited to the low cap party

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
No

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
The second FU of the week is the fact that

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Of um

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Of all the trainers in our company

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
All of them

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
I'm the only one that has to work next week

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
And I have a class

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Monday Tuesday

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
No not Wednesday

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Monday Tuesday next week

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I have to teach and then I have to teach the next week too

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Every day that isn't technically a holiday

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
With the new year involved

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
But you know what at least I like my job

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
But still it always sucks when you have to work

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
So that's awesome

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Dar soccer is complaining that she has to work on Christmas

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
But you're Jewish

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Alright

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Alright anyway they can't hear you

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
You're not on mic

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
She's too busy slicing up this amazing pie

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
That I can't wait to dig into

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
So let's do a couple more stories

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Then we're going to reveal the listless winner

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
And then we're going to get into your calls

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
So let's do it

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Uh Loki

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
So Humble Bundle everybody is pretty much familiar with that website

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
The process behind it

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
You buy a game for whatever price you want

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
And part of that money goes to charities

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
And part of it goes to devs

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
And Humble Tip and all that fun stuff

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Well they've raised a lot of money since launching that site

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Back in May 2010

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Over 50 million dollars

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
For charity since that first sale

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
And they've even

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Raised was it 100 million dollars

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Towards developers

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
So that's pretty awesome

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
And um

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
They're saying the very first Humble Bundle

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Raised $400,000 for charity

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
$200,000 each for

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
EFF and Child's Play

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
And um

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Just

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
That's just amazing

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
All this money going to these awesome charities

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
And um

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Hell even

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
They're not the only site out there now

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Now they have all these other bundles that go to

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Different charities

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
I'm kind of curious to see how much money

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
You know sites are kind of injecting

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
To these great causes

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
So uh awesome

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Although I gotta say though

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I'm starting to run out of gains

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
To purchase on their site because

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
A lot of them seem to be repeating

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
And I have a lot of leftover Steam keys

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
I don't need anymore copies of Fez

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Please no more copies of Fez

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Alright

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
And one more story I have for you guys

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
And this is

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
This is tough to report on

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
But in the same way it shows the

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Good side of the gaming community

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
And the last official news story

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I wanted to have because you know it's

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Been kind of a rough year in some ways in the gaming

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
World and there's been a lot of

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Very heated

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Intense and sometimes

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
Downright personal debate that's been going

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
On out there so I like

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
It when gamers can band together for something

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
That's good

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
And um

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Unfortunately the situation is awful

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
The situation is not so good

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
And uh it has to do with Final Fantasy

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
14 but I just want to say

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Because I know you're all going to go fanboy

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
But hold on I'd be reporting on this even if it wasn't

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Final Fantasy 14 this is just kind of the first

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Big case that we've seen in Final Fantasy

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
14 and this has to do with a

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Reddit post that was posted on the Final Fantasy

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Subreddit last night where

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
A free company leader

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Put a new permanent rank on a friend

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
That they were informed was going to be

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Passing away literally within

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Hours and there was a little

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Screenshot that was posted over to Imgur

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
That noted that

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Codex Valda

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
And I hope I said that name right Codex Valda

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Would be the immortal siren in this

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Particular free company

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
And that alone

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Is pretty cool but what really happened next

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Was really amazing and

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
You know the player

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Behind the character

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Only 29 years old

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
And passed away the other night

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Codex unfortunately he did pass away due to

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Complications from renal failure which is another

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Word for kidney failure

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
And it was one of those things where they knew

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
He needed a new kidney and it was

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Kind of a surprise that this happened

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I mean because

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Yeah they had like a donor lined up

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
You know this was just one of those

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
And I think they even said one in a

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Million situations where unfortunately

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
It was that one in a million

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
So Codex did unfortunately

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Pass away but the side of this

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Is good I mean that part's obviously not good

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
And very tragic but the side of this

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
That's really great is that

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
This really just created this

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Spontaneous outpouring of

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Support in the game and it started with

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
One or two people just kneeling

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
With their characters in front of the house

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
And staying logged in and kneeling

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
And then that slowly grew on the Gilgamesh

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Server too I think they said it was up to 80 people

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
At one point and more and then it was spilling

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Onto other servers in the same

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Housing district people kneeling and being respectful

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
And I saw some people

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Took out their fairies as scholars

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
And actually spelled out the guy's name

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Codex with their fairies as a bit

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Of a tribute and I just thought

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
You know I was like this is

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
The type of stuff why

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I love games and why

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
I love MMOs was that the community

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
You know put all their shit aside

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
About you know so and so doesn't heal

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Fast enough in a dungeon or whatever put all

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
That stuff aside to take a moment out

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
To recognize one of

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Their own community that was gone way too

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Soon and I just you know and this this story

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Has been gaining a lot of steam on like you know

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Kotaku did a story on it and so it's

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Spreading to other places as well and I just

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Thought this is a great example

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Of the community recognizing

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
One of their own and I do hope the final fantasy

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
14 developers I know they're busy with the

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Japanese fan fest right now I hope the

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
14 developers kind of notice this and maybe

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Will consider doing an NPC

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Tribute and I realize you can't

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Do a tribute for each and every person

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
That played final fantasy 14

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
That happens to pass away

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Just like they can't do that in wow or whatever

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
But for particularly invested people

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
And for particularly people

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
That seems very tied into the community

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Where the community sort of you know

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Spontaneously comes together for something

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Like this I really hope that the 14 developers

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Do some type of official

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Recognition of support for codex

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
And you know

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
I'm so sorry for codex's friends

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
And families that this happened but

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Just know that there are literally

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Hundreds and thousands

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
And thousands now of

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
People who are remembering this

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Particular player because you know

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
What we all love this game as

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Well anyway

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Let's see fifth dream in chat says there was a

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Get together tonight on mcgarthomer I put off some

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Fireworks I'm very sad I missed it

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
I had to do this show though but I'm glad

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I could at least mention it on the show

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Act F says the gaming community

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Can be amazing when it tries to

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
And dungeon buster says indeed

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
And I think that is a fantastic note

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
To end on but I do want to point

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Out as joan under matt also says the guy's real

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Name was ty I have a friend who

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Played games with him for several years

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
So a moment of

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
Silence please for codex

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000

Theme for the game jam I'm just waiting

Didn't quite make it I'm going to reveal that

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
As well so I'm just waiting

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
For those answers to pop in

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Which they should any minute

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Oh this is embarrassing do I have to reload

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Maybe I do

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
This all is automated

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Behind the scenes

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
No I don't want you to resend data that you already

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Hold on I'm going to try this one more time

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
I think I remember something about you have to be on the page

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
For a minute before it pops in

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I might need to

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Actually make it live

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Set it on fire

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Uh oh

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Did you break it? No I didn't break it

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Hold on I'm going to try making it live again

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Just not answer but we'll see if that fixes it

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
It's been so long since I've done this

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
That I forget how to make it show me the

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
I just I know what the winner was

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
New theme everything's broken

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Hey a buggy game wins

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I do know which one was on top

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
But I was hoping to name the other two as well

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Bobby says I broke it

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Re-check answerable I think

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Alright we're going to make this answerable again

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Hold on

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Let's see what happens

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
This is going to be so funny you guys

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
There it is fine

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
It's going to be so funny

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Number three answer

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
The number three theme

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Just missed it, missed it by that much

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
MS Paint or Corel Draw

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Very close

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Number two answer

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Bobby and the Ban Hammer

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Missed it by that much

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
And the number one

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
The winner this

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Year or maybe we'll do this every six months

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Who knows

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
This first

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
VOG game jam's theme will be

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
And how appropriate

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
A buggy game

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Is the winner

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
A buggy game is going to be the theme

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
There it is

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
A buggy game

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
The theme for the first ever

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
VOG game jam

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
How appropriate when I broke

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
The whole fucking website trying to see the answer

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
So there it is

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Alright

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Thank you everybody for voting and participating

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Wait to see what you guys

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Come up with and again

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Just especially after the rant

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I went on earlier this evening

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
And everything else that's been going on in the gaming industry

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
I think this is a perfect fit, I really do

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
A buggy game

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Yeah, new earth defense force game

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Oh is that, that's what you

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Really wanted

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
That was your way of getting copyright in there without it

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
Alright

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Nice

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
You can't copyright killing chain insects

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Alright

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
I would never do that, maybe

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Alright, anyhow

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Let's see, and some folks talking

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
About what they were going to do for Bobby and the

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Banhammer, Act F says

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
A card game similar to Cards Against Humanity

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
But trying to get a card

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
Or comment to get you banned

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Oh man, we should

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
I should have let people submit for the top

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Three, that would have been awesome to see, but we'll see

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
Alright, a buggy game

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
There it is

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Chat says, all the bugs

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
And Hitstun says, I hope you guys like

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Exploitable game mechanics

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Yeah, that's going to be hard programming that in

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
But, we'll see

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
I don't know, when I hear

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
A buggy game, I think of

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Like, actual bugs

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Like, why can't a buggy game be like

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
Why can't it be Frog Fractions?

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Is this Frog Fractions 2?

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
This was all a ruse for Frog Fractions 2

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Oops

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Alright, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
So there we go

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
VXJ6V says, number 2 can be done in the spring

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
Well, you know what? It depends on

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
How the participation level is

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
This time, so again, when you're finished

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
With your theme of

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
A buggy game

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
You're going to submit that to Jam

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
At OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
The deadline is January 11th

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Not that I'm going to stop you from

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
Submitting after that date

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
And I don't think Bobby would be opposed to

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Putting things on the site that come in after the date

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
However, if you want to earn one of the participation

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Prizes, if you want to earn one of the loot

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
And you want to earn that official recognition

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
You've got to be done by January

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
11th. Get to work

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
A buggy game

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Alright, once again, the Skype line is open

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Last minute stories, Loki?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Oh, I haven't even been looking

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
You're too excited about the buggy game

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
I've seen some good examples

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
Of some really funny buggy ideas

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Like another game jam didn't do this

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Did they?

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
I don't think so, but no

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
I still like to think, even if another game jam

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Did it, we would still be the first

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
That says, you can create

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Anything, you're not limited to

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Unity, you can do anything

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
You want. Yeah, usually game jams

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
Will be like, you program it

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
You can use Unity, you can use whatever

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
But it has to be a program

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
You can't just make a card game

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Or a board game, or whatever

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
No, I've seen some good examples

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Of just, usually in the

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Unity subreddit

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Where they'll be showing

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
There's this one guy who actually does

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
A lot of development on there

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
He posts updates and stuff

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Of things he's working on

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
And the last couple of ones that he put up there

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Is some bugs that he had in the game

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
That he coded something slightly wrong

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
And it was a hilarious result

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
Kind of gives me ideas

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Alright, well our phone lines

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Are not really lighting up

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
So, here's me stretching

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Trying to fill time

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
Let me go to the Twitter

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I'm trying to eat this pie, you guys are making me

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Fill time, I'm not able to eat this pie

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
This upsets me

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Anyway, I'm going to go to Twitter

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Yeah, tweet the thing

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Let's see, Eric RPG

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Sent a tweet with a link

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Let me pull up this link and see what this is all about

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Again, if you want to call us on Skype

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Or our telephone number

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Let's see

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
We got sent a story by Eric RPG

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
To a story on

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Siliconera, which says

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Queen Victoria blasts through Martian mines

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
In Rock Boshers DX

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
On PS4 and PS Vita

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
So this is a game

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
That has, I guess, cross-buy

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
And cross-save support

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
A 10-stick puzzle shooter set on Mars

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Starring Queen Victoria

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
That is pretty fucking random

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
But I like that, I like games that are really random

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
It stylizes

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
If you were playing it on a ZX Spectrum

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I like stylistic games

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
That's really cool

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Alright, now our phones are lighting up, it was just a little delayed

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Let's get to it

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Hey guys, it's Jason

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Hey Jason, wow, are you at the office?

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I was going to say, that's a huge background back there

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Oh my gosh, I didn't realize you were back in San Francisco

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
When are you coming to visit?

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
That's a good question

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
I've actually been super busy

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
Obviously, I haven't been talking about it with you at all

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
I understand, I understand

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Well, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
There was a topic that you guys were talking about earlier

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
And Go figured that as soon as I

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Clicked, I hit

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
A hit call, the particular topic

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Completely slipped my mind

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
The actual game

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Oh, Tetris

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Tetris, Tetris on the PS4

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Like, I've been in these

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
Kind of conversations before, and I always

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Am completely motivated to chime in

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Because, like, I just

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
I'm not a

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Full time developer, I never have been

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
And so, it's like, I don't

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Always have the way of really explaining these things

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
But, being

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Who I am, being the person

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Knowing what I know

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
And being in these kinds of situations, like, I have to

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Defend developers

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Because

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Delaying the game to get it right

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Like, development

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Ah

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
You never know what you need

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Until you don't have it

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
You never know what you need until you've lost it

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
There's an old thing in IT

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Where if everything works great, you don't even know

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
You have assisted men, it's when things go wrong

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
But you're, you know, breathing down their neck

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Because things have to get taken care of

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
All of those kinds of things

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Extend to development as well

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Like, what was

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
This is maybe a bad example for Tetris

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
But what would have happened

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
What happens when any game is delayed

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
People don't defend developers

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
They jump down the throats of

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Especially in the case of Tetris

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
This game isn't difficult

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
No

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
The design and theory and everything behind Tetris isn't difficult

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
But that doesn't mean that

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Implementations

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
First game of its kind on its generation

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
New tools

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
New libraries, new engines

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
Yes, Tetris is a simple shaped game

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
But there is so much more detail

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
That goes into it

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Which is literally what the act of development is

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
And it just

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
I just don't like deriding developers

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
I know I've done it myself

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I just don't like deriding developers

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Period

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I understand that to a point, Jason

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
And I think sometimes when we have issues with games

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
A lot of times it's not even necessarily

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
The people working on the front lines

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Who are the quote unquote problem

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
And I think in a case where

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
A game gets released buggy

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Specifically like Assassin's Creed

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
And that whole debacle

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
I really think that is just pressure

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Where the developers needed more time

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
To make it happen

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
And they were denied from up above

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Absolutely

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
That is a really significantly good example

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Because that was just

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Blatant and absurd

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
The issue is, Jason

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
It's the same company

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
And now it's Tetris

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
And so that's showing me a pattern

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
And that's kind of worrisome

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
And I do understand that when games get delayed

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Everybody gets really pissed off

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
But at the same time, you know, in Miyamoto

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Or somebody had said this a long time ago

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
If a game gets delayed, if it's good

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
People will never remember that it was delayed

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
And I think to some extent

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
That really is true

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
And I know at least we here at OLR

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
At least I like to think so

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Whatever the delay is

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
But after seeing so much crap like this happen

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Like when The Witcher 3 got delayed a few weeks ago

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
It was what, like the second delay

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
You know what, I don't want Witcher 3 coming out

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
And being broken

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
If they have to delay it two more months to get it right

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Then cool, do it

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
I was gonna say exactly the same thing

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
That Bonds did

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Half-Life 2 was delayed significantly

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
At least two or three times

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And along the way there was also the legendary

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
E3 hack that leaked significant

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Half-Life 2 content to everybody

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
And you can guarantee this is why

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
They don't even announce Half-Life 3

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
They'll announce it when it

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
No, seriously, they're gonna announce it when it's done

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
And ready to go

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
That's why when we joke around that Gabe needs to come out

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
At E3 and go

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
Half-Life 3 is on Steam right now and drop the mic

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
That's no joke

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
That's how it's gonna fucking go down

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Absolutely

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Yeah, I just, it's kind of

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
The way that it was being presented

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
The way that people have learned

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
To talk about these kinds of incidents

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
That just, they're just great on me

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Because, you know, blame

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Blame the developers, blame the testers

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
They're the go-to

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Because they are the face of the game

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Shy of like the CEO of the company

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Or something like that

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
But nowhere in that discussion at the start of the show

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Did anything like businessy

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Get discussed

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
It was the fault of the developers

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Period when it was being discussed

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
And that's the kind of stuff

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
That's the part of it that really disappoints me

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Is that that is the go-to

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Vocabulary for everybody to talk about

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
When there's a good chance that

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
A ton of developers or testers

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
Had brought up saying

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
These things are problems

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
But for business, political

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
Possibly technical people

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Downplaying things

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Oh, three frames gone isn't bad?

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Well, that person has never heard of speed running before

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
And knows the technical obsession

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
With the level that people go to

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
If I gave the impression that I was solely placing

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Blame on the developers for the Tetris debacle

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Then I apologize

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
But I think what I kind of meant to say

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Is that the development on this game clearly wasn't finished

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Whose fault is that?

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
Probably management's

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
And more so that I

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
It's not even really the developers that I blame

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
It's a lack

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Of QA

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
And I think that's an okay thing to say

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
There's a complete lack of QA

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Or this would have been caught

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
It's not something that happens on level 5

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
On Tuesdays

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
When you're maybe connected on a shoddy Comcast connection

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
When this happens

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
No, it happens to everybody

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
If you just play a normal game

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
And that's where I'm like

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
The funny thing is I can actually kind of see

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I can envision that some of those same arguments

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Happen business-wise

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
It's Tetris, we know this franchise

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
We've done it before

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Why are these problems problems?

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Because the tools don't remain

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
The same between generations

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
And even years

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Two games of an iteration

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
In the same generation things can change entirely

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
I actually don't get so bothered by the whole

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
But it's Tetris, it should be easy to do

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
Type of argument

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
It's Tetris, but it's Tetris on the PS4

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
And there's certain expectations

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Of what PS4 games should have in them

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Especially with this whole

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Social era we live in

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
And game sharing and all this stuff

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
There's

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Hiccups are killing me

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
There's certain expectations

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Where I don't think it's as simple as

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
You just put the Game Boy version of Tetris on the PS4

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
I think there is a certain

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Greater expectation than that

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
I'm actually not going to be

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
One of those people that says, oh it's just Tetris

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
But I am going to say, oh it's just a

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
QA department

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Well that's halfway there

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
So I guess I can give you at least that much

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
Alright, fair enough. Hey, you thinking about

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
participating in the game jam?

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Because it doesn't have to just be

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Like a classically programmed game

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
That opens the door for me, like I said

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
I've never been a full time programmer

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
There were a couple of concepts that did kind of cross my eye

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And my number one vote

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Matched the winner, so

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
There are definitely ideas

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
But with traveling back home

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
And all that kind of stuff, we'll see

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
I certainly would like to, but we'll see

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
I understand, well you know the golden rule is

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Even if it's not the totally fleshed out game you wanted to build in Unity

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Create something, dammit

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Alright, Jason, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in some more calls

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
But take care buddy, we miss you

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
You too, thank you

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.000
By the way you guys, Jason has an epic fucking beard growing on his face now

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
I saw that beard when it was a little bit

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
But getting to see that on Skype via the video, that is epic

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
That is an epic beard he's got there

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Alright

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:56.000
I'm going to leave it open for a couple minutes to see if something can get through here

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
I did see at least one other caller trying to get through

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
So I want to give them another chance to try to get through

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And we will see what happens

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Oh, I do see another call coming through

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Let's get to it

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Let's do Zaku there

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Zaku, you are really loud, get a little ways away from the mic

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
And tell us what's on your mind

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Oh, nothing much, just celebrating

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
The end of my birthday

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
And the start of the 30s for me

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Well, happy freaking birthday

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
My god, you're 30 years old

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Yep, 30, the big 3-0

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
How old were you when you first started listening to this show?

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Oh, I'd say about 19

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Oh my god

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
I can't, I can't, I quit

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
We're done

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
The last OLR everybody

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Have fun with that game jam

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
We won't be here when it's done

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Happy birthday, Zaku

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Yep

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
You know what, 30s aren't as bad as everybody says it is

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
30s is actually kind of awesome

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Everything's better

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
And less stupid

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
Everything's better

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
It's like Logan's run where after a certain age

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
The light in the palm of your hand

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Blinks and you have to take that ride

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Into that other magical place

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Obviously

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Where they kill you off at that certain point

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
But I digress

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
I guess the point is

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
To the young folks

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I'm pretty much a dinosaur

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
You know, senior citizen at that point

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Oh, whatever, you know what, the thing they don't realize

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Is that sex is better in your 30s

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
TMI, I don't care

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Speak for yourself

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Oh wow

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
TMI, I don't care

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I don't care

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Alright, well I don't think you called in

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Just to talk about your birthday

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
What else is on your mind, my friend?

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Just catching up on the gaming

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
That I'm trying to do right now

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Apparently

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Recently

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
Dovetail, the folks who

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
You know, the folks who brought us Train Simulator

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
They recently released

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Microsoft Flight Simulator on Steam

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
And apparently

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
As much as I, you know

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
The fact that I managed to jump on it a few months before

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
That thing was announced

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
It's like, whether or not

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
There's any life left

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
In that whole flight sim market

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
And I mean, after the

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
You know, the past few months

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
After getting hooked on it

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
And spending dozens of dollars on

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Third party add-ons for it

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Mainly like commercial airliners

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
I mean, is it

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Is, you know, the point is

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Whether or not there's still room

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
For something like that

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Given the fact that it's almost like

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Ten years removed from where

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
From the height of the game

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Um, I think

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
Especially with flight sims

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
There's gonna kind of always be an audience

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
For that, you know, and they did

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
They just released that game on Steam

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Like, just came out, but you know

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
If you look at Steam and the simulator

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Like, okay, let me tell you

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Let me tell you a little story

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
There's another simulator game that I see all the time

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
On Steam, and I'm always sitting there going

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
People actually play this game

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
And it's Farming Simulator

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Is the name of the game, okay, Farming Simulator

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Okay, right, and it's up there all the time

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Okay, so when I'm at E3

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
And we're doing the whole thing where it's like

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
We're gonna live, you know, cover E3

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Ask us questions on Twitter, da da da da da

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
I get a question from, like, Germany

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Out of the blue, from some person

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
Because I posted a random picture

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Of me in front of something funny

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
At the Farming Simulator booth, and the guy was like

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
You have to tell me everything about Farming Simulator

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
What's the game like, is it playable?

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
What's in the game? You gotta tell me everything about Farming Simulator

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
You'd be surprised, there's a lot of people that are interested in that game

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Fuck, Farming Simulator, really?

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
It's on, like, console, Maximum Games

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Is the one that's been distributing that

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
And I seriously talked to the guy that's the head of the company

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
When I was working at my old job

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
And he would tell me stories about

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
How well that game's selling

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
It's, like, their best-selling game

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
So there are people that eat that up

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
And look at all those other simulators that they have on Steam

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
There's, like, a ton of them

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
But, yeah, I mean, they have

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
DCS World, which has, like, the

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
Fighter jet simulator

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Which is essentially, like, a chore

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Not to belittle

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
The fact that certain flight sim

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
Add-ons, like, you try starting

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Up a triple seven from

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Dark, from cold to dark

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
All the way up to the point where it's taxing

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
I think it's, like, I need

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Clip notes for that

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Zaku, I think there still absolutely is an audience for Flight Simulator

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
I mean, you express interest in it

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
And you're just 30 years old

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
You're still young, there's still room for

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Tons of Flight Simulator games

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Even though maybe the audience is a little different

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Is what it is

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Because I remember a day when I was younger

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
When I was 19 years old or what have you

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I remember when Flight Simulator games

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
Were oftentimes kind of the benchmark

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
For new hardware

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Like, when new things would come out on PCs

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
It always seemed to be, like, a Flight Simulator game

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
Was one of the first things to come out

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
To really show off the graphics

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
And the capabilities of the systems

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
And I think that's changed Zaku

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
I think Flight Simulator games

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Have turned more into people that are

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
Enthused about

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Amateur flight or what have you

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Or as the enthusiasts of the genre

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Right, and the thing is

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
You're talking about

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
FSX, which is almost a decade old

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
That still runs on DirectX 9

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Meanwhile, you have

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
X-Plane, the latest version

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
X-Plane 10, which

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
Apparently, it's a little slightly better

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
In terms of graphics, but

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
The only thing that's close to

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
You know, to actually matching

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
You know, a modern

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
The only thing close to a modern day

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Flight Simulator right now is PrepR3D

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
And that's a professional

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
Version of FSX that

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Lockheed Martin puts out for real pilots

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
But I guess

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
With Dovetail now at the helm

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
Whatever future Flight Simulator

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Game they're going to make is obviously

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
Not going to be called Flight Simulator

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
But it's going to be, in essence, a spiritual

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
Successor of that franchise

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
And hopefully it will bring the graphics into

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
This decade of

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
You know, modern computing where you could

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Just take advantage

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Completely advantage of a modern PC

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Instead of just doing everything in a single

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Core, you take

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
You exploit multi-core

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
And high-end video processing

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
To essentially

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
And more importantly, 64-bit

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
So that you can actually

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
You know, you can run a game like FSX

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Which is very intensive for

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
A ten-year-old game which is not optimized

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
And you could essentially run it

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Like, you know, you could take advantage of new hardware

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
That's available today

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Right

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Yeah, and hopefully

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
As I said, it was on sale

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
For five bucks a couple of days ago

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
When it first came out

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
I'm kind of skeptical on getting

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Re-buying it again on Steam because apparently

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
You can't activate your existing keys on it

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
You have to buy the game again

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Nice

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
I'm not too sure, other than the fact

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
That you can now play online

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Multiplayer again

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
It's a wait-and-see approach in terms of

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
How it will actually

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
Perform with the existing

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Third-party add-ons that I have on it

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
Well, you know, I do

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
I do want to see the game in motion

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
I hope some people are livestreaming it

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Because I do want to see, I haven't really looked at a

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Flight simulator game in a while and I bet

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
I bet they're still very

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Pretty to look at and so forth

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Yeah, if you tweak the

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
I mean, with FSX right now

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
You could definitely tweak a lot of the files

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
There are many ways to make it look good on

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
On modern PCs for

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
For almost a ten-year-old game

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Even like DirectX 10, which wasn't

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Officially supported, it was a preview

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Back then, there are plugins that allow you to fix

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
The DirectX 10 issues

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
That were rampant in FSX

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
And essentially looks a lot better than

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Than running it on, you know,

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
DX9

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
I guess there has been folks

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Streaming on Twitch for

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
FSX, but until I get a new

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Video card that allows me to stream through

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Nvidia, I'm probably gonna

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Yeah, it'll be a while before I

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
Do any livestreaming of that

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Fair enough, alright my friend, I gotta let you go

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
But thank you for the FYI, Flight Simulators

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
They're out there, check them out

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
Alright, take care my friend

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Have a good one, you too, bye

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
And congrats on hitting 30

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Even though you've been listening to this show since you were 19

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
Which means I'm

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Also that old

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Alright, Rob

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
What? Deal with it

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
No, actually, you know, and like

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
I told Zaku, actually my 30s have been

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Pretty fucking awesome, and considering the fact

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
That I had, uh

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
You know, I was really, really sick when I was 29

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
It actually made me very thankful to turn 30

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
So, you know, alright

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
1877 game OLR, username on

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, now the phones are

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Lighting up, they were slow earlier, but now it's

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
They just fill right up

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Uh, this is YYR

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
Hi Aaron, how are you?

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
Hey YYR, how you doing?

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
Well, I'm

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Trying to formulate an idea

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
For this new game jam

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Thing that we've all laid out

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Tonight

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
So far the best idea I have

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Going off Jason's

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Phone call a little bit ago

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Was, uh, come up with

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
A plan to develop

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
A game in five weeks

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Yeah

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
And don't test it

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
And then release it

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I mean, it works for Ubisoft, right?

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
That's right, so the game

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
It's gonna be meta, it's gonna be a game about

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Making a game

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Uh, oh, well

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Well now we have another thing entirely

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
No, he's saying basically

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
To develop a game, don't test it

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Okay, I thought that was his idea

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Okay, in the game you're gonna make a game

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Okay, nevermind, I was going too meta with it

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Okay, I get it

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Wow, you're really thinking about this

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
I am, I am, well you know what, there's a part of me

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Not that I want to give away everything I'm doing

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
But I'm actually thinking of going with the very literal

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Interpretation of the word and doing a game about

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Bugs

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
Not giving Loki

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Not giving Loki his Earth Defense Force game

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
But I don't see why you can't do a game about bugs

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
Well, I mean, I'll admit

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
You know, as soon as the theme was chosen

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
I turned to my fiance

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Sitting on the couch next to me and I said

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Alright, let's do something with spiders

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
But, uh, I don't know if I'm

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
Actually gonna go with spiders

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
I just, I would

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Love to do something that was both figurative

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
And literal

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
I also don't want to go beyond my

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Means, you know, one

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
Person, three weeks

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
And a keyboard

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
I mean, basically though

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Three weeks does sound like a lot

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
I'll warn anybody, I mean

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
First of all, I want to super encourage

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
Everyone, as many people as

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
Possible to get in on this

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
But I also want to warn people that

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Game development really is

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
A time sink, it will take

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Longer than you would expect to do

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Well, pretty much anything

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
So don't wait for

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Two and a half weeks and then say

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Alright, yeah, let's throw something to get now

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
The way I figure it's always three times longer

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
So just plan something for a week

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
And it'll take you three weeks

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Also, one big reason

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
We're starting it now is that we know a lot of people

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Have time off for the holidays

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Now granted, a lot of you spend time with family

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
But there's also a lot of you that have a lot of free time right now

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
So we really want to start it before the holidays

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
And then run it really all the way through

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
The holiday period, so

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Yeah, this is probably the best time of year to do it

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
I think, I mean, any time's a great time

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
To develop a game, but this is probably

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
As good as we could do as far as

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Time for everyone

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Absolutely, as many of you guys

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Listening as possible, whether you're

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
Listening live on the podcast, anything

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
Go ahead and make something, because

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
You're going to enjoy it

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
I think you will

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
And some folks in chat saying

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Let's see, they're talking about the meaning of the word bugs

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
And Darth Tetsuya says, so you can do a game about

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Bugs, that I think I can work with

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
However you interpret the rules

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
You can do anything you want

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
Around that theme of buggy game

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
How do you interpret that?

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Because, I don't know, maybe you want to do a game about

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Amish people and have it be about a horse and buggy

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
You could do it!

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
You know, SSJ100 Matt did bring

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
That up earlier in chat

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
Amish Racer 2000

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Why not? Come on

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
You could do a game with horses and buggies

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
Look, I just gave somebody a concept right there

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Alright, now I've got to think of something new

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
Perfect

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Alright, well YYRA, I'm so excited

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
I think we're done here

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
I'm so excited to see what you come up with

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Alright

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
I'm sorry, you've broken up a little bit, what happened?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I just wanted to say I am so excited to see what you come up with

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Oh, yeah, well I'm excited too

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
Because I'll tell you, at this point my slate is blank

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
I really have no idea

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
I'm with you

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
You have just as much of an idea as I do

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Alright

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Well, I've got to think too

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
I will come up with something

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Me too, I think I know how I'm going to do it

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
I just need to know what story I'm going to tell, so we'll see

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Alright

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
I've got some serious thought into this over the next day or two

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Alright, good luck my friend, take care

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
I'm very excited, and I'm looking forward to

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
what everyone else puts out as well

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
So, yeah, pick up your keyboards

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
or game controllers or whatever you're using

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
and get cracking, this is going to be great

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Do it, create something dammit

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Yup

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Alright, take care my friend

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Enjoy your weekend, your holidays

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
and everything else

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
You too

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Take care, bye

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
I know I'm going to enjoy the rest of those latkes

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
that are sitting over there waiting for me to eat

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
I'm so excited

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Alright, oh man, you filled me so, like even Alan

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
messaged me earlier, do I even need to make dinner tonight

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
or have you pretty much filled up on crap

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
and I'm like, I filled up on crap

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
but it was really good crap

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
I'm taking some of the cookies with me

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
unless Becky has some when I get to our house

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Alright, well

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
I do want to thank everybody

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
who called in tonight, if you did not call in

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
and you were trying to get in

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
and you didn't get through, I'm very sorry

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
but you will just need to

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
send us an email, participate at

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
orangelaunchedredo.com or you can send us a tweet

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
or what have you, but really this week guys

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
it's time to get working

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
on your games, create something dammit

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
in the first VOG game jam

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
your forum is apparently already up Loki

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
so for people to discuss

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Yeah, I posted even there's some

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
tools that I found on one of these

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
game jam tip sites, so I

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
just copied and pasted that

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Awesome, awesome, I'm really gonna

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
try to spend time to do this

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
I'm the type that will procrastinate

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Come up with an idea quick

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
because that could take a while

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
It could, it could, alright well

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
that is about gonna do it, Loki checking in

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
with you for any last minute stories

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Alright, well then

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
that brings us to the end of the show

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Thank you guys so much for listening

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
Thank you for supporting independent radio

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
All we ask

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
you know, tell a friend or two about the show

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
you know, we don't have this big budget

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
we're not IGN

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
we can't put a big video out there that everybody sees

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
of our buggy Tetris experience, we can only

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
tell you about it, so please

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
tell a friend or five about the show and help spread the word

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
about independent broadcasting, and most of all

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
support independent broadcasting

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
there's so many hard working people

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
out there creating amazing

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
content, I was gonna mention this real quick

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
as soon as I

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
as I'm in my outro, a buggy podcast

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
No, sorry

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
It's kinda cool, there's a British company

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
apparently Liberty Games that made

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
