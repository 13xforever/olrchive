00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight we interview Max, Philip, and Jeffrey of Cooking with Unity, a web series of YouTube videos that teaches you how to create video games using Unity step by step in detail. We'll take your questions live and chat along with your comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this, our 579th episode, December the 14th, 2014, live as we are every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts. Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Maybe I should just go by Madame Spanky, I don't know.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You do have a very hoarse voice tonight, I don't mean like a...

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What happened? Are you okay?

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I had the plague.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, I thought maybe you went to a New Kids on the Block concert and were screaming really loud or something.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, everyone at Locat has had the plague and I starved it off for a solid two to three weeks and then it finally got me and then when it got me, it really freaking got me.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, as long as you don't give it to us here in the studio.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You know, that's so rude. You should be like, oh, I hope you feel better and then go take some vitamins. I'm kidding.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
People always say that and I'm just always like, you know what, maybe it just always strikes me as a little bit odd.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because all I've been hearing is, don't get me sick, don't get me sick. I'm like, don't you want me to feel better?

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Of course we want you to feel better, but you know...

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm not getting you sick.

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I mean, either you're going to feel better or you're going to die. There's no like...

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know, death might sometimes make you feel better. No, I'm kidding.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But it turned into an upper respiratory infection, so...

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yikes.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, I took codeine today.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, you know what'll fix you right up is some coffee. That's what you need.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm drinking some, but I can't taste it.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, good luck, but...

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It tastes vaguely like coldies.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If we hear a little less from you tonight, this is why, because you're obviously...

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Even when you walked in here, you were sign languaging me, basically.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Or that, or you just really wanted to flip me off for something I did. I don't know.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
All right. And they're even asking in chat there, does Jamie need to be turned up a little bit?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Probably, but she's just also a little... She's just quiet, because...

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I could try talking like this.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey, what's up, bitches?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're fine. Your audio's fine. You're just a little... You're a little weak tonight.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, he's not weak tonight. He's here, strongest ever. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I eat too much too fast, I think.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Uh-oh.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I hope you don't get the other kind of sick.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, no, no, no. I skipped lunch today, because I was working on the show, rolling stuff,

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and then I was just tired and I was gonna take a nap because of the kids.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And so I didn't bother to get up from the couch to make lunch.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And so then I just got the bacon ultimate cheeseburger. I know, a very light meal.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And then I just ate that really fast, and I'm like, oh, wow. I'm really full now.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, that hurt. That hurt.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A power meal to get you through the show.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm just uncomfortably full, but that's all right.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate with our show,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
because, again, we tape live on Sunday nights at vognetwork.com.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can join us in the chat, live.vognetwork.com.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Black Wolf, Bobby Black Wolf, our pal who's on before us, saying,

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Jamie channeling her inner Travis Donovan with that what's up, bitches.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Our good pal from under Sedation Live, which is Saturdays here.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So there you go.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's see, DarkSakura, you wonder. I just have to say this comment because you're talking about this.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I wonder if I should try making a webcomic in Unity.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, why not? Maybe you should.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I want to do it dating sim style, you know, with image, image, image,

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
because I love Homestuck, how it's got all the animations and whatnot,

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
but I hate how all the text is at the bottom.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You have to scroll through 50 million piles of, you know, stuff.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, if you make it, you can put it at the top.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They do have, I have seen in the assets store,

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
they did have something for, like, dating sim style game,

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
like a system already built out, you know, for that.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, but I've had the idea of doing it that way for a little bit, so.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, let's talk about why our chatters are talking about Unity tonight,

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
because we do have some special guests coming on the show in about 45 minutes here.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Loki, I'm going to have you talk about these guys,

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because this is actually a show that you've referenced quite a bit

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
in the making of your own game that you're trying to make right now,

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
amongst, you know, New Job, amongst Raising Kids,

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
amongst Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes. So, yeah, so I don't even remember how I came across them.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sure probably just looking up information about Unity on YouTube

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and stuff like that, just kind of trying to learn wherever.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I found the show, and it was just very informative, very entertaining.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You know, that's incredibly important, and it's just fun to listen to.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Like, even, you know, while I'm working on my stuff and programming stuff,

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I just love listening to them, and just...

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Does this show have a name?

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes, I'm getting there. Hold on.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, sorry, you're building anticipation.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, anyway, so, yes, well, the show is Cooking with Unity,

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and hosted by Maximilien Moreau,

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and, of course, he has Jeffrey and Phil on the show as well.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Occasionally, sometimes they're there, sometimes they're not.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But they do a show twice weekly, or originally it was twice weekly,

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
on Monday, and then also on Thursdays.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thursdays tends to be, like, a 2D episode.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So they'll do, for example, two different games kind of at the same time.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, one, I think they were working on, like, was it last week?

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It was, like, a rail shooter.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So kind of like House of the Dead, I guess, if you want to,

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
you know, something like that, for the 3D show.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And then on the 2D show, they're working on a project called Fight Go Right,

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
which is kind of like a beat-em-up, you know, 2D arcade game,

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
like Ninja Turtles or, you know, the Simpsons arcade, or Final Fight,

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
or something like that.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And so, kind of the two different styles in there.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Plus, now Max has been doing a show in the mornings called, you know,

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Breakfast with Unity, which actually started off about,

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
it'd be like 10 to 15 minute shows.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I've been noticing they've been getting longer and longer,

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
which is cool, because he goes over kind of quick little tips on-

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's okay, when the Orange Launch Radio podcast started,

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
it was supposed to be 45 minutes.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And now-

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oops.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But yes, absolutely entertaining.

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's kind of cool though is they interact with the people that are listening

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
or watching the show live, and so you can ask questions about things,

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you can make suggestions on stuff,

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and it's just kind of nice to have that live feedback, you know.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And also, you know, he invites everyone on every show, you know,

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
hey, if you have a question about something,

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
or you just, you know, need some help on something,

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
just send me an email and, you know, I'll help you out.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And it's really nice.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And I love their attitude, you know, I can't profess to know as much about Unity,

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm not as into, quote unquote, the programming side,

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
but I love that these guys, at the end of their videos,

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
they talk about, you know, in their descriptions too,

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
they say, you know, go download Unity and make a game.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You know, that's very much kind of like their message,

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
is that more people should, you know, basically be making games.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And I love that, because that's kind of the type of thing

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I've always said about podcasting,

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
because I've had people come to me and say,

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
well, Rob, I want to start my own video game podcast,

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
but I don't want you to be mad or see me as competition,

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
because I know you've got a video game podcast.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm like, it's not, no, no, no, it's not like that.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I want you to make your, that's like the ultimate compliment

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
if somebody goes and creates their own podcast.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We need more indie voices out there.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Go forth and podcast, please.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's a great thing.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So I love that they bring that kind of message to games.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We need more people making games.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I love that.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I haven't caught up on all the back videos I missed,

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
because I came into it a little bit late, but...

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There's a lot. I had no idea where to begin.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah, they've got like a couple series,

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
highly recommend that they've done.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
One recently, which I just think is fantastic,

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and I'm probably going to go look at it a bunch

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
when I'm actually getting to publishing,

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
but it's from scratch to publish,

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
where they literally make a game,

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and I even have it on my phone, you know, it's fun,

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
because my phone actually tries to play it on its own sometimes,

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
because it's possessed.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But they start, and they make a game from scratch,

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and he goes through all the steps to even getting it published

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
on iOS, on the Android store.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I noticed that.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Windows store, yeah.

164
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It got into a lot of like, not just here's how you program,

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but here's how, you know, all that other stuff

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that sometimes a programmer doesn't want to have to get involved with,

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
but you do.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah, so it was very informative,

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
and then he's got like some other series.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He did one which was like a Star Fox style game.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think I saw one, a pinball in there.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
One that I looked at, because it was short,

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and it was their little featured video on their page,

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
was the one where they made the game in three minutes.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It was kind of like the reverse kaboom,

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
where you don't try to catch the bombs, you try to avoid them.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Instead, it was such a like,

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
it kind of gets back into what we were talking about, you know,

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
and it's kind of been almost a running theme on this show

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
over the past month ever since YYR unveiled pixel sheds here on,

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
yes, that was the game he made,

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and I think he did that in Unity, right?

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know if he's used their videos,

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but he used Unity to make that very Atari 2600 game,

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and we've talked about how sometimes it's just the idea.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Like, you don't necessarily need all these like gung-ho

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Final Fantasy-esque graphics,

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
although that's a nice thing for games to have.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You don't necessarily need that.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So, I mean, this game that they did in three minutes,

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and they're like, time me, and the whole thing,

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
was a stupidly simple concept.

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I mean that in a complimentary way

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
that was executed quickly and easily,

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
so it was really cool,

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and it just kind of went to show like,

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
oh yeah, you really can do this if you're just willing to,

198
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
you know, put a little time in learning it.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, they will be on the show 45 minutes, give or take.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We'll have them on the show,

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and you can ask your questions live,

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
if you happen to be listening,

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Before we get there, though,

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to the Cooking with Unity guys,

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
which, quick plug for their site, of course,

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
if you want to look at their videos,

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you know, when you're done with the show, of course,

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
cookingwithunity.com just takes you right to their YouTube page.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, they also have a Patreon,

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and also, I believe, YouTube slash pushypixels

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
is their channel, I want to say.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alright, we'll let them plug all their stuff they want to plug.

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They got Twitters and all that stuff.

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We'll get that a little later on,

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but let's get into, we got to talk about video gaming,

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and what's been going on,

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
because this week was a little less crazy than last week.

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Obviously, last week was a very atypical week

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
for a December news pattern with the PlayStation experience going on

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and the game awards happening.

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We had a lot of news come in last week,

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
so things have started to slow down a little bit this week,

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
but there's still quite a bit going on,

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
and so I want to talk about this big one to start,

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
because this is something that's outside of even just gaming.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is something that has started with something you've heard about

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
on the nightly news.

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You've heard about it everywhere,

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and that is about the hack that took place of Sony Pictures.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The two are not tied together, Sony Pictures and PlayStation,

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
other than the obvious partnership,

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
because at the end of the day, it's the same parent company,

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
so a lot of the stuff they pitch to you on the PlayStation Network

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
are movies made by Sony Pictures, right?

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But that's, I mean, just because Sony Pictures got hacked,

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
it didn't really affect the PlayStation side of things at all,

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
but certainly this is the second time in less than five years

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
that Sony has had to deal with a major, major hacking issue,

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
and there's been a lot of stuff exposed because of this hack,

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and some of that has to do with very tabloid sorts of stuff,

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
like what did this director say in this confidential email

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
about Angelina Jolie and so forth,

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but it's also been very interesting into how Hollywood really works,

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and it's really been eye-opening for a lot of people,

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
not always in a positive way.

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And certainly there's an ethical debate to be had about that,

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
about should we be analyzing all this stuff that came out of a hack,

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
but I don't really want to have that debate today

250
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
because I can't really talk about should it or should it not have happened.

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It did happen, and now all this stuff is out there for us to sort of analyze,

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and us turning our back to it and saying,

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
La-la-la, it didn't happen is not going to necessarily make it go away, right?

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So that all being said, one of the big things that's catching a lot of gamers' attention

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is this talk of is Sony about to make a Super Mario Bros. movie,

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and how the fuck does that even work when Super Mario Bros. is a Nintendo thing?

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Nintendo has said we're never doing a movie again

258
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
because that John Leguizamo Bob Hoskins movie was so bad,

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Dennis Hopper, right, in that too.

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It was so, so bad we're never doing a movie again.

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
How does it even work when Nintendo teams up with their quote-unquote enemy to make a movie?

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Now quickly, if you haven't heard about this,

263
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
some of the information that came out of the Sony Pictures hack

264
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
were some emails that went back and forth between producer Avi Arad

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to Sony studio chief Amy Pascal.

266
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And in the emails, which were dated, like this is recent.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This is not like, this is a project that happened four years ago that got shelved,

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
this email was from October 23rd.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And the producer said, I am the proud father of Mario the Animated Film.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And he sent pictures with Shigeru Miyamoto, Satoru Iwata,

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
and one of them actually said, happy CEO, let's get together, it's the mother lode.

272
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So essentially this producer went over to Japan, had a meeting with the Nintendo higher-ups,

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and apparently, and we were having to kind of read between the lines a little bit,

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
you know, again, consider that this information, we're not supposed to know.

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We are not supposed to know this, but it got out.

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So take it with a huge grain of salt.

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But apparently what happened, the Sony producer went over there,

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
or the producer went over there and pitched the movie.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's supposed to be an animated film.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, I was going to say, I could see that as an animated film.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Which also makes a little more sense as to why Nintendo might be on board,

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
because it wouldn't necessarily be like a live action thing.

283
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Nintendo has been experimenting a little bit with the animated film.

284
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
They had the Pikmin movies that showed up at that Japanese film festival

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that Miyamoto actually was a big part of.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So certainly Nintendo's dipping their toe in the water of these animated films.

287
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But I'm sure a lot of people are asking, well, why Sony?

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But, well, why not Sony?

289
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Because they're a motion picture studio.

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They've got, you know, an animation studio.

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Nintendo doesn't have an animation studio.

292
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I mean, so your choices are, I think, I mean, I don't know if they're limited,

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
but if you're looking at really big animation studios,

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I mean, you've got Pixar and Sony Pictures Animation, DreamWorks Animation,

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and there's a lot of other smaller ones out there.

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But, I mean, it makes sense.

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I mean, look at, and also kind of look at how they treated their properties.

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You know, Sony, I mean, they've got a Ratchet and Clank movie coming out

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
that looks pretty awesome.

300
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And I don't know about the, what was it, the other PlayStation 3 title

301
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
that they made an animated movie, whatever.

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That one wasn't that great,

303
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
but the source of material wasn't that great to begin with either.

304
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me jump in here in the chat room

305
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
because a lot of people saying this in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

306
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and Rama starting us off saying,

307
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Sony Pictures is technically different from SCEI,

308
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
so it's plausible for this to happen.

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And, yeah, I think that's the important thing is that even though at the end of the day

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
you have Sony, and then these are different divisions of Sony,

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
that agreement that Nintendo may or may not have with Sony Pictures

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
doesn't necessarily have to carry over into PlayStation.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Like, and I'm sure that is very explicitly stated in the contract.

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This does not mean that Mario's going to show up on the PlayStation,

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
so get those fanboy images out of your head.

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're not going to have Super Mario the Game,

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
or Super Mario the Movie the Game.

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What was it called when they did it with Street Fighter II?

319
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The movie was, the game was so bad.

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It was Street Fighter the Movie the Game.

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Street Fighter the Movie the Game.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're not going to have Super Mario Brothers the Movie the Game

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
show up on the PlayStation 4.

324
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's not going to happen.

325
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And I bet Nintendo has that all very clamped.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There would be no, and Nintendo probably has 100% control over the merchandise

327
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
because merchandising is something Nintendo really wants to get into now,

328
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
probably especially after what's going on with all this amiibo crap that we get in later.

329
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I got to say it.

330
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Merchandising.

331
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Right?

332
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So I'm sure the agreement is very much this is about a movie and only a movie.

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And, you know, but as they say in the email, it's the mother lode.

334
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I mean, an animated Super Mario Brothers movie,

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I mean, there's an instant audience for that.

336
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You don't even need to see a trailer for it.

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You really don't.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Heavenly Sword was the title I was thinking of,

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
because they did a direct-to-video animated movie and it was just crap,

340
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
but Heavenly Sword wasn't that great to begin with.

341
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah.

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Directed to you in chat saying,

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
who was behind Final Fantasy The Spirits Within?

344
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Was that Sony?

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That was Sony.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah, but Square Pictures was a part of that.

347
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That was a division that Square created and faded away real quick.

348
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
A company that I wish would really do more stuff,

349
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
because it wasn't bad.

350
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It was just not Final Fantasy.

351
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's just they kind of it's as much Final Fantasy as was like,

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't know, the Castlevania game.

353
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Honestly, there was a lot in that movie that was kind of ahead of its time,

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
but we digress here a little bit.

355
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So what do you guys think when you hear about a Super Mario Brothers animated movie?

356
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Do you think this is something that should happen,

357
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
or let's stop with these video games?

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Video games should be video games.

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Movies should be movies.

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
When they cross over, it rarely does well.

361
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, no, I think it's fine.

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I mean, especially if it's animated.

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That'd be fine, because it's when you do the live-action stuff

364
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
that doesn't really make any sense.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Look at how many Pokémon movies have we had.

366
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I mean, seriously, it's based off a game, so there's no problems there.

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't see why this would be a problem.

368
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Animal Crossing movie, I don't know.

369
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I didn't see it, but I heard it wasn't bad.

370
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
My biggest concern about a Mario movie would be the voice of Mario

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
would be so, so important, because Mario, I mean, Mario has a very distinctive voice.

372
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Obviously, Charles Martin.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Of course, it's going to be still him in the movie.

374
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
But Charles Martinet never says anything besides the wahoo, yahoo, and all those voices.

375
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Mario doesn't really have...

376
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He'll just get Troy Baker to do it.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He does everybody, so that's fine. He can do it.

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But I can imagine that Charles Martinet is going to be asked to voice the entire movie.

379
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
With all due respect to the fantabulous man that Charles Martinet is,

380
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I would just think that Sony would probably want to barter for some name-recognizable talent

381
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
as painful as that is for a lot of you guys to hear.

382
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's the reality of the harsh business in Hollywood.

383
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Look at some of those other emails about Andrew Garfield and Spider-Man for what I'm talking about.

384
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think it'll be fine.

385
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Just like, you know, there are people that can do the Mario voice that aren't him.

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Right, and I do think, well, Captain Lou, rest in peace, also pulled off an amazing Mario.

387
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It was a different Mario, but it was an amazing, memorable Mario that was a big part of our childhood.

388
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So to say that nobody else besides Charles Martinet can portray Mario would not exactly be right,

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
because Captain Lou had a different, but awesome Mario.

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But that's where we get into the tricky thing, because if we bring in another talent,

391
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
then should it be different from the Mario we know in the games?

392
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Here's the tricky thing is...

393
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Then is it really based off the game?

394
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Here's the tricky thing is when you bring in talent and they're better than the source material.

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Perfect example.

396
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Heath Ledger as the Joker.

397
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No one's going to be able to compare to Jack Nicklaus' Joker.

398
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He was fantastic, and then...

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I mean, the guy that played golf.

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Jack Nicholson.

401
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Jack Nicholson, whatever, yes.

402
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The golf guy was good, too.

403
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But anyways, Jack Nicholson, you know, hey, I'm a fan of both, so that's fine.

404
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So, you know, no one can compare to him.

405
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Heath Ledger, that's a terrible casting.

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And then they saw it and they're like, oh, never mind.

407
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No one's going to be able to...

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Now when, you know, the next, you know, was it the Batman Superman movie comes out, you know,

409
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
now it's like, I think there's going to be another Joker in there.

410
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Or, I don't know, Suicide Squad.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah, the new Joker's in Suicide Squad, and that, I mean, not to digress into a movie podcast,

412
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
but I mean, they're lining up some huge talent for that movie.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They're talking about Will Smith in that movie.

414
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I don't know if it's fan wank or whatever, but there's been talk about Oprah playing Amanda...

415
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What's... Jamie, who's the head of the Suicide Squad?

416
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, it's DC. I mean, who's the head of the Suicide Squad? Amanda?

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This is why I give you this flat look, like, the fuck do I read DC? No.

418
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Okay, well they're talking about putting Oprah Winfrey in the damn movie, and I'm like,

419
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
is she really going to be... But then the comic book movies are huge.

420
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Oprah was in The Color Purple.

421
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, I know, I know.

422
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She was awesome in The Color Purple.

423
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
If there was going to be a real-life Suicide Squad run by, like, you know, a powerful woman,

424
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
then yes, Oprah I could see doing that.

425
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But anyway, and then who's the...

426
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is the guy's name that got to play the Joker?

427
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Jared Leto.

428
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Who I think all the way back to... Wasn't he on My So-Called Life?

429
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Wasn't that where he started?

430
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't remember, but...

431
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Or one of those, like, 90s shows or something.

432
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And then he did the band. He had that band for a while, and now he's doing this.

433
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And so he's going to be the Joker, and now you're right.

434
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Everybody's going to inevitably compare him to...

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Heath Ledger.

436
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Heath Ledger.

437
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Same with Batman. I mean, Batman, they've been doing that, you know, comparing...

438
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's true.

439
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's just, it's a different take on it, and honestly...

440
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't know, I think...

441
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Amanda Waller, thank you.

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So that's why I'm not seeing if they come out with...

443
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If he's going to have a different voice in the movie.

444
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's not a big deal.

445
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't think it's going to...

446
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
As long as it works, I don't have a problem with it.

447
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yeah.

448
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If it's really weird, then yeah, that's going to be...

449
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay.

450
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What other quick thought on this, and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.

451
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This could be interesting.

452
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I mean, who knows what's going to happen because of the hack now.

453
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Mario may get cold feet and pull out of this all together, and the hack may have fucked this movie.

454
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I mean, who knows?

455
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
No, I doubt it.

456
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Movies end up in development hell all the time.

457
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Just because this conversation happened doesn't mean the movie was ever, ever going to end up really being a thing.

458
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But it does open this interesting door.

459
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I mean, if Mario's going to end up being an animated thing, you know, every Friday on the Super Mario Brothers Super Show...

460
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What did they have every Friday?

461
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The Zelda cartoon.

462
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Screw that show Monday through Thursday. It was all about Friday with no disrespect to Captain Lou.

463
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But it really was all about Fridays and the Zelda cartoon.

464
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And again, creating that very distinctive character that wasn't necessarily the same one from the games.

465
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Excuse me, princess.

466
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
When has that ever been uttered in one of the games?

467
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
They really should reference that.

468
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
They really should, actually.

469
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But anyway, you can see the point I'm getting to.

470
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
If a Nintendo Mario movie comes out, could Sony soon make a Zelda movie?

471
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Is an animated Zelda movie the type of thing you guys would want to see?

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Or do we need to see IGN's April Fools trailer from six years ago expanded into a full movie?

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Both.

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You want both.

475
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Also, speaking of IGN, I would also like to see their series. What was it? The Hogwarts Detective series or whatever that they had?

476
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Where it was like a cop drama set in the Harry Potter world. Yeah, I'd totally be down for that, too.

477
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Alan Alchemy in our chat room confirming that Jared Little's big break was my so-called life.

478
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Thank god I haven't forgot my 90s pop culture trivia. Phew.

479
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I could still kick butt in a game of Trivial Pursuit.

480
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Some various people in chat talking about Amanda Waller and the different portrayals.

481
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
We have Brad from Pod Culture coming right out and saying, fuck the new 52.

482
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
So, not always popular, the reboot there.

483
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
So anyway, and Akuma JP singing along.

484
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Friday, Friday, gotta get down.

485
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
No. Stop.

486
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You know what? She did a sequel song called Saturday and it was actually kind of good.

487
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
She milked that 15 minutes of fame.

488
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Well, the Saturday one is totally just making fun of Friday, but it was pretty funny.

489
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Back to the movie chat. We get on tangents sometimes on the show. Back to the movie chat.

490
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What you don't say?

491
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Dark Sakura, Mario animated movies, is that something you'd be down for?

492
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I think the Robitussin face that I just made sort of applies to that, too.

493
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
So no, that was a very much do not want or it's nope o'clock face.

494
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It might be good for me, but I don't really want it.

495
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'd be down with a Mario movie as long as it's set in like the Super Mario RPG universe,

496
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
because they had some pretty awesome characters for that.

497
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
All right.

498
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I do kind of miss the old Super Show cartoon, because that was fun.

499
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Actually, the ones I liked were the Saturday morning ones that was set in the Mario world.

500
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh yeah, the later ones, right?

501
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yeah, those were good. Those were good. I like those.

502
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
All right, well, we will maybe see what comes of this, because my other big question,

503
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
would it be traditional cell animation like the old cartoons,

504
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
or would it be like that more modern CGI, Viva Pinata looking thing?

505
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Well, I was actually going to say if they did a Zelda one,

506
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
it would have to be a bit more serious and not the 80s cartoon style.

507
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Right. Viva Pinata. There's a franchise that Microsoft really wanted to force down our throats

508
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
into becoming popular. It just didn't happen.

509
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'd like to see something the way that you know how Street Fighter IV is done,

510
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
with that sort of 3D yet 2D-esque.

511
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Kind of that jump out at you animation?

512
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Right, where it's got the appearance of cell shading, but not quite.

513
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
A comic book in motion.

514
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah.

515
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That's kind of what that looks like to me.

516
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Or like Borderlands.

517
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

518
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So, was it a cartoon shading with an outline?

519
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS, basically.

520
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I just think that it would lend itself well to Zelda.

521
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
All right.

522
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
If it was going to be an animated thing.

523
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Some quick comments from chat to wrap this all up,

524
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and then we'll get into our gaming weeks.

525
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Because it is a show where every gamer has a voice,

526
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and some of the voices in chat right now.

527
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Raginator says,

528
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Hell, I'll take any Zelda movie, live-action or animated, so long as it's good.

529
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Rama saying a live-action Super Mario Brothers movie would be great,

530
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
provided it's his fantasy setting like Willow.

531
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And some comments on Viva Pinata.

532
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
YYR saying Viva Pinata was actually a pretty good game.

533
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Magma Lemur. I don't think I've seen that before.

534
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Magma Lemur.

535
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Magma Lemur, sorry.

536
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Saying Viva Pinata was a fine game.

537
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And if I remember correctly,

538
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I want to say it's one of the free games of gold games that's coming up pretty soon.

539
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I think it was a while ago.

540
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
A while ago.

541
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Oh yeah, because I didn't download it.

542
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm like, Viva Pinata.

543
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I played it when it came out.

544
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
All right.

545
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks.

546
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We've got plenty more news to get to,

547
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
but let's talk about our gaming weeks first

548
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week

549
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
to help you establish, like where's our head at

550
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
when we're talking about all these games this week?

551
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
What games have been filling our brains this week?

552
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you.

553
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I've been playing a lot of Dragon Age.

554
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh yes.

555
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
A lot.

556
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
A lot.

557
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I hit 40 hours on my starting my second playthrough.

558
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And she's still in the Hinterlands.

559
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
No, I'm not.

560
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Actually, I keep going back to the Hinterlands whenever I need elf root.

561
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Although I did find, of all places,

562
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
a really good place to get elf root and blood lotus

563
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
in the western approach in the desert.

564
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Why 40 hours?

565
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What has grabbed you about this game for 40 hours?

566
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm just running around doing shit.

567
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Really.

568
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm MMOing it.

569
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It keeps you a busy bee?

570
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm MMOing the lawn.

571
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So Dragon Age, I almost want to say Dragon Age Origins,

572
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
but Dragon Age Inquisition is like an MMO without the other people.

573
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Exactly.

574
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That makes it perfect.

575
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm serious.

576
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Because then I can just have, because I run it through Steam so I can screen shot it.

577
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:54,000
After this playthrough though, I'm going to go in and set up the cinematic tools.

578
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So I can go in and take pretty screen caps and whatnot.

579
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
But I've been doing this odd thing where because I've been delirious on coding for the last couple of days,

580
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I've been creating my own dialogue in my head.

581
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So now my Inquisitor is just this utter airhead who's like, everyone's like,

582
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
we're dying, we're being killed.

583
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
She's like, look, I found blood lotus.

584
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Help me gather.

585
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But the quillbacks, blood lotus.

586
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Is that like when Alan and I watch the nightly news and we mute it

587
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and then we just talk instead of the anchors when they're saying to each other?

588
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That sounds awesome.

589
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
We're really good at that game, by the way.

590
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I've actually just been tempted to make a stupid video.

591
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I've been tempted to make a stupid Tumblr just for the weird dialogue

592
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
that goes on in my head during that game.

593
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I've already started putting some on my regular Tumblr and I'm like, I can't.

594
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I don't know.

595
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
D-A-I-M-H. Dragon Age in my head.

596
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Well, actually a few someones have said, are you going to do Dragon LoL?

597
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Like you do LoL Effect?

598
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And I'm like, fuck no.

599
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Do you know how long it takes me just to think of something for Mass Effect?

600
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Haven't you talked about, you were mentioning to me the other day,

601
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
you were trying to do some broadcasting with it, but it was kind of bumpy.

602
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
No, no, no. I wasn't trying to do broadcasting.

603
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Raginator kept wanting to watch me play.

604
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh.

605
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And it worked fine a couple of times, but every other time it's like,

606
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
freeze the game and it would eventually unfreeze and I could save this last time.

607
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Here I was freshly on a dose of Coding Cough syrup

608
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and when I am on opiates, I will switch from moods like you will not believe.

609
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And I was like, I can't, I can't, I got to turn off the game.

610
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It better save. My last save corrupted. What am I going to do?

611
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And then it worked.

612
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And then I ended up playing like another fucking 15 minutes.

613
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That's probably the whole conflict between the fact that Dragon Age is not really a Steam game

614
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
because it's all on Origin.

615
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And then I was like, but wait, I play this game so I don't have to play with other people.

616
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I don't want anyone to watch. Watch me run around in circles.

617
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Well, turn off the broadcasting then.

618
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Well, no, I'm gonna, I'm just going to deny him in the future.

619
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But like half the thing that I do is like, can I jump up on this cliff?

620
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I found half the shit I found by trying to climb rocks.

621
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I just keep, I keep my broadcast channel open all the time.

622
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I don't care. I still try to do that.

623
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If somebody wants to watch me stream when I'm playing, then that's fine.

624
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I am not an exhibitionist like you, Rob.

625
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Well, but I always say, don't expect me to entertain you.

626
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Like if I do a Twitch stream, then I'm going to be on cam and make witty commentary.

627
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But if you're going to tap in and watch me playing something on Steam,

628
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
that's what you're going to see is me playing something on Steam.

629
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm not, you know, I'm usually trying to relax and do that.

630
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
But at any rate, my big thing lately is I'm just really running around and exploring.

631
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You know, I want to, I'm actually customizing my castle right now, which is like,

632
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
oh, we've got this big guy out of here with red shit growing out of his face.

633
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
We got to stop him or he's going to destroy the world.

634
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And I'm like, blood Lotus.

635
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
All hail Skyhold. It is the best castle ever.

636
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I will decorate it with all the things.

637
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Can you quickly tell us about that funny thing we were talking about on Steam chat the other day,

638
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
the staff of sad or whatever it was called.

639
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The sad weapon.

640
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Whoa.

641
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I have, I have slayed dark soccer with this sad weapon.

642
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It's like Mark something mace.

643
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
It's a banana nailed to a stick.

644
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You find a schematic for it and it requires three sad splinters to make it.

645
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
It is a banana nailed to a stick.

646
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So I've decided that maybe if, if, you know,

647
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
when a gamer X happens this next year,

648
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm actually thinking about doing some kind of dwarf cosplay because I'm short and you know,

649
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
buxom and I have decided that if I cosplay a dwarf,

650
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
she's going to carry around the sad weapon.

651
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Nice.

652
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
The banana on a stick.

653
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The question is who will get it.

654
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But I bet that there'll be a lot of people probably that actually get that.

655
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
So I also have a slight regret and that's putting a Varick in the scout meal

656
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
because he needs to show off his, his carpeted chest,

657
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
his carpeted dwarven chest.

658
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
All right.

659
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Manly chest hairs.

660
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
All right.

661
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I played other shit.

662
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Okay.

663
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Well God, you could talk for three hours just about dragon age.

664
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Clearly I played some final fantasy today so that I wouldn't get kicked out.

665
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
14.

666
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Right?

667
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Yes.

668
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So I wouldn't get kicked out.

669
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
And um, I've played some flux.

670
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Okay.

671
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And I have an odd addiction to a game called Moonlight Mahjong.

672
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Makes me feel like I'm 70 years old, but I fucking love that game.

673
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I have no idea why, but whenever I just need something mindless to do, it's Moonlight Mahjong.

674
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
That's it.

675
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Awesome.

676
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
All right.

677
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

678
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I just, my son has been playing a ton of Lego Marvel superheroes, so I had to play the game too.

679
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So I finished the game, at least the story portion of it.

680
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And I'm still trying to, I guess trying to platinum it.

681
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But the thing is, now that I've been playing it more, I'm starting to notice all the bugs.

682
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And um, yeah, it's, first off, okay, I had to reinstall the game because it crashed,

683
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
it would crash like all the time and it was really annoying.

684
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So I finally reinstalled it and that seems to fix that part.

685
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
But now I'm getting weird glitch issues where, you know, I'll play as a character or something.

686
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And like I had one the other day where I couldn't control the character very well.

687
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Like it would only go in one direction and not the other directions.

688
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And end up having to kill him with another character in order to get control of him again.

689
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But um, what else?

690
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh, and then for some reason, they have like these racing segments you have to do in the game.

691
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And the flying controls aren't very good, so you either go slow or you go super fast and can't control it.

692
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And you know, trying to go a little bit faster or just kind of control things, it just goes out of control very often.

693
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And the racing, they have racing controls.

694
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So your driving controls are just, you know, gas break and left right and that's steers.

695
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Okay, well that's how it is for the cars.

696
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But then they have these little RC car type things where they're like,

697
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hey, you know what, let's just fucking change the steering control altogether.

698
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Let's just have it gas break and then you have to push in the direction that you want to go.

699
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So like if I want to turn and I'm going to the left, I have to push down, which makes no fucking sense.

700
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And so I was getting super frustrated with it because I'm trying to go, it's literally like just an oval track that happens to be on a roof.

701
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
But the car just veers off the edge and just flies into the ground.

702
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm like, fuck this, I don't want that stupid car that this thing unlocks.

703
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Anyways, but I can't get platinum in the game if I don't finish it and it's really annoying.

704
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But it's fun. I have been unlocking some characters, you know, my son's now a fan of the song that plays.

705
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Well, in the credits and also in the home screen for the game, which is the Mary Marvel marching song or something like that.

706
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
It's basically, I think, the Stanley's fan club's official song or something. So he's like really into that.

707
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And then he's been enjoying playing Loki because now I have Loki unlocked. So it's fun.

708
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And then I finally figured out how to customize my character.

709
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So I have a character with Thor's hammer and Loki's helmet and a goatee and stuff.

710
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
That sounds awesome that you've been able to be doing a lot of gaming with your kid.

711
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Yeah, he's been very obsessed with it though. Like he gets mad if you have to turn the game off.

712
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
So yeah, we're working on that. But yeah, he can actually play it now.

713
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm just trying to get him to be able to do it without me having to help him.

714
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Switching characters is what he has trouble with usually.

715
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Alright. My gaming week, if you're all done.

716
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I am.

717
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff to talk to you guys about.

718
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I've been playing a lot of the same stuff, you know, because not a lot of new stuff's come out.

719
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I've continued to play Final Fantasy XIV, which I decided to level a gladiator who's now a paladin for no particular reason.

720
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But Alan made my little female lala, I play a little female lala, an entire set of all-pink armor.

721
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So I look adorable. So that's kind of one thing I've been doing in Final Fantasy XIV.

722
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I played Geometry Wars 3 earlier this week.

723
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And I actually played over SharePlay because Extifer saw me playing and he's like,

724
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't know much about that game, but I really like twin-stick shooters because he's really into super stardust.

725
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So Extifer, if you listen to my other show, Hoard House, you know Extifer.

726
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He was like, can we do the SharePlay thing?

727
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And I was like, sure.

728
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
So we hopped on SharePlay and then I realized, oh, he doesn't just have to watch me.

729
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Geometry Wars has that whole co-op built in.

730
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
And it has the, you can play online mode, but then there's also the couch co-op.

731
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But thanks to SharePlay, you don't really need the couch.

732
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You can have the virtual couch.

733
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So we actually played a little bit of that and it actually ran.

734
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You would think there'd be a lot of lag, especially in a shooter.

735
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It ran really well and Extifer was able to hold his own pretty good on Geometry Wars over SharePlay.

736
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So thumbs up to that SharePlay technology because it's really unlocking new uses in these games.

737
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So being able to play Geometry Wars on the big virtual couch was a really awesome thing.

738
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
So that was cool.

739
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
So more Geometry Wars 3.

740
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And then one new but not really new thing that I've been playing a lot of this week,

741
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
and this might surprise some of you guys.

742
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIII on Steam.

743
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
As you guys probably know, Final Fantasy XIII came out on Steam a couple months ago

744
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and a lot of people weren't happy with it because it had some really weird issues with the graphics.

745
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Such as you could play in a window that was 720 pixels, that's it.

746
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Or you could play it full screen, 720 pixels, that's it.

747
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And there was just a lot of weird, crappy bugs with it.

748
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Well, they released this week a graphic patch.

749
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So now you can play in a window that's 720 pixels or you can play in a 1080 pixel window.

750
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And they actually have the 1080p modes are kind of in this now.

751
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And you can play a whole lot of custom resolutions full screen.

752
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So I can play my native resolution full screen, which is what I've been doing.

753
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
And the game looks great.

754
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Now not everything in the game is 1080p because like some of the pre-rendered movies and things like that,

755
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
like that is stuck at the way they were rendered.

756
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
They haven't really gone back and upped any of those things.

757
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But I'll tell you what, maybe it's because my machine's a little newer.

758
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I upgraded a lot of it this year.

759
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But some parts of the game run smoother at like 60 frames a second,

760
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
like smoother than it does on the PlayStation 3.

761
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And just the way a lot of the colors and things are kind of even more vibrant on a computer monitor

762
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
than they are necessarily on the TV while I'm playing on the PlayStation 3,

763
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I can just sit there and just watch the beauty of this game really unfold.

764
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And I know the game itself gets a lot of shit for some of its characters

765
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and the fact that the first few hours of the game is press A to win type of thing.

766
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But I think if you can get over that little hurdle, there's a really great story in there

767
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
that's a lot of fun to experience.

768
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And I'm having fun kind of going back and experiencing it again

769
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
because this is really my second full proper playthrough.

770
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And I'm noticing a bunch of shit this time that I didn't notice the first time,

771
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
such as characters that don't show up until partway through the game

772
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
are actually in the game early on if you look for them.

773
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
They're in the background or like in a side type of thing, but they're there.

774
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So I'm kind of having fun looking at that.

775
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So kudos to Square for putting out that patch that actually fixed the damn game.

776
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Mostly, though, I do have one thing I've got to still complain about,

777
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
and that is that I was really thrown a fit on Twitter and IRL

778
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
because I got the graphic patch installed and I started running it,

779
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and I'm like, why is it skipping?

780
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And what would happen is that it would run 20 frames skip, 20 frames skip.

781
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And it was this very noticeable skip.

782
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
It would be like, go, stop, go, stop, go, stop.

783
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It was just really, really annoying. I can't play the game like that.

784
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's too distracting.

785
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Well, I get really frustrated, and I'm like, God damn it.

786
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Why don't they put out a fucking demo so I can see that this is a piece of shit port

787
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
before I start playing it, da da da da da da.

788
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And Alan looks over my shoulder and he goes, oh, I have that same problem,

789
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
and that's happening because your Xbox controller isn't plugged in.

790
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
If you plug it in, it'll stop doing that.

791
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And I'm like, really? And I plugged it in, and sure enough, it stopped doing that.

792
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

793
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That doesn't make any fucking sense, but swear to God, that's what fixed it.

794
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
And I don't know, I don't think an Xbox controller is required,

795
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
so I don't know if it's because I used one previously.

796
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It shouldn't still cause any frame skips if it's an Xbox controller's plugged in.

797
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah, so a lot of that stuff was annoying to say the least,

798
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
but if you can clear some of those technical issues, the game is really good.

799
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Not that I can necessarily give Square a buy on a lot of these issues that are just like,

800
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
really? Really? It skips if the controller's not plugged in, really?

801
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
There's a lot of those little issues that it's hard to give Square a buy on,

802
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
but if you can get past them, I would argue that the Final Fantasy 13 PC port

803
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
may actually be better than the PS3 port.

804
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And I'm really excited to get into 13.2 at some point,

805
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,000
even though I hear not all the DLC carried over because of licensing issues.

806
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm really excited to beat 13 and then get into 13.2, which just released on Steam this past week.

807
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
So there you go. I've been spending a lot of time playing 13.

808
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I do have my broadcast channel open, so if you happen to see me online, you can jump in.

809
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And I used to with Steam, I used to only accept people on my friends list that I knew,

810
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
like IRLs I used to beat, but I'm not such a stickler anymore,

811
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
so for whatever reason I said no to your request before, just request again and I'll accept.

812
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,000
So that broadcasting stuff is actually working now on Steam?

813
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah, it's working. It's not as rich as, say, Twitch, but what I can do is I can say,

814
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I have a little thing that is, you check the box, and if a friend right-clicks my name

815
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and wants to watch my game, then they can. It'll just start streaming the game to them.

816
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, and it'll show me in the corner a little, because Alan and I are playing this a little bit,

817
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
because I want to see what it'll look like. It'll show a little record light in the corner,

818
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
it'll say one viewer or two viewers, whatever, and then in the top left in a really tiny font,

819
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
if anybody says something in chat, it'll show.

820
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So it kind of uses that Steam overlay a little bit to be able to pop the important broadcasting information in there.

821
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
But there's still no webcam, there's still a lot to be desired for,

822
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
maybe a broadcaster that really, really wants to go pro.

823
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
So do you have to turn that on, or is that just on by default?

824
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You can turn it off.

825
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Because I can imagine that would use a lot of bandwidth if...

826
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
No, you can disable it altogether if you want. Most people have it set to the way that Jamie has it set,

827
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
where somebody can request to watch your stream.

828
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But I just open my... if you're on my friends list, you can just tap in and watch whatever I'm playing.

829
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
But I just say, when I do a Twitch broadcast, that is performing.

830
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That is, I'm going to talk through the game, I'm going to give some explanations,

831
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm going to tell you what I'm thinking, and all that stuff.

832
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
When I'm Steam broadcasting a game, that's just you peeking in my window looking at my TV.

833
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
You know, I'm not going to...

834
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
That's a little stalker-ish.

835
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
It is a little stalker-y, but it's not like it's a webcam in my home,

836
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
it's just Final Fantasy XIII, so it's not too big a deal.

837
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Alright, well, in just a couple minutes, we're going to get to our interview here,

838
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
but I think we have time to squeeze in one story.

839
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, I've got to do housekeeping real quick.

840
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R, of course, and if you want to follow us on Facebook, you can.

841
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, and we're also on Google.

842
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

843
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And we are on YouTube as well, OrangeLoungeRadio,

844
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
and old episodes of the show available on YouTube.

845
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Since I know we're interviewing a YouTube channel tonight,

846
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
we may have some YouTube people that are listening or viewing or what have you tonight,

847
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
so we do have the YouTube, although the YouTube is just static pictures

848
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
over the show that Jason puts together.

849
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
We do not at this time have a camera in our studio because it's OrangeLoungeRadio,

850
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
and we're really not that excited.

851
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
If you want to see me in gym shorts bundled up in a Snuggie, then so be it,

852
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
but otherwise it's not that interesting to look at, I don't think.

853
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
And I still need a haircut, so yes.

854
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,000
All right, you can see I did some light remodeling in Studio N7,

855
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
that arcade cabinet that Loki was complaining about last week.

856
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Last time.

857
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
We finally got it lifted and on and working.

858
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's been a lot of fun, actually.

859
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
I was playing BurgerTime on it earlier.

860
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Nice.

861
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
That's all I ever wanted was a BurgerTime cabinet in my house.

862
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
All right, let's get into some news.

863
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
We'll do one story here, and then we'll get to our interview tonight.

864
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Okay, so Amiibos have been selling pretty well.

865
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That's good for Nintendo.

866
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I mean, I guess everybody will be willing to buy anything that's in figure form nowadays.

867
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,000
But apparently they've sold, well, Smash Brothers has sold nearly 700,000 copies,

868
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
and they're saying that apparently the Amiibos themselves have sold quite a few as it is,

869
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
almost as many copies as the game.

870
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So, wow, you guys will really buy a lot of this stuff.

871
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I don't know.

872
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Personally, I just don't get the Amiibo thing.

873
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I mean, it's a cool add-on.

874
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I mean, if I want figure for my desk or something, that might be a cool thing to buy,

875
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
but the functionality is just not there for me.

876
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I have a lot of Nintendo friends, like Nintendo fan friends, on my Twitter,

877
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
and let me tell you, the thirst is real for these things.

878
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I have people, somebody I follow on Twitter actually said,

879
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I am so frustrated over this, I'm going to cry,

880
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
because they couldn't find the figures that they want.

881
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Like, I guess Nintendo released three new figures today,

882
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
the Little Mac and the Diddy Kong came out today, and Zelda.

883
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Oh, yeah, because that's obviously one people want is Zelda.

884
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And so people really want these figures, right?

885
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
But they're so hard to find because Nintendo and hardware equals lull.

886
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And I guess these things are really hard to find,

887
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
and people are getting really, really frustrated at how hard these things are to get,

888
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
because now that we know Nintendo's pulling them from shelves,

889
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
you know, it's like maybe they're not going to get one.

890
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I don't know.

891
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Well, I think that you guys are just pointing to their hands if you ask me, but that's fine.

892
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And yeah, they're saying Nintendo did confirm that they're discontinuing some Amiibo figures after initial shipments.

893
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
They're saying we will aim for certain Amiibos to always be available.

894
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
These will be for our most popular characters like Mario and Link.

895
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Do the shelf space constraints.

896
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Other figures will not return to the market once they've sold through their initial shipment.

897
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I think that's a load of crap if you ask me, because I think that the reason they're doing that is not necessarily shelf space,

898
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but they want you to feel the urge, like, oh crap, if I don't buy this right now, I'm never going to get it.

899
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It's just like the fucking Wii U was.

900
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:35,000
They're trying to give you that impression that if you don't buy it now when you see it on that shelf, you're never going to get one.

901
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I don't believe that for one second, because they know that they're making money off of this.

902
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
They're going to keep reprinting this.

903
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:52,000
If it's any indication, like they've done with other games, they will have variants that they'll make.

904
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Or they'll be a different color one or something that comes out later on or something.

905
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Of course, they're saying that certain Amiibos are sold out, and they may return later on.

906
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
They're saying that some Amiibos were very popularly launched, and possibly some Amiibos in the United States.

907
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Canada and Latin America may not be available right now due to the high demand efforts.

908
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I guess that's the expected, because people are really clamoring for these.

909
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I don't understand why, but once again, it's Nintendo. People are fans of Nintendo.

910
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I'm not going to buy for a second, though, that if there's an Amiibo that's sold out,

911
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't think that there's any figure that's in low demand right now, so I'm just not buying that.

912
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

913
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
YYR says, I called Nintendo because of a problem redeeming a prepaid card.

914
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I asked the phone rep about whether they were going to make more Wii U GameCube adapters.

915
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Exact quote from rep. I know, right?

916
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Bottom line, NOA has no clue as to whether more stuff is being made.

917
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I would expect the same to be true of Amiibos.

918
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Once again, I think their strategy, and this has been their strategy since the Wii came out...

919
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
To starve the market?

920
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
To starve the market to drive up demand.

921
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
It fucking worked, and people are buying into it, so why wouldn't they do it?

922
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
The fact that they're saying that, once we sell through this, we may not bring it back.

923
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Yeah, I could see that as possible.

924
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It's a possible scenario if you have an Amiibo figure that just is not popular.

925
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Say that they came out with, I don't know, a Birdo figure or something, and no one fucking...

926
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I will be fucking buying that thing once, bitch.

927
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I understand that you would buy it, but let's just hypothetically throw out there.

928
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
How dare you? How dare you say that Birdo has no fans out there?

929
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I'm not saying that Birdo doesn't have any fans.

930
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm just trying to throw out a random new character.

931
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I'm not going to go down the list of every single character in Mario games until we get to the...

932
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Okay, I got one for you, Ice Climbers.

933
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Aww, too soon, too soon.

934
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I'm just saying, let's just say, hypothetically, that they have a character that's just not popular.

935
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
The dude in Hogan's Alley.

936
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Because when has Nintendo ever revisited that game?

937
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Alright, that's fine.

938
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Dude from Hogan's Alley, or how about CDI Mario?

939
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
CDI Mario or Zelda.

940
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Those are figures that they're either derpy, no one wants them.

941
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Hypothetically speaking, yes, I can see if they're not selling, they're not going to make more.

942
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Once they sell out of their initial shipment, that's it.

943
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That's going to be gone.

944
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
But I think for any of these figures at launch, they're going to totally be restocking that stuff.

945
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
They're not just going to be...

946
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Why would you do that?

947
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Why would you stop selling a figure for the hell of it?

948
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
If it's selling through, you would keep doing it until it stops selling through.

949
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I think if you're the person that's getting really frustrated at not being able to find these figures,

950
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
let Nintendo know.

951
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Tweet them, email them.

952
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I wouldn't necessarily say call them, because I don't think the people answering the phone can really...

953
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Apparently they're in the same boat you guys are.

954
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
But make sure Nintendo knows.

955
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
You want these figures and they're not making enough of them.

956
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And that's probably going to be the best thing to get another shipment.

957
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That's how we ended up getting Earthbound on Virtual Console,

958
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
a western release of The Last Guardian and all these rainfall games.

959
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Now, SSJ100Matt was saying, listen, Nintendo isn't losing money on them.

960
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
He was jerking people around like this and manipulating the market.

961
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I don't think that they're...

962
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
They're not sitting on shelves.

963
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
They're selling out immediately, so they're going to keep making them.

964
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I just think that they're...

965
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But it always sucks when it's selling out immediately because it's eBay scalpers and buying it up.

966
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And you know that's what's happening.

967
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,000
And also, and I've got to double check here because I know I didn't put these stories on our show roll,

968
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,000
but they had some news about upcoming figures and the bullshit that they're doing.

969
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
That crap where it's like, oh, hey, hey, you really want Rosalina?

970
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Well, it's going to have to go to Target for that.

971
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Or, hey, you want this figure?

972
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Well, you got to go to Toys R Us.

973
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Or there's the rumor about that Shulk GameStop is purposely...

974
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
This is a huge grain of salt because it's one of those, I work for GameStop,

975
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
but I'm not going to tell you who I am.

976
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Where apparently GameStop is going to hold half the Shulks to sell as used.

977
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I mean, it sounds really...

978
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm almost like, even GameStop's not that low.

979
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Sell them as used?

980
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
They did that with another title.

981
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
They did that with the...

982
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah, Metroid Prime Trilogy.

983
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
No, no.

984
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
They did that with...

985
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
No, they did that with the reprint of...

986
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Was it The Last Story or something like that?

987
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Xenoblade.

988
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Xenoblade, yeah.

989
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And they sold it for more than retail because of high demand.

990
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Jamie, quick comments.

991
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
We got to get to our interview with Jamie.

992
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Just that my coworker picked up four amiibos,

993
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and all they do is sit on the wall between our cubicles

994
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
so that we have the eternal battle between Link and Red Ring Rico

995
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
from Phantasy Star Online.

996
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Nice.

997
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Just saying.

998
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Well, those amiibos seem to be doing very, very well for Nintendo,

999
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
so whether it is artificial or natural, who knows?

1000
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That's anyone's guess.

1001
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
All right, but we are going to shift gears here quite a bit

1002
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
because we want to bring onto the show here tonight

1003
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
our friends from the YouTube series Cooking with Unity.

1004
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
We're going to get Max, Phil, and Jeffrey, all of them.

1005
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
They're all actually in the same room,

1006
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
and we're going to talk to them all here tonight,

1007
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
the guys from Cooking with Unity.

1008
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
And if you have questions for them,

1009
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
you can submit it in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

1010
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
but I believe we have them on the line.

1011
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
You guys there?

1012
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We are.

1013
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
We are here.

1014
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Yep, I'm here as well.

1015
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Hello, hello, guys.

1016
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Welcome to Orange Launch Radio.

1017
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Hello.

1018
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Thank you so much for taking time to be with us tonight,

1019
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
and you guys are all in the same room just like we are.

1020
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, yeah, we're all in the same room,

1021
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
and thank you for inviting us.

1022
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
It's exciting to be on your show.

1023
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
No worries.

1024
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Actually, I got to give credit to Loki here.

1025
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Loki's kind of our game maker here on staff,

1026
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
and he really likes you guys an awful lot.

1027
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
He's the one that showed me about the show.

1028
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I love the show and the banter.

1029
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
The banter's the best part.

1030
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
All right, well, I'm glad you do

1031
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
because a lot of times when we do the banter,

1032
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
we're like, oh, no one is watching this for this.

1033
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So it's good to hear that the banter's coming across, too.

1034
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Usually when we're bantering,

1035
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
we're talking about stuff

1036
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
because we've run out of intelligent things

1037
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
to say on the show.

1038
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And we don't want YouTube to clip the video.

1039
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yeah, exactly.

1040
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
So for those who don't know, Max is the first guy that talked.

1041
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'm Phil from Cooking with the Unity.

1042
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I'm Max.

1043
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
And I'm Jeffrey.

1044
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And, yeah, we enjoy doing the show,

1045
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
and I'm really happy that you guys,

1046
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm really happy that Loki is enjoying the show,

1047
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
and it's really great that we got an invite

1048
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
to do the show with you guys.

1049
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
And hopefully we can answer some questions

1050
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
and give people a place to actually start

1051
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
for making games and starting their career making games.

1052
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Excellent, because that's where my head's at.

1053
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
It's like, well, you can't say I'm not a fan.

1054
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm still not understanding the subject matter fully,

1055
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
but I want to get there.

1056
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I want to get to that point someday.

1057
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So that's really exciting.

1058
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And I don't know if you guys heard earlier in the show,

1059
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I was kind of talking about

1060
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
a lot of what you guys seem to do for game creation.

1061
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
There's a lot of what I've said about podcasting.

1062
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I don't know if you know,

1063
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
we've been doing Orange on its Radio for 12 years.

1064
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's wild.

1065
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Especially considering how early podcasting was

1066
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
at the time that you started it.

1067
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes, absolutely.

1068
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Well, there was no podcast when we first started.

1069
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

1070
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You were a radio station, right?

1071
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yeah, we were live through 65,

1072
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and then that kind of evolved into that.

1073
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But we love it when people create their own shows,

1074
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
just like you guys really empower people

1075
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
to make their own games, which I think is so important.

1076
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Well, let me take a step back and ask you guys,

1077
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
for those that don't know what Cooking with Unity is,

1078
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
tell us about it.

1079
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
What is Cooking with Unity?

1080
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So, what the show is,

1081
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
it's my attempt to educate people on how to make video games.

1082
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I realized, so I started in the industry at Sony,

1083
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
and I went to DigiPen for school and stuff,

1084
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and so I kind of got immersed in how to make games and stuff.

1085
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And when I was growing up,

1086
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
there wasn't as much internet resources for things,

1087
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and there wasn't even as much internet.

1088
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And it just seemed like, with Unity,

1089
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
this is the time to actually start showing people,

1090
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
in general, how games are made

1091
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and what people do when they make games,

1092
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
and what does it mean to make a game.

1093
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Like, my biggest problem was,

1094
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
if you were to ask a random person on the street,

1095
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
how do you make a movie,

1096
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
they wouldn't be able to give you a very specific answer,

1097
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
but they'd be able to say,

1098
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
okay, you get a camera,

1099
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
you get a bunch of people in costumes

1100
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
on the other side of the camera,

1101
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
you shoot the scene,

1102
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,000
you do some editing,

1103
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,000
maybe you have a green screen

1104
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and use the magic of a computer or something,

1105
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
but they'll have a general idea.

1106
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
But if you ask a random person how to make a video game,

1107
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
they're going to just give you this blank stare.

1108
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
They're going to be like,

1109
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I think you use a computer at some point in the process,

1110
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
and that's like all people know.

1111
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And making games has gotten a lot easier

1112
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
in the last few years

1113
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
because of all the middleware and engines

1114
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
and tool chains that are available for free or for cheap.

1115
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
We've got Unity, we've got Unreal,

1116
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
we've got Crytek, CryEngine,

1117
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
we've got smaller, lesser known ones

1118
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
like Cocos2D and Erlicht and a few other things.

1119
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
But if you want to actually get started making a game,

1120
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
you no longer have to start by making the game engine.

1121
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You can actually just start making your game,

1122
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
which is exciting.

1123
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Why Unity in particular?

1124
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Well, in my case,

1125
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
it's because it just fit my organization style.

1126
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I started using Unity during a game jam,

1127
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
and I had never used it before,

1128
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and I was able to make a very simple game in two days

1129
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,000
without having ever touched Unity before.

1130
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It's just very well organized.

1131
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I like the way that it's a component-based organization

1132
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
for building things.

1133
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And the thing is, if your question is

1134
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
why Unity over anything else,

1135
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm not going to say that you should use Unity

1136
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
over anything else.

1137
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I think you should use whatever works best for you.

1138
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
If you download Unreal and it just clicks

1139
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
and you just love the Blueprint system

1140
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and you can understand you start making a game,

1141
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I want you to make a game.

1142
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I don't care if you use Unity or not.

1143
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
But I use Unity because it fits my workflow.

1144
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I'm very familiar with it.

1145
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I use it for my own projects,

1146
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and therefore I can teach it to people

1147
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and teach how to use it on their projects.

1148
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
You know why you guys are awesome?

1149
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Because in that sentence there,

1150
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
you said, I want you to make a game.

1151
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And I think that is such a great message.

1152
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Absolutely.

1153
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
That's something that I hear in your videos as well.

1154
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So let me ask this question.

1155
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Why is that important?

1156
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Why should you go make a game?

1157
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Why shouldn't you make a game?

1158
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I mean, honestly, if you're passionate about something,

1159
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
then you should absolutely go out and do it.

1160
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You should get that passion out there into the world

1161
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
and develop something.

1162
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I mean, it's an art form just like anything else.

1163
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Oh, God, I went into the art form thing.

1164
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Oh, sorry.

1165
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Video games as art is a whole other discussion,

1166
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
but I'm sure you guys have had that one before.

1167
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
So the thing is, yeah, why shouldn't you make a game?

1168
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
The thing is, I talk to a lot of people who play video games,

1169
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
and I always hear game designs from people.

1170
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm like, you know what would be a really cool game?

1171
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And sometimes it'll just be a really high-level thing.

1172
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It'll just be like, if it was Call of Duty,

1173
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
but it had motorcycles.

1174
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It might be something as simple as that,

1175
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
or it might be someone who has a really cool idea

1176
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
for a puzzle game or something, and everyone has these ideas,

1177
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
and very few people get the opportunity

1178
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
to actually build something

1179
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
that works towards making these games a reality.

1180
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
And the other thing I'm worried about is,

1181
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the games industry, because of how hard it is,

1182
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
or how hard it was, I think it's getting a lot easier,

1183
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,000
but how hard it is to learn how to make games,

1184
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
it was attracting these people

1185
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
that might not even be interested

1186
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
in the games themselves, but are interested

1187
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
in solving the challenges, and that's great.

1188
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I have no problem with that.

1189
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I have no problem with non-gamers making games.

1190
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
But I want to see more gamers making games,

1191
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
because gamers know what they want,

1192
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
and they can actually iterate on the previous art

1193
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
and create something new and interesting,

1194
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
and they already know the limitations

1195
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
that they're working within,

1196
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
and they're going to be able to figure out

1197
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
how to work around those limitations

1198
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
and change the expectations for games

1199
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
from a perspective of someone who is themselves

1200
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
a consumer of game products.

1201
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And so that's really important.

1202
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
You raise a really good point there,

1203
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
that there's a lot of non-gamers in the game industry,

1204
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
and we've kind of hit on this before

1205
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
when we talk about management decisions

1206
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
that screw games up,

1207
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
that cause buggy things to be released

1208
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
because it's more important to get a game out

1209
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
at a certain day and date to satisfy an XYZ person.

1210
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We get that all the time,

1211
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
and I think that's great,

1212
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
to get more gamers involved in making games.

1213
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Y-Y-R in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1214
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The feeling of playing something

1215
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
that I created with my own two hands

1216
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
is one of my favorite feelings in the world.

1217
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
If you have questions for our guests tonight

1218
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
from Cooking with Unity,

1219
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
you can ask that in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1220
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Have you guys heard of any games

1221
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
that you may have helped through your YouTube series

1222
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
or inspired to create?

1223
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
We're still early in our history for that kind of thing.

1224
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I have seen some really cool projects

1225
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
from people who might not have started with our show

1226
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
but are definitely using our show now,

1227
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
and I'm really excited to show more of that

1228
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
on the show as things progress.

1229
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
The thing is right now,

1230
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I want to show what people have made on my show.

1231
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
We want to have more segments

1232
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
that show what other people have made using Unity

1233
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
and what other people have made using whatever they want to make it with.

1234
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It doesn't have to be Unity specific.

1235
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
We've seen some really good projects,

1236
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
but they're all in progress.

1237
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
They will need an audience later.

1238
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't want to just jump the gun,

1239
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
show something that I think is kind of cool now.

1240
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Other people might not get why it's cool yet,

1241
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and then when they need the exposure,

1242
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
it might be harder for them to get it.

1243
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I don't have any direct examples for you right now,

1244
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
but there will be some soon

1245
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
as these projects come to fruition.

1246
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Well, I know of one. I know of at least one.

1247
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Right, Loki?

1248
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1249
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I just wish I had something to show right now.

1250
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
It's just redoing the engine three or four times already.

1251
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But the great part, though,

1252
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
is when I was learning,

1253
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
and I'm still learning

1254
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
because I'm just teaching myself everything,

1255
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I just started in March

1256
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
to actually start working on a game idea.

1257
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,000
But just trying to skip doing it the hard way,

1258
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
and then having to learn to do it the hard way,

1259
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
which is a good way to learn things, I guess.

1260
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Oh, it's always good.

1261
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It's a constant learning experience.

1262
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I mean, you never know all the answers,

1263
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
and there's always new ways to do things.

1264
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's really exciting to try to solve problems dynamically.

1265
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Sometimes you even find old ways to do things.

1266
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I found that, especially in the days of mobile,

1267
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
some of my knowledge about how PlayStation 1 games cut corners

1268
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
is actually useful

1269
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
because those same corners can be cut on mobile

1270
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
and give you great-looking visuals with less performance.

1271
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And so there's a lot to learn.

1272
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
You started in March, and as Phil said,

1273
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
you never run out. We haven't run out yet.

1274
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I learn a new thing every day making games.

1275
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
At least one thing every day.

1276
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
And that's not an exaggeration by any stretch of the imagination.

1277
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And sometimes it's really simple stuff too.

1278
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Occasionally someone will be watching my show

1279
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
and point out a feature in Unity that I didn't even know was there.

1280
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And I'm just like, wow, that saves me 20 minutes every time

1281
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
that I would normally have to do it this other way

1282
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
that I had already figured out

1283
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
because I just didn't know that this was built in.

1284
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm sorry that I'm not giving concrete examples here,

1285
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
but I'm sure that you've run into this yourself

1286
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
in the short time that you've been working

1287
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
where you find a way to do something,

1288
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
and it totally works, and it's fine.

1289
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And it doesn't have really many disadvantages or anything,

1290
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
but you find out later you could have done the same thing

1291
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
in one line of code and even less worry,

1292
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and it's a little bit more efficient and stuff.

1293
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
That being said, the super important thing to remember,

1294
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
and this is something where I differ from a lot of teachers and stuff

1295
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
where they're like, you need to learn the right way to do things.

1296
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
There's a million right ways to do anything in game development.

1297
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
There's a million. This is not an exaggeration.

1298
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
And there's a few that are terrible,

1299
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
and there's a few that are awesome,

1300
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
and there's everything else that's in between.

1301
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And the thing is, most of the in-between stuff

1302
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
will do what you need it to do.

1303
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
So my rule is, if it works, use it,

1304
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
especially when you're learning.

1305
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
If you have a solution to the problem,

1306
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
don't worry that it's the best solution.

1307
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I have a lot of people who are like,

1308
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
did I do this right? And they've done it totally right.

1309
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And they're like, but is there a more efficient way to use it?

1310
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And my answer is always, yes,

1311
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
there's always a more efficient way to do it.

1312
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
It is efficient enough, and it works,

1313
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
and that's the most important part.

1314
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
What needs to be important is you can always optimize later on.

1315
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
If you've encountered a situation where,

1316
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
yeah, the game's running terribly

1317
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
because of the way that I've implemented this thing,

1318
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
well, you can always go back and refactor it

1319
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
into a way that's using a different solution to the problem.

1320
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
You can always optimize later on.

1321
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
This is great to listen to,

1322
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
but for me, I've got to admit,

1323
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
my knowledge of game making is so-so.

1324
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I used to be able to make stuff in ZZT.

1325
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That game was awesome. I used to use that.

1326
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And maybe Commodore 64 Basic back in the day.

1327
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
All right.

1328
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
I love Commodore 64. We can talk Basic all day.

1329
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
God, that system was so flippin' amazing

1330
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
and kind of ahead of its time in many ways.

1331
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
But anyway, let's say I want to make a game.

1332
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'm going to do this. I'm going to download Unity.

1333
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I don't have a whole lot of programming experience

1334
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
except maybe like 10 print,

1335
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Rob is awesome, 20 go to 10.

1336
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
So I have very little programming experience.

1337
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So now what? Where is Word 1 in chapter 1?

1338
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Where do I start?

1339
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
So we made a series actually specifically for this.

1340
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's called From Scratch to Published.

1341
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
And we cover...

1342
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So it starts in episode negative 1,

1343
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
which is a strange episode number to start at.

1344
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
But the reason I did that is the first episode teaches you

1345
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
how to download and install Unity and start using Unity.

1346
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Episodes negative 1 and 0

1347
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
are for how to set up your computer

1348
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
and how to get an email address.

1349
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So we cover the most basic stuff you can possibly have.

1350
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
We talk about every single thing.

1351
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
And we go all the way up to the point

1352
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
where we actually publish on several stores,

1353
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
namely the Windows Store for both phone and PC,

1354
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the iOS and Mac app stores,

1355
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
and the Android Play Store.

1356
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
And the thing is,

1357
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
so when you're watching this one,

1358
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
there's going to be points,

1359
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
especially if you're a fresh beginner,

1360
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
you haven't done much programming in a while,

1361
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
or maybe no programming whatsoever,

1362
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
there's going to be some stuff

1363
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
where you're going to just have to take it on faith

1364
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
what I'm saying.

1365
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I try to explain things very thoroughly,

1366
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
but sometimes in the effort to just get the next section done,

1367
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I have to just say,

1368
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
here's the code, here's what we're doing,

1369
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I try to explain it,

1370
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
but it's not going to click at first.

1371
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
And so you've got to just work with it.

1372
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Don't stop there.

1373
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
It's not going to teach you everything you need to know.

1374
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It's going to teach you enough that you can get started.

1375
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And from there,

1376
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
you'll start forming questions

1377
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and start answering your questions yourself,

1378
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
and you'll be able to figure out how these things actually work.

1379
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
The important thing is,

1380
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
on the series, because we start from scratch,

1381
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
we start literally on a PC

1382
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
that doesn't have Unity installed,

1383
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
or any program installed,

1384
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
we show installing Unity,

1385
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
we show installing Source Control,

1386
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
we show how to use Source Control stuff.

1387
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Most people don't even know what Source Control is,

1388
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
and most people don't use it,

1389
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
and this is terrible.

1390
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
People should be using it.

1391
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
What Source Control is is basically a backup system

1392
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
slash collaboration system

1393
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
so that when you make changes to the project,

1394
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
everyone else working on the project gets those changes,

1395
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
and more importantly,

1396
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
if you make a change and something's wrong,

1397
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
you can go back later and be like,

1398
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
hey, that change was wrong,

1399
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and it keeps that history

1400
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
of everything that you've done.

1401
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
That way, mistakes are less costly.

1402
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
What's fun about games

1403
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
versus pretty much any other industry

1404
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
is there's the only cost

1405
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
involved in making them

1406
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
effectively, once you have the tools,

1407
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
which the tools are free now,

1408
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
is the cost of time.

1409
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
The worst mistakes in the world

1410
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
that you can make will only cost you time.

1411
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
They will never cost you manufacturing resources.

1412
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You will never have to replace things

1413
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
because you did something wrong in code.

1414
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Well, okay.

1415
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Yeah, I mean, if you drop your iPhone on the floor,

1416
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
it'll be your test device.

1417
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
There's little problems like that,

1418
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
but it's from the physical world.

1419
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's not from the digital world

1420
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
that these problems are occurring.

1421
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
So mistakes should be embraced.

1422
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You really do learn from mistakes.

1423
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
So don't feel bad

1424
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
when something doesn't work right.

1425
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Feel good when you make it work right afterwards.

1426
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
And so, yeah,

1427
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
From Scratch to Publish will give you

1428
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
probably the best kind of overview

1429
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
front to back of game development

1430
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
using Unity.

1431
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And then you can start to get more specific on videos

1432
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
and by downloading

1433
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
text content or using assets

1434
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
from the Asda store to try and figure out

1435
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
the rest of the way, how things work.

1436
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Remember, there's always

1437
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
more to learn. There's always tricks that

1438
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
like, I don't know all the tricks.

1439
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
I try to teach as many tricks as I know.

1440
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
When I find a new trick, I try to tell people about it.

1441
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But I will never know everything.

1442
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
And no one will.

1443
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
But try to know as much as you can.

1444
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And get into it. And I know you will enjoy it.

1445
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Alright, I'm going to check that out.

1446
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
In fact, I even see why YR just linked that

1447
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
to episode negative one in our chat room

1448
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
over there at live.vognetwork.com

1449
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And if you are just joining us live, we are talking

1450
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
with Max, Phil, and Jeffrey all from

1451
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Cooking with Unity.

1452
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
If you go to cookingwithunity.com

1453
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
it will just take you right to their YouTube channel

1454
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
that has everything there.

1455
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Do you guys have any other, like, I don't know

1456
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
if you guys do Twitter feeds or Facebook

1457
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
or anything else we should be following you guys on?

1458
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Oh, I'm on Facebook, or on Twitter.

1459
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Twitter is MagmaLemur

1460
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Awesome. And I'm on

1461
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Twitter as Drakfire, that's

1462
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:14,000
D-R-A-K-F-Y-R-E

1463
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Alright. I'm also in the channel as Drakfire

1464
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
so if you just spell my name in there.

1465
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Sounds good.

1466
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And if you guys have questions, wait, there's three of you

1467
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Wait, am I in the channel out there?

1468
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
There's three of us, but I don't think Jeffrey has a Twitter.

1469
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
No, I don't have a Twitter.

1470
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Alright, that's alright. That's alright.

1471
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Darsakra has a Twitter, but she doesn't ever use it.

1472
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
So I tag her in things. I use it sometimes.

1473
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Yeah, she'll reply to it like a month later.

1474
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And I'll complain about Pinkberry being closed ten minutes early.

1475
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah, why did you tag me in this?

1476
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Alright, anyway.

1477
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
So, awesome, awesome.

1478
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Loki, I want to go to you, because

1479
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
surely you've got some things you want to ask these guys.

1480
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah, I mean, the

1481
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
one general question. First off,

1482
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
I was going to mention, they do have a Patreon as well.

1483
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So there's some cool stuff

1484
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
that you get access to, like they have a

1485
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
repo with some cool

1486
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
code and stuff in there that you can

1487
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
check out. So definitely

1488
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
go check that out and support them

1489
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
if you can. The other thing I was

1490
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
going to say is, now I know you

1491
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
guys have done quite a few different types of

1492
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
games in the past,

1493
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
different projects and stuff.

1494
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Looking forward, what are some

1495
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
different types of games that you're looking to tackle

1496
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
in future projects?

1497
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Well, I know

1498
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
for one, I'm working

1499
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
very close with Justin Morovitz

1500
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
on Vanguard

1501
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
V, and I really hope that we get funding

1502
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
for that project, because that's going to be awesome.

1503
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Justin is

1504
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
trying to start a studio

1505
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
that's VR centric.

1506
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
And I think that's

1507
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
important.

1508
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I do think that's actually ultimately

1509
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
where the games industry is going to move towards

1510
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
is virtual reality.

1511
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I'm not saying that we're going to get rid of TVs.

1512
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I think that's silly to think that.

1513
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I don't think we're going to be getting rid of tablets or anything.

1514
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
But we're going to be adding VR to the mix.

1515
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And I think that the people who have been

1516
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
playing games the longest

1517
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
are going to be very interested in seeing

1518
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
what actually comes to pass with virtual

1519
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
reality. So I would say that

1520
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
in my future at least, what I'm hoping

1521
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
for is to get to work on more virtual reality

1522
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
related games

1523
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
and projects. It's an interesting

1524
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
challenge because you have the physical aspect.

1525
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
You don't want to give people

1526
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
whiplash when they're playing your game. You don't want

1527
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
people to get motion sickness.

1528
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Although I do think motion sickness

1529
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
is going to be less of an issue as people get

1530
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
their sea legs, so to speak.

1531
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Just like how

1532
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
people forget, but when the games first started

1533
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
just games scrolling left to right would make some

1534
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
people sick. And now

1535
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
you would never even worry about that. You would

1536
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
scroll the game however fast you want it left

1537
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
and right. You can jiggle it

1538
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
back and forth and no one's going to get sick.

1539
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And it'll be that way for VR at

1540
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
some point.

1541
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Cool.

1542
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Speaking of VR, I see in our chat room

1543
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Bobby Blackwell says, I demoed Vanguard V

1544
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
at a recent VR meetup with the

1545
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
KOR FX vest. Bobby

1546
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
by the way is our guy on the network that is really into

1547
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
this VR stuff.

1548
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
He wants to know when the Proton Pulse talk is starting.

1549
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Well,

1550
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Proton Pulse is available on Google Cardboard

1551
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
right now. Go get it. Go get a cardboard

1552
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
and go download it.

1553
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Full games available, so

1554
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
yeah.

1555
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
They just released the Cardboard SDK for

1556
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Unity, I just saw.

1557
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Yeah, we've had a beta

1558
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
version for a while and actually I think it's been

1559
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
publicly available too, but we've had

1560
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
some close interaction with Google which has been great.

1561
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Speaking of

1562
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Bobby, there's always a really funny debate

1563
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
that you and him

1564
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
have, Loki, going back and forth

1565
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
when you first got into programming.

1566
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I don't think there really is a right or wrong

1567
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
answer, but I thought I would consult the experts

1568
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
here for the Cookie with Unity and

1569
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
ask this, when we talk about your very first

1570
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
project, I'm going to start my first project

1571
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
and my first game.

1572
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
In your opinion, do you think it's better to

1573
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
build clones of existing

1574
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
games or to just,

1575
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
you know what, I'm going to do my own thing. Do your own thing.

1576
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
This is a really, really good question.

1577
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Oh,

1578
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
yeah, I mean, my first project

1579
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
ended up being that little game robot alone

1580
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
that I made.

1581
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And that's only on iOS

1582
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
unfortunately, I still haven't gotten around to

1583
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
porting it to anything else, even though it takes

1584
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
no time and effort, I just need to boot up the project.

1585
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Apparently I'm too lazy to do that.

1586
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
It was my first game

1587
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
and it's basically a clone of Puro 2

1588
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
from WarioWare,

1589
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
the first WarioWare game

1590
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
for the Game Boy Advance. It's a very small

1591
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
mini-game there, but it was something

1592
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
that's small in scope that I knew how it

1593
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
functioned and I think it's very important

1594
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
to take something that you kind of understand

1595
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
how it works and just make something simple

1596
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
and once you make that simple thing work,

1597
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
just step up the complexity a little bit more.

1598
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Like starting with Pong is not necessarily

1599
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
bad or Space Invaders,

1600
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
something like that, something small and

1601
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
simple that you know kind of mechanically how it

1602
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
works so you can kind of just

1603
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
get a feel for what you need to

1604
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
implement. Yeah, and on the show we model

1605
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
our episodes based on

1606
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
genres and we try to basically

1607
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
make it based on another

1608
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
game that's similar in that genre.

1609
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Our very first episodes were

1610
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
well actually my very first episodes, it was

1611
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
before we had multiple people on the show,

1612
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
were Space Invaders

1613
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
and I believe Space Invaders

1614
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
is probably the best place to start

1615
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
and not necessarily on my show

1616
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
because it's terrible, I had

1617
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
no showmanship or anything back then.

1618
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
But some people still say they like the

1619
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
episodes, but I'd say starting with

1620
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Space Invaders is good because it teaches you

1621
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
a lot of the basics about game development.

1622
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It teaches you how to

1623
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
make bullets happen.

1624
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
That's a very common thing, how to spawn something

1625
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
and make it move on the screen.

1626
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
It teaches you movement

1627
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
and it teaches you how to create and destroy

1628
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
things on the screen that you're destroying.

1629
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And all those things are really important in games.

1630
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Pong is a really good example

1631
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
as well except for it doesn't really teach

1632
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
it teaches very basic instantiation and

1633
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
destruction, there's only one object. I like

1634
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Space Invaders because there's a few more objects to work with

1635
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
so it feels like there's something to sink your teeth into.

1636
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
As far as to whether everyone

1637
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
should do this, what I

1638
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
mainly want to say is

1639
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
it probably doesn't matter that much as long as

1640
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
you have a really clear idea in your head what you're making

1641
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
whether you duplicate something that's

1642
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
existing or if you go with your own design.

1643
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
But the scope

1644
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
is important. So if your

1645
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
dream project is, and I know a lot of people

1646
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
have this and I'm not dissing the

1647
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
dreams here, if your dream project is

1648
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
an MMO where you

1649
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
can do real time combat

1650
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
and wherever you strike the shield

1651
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
on the opponent is exactly where the

1652
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
damage happens and there's a

1653
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
damage model for it. You have this

1654
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
pages and pages and pages. Don't start

1655
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
with that game. Please don't

1656
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
start with that game. Even if

1657
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
your high concept starts with

1658
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
is a multiplayer game, don't start with

1659
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
that game. Start with a single player game.

1660
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
If you do want

1661
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
to work towards your dream project though

1662
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
start with a small project

1663
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
that represents

1664
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
a portion of your larger

1665
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
project and then just keep doing that

1666
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
and then build them together.

1667
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And what I mean by that is

1668
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
honestly a really good example

1669
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I think is the Metal Gear series.

1670
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
In that

1671
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
if you've ever played Metal Gear Solid

1672
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
which

1673
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Metal Gear Solid, sorry

1674
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake, the MSX version

1675
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
it's on the anniversary

1676
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
collection. It's the

1677
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
last 2D game before they went to 3D.

1678
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
If you play through that game you'll see

1679
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
that pretty much everything that happens

1680
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
in that game happened

1681
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
in Metal Gear Solid later

1682
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
in 3D. Even

1683
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
smoking to display

1684
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
lasers and go through them

1685
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
that's in that game first.

1686
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Crawling under tanks is in that

1687
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
game first. Pretty much

1688
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
every single interaction, all the elevator interactions

1689
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
all of the communication

1690
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
between characters, all the codex stuff

1691
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
was in that game first. And that game

1692
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
is a 2D game.

1693
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So he had tried

1694
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
this formula already

1695
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
before they moved to 3D. Before they did

1696
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
something that was ground breaking.

1697
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
And Metal Gear Solid was truly ground

1698
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
breaking for the time. And

1699
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I think that company still just does amazing

1700
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
work. I love Kojima's work.

1701
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
So think about it from

1702
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
a perspective of make the

1703
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
simple version of your game.

1704
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Do stepping stones and then once you have the simple version

1705
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
you can kind of already work some of the problems

1706
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
out and then you can make a slightly more complex version.

1707
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And then before you know it you'll have

1708
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
you'll be working on the networked multiplayer

1709
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
massively multiplayer online version of your game.

1710
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I mean it's all about iterations upon

1711
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
your development basically like

1712
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
yeah just start with something simple. You know like Metal Gear

1713
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
maybe didn't eventually originally have

1714
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
like pressing up against a wall in the first

1715
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
version so they added it in the second one

1716
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
so you could start hiding around corners.

1717
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And so on and so forth and they just kept going

1718
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
with these ideas and that's how you get

1719
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
these really complicated games is you start

1720
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
off simple and just kind of keep iterating

1721
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
ideas and adding functionality

1722
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
to things.

1723
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Alright well to be fair to Bobby he is saying

1724
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
in chat room I stressed more something that

1725
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
was small in scope not necessarily

1726
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
a full clone but that seems to definitely be in line

1727
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
with the message you guys are saying is that if you want

1728
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
to make this gigantic dream game

1729
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
MMO focus on that one little

1730
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
part first that maybe you can build into

1731
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
the larger game later. And yes Black Wolf

1732
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I did say simple was boring. It's just not for

1733
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
me. That's not what I want to do and that's fine

1734
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
you know the fact that I didn't start with a simple project

1735
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
means I've learned

1736
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
so much more so and not to say that I

1737
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
would you say that even though you maybe didn't take

1738
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
on a simple project at first Loki you still

1739
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
you're building one piece at a time. Yes

1740
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
and I'm also not crazy enough to do an MMO

1741
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
no one I don't want to ever

1742
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
do an MMO ever ever

1743
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
ever ever ever just

1744
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
it sounds too too crazy

1745
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
so never no idea how many

1746
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
times that I've heard someone say oh I've got

1747
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
this really good game idea I want to make it

1748
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm working on an MMO like that's

1749
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
that is usually surprisingly

1750
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
it happens all the time.

1751
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Oh gosh well gosh a dungeon

1752
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
buster in our chat says this is a great interview lots

1753
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
of great advice you know what I agree this is

1754
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
this has been so informative and there's

1755
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
so much more information that I

1756
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
hope folks will go check out over on your YouTube

1757
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
channel over at cookingwithunity.com

1758
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I do have to wrap things up here

1759
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
pretty soon because we've almost been on the line

1760
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
for a good half hour talking about making games

1761
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
but before I let you go

1762
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I do always ask the people on our

1763
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
show what games are you

1764
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
playing you know besides the ones you're making

1765
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
what games are you playing these days

1766
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
so can we go around the room there real quick with you three

1767
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
alright one two

1768
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
three GTA 5

1769
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
yeah I've been playing GTA 5 on the PS4

1770
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
that game is astounding

1771
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
no wonder you like these guys

1772
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
listen I don't need the love you guys anymore

1773
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I mean seriously

1774
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
the scope of that game

1775
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
and like the amount of detail they put into

1776
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
it is just unreal

1777
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
they must have

1778
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
actually put human souls into that

1779
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
game to make it run the way it does

1780
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
like the

1781
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
amount of things they network we've been playing

1782
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
it online together and

1783
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
it's just outstanding

1784
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I do not know how

1785
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
they network all this information

1786
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Loki was like a top 100 player on GTA 4

1787
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
yeah I used to play multiplayer

1788
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
a lot on GTA 4

1789
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
a lot a lot but

1790
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I've been playing a lot

1791
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
was it Playstation 4? I know I saw a video

1792
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I don't remember if it's from Playstation 4 or not

1793
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
but yeah we need

1794
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
the hookup online

1795
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
because I haven't played any online yet

1796
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Jeffery what games have you been playing

1797
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
because you probably have a more diverse

1798
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
library than we do

1799
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
well I usually play a lot of

1800
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Steam games lately

1801
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Gauntlet came out not too long ago

1802
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I've been playing the 2014 Gauntlet

1803
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I still play Monaco

1804
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
from time to time

1805
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
that's a really great stealth game

1806
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Monaco was fun

1807
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I actually really was impressed with that game

1808
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
when you started showing that at work

1809
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Jeffery and I used to work together at a place

1810
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
called Play Habit that unfortunately is not around anymore

1811
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
it was really cool

1812
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
the person who ran the place actually

1813
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
came up with the marketing

1814
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
well effectively came up with the marketing slogan

1815
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
that Sega used

1816
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
for so long of

1817
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
blast processing, he was actually the originator

1818
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
of that phrase

1819
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
so that was pretty wild

1820
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
of blast processing?

1821
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I've got an interview with him

1822
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I need to post it online sometime

1823
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
he's giving me permission but I want to make sure

1824
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
it has impact when it happens

1825
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
well you guys are awesome

1826
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
and I love the message you guys carry

1827
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
that I want you to make a game

1828
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
so I want to say something here real quick

1829
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
this is kind of a little bit of an announcement

1830
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
but I want you guys to be able to hear this too

1831
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
because I think you guys will really like this

1832
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
this is kind of like an ongoing theme that's been going on

1833
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
with our show

1834
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
and with Bobby's show and some of the other shows on the network

1835
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
from talking about

1836
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Loki's game and how he's been making a game

1837
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
to when Bobby did the

1838
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Flappy Vog project, it's kind of like a joke

1839
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
thing to when YYR

1840
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
did the O.L.R. Dream

1841
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
maybe you guys probably don't know about this

1842
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
but we have a list of dream games

1843
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
or things we mentioned

1844
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
in Jess, that would be a great game

1845
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and one of our listeners, YYR, actually turned

1846
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
one of those into a game, it was called Pixel Shits

1847
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
and

1848
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
it's something

1849
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
he actually

1850
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
you got to get the link in chat, it's great

1851
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
it's 2600 inspired, YYR please

1852
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
please post the link

1853
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
it's a 2600 inspired game

1854
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
where you go around and you try to stop

1855
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
joggers from running through a park

1856
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
by taking a giant shit

1857
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
oh that's amazing

1858
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
the genius mechanic

1859
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
is that when you run out

1860
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
because you know a person can only do so much

1861
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
there's a little taco cabana in the corner

1862
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
that you go to and refill

1863
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
your mirror

1864
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
oh that's amazing

1865
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
that's where the game went from

1866
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
like LOL to just

1867
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
freaking genius

1868
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
yeah it was great

1869
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
oh no, that's what I love to see

1870
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
people making things like this

1871
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I love silly creative games and stuff

1872
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
the sillier the better

1873
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I want to just put a shout out there

1874
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Jake Kaufman Vert, he's a really great game composer

1875
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
you probably know about him

1876
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
but he made a game called Dick Hand

1877
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
that you probably don't know about

1878
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
definitely check that out

1879
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
that sounds inspired by Cards Against Humanity

1880
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
well

1881
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
the reason why I bring all this up is because

1882
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
we've been doing some talk behind the scenes

1883
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
and I was talking with YYR and I was talking with Bobby

1884
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
and we've decided that we want

1885
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
people to create things

1886
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
just like you guys do

1887
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
we think there needs to be more voices out there making games

1888
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
so we are going to host

1889
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
a vog jam

1890
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
and that's video game jam

1891
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
that's v-i-d-o

1892
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
game jam

1893
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
so it's the vog jam

1894
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
and we just want people to create something dammit

1895
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
so whether you have unity

1896
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
and you're comfortable using unity

1897
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
you want to learn unity

1898
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
you can use that

1899
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
but we're also going to encourage people

1900
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
and if you only feel comfortable making

1901
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
a level in LittleBigPlanet

1902
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
or using RPG Maker

1903
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
then do that

1904
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
we are going to be doing our own game jam here at VOG Network

1905
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and I'm going to give you all some more details

1906
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
in just a little bit

1907
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
we're going to do Iron Chef style

1908
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
where there's going to be a mystery ingredient

1909
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
and we will talk about how we're going to come up with that ingredient

1910
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
as a community next week

1911
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
that is fantastic

1912
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
it's not pixel shit

1913
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
pixel shits will not be the game

1914
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I just want to say that's super awesome

1915
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
game jams are actually what got me started

1916
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
it's not what got me started as a programmer

1917
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
it's what got me started as making games on my own

1918
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
it's what got you started in unity too

1919
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
yeah it is what got me started in unity

1920
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
actually we were going to use

1921
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
a different engine and it didn't work

1922
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
for collaboration so I ended up using unity

1923
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
because a friend of mine said it was really cool

1924
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and the rest is history

1925
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
so yeah

1926
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
game jams are awesome

1927
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
drop us an email

1928
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
we'll promote and we'll be on it

1929
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
we love game jams

1930
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
that's awesome and this is very important too

1931
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
and I want to stress this because there might be some people that feel

1932
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
very overwhelmed any prizes that we do

1933
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
with this game jam we will not be giving away

1934
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
prizes on quality

1935
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
we will only be giving away prizes on

1936
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
participation and I think that's very important

1937
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
because we want to make sure this is a very accessible

1938
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
thing for people to participate with

1939
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
but anyway I just thought

1940
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
you know you guys helped inspire

1941
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
a lot of that conversation that happened behind the scenes

1942
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
this week so you know

1943
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
if you guys want people to make games

1944
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
we want people to make games too and

1945
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
we hope this all comes together and helps that happen

1946
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000

1947
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000

you know maybe I'm not gonna be comfortable with using

2015
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Unity but I know how to use Commodore 64

2016
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
basic I know how to make programs

2017
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
in the little big planet there's some other things I know

2018
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
how to use so I am gonna participate

2019
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
in this game jam YYR

2020
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
has committed to participating in this game jam

2021
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Bobby Blackwolf will be participating

2022
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
in the game jam I'll participate Loki's participating

2023
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
in the game jam I'll just put my game on hold for now

2024
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
in this like video

2025
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
so this is what's gonna happen

2026
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
we're gonna use the time honored

2027
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
scientific method that's proved

2028
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
true in the past 12 years of Orange Lounge

2029
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Radio and that is

2030
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
listless so next

2031
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
week on Orange Lounge Radio we are going to do

2032
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
a listless segment to

2033
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
determine what the mystery

2034
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
ingredient for the game is going to be

2035
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
and that is going to be

2036
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
basically a

2037
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I would say a title but I don't wanna say that

2038
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
that title has to be the name of your game

2039
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
for example

2040
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
cause I don't know like a theme

2041
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
it should be the theme there we go

2042
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
so for example let's

2043
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
say we were to go over to

2044
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
the Orange Lounge Radio list of dream games

2045
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
which we're not gonna do we're gonna come up with something new

2046
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
but just as an example let's say I go to the

2047
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
OLR dream games page and I decide that

2048
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
puzzle sluts is gonna be the theme

2049
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
and we're not gonna throw something

2050
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
that adult at you but puzzle sluts

2051
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
ends up being the theme then you would have to

2052
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
make your game or your level or whatever

2053
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
it is somehow incorporating

2054
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
puzzle sluts into it

2055
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
and whether that's just something that kinda

2056
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
happens on the side or whether that's the focus

2057
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
so it's just like cooking right

2058
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
just like those guys cook with unity

2059
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
this is the mystery ingredient so

2060
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
what is that theme

2061
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
going to be we wanna take

2062
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
suggestions from you guys even though usually

2063
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
with listless it is what

2064
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
DarkSakura, myself and Loki ultimately

2065
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
decide that goes into the pot we

2066
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
wanna take your suggestions

2067
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
so if you have a suggestion

2068
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
you can do one of two things you can e-mail us

2069
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
participate at orangelandstrator.com

2070
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
make sure that subject line says

2071
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
game jam and then tell us

2072
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
what is the mystery ingredient you believe

2073
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
should be included in the game jam

2074
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
or you can comment on the posting of this

2075
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
show over at vognetwork.com

2076
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
just comment and that

2077
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
way the little thumbs up and thumbs down will tell

2078
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
us what we ought to think of using

2079
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
for the theme in listless next

2080
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
week so we will be choosing that mystery ingredient

2081
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
you will have over the holidays until

2082
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
the end of january

2083
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
to submit your project

2084
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
and if you need help hosting

2085
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
even let's say you create a

2086
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
project in unity but you have no where to put it

2087
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
bobby blackwolf has offered help

2088
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
so at vognetwork we can actually

2089
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
post some of those creations for you

2090
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
guys over at vognetwork if you need a

2091
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
place that's not required though if you

2092
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
post something on your own site we

2093
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
just wanna give you the tools we don't want anybody

2094
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
to say well I would have participated but I didn't

2095
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
have a place to host it no no we're gonna

2096
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
solve some of those problems mega.com or

2097
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
whatever it is nowadays mega

2098
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
something though so there you go

2099
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I do wanna say one quick very

2100
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
important thing with the themes

2101
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
cause we gotta get back to the news cause we're running really

2102
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
long tonight with the themes

2103
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
please nothing that is already

2104
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
copyrighted keep that in mind

2105
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
yeah nothing infringing please don't make a Mario

2106
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
game exactly so you can't we

2107
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
can't do like garris does calibrations

2108
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
cannot be the game theme because

2109
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
garris is a character

2110
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
but you can make that game for me personally

2111
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
so keep that in mind we are not

2112
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
out to make sequels it has to be

2113
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
an original idea calibrating with garris

2114
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I'm sure there's already the shakarian calibrator

2115
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
out there somewhere I'm sure there is

2116
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Brad from Paw Culture says what about

2117
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
collaborations I'm

2118
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
always going to refer to the golden rule of the

2119
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
game jam which is create something

2120
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
dammit so if the only way you're gonna

2121
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
be able to create something is to work with somebody else

2122
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
then I'm gonna say yes

2123
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
create something dammit that's the golden

2124
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
rule I'm gonna refer to throughout the game jam

2125
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
so partner up yes

2126
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
just create something dammit

2127
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
to register participation for this weeks

2128
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com

2129
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
use the pass phrase fork

2130
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
alright so

2131
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
we'll have more information we're gonna have a big

2132
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
prize pool there will be

2133
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
no grading done on quality

2134
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
that is ultimately up to the community

2135
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
if one of these games goes viral

2136
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
that is the community that makes

2137
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
that happen but we

2138
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
will be giving out prizes based on participation

2139
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
we have accumulated a

2140
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
crap ton of prizes throughout the year

2141
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
so I don't

2142
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
want to say cause I don't know how many

2143
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
participations we'll get I

2144
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
want to say if I almost want to say

2145
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
everybody who participates will get something

2146
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
but then I go well that's

2147
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
only allowing for like 20 people

2148
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
if we get like 200 submissions which would be

2149
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
amazing boxes I know

2150
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
right so I will say this

2151
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
we are going to try well I will

2152
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
we do know this we have the

2153
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
loot system on vognetwork.com for sure

2154
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
100% everybody will get exclusive

2155
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
loot on vognetwork.com even

2156
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
though it's virtual you'll at least get that little badge

2157
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
of honor that you participated in the game

2158
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
jam the first one which we hope

2159
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
of many now I have a question

2160
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
since I totally

2161
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
don't even realize this is there a way to see what

2162
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
loot other people have on their profile

2163
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
click on their little profile

2164
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
you're already 100% better than playstation 3

2165
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
and playstation home problems with the trophy

2166
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
so there you go

2167
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
100% better

2168
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
we got to get back to some news more info on the game jam next week

2169
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
but submit your ideas but we got to

2170
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
run through the news and I'm going to say

2171
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I'm going to take this a little bit of an accelerated

2172
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
pace just because this first

2173
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
part of the show is running really long so let's talk

2174
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
quickly about street fighter 5

2175
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
street fighter 5 more news is

2176
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
coming out about street fighter 5 and Charlie

2177
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
has been revealed as a character

2178
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
that will be in street fighter 5 Charlie was not

2179
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
in street fighter 4 if I recall

2180
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
you have the pointy hair but Charlie

2181
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
was in what was it alpha?

2182
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
alpha 3?

2183
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
he was in alpha

2184
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
and alpha 2 and alpha 3

2185
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
so they've modernized him a little

2186
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
bit it looks like for this game because we don't see

2187
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
an awful lot of them we only see just kind of

2188
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Charlie wasn't in like

2189
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
cross Tekken was he?

2190
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I don't think so

2191
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
but yeah so Charlie was announced

2192
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
for street fighter 5 which by the way showed

2193
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
off the first footage

2194
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
of the gameplay and literally

2195
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
you know it was like a splash screen that was pressed

2196
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
start and then it went right into a Ryu vs

2197
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Chun-Li battle I

2198
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
thought that was pretty funny what oh just

2199
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
did you watch did you watch all the

2200
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
reactions of the guys going oh my god

2201
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
it's got the oh my god no not that there's

2202
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
there's a part in it like where

2203
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
um Ryu knocks Chun-Li into

2204
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
like at the end of one of the rounds he knocks her

2205
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
into a wall in the kitchen

2206
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
and a bowl of noodles falls on her head

2207
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
and it stays there for the whole next round

2208
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
there's a bowl of noodles on her head

2209
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
it's hilarious

2210
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
yeah people details I love

2211
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
details it's great

2212
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
so people getting excited at that first

2213
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
footage of Street Fighter 5 and

2214
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
yeah there's like a revenge bar at an EX bar

2215
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
and there's I noticed

2216
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
that speaking of getting knocked through the wall

2217
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
then that next stage started

2218
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
in the middle of the room they were in so

2219
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
it's kind of neat how those environments are coming into play

2220
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
as well so I think we'll be having

2221
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Street Fighter 5 news a lot I mean they could

2222
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
announce like a character a week probably leading up to

2223
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
the release we'll see

2224
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
DarkSakura what do you have for us?

2225
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I have some stuff

2226
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
specifically something about Borderlands

2227
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
there's going to be a Borderlands

2228
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
remastered apparently this

2229
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
was information released

2230
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
from the Australian age rating

2231
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
board they didn't

2232
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
actually say exactly what Borderlands it is

2233
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
but there's going to be a Borderlands remastered

2234
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
edition with

2235
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
an MA 15 plus rating

2236
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
supposed to be on Xbox One

2237
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Playstation 4 and likely

2238
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
PC the

2239
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
thought is that it's

2240
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
well at least it's a speculation that it's going to

2241
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
be the original one but honestly

2242
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I think it's all three

2243
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
for the guess see that would

2244
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
be really I mean

2245
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I don't think it would be that hard

2246
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
really to update graphics wise

2247
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
and

2248
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
well yeah they don't have to do anything graphics wise because it's on

2249
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
PC so they already have the high res graphics

2250
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
they just redo the engine for console

2251
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
and

2252
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
port it over probably want to

2253
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
have maybe more smoothing

2254
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
for the PC iteration

2255
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
we talked a lot last week about that whole Final Fantasy

2256
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
7 reveal which is a PC

2257
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
port on the PS4 so we know this

2258
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
is an outlet that a lot of people are using

2259
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
so

2260
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I'd say if you

2261
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
don't have the games yet just keep your eyes open

2262
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
there's of course not exactly

2263
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
a release date on this this is

2264
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
just coming from

2265
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
the Australian ratings

2266
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
board but it's something

2267
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
to think about

2268
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
it's not the only game that's looking like this

2269
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
later in the show we have news of another

2270
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
game so this seems to be

2271
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
could be a theme where

2272
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
a lot of the PS3 classics

2273
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
so to speak end up getting remade for PS4

2274
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
this year alone

2275
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
we've had Tomb Raider, Sleeping Dogs

2276
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
they had

2277
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
well it's a PC port but

2278
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Shadow Warrior came over

2279
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Saints Row

2280
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
4 and

2281
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
God of Hell is going to be in January

2282
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
which I'm totally picking that up again

2283
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
I own it on 4 systems

2284
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
already but I'll buy it again

2285
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
even though I really didn't care for

2286
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
4 too much but

2287
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
whatever

2288
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Grand Theft Auto 5

2289
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
but hell I'll buy that 4 times if I need to

2290
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I'll buy it on PC when it comes out again

2291
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
when you love something enough Loki

2292
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
exactly you'll buy multiple

2293
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
now you understand okay next time

2294
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
you ask me why do you own the

2295
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Mass Effect trilogy 5 different times

2296
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
okay well that's a little

2297
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
different okay let's talk

2298
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
about how that's different one Grand Theft Auto 5

2299
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
on PlayStation 4 is a significant

2300
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
upgrade of Grand Theft Auto the only reason

2301
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I bought it on the other 2 systems

2302
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
in the past was because

2303
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I was going to play it on

2304
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Xbox but then my

2305
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
my boss wanted to play it on

2306
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
PS3 and he promised that we would so

2307
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
play this game multiple times on PS3

2308
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
and we'd just be playing all the time because we'd play

2309
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
tons of Grand Theft Auto 4 and

2310
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
that never happened that's why I bought it on

2311
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
3 systems

2312
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
otherwise it would have been 2 systems and to be fair

2313
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I've sold back my copies on the other systems

2314
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
but if Mass Effect trilogy ends up

2315
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
being one of those games that ends up on PS4 as well

2316
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I know you'll be buying it

2317
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I'm doing it

2318
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
and I guarantee you it will

2319
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
at some point right before

2320
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Mass Effect 4 comes out or whatever they're going to call it

2321
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Loki promised you guys, Loki promised

2322
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
alright let's travel around the world

2323
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
and check out some games we do know are coming

2324
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
out to a store near you although I imagine

2325
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
for most of the world not much right

2326
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Loki? I wasn't going to say

2327
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I haven't even looked at it yet but I'm going to

2328
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
go out on a limb here and say I don't think

2329
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
anything's coming out this week in fact I'm

2330
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
going to say nothing's coming out this week I think

2331
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
digitally I think you get Tetris

2332
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
well digitally there's going to be stuff coming

2333
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
out but I'm not talking digital I'm talking

2334
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
you know physical releases and

2335
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
there is not a

2336
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
thing coming out in fact I would be willing

2337
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
to bet that you won't see anything until January

2338
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
well it is that slow

2339
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
time of the year but going to Japan it's

2340
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
a little bit different they still are trickling out

2341
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000

2406
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000

01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000

2408
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000

there it is

2418
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
alright just a couple more stories for you guys

2419
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
and then the classic game of the week

2420
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Loki

2421
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
so um

2422
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Sega is trying to figure out

2423
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
how to adapt their properties

2424
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
into other forms

2425
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
of media and entertainment

2426
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
including TV

2427
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I'm hoping that the fact that they're hiring

2428
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
this media exec

2429
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
means we're gonna get some better

2430
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
stuff other than Sonic Boom cause I don't

2431
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
know, I don't know if that

2432
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
new cartoon's any good

2433
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
from what I hear but apparently

2434
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
even Choflin

2435
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
is going to, is set to

2436
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
adapt some of

2437
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
their old franchises into

2438
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
you know, television

2439
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
web series, you know

2440
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
you name it, movies

2441
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
they're seeing adaptions of

2442
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Altered Beast, Crazy Taxi

2443
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Shinobi, Streets of Rage

2444
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
and other titles

2445
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I can only think, you know

2446
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
we've seen Sonic so far

2447
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
and I'm just hoping that they reboot

2448
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
that at some point

2449
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
that actually works for them

2450
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
but man, I would like to see some of those old

2451
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Shenmue, Shenmue

2452
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Shenmue

2453
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
come on, lucky hit

2454
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
hits the big screen

2455
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
you know, as weird as it would be

2456
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I would love to see like

2457
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
a Moonwalker series

2458
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
or something like that, even though I understand

2459
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
that's, you know, based off of the Moonwalker film

2460
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I'd still

2461
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
love to see that as a spin-off series

2462
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
or Space Channel 5

2463
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
hello, yeah, that's what Fifth Dream in our chat says

2464
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Space Channel 5 the series

2465
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
YYR in chat says, go home

2466
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Sega, you're drunk

2467
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
or can we do like some

2468
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
you know, not the

2469
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I fear that Crazy Taxi

2470
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
will be it, it's gonna be like really

2471
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
like, just like second-handed

2472
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
can we do like something with like all the Dreamcast

2473
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
you know, characters and stuff

2474
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and like a sort of Captain N type of environment

2475
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
but not stupid

2476
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
you know, can we do something like that, you know, have Ooh La La

2477
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
and maybe, you know, get

2478
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
the nameless characters

2479
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
from Crazy Taxi or whatever

2480
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
and hell, let's throw in some

2481
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
what was it

2482
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
I don't know

2483
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
other series that they had

2484
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
on Dreamcast

2485
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Fifth Dream in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

2486
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
suggests Hatsune Miku the animated series

2487
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
now that one I could actually see happening

2488
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
because Hatsune Miku is a pretty big deal

2489
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
for Sega, so especially overseas

2490
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
so, yeah

2491
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I don't know, maybe

2492
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Daytona

2493
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
do do do do do do

2494
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
don't even

2495
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
alright, well

2496
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
a lot of people cry

2497
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
a lot of people on the internet

2498
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
saying don't even to this

2499
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
character that was announced for Tekken 7

2500
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
and this was

2501
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
a character kind of like

2502
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
a, I guess you could say like a

2503
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
cosplay

2504
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
fan girl, kitty girl

2505
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
the name was Lucky Chloe

2506
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
was the character unveiled during a

2507
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
livestream celebrating the 20th anniversary

2508
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
of the Tekken franchise

2509
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
she's wearing pink cat ears

2510
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
and like a pink

2511
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
like cat paws thing

2512
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
and she's got on like a little black tutu

2513
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
with a tail that actually kind of looks like a cat

2514
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
so I mean she looks just like

2515
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
a cute, you know, anime

2516
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
girl that

2517
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
could show up in the Tekken series, right?

2518
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
maybe she works at a cat girl

2519
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
cafe, perhaps

2520
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
but they announce Lucky Chloe for Tekken

2521
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
and all of a sudden

2522
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
a lot of negativity on the

2523
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
internet get out, but negativity

2524
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
hit the internet

2525
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
and the series producer Katsuhiro

2526
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Harada was alerted

2527
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
to a thread on NeoGaf

2528
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
where a bunch of people were saying

2529
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
things like, God, I hate her already

2530
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
but first off

2531
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
why did you go to NeoGaf?

2532
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
but NeoGaf, they hate everything

2533
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
sorry, not sorry

2534
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I'm just keeping it real, you guys

2535
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
but anyway, I'm sure Twitter

2536
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
was no better, speaking of Twitter

2537
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Harada ended up tweeting out

2538
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
quote, are you Western, only one

2539
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
bulletin board? Hello, small world

2540
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
I'll make muscular and skinhead

2541
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
character for you

2542
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
probably in reference to

2543
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
stereotypes of American characters

2544
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I can see the meme already

2545
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
they have

2546
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
the Heath Ledger Joker

2547
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
sitting there

2548
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Felicia!

2549
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Catgirl, Felicia, and Dark Sockers

2550
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
no one blinks an eye

2551
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
bye Felicia

2552
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
alright, anyway

2553
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
he went on to say that

2554
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
American fans shouldn't

2555
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
be upset because Chloe is just one of the

2556
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
game's many characters

2557
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
which, if I recall

2558
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
involved a fighting

2559
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
panda bear

2560
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
and a wooden dummy

2561
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
a wooden dummy

2562
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
a kangaroo

2563
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
a dinosaur

2564
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
give me a fucking break, this is

2565
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Tekken, people

2566
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
and Yoshimitsu, I mean, come on

2567
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
if a catgirl wants to catgirl, then let her

2568
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
catgirl

2569
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
here's the thing that I have to say, it's his

2570
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
fucking game, he can put whoever

2571
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
whoever the hell he wants in it

2572
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
if you don't like that character, don't play as that

2573
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
character, I don't really care for Dalzim

2574
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I don't play as Dalzim

2575
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
not that I hate the character itself, it's just I don't like the way he controls

2576
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
nobody bonks when Dead or Alive

2577
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
had a Teletubby

2578
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Dead or Alive had a Teletubby?

2579
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
What's his face

2580
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
with the Teletubby outfit?

2581
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
since we are talking about

2582
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
game creation and game creators a lot

2583
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
tonight with that special theme, and I should have asked the guys

2584
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
from Kooky with Unity about this

2585
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
here's a tip

2586
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
from me to the guy here, producer

2587
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
of the Tekken series, don't read the

2588
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
comments, do not ever

2589
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
ever ever read the comments

2590
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
don't read them, don't let NeoGaf

2591
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
influence your game, don't let any

2592
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
website influence your game like that

2593
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
just make a good game

2594
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
that you love, and that is what's most important

2595
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I'm not even going to get into any of this

2596
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
so, but yes, I whole

2597
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
hardly agree, you know, if you're making

2598
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
a diverse set of characters, that's fine

2599
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
this is the character you want to make, that's cool

2600
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
they have other characters, there's

2601
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I don't think Tekken suffers

2602
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
from non-diverse characters, they have

2603
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
plenty of diversity in characters

2604
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
and species

2605
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
and sex

2606
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
orientation, whatever

2607
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
it's

2608
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
that's not even a complaint of that

2609
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
series, it could be Dead or

2610
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Alive, I mean that's, you know

2611
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
a little bit worse

2612
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Rama in our chatroom over at live.fognetwork.com says

2613
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I'm amused at the cosplay

2614
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
fandom who got mad because they assumed

2615
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Lucky Chloe was based off of Jessica

2616
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Negri

2617
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I hope I said the name right, I don't even know who she is

2618
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
she's the one that did the

2619
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Lollipop Chainsaw

2620
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
cosplay, and she's down on her stuff too

2621
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
sorry, I believe that she's also

2622
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
the one though who did

2623
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I may be getting her confused

2624
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
but she also did cosplay in Blackface

2625
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
at the end of the, oh, well

2626
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
at the end of the day, at the end of the day

2627
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
if this was inspired by a real

2628
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
life person or whatever, so what

2629
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
so what

2630
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I mean, god, they put that one girl

2631
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
in Mass Effect... Law? Hello?

2632
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Yeah, right? Law?

2633
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I mean

2634
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
No, he's totally original, not inspired

2635
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
by anybody named Bruce Lee

2636
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
They put that one IGN girl in Mass Effect 3

2637
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
and it didn't ruin the game

2638
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Who's did, uh...

2639
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
It might not have been her, by the way

2640
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
I might be confusing her with somebody else

2641
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Yeah, alright, yeah, don't start

2642
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
rumors here, I'm just kidding

2643
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
No, Rama told me who it was

2644
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
but anyway

2645
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
No, who I'd want to see a fighting game done by

2646
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Rama clarifies that wasn't her

2647
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I know, it was somebody else though that looks

2648
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
very similar to her

2649
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I would love to see a fighting game done by Platinum Games

2650
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
That would be fucking amazing with all their character designs

2651
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
You never know

2652
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Alright, let's

2653
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
travel back to a time when things were

2654
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
simple, because, like, we're gonna go back to

2655
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
a time when, you know what, who

2656
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
knows what it looks like, because it's a big square box

2657
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
moving around your television

2658
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Alright, maybe we're not talking about a game

2659
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
that old this week, but we are gonna take

2660
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
a trip to the vault, where Dark Soccer's gonna

2661
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
open up the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey

2662
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
you should show a little respect

2663
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
to the games that came before you

2664
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
This is the classic game of the week for this week

2665
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Dark Soccer, what'd you pick?

2666
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Well, my whole logic

2667
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
behind this was trying to find a game

2668
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
that was ten years old

2669
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
that people would go, holy shit, that's ten years old

2670
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
So, I picked

2671
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Silent Hill 4 The Room

2672
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Holy shit, that's ten years old?

2673
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Yes, it is

2674
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
At any rate

2675
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
this one

2676
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
was published by Konami

2677
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
of course, developed by Team Silent

2678
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
It came out in

2679
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Japan in June 2004, and in

2680
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
North America and Europe in September

2681
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
This was at my

2682
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
second or third E3

2683
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
and they had the whole

2684
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
big kitchen set up and everything, it was really awesome

2685
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I have pictures of it somewhere

2686
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
But this one, instead of being set

2687
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
specifically in Silent Hill

2688
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
is set in a town called South Ashfield

2689
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
and it follows this dude named

2690
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Harry Townsend around

2691
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
He's locked in his apartment

2692
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
and he finds different ways to

2693
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
escape through his bathroom

2694
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
through other ways, and

2695
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
goes through all these different craziness

2696
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
where he's chasing an undead serial killer

2697
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
named Walter

2698
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
because Walter is totally

2699
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
a serial killer's name, don't you think?

2700
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
A little bit, yeah

2701
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
So basically

2702
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
you've got the one save point

2703
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
which is his room

2704
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
The room will restore his health

2705
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
but there are

2706
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
hauntings that happen

2707
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
in the room during the second part of the game

2708
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Whatever you do, don't

2709
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
get the Robbie the Rabbit

2710
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
to take him back to your house

2711
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Seriously, it will fuck you up

2712
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
He also is

2713
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
spending the second half of the game

2714
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
helping his neighbor Eileen

2715
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
who

2716
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
she has to go around with him

2717
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
She takes damage as she gets

2718
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
possessed over and over again

2719
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
and so basically

2720
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
however much damage that she takes

2721
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
directly affects the ending

2722
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
that you get

2723
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
So

2724
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
basically though

2725
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
you beat shit up

2726
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
You can shoot things

2727
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
You've got different

2728
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
talismans as well that can protect you from damage

2729
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
can protect your

2730
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
room from being haunted

2731
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
and you can

2732
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
charge your melee attacks

2733
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
You can actually do more damage

2734
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
You also have unkillable ghosts

2735
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
that are

2736
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Walter Sullivan's victims

2737
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
and the ghosts can hurt you

2738
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
and can only be nullified by two items

2739
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
and you can also

2740
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
exercise hauntings from your apartment

2741
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
with those same items

2742
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
and you can knock down

2743
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
ghosts

2744
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It's basically two bullets that will knock them down

2745
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
or you pin them permanently with a sword

2746
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
So there are certain

2747
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
ways you can kill things

2748
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
So there's also

2749
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
another

2750
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
character that actually you see

2751
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
I don't remember how many

2752
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Well I'm sure everyone remembers the

2753
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
remakes of

2754
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
the songs they did for DDR from this game

2755
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
but

2756
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
one of the characters who

2757
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
dies early on in the game is in the

2758
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
beginning

2759
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
is in the video

2760
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
with Cynthia

2761
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
but I mean

2762
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
the game is

2763
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
it's weird

2764
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
It's one of the last of the good Silent Hill games

2765
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
And then of course

2766
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
don't worry

2767
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
you also get the special endings

2768
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
Well actually

2769
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
in this one

2770
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
actually I'm wrong

2771
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
this one does not have the UFO ending

2772
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I was going to say I thought it

2773
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Yeah this one didn't have the UFO

2774
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
It's the first one that didn't have the UFO ending

2775
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Oh bummer

2776
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
You have

2777
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
four endings

2778
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Mother, Eileen's death

2779
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
The

2780
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Twenty One Sacrament

2781
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
and

2782
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
hold on because I know I've never gotten the dog

2783
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
not the dog but the UFO ending

2784
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Yeah there's no UFO ending

2785
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
There's not a disco party ending?

2786
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
No there should be a UFO ending

2787
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
PT better have a dog ending

2788
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I know right

2789
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
There's actually a picture

2790
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
of

2791
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
how they set up the whole kitchen

2792
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
thing

2793
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
which is not a very good picture

2794
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I'll have to find a better one for the chat room

2795
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
but the soundtrack

2796
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
is just really amazing

2797
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
of course like all the Silent Hill soundtracks

2798
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
that were done by Yamaoka

2799
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
The

2800
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Japanese soundtrack had a second

2801
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
disc that had

2802
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
music

2803
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
done by Yamaoka

2804
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
that was done to reading of

2805
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
traditional Japanese stories and then the

2806
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
American version had 13

2807
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
exclusive tracks and

2808
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
remixes and then there was

2809
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Your Rain that was redone for DVR

2810
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
and

2811
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
there was also a

2812
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
UMD out called The Silent Hill Experience

2813
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Track 22

2814
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
was also called

2815
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
No Way to Escape

2816
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
and it was a special recording for the soundtrack

2817
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
so

2818
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
there you go I have picked

2819
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Silent Hill

2820
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
4th Room

2821
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
probably like I said one of the last

2822
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
good Silent Hill games

2823
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I haven't played it since the game first came out

2824
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I think I still have your copy

2825
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
On what? Xbox right?

2826
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
No I thought it was

2827
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Yeah it was

2828
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
No I had it on Xbox

2829
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
I remember playing the game when I was living with

2830
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Loki I must have been 10 years ago I was living with Loki

2831
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
and I got so scared at one part and Loki

2832
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
looks over and goes what the hell is going on over there shut up

2833
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I didn't say that

2834
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Yes you did!

2835
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I would never tell you to shut up

2836
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I may have inquired what's going on

2837
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Alright walking into

2838
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
studio a connoisseur

2839
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
of the Silent Hill series

2840
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
a friend of the show

2841
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Shana Lee goes here in studio with us

2842
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
So I have to talk about this for a second

2843
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
Is there a dog ending yes or no?

2844
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
No it only has 4 endings

2845
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
That was the start

2846
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
of the downfall

2847
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
That's what I should have done

2848
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
as the fortune cookie

2849
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
You go bark bark bark bark bark bark bark

2850
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I heard there talk of

2851
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
your reign being in

2852
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Silent Hill in DDR

2853
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
it did not get mentioned at least by the time

2854
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I got up that there was another Silent Hill 4 song

2855
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
in DDR

2856
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Did you guys talk about that?

2857
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
I don't think so

2858
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
No Shana

2859
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Is that the one from 3?

2860
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
No no not in PS2 DDR

2861
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
UltraMix

2862
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
2

2863
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
has

2864
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
from the US CD sampler

2865
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
the remix of Waver

2866
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
from

2867
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
cause that was all my doing

2868
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and then they did a really bad cut of it

2869
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
so I feel bad in a way

2870
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
but I do not feel that bad cause I like that song

2871
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
So you pushed to get that song in the game and then

2872
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I'm the only one that said anything about that song

2873
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
and they brought it into the game

2874
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Yay Shane

2875
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Well there you go

2876
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
So who knew you had a little piece of the classic game of the week

2877
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
How does it make you feel to hear that Silent Hill 4 is 10 years old

2878
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Really old

2879
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Cause I remember that E3

2880
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
That was my first E3

2881
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Also remember we had

2882
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
the

2883
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
scoop on that song

2884
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
We had the world premiere of your reign

2885
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
from DDR and that was Shane who

2886
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
made that all happen

2887
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
We had to talk over half of it for people recording it

2888
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Yes cause that was back in the day

2889
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
when people would do that

2890
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
People were obsessed with DDR

2891
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
And then

2892
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I got a bajillion copies of the sampler

2893
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
because of Dan

2894
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
And that's actually what happened

2895
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
is that Shane had an early

2896
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
print of that sampler

2897
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
so that's how we were able to use it

2898
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
And I want to say

2899
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
cause that's one of my favorite Silent Hills

2900
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I love 4

2901
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
The scariest ones cause I don't like Walter chasing me around

2902
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
It's not fun

2903
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
When that game came out in Japan

2904
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I used an import site

2905
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
to import that game

2906
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
overnight

2907
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
weekend just so I could have the CD

2908
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
that came with it for a car trip

2909
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I was taking on that Saturday

2910
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
How much did that

2911
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
set you back?

2912
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Well the game I think itself at the time was maybe like 60 or 70

2913
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
and it was the collector's edition

2914
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
which made it a little more expensive

2915
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Pretty sure it was like 180

2916
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
at that point to hear the CD

2917
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
You know what? I've done that

2918
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Because when Rival Schools

2919
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
the evolution for Rival Schools came out

2920
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
I had that shit

2921
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
I paid 120 bucks for that

2922
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Alright

2923
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Well we gotta go to break you guys

2924
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
because we still have plenty of show coming up

2925
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
and we're like 2 hours into the show

2926
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
so we're gonna skedaddle through part B

2927
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
so we can get to your calls, your emails and much more

2928
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

2929
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
right after this

2930
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2931
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
live on this Sunday evening

2932
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
December the 14th of 2014

2933
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
the 579th episode of our show

2934
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
We're running a little long tonight

2935
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
because we had an awesome interview

2936
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
with the guys from Cooking with Unity

2937
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
and you know what? Can't complain

2938
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
if that's gonna hold us and make us run a little long

2939
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
it's for damn good reason

2940
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
as you know, encouraging people to get out there

2941
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
and create and make games

2942
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
it was a great interview, a great time

2943
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
We are gonna try to make up a little of the time

2944
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
here by running through some more news

2945
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
here with our rapid fire news

2946
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Loki! Yes, so let's talk a little bit

2947
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
about free stuff

2948
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
and this is awesome

2949
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
You know, Origin does

2950
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
these kind of free games

2951
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
for a while, on the house

2952
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
they call it, and they've been swapping

2953
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
out different games and pretty much

2954
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
this is my entire Origin collection anyways

2955
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
but SimCity 2000 is now up for grabs

2956
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
so you can

2957
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
get that for free if you have

2958
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
the Origin client installed on your system

2959
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
and check it out

2960
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
and then I guess they said

2961
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
normally they're also offering

2962
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
I guess the $5 special edition

2963
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
oh, it was the $5 special edition

2964
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
that they were offering on the house

2965
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
pretty cool

2966
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
so go check it out, rather old SimCity game

2967
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
and it's not a bad SimCity game

2968
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
and then of course

2969
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
with the popularity of

2970
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Theatrythm Final Fantasy

2971
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
we are now gonna be seeing

2972
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Theatrythm Dragon Quest

2973
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
as a next game coming out

2974
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
from Square Enix

2975
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
kind of along the same lines

2976
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
except now instead of music from the Final Fantasy series

2977
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
you'll have music from the Dragon Quest series

2978
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
and it's expected now

2979
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
to be coming out in Japan

2980
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
on the 3DS

2981
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
March 26, 2015

2982
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
there's yet ones coming over the west

2983
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
but you better believe it probably will at some point

2984
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
well, I assume some of the music

2985
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
will come from Dragon Quest X

2986
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
which is a game we don't even have here yet

2987
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
but I guess Theatrythm Curtain Call

2988
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
had some Final Fantasy games that weren't out here

2989
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
either yet anyway

2990
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
with the Type-0

2991
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I don't know, I don't think it's as sure of a thing

2992
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
as you seem to think

2993
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I think that they would bring it over here

2994
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I hope so, if nothing else

2995
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
just freaking make it a digital only game

2996
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
and buy it, exactly

2997
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
and then Final Fantasy

2998
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
X and X-2

2999
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
are getting another

3000
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
well, a port

3001
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
of the HD remaster

3002
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
so I don't even know how much better it's going to look

3003
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
but it's going to be coming now to

3004
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
PlayStation 4

3005
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
and they said that it's going to be priced

3006
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
at $50

3007
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
so next spring

3008
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
PlayStation 4, Final Fantasy X and X-2

3009
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
almost pretty much a year since the last one

3010
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
was released on PlayStation 3

3011
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
so

3012
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I don't know, I'll check it out I guess

3013
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
they haven't really said what's going to be unique about it

3014
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
other than that there's going to be some system exclusive features

3015
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
thanks

3016
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
that's very vague

3017
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
I worry when they say

3018
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
system exclusive features

3019
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
that means share play

3020
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
and broadcasting on Twitch

3021
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
because those are features that are built into the system

3022
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I really would take that

3023
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
to mean nothing more than

3024
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
just things that are on the PS4 that aren't on the PS3

3025
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I think that they're just porting it, I don't think it's going to look any better

3026
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
I would not

3027
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
get your hopes up about this at all

3028
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
and then

3029
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
unless you have a PS4 and not a PS3

3030
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
then get your hopes up

3031
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
and then finally they've confirmed that the

3032
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Final Fantasy XV demo will be

3033
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
exclusive to day one copies of Type 0

3034
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
HD

3035
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
it will not be coming out separately

3036
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
they're saying it's intended to be

3037
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
a special gift for those who purchase

3038
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
early

3039
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
so pre-order that game if you want it

3040
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
the demo

3041
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
and they're saying that

3042
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
is that going to be coming to North America as well

3043
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
or is that just the Japanese copies

3044
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
because I'm not really sure yet on that

3045
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Final Fantasy XV

3046
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
or I should say Final Fantasy

3047
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Type 0 HD

3048
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
March 17

3049
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
2015

3050
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
lots of stuff to look forward to

3051
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
and we have to buy an early

3052
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
copy so I can play the demo

3053
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
it looks good

3054
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I would have bought the game anyway

3055
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
but for the demo

3056
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
certainly that just cements it

3057
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
alright well moving on to some other quick news here

3058
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
as far as expos and conventions

3059
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
go GX3

3060
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
which was once known as

3061
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
GamerX3

3062
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
GX3 has been dated for next

3063
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
year this is now moving from a

3064
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
summer convention to a winter convention

3065
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
we knew that was going to happen but it is now

3066
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
dated December 11th through 13th

3067
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
and they have a new venue

3068
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
they have moved it out of San Francisco

3069
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
it will now be in San Jose

3070
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
at the San Jose area

3071
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
is that less of a drive or

3072
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
more of a drive?

3073
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
it's more of a drive but quicker because of traffic

3074
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
and less of a cost ideally

3075
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
yeah and actually they're saying

3076
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
they haven't said officially but they're saying that the rooms

3077
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
will be like $100 cheaper a night

3078
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
this year so that's already

3079
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
which is funny you know what's funny if you go back and listen

3080
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
to some of the talk I said

3081
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
on an earlier show when I was kind of summarizing GamerX

3082
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I said they really should think about moving it to

3083
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
San Jose and they can have it

3084
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
there's the convention center and all the hotels right there

3085
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
well guess where the Marriott is?

3086
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
it's one of the hotels connected to the convention center

3087
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
so I like to think

3088
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
I called it and maybe I helped

3089
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
see I used to say like Santa Clara

3090
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
would have been a good place but now that they built the Niner

3091
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
stadium right next to it that's probably not good anymore

3092
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
and you know there are some people are very

3093
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
happy to hear it's moving to San Jose because it's closer

3094
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
to him some people where San Francisco is closer

3095
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
not as happy to hear about it

3096
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I think at the end of the day

3097
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
you know you don't hear a lot of bad stuff about

3098
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
this con by the way disclosure

3099
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
or whatever or encouragement VOG

3100
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
network is a sponsor of GX3

3101
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
we will have a table at the show

3102
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
myself and Dark Soccer are for sure going

3103
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I'm hoping Loki can go depending on

3104
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
the situation we'll see I have a year notice

3105
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
just for one day if nothing else

3106
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I would like to go I haven't been to a con

3107
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
in I don't know

3108
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
a very long time

3109
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
well you'd have a good time here so

3110
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
again it's December 11-13 at the San Jose

3111
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Marriott and tickets are available right

3112
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
now and they have all different

3113
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
levels and platforms right now the cheapest

3114
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
is $70

3115
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
to $5.95 but if you really do want to

3116
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
go Loki let's talk off air because

3117
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I have an opportunity for you

3118
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
alright

3119
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
that is that so GX3

3120
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
will see you there in December

3121
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
moving on to some more stories about

3122
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
The Witcher 3 is up next

3123
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Witcher 3 got delayed and

3124
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
this is what I think the second time

3125
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
this game has been delayed it's been pushed back

3126
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
now from February to

3127
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
May 19th is the new date

3128
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
and a big apology letter going

3129
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
up on the Witcher.com the official site

3130
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
we owe you an apology we set the release

3131
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
day too hastily it's a hard lesson

3132
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
wanted to take heart for the future you know what

3133
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
you know what exactly I rather

3134
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
you push it back like EA

3135
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
do with Dragon Age Inquisition and Battlefield

3136
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
and have it be a good game when it comes out

3137
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
then to put it out like Assassin's Creed

3138
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
you know I don't

3139
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
we'll wait the extra three months

3140
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I realize you're going to get shit from Twitter now

3141
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
like oh you pushed it back again

3142
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
can't make your deadline

3143
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
but when the game comes out if the game kicks

3144
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
a lot of ass then people

3145
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
are going to shut the hell up about the delays

3146
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
and enjoy the game or Grand Theft Auto

3147
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
right Loki that series never gets delayed

3148
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
well yeah exactly and

3149
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
it's not and people aren't complaining

3150
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
because well they're just complaining because

3151
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
they don't get to play as early as they'd like

3152
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
to and that's really you know

3153
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
that's not a bad thing

3154
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
alright and lastly

3155
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
it's your last chance to check out

3156
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
After Burner Climax

3157
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
now this game came out a little while ago

3158
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
but it is going to be delisted from

3159
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network

3160
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
on Christmas Eve December 24th

3161
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
so if you were at all interested

3162
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
in the game you might want to grab it because again

3163
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
it will be pulled on December 24th

3164
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
and you will not be able to buy it

3165
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
if you should accidentally delete the game

3166
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
or something you can download it again

3167
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
that won't be a problem but this has to do

3168
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
with some of the license

3169
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
agreements between Sega and the

3170
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
aircraft makers of some of the

3171
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
planes that are in the game those license agreements are

3172
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
expiring so much like

3173
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Outrun got delisted

3174
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
and you know some other things that have licensed

3175
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
content and they get delisted

3176
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
that's why it is fictional aircraft

3177
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
that are like those aircraft

3178
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
fictional aircraft

3179
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
that's why Ridge Racer was so cool because they have fictional

3180
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
cars or Punch Out when they just replaced

3181
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Mike Tyson with Mr. Dream it was easy

3182
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
but anyway alright well whatever

3183
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
they got to do what they got to do so After Burner

3184
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
if you want to get that last chance Dark Sakura

3185
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
we do have

3186
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
other news

3187
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
there is something going to be

3188
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
on the Virtual Console only in Japan

3189
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
and that is Vampire Hunter

3190
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000

alright let's go to

3248
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
the FUGL question of the week

3249
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
it's my vehicle

3250
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
ha ha

3251
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
each week we visit

3252
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Facebook and Google Plus

3253
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
you slam that together you get FUGL and we ask

3254
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
a question of our communities

3255
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
and tonight we wanted to know you know we were talking about creation

3256
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
tonight we knew that was going to be a theme

3257
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
of the show tonight so we asked our audience

3258
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
what's something you've created

3259
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
in the video game world did you program a small

3260
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
game or work on a large one maybe you made

3261
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
levels for a game of yours what did you

3262
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
create we also kind of put in there if you really

3263
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
really really haven't made anything

3264
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
a. we hope you start

3265
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
b. what do you hope to create someday

3266
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
so a couple

3267
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
different questions there depending on your situation

3268
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
act deaf starts us off on Google Plus

3269
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
saying the closest I've been to video game

3270
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
programming has been translation

3271
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
I haven't been directly involved in it but I

3272
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
helped some friends with translations and editing

3273
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
hey you know what important

3274
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
very important I wouldn't have got to play

3275
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Final Fantasy 5 when I did if it hadn't been

3276
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
for some people translating the original

3277
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Super Nintendo ROM

3278
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
translation didn't end up perfect but at least it got me

3279
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
through the game so translation important

3280
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
role makes the game more accessible to people

3281
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Redertainment in chat

3282
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
saying there's a book I put out a couple years

3283
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
ago that no one read called volume 11

3284
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
when I originally dreamed it up it was supposed to be

3285
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
a stealth action game complete with long sections

3286
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
spent sneaking around and trying to avoid groups

3287
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
of people looking to kill you and all of

3288
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
your people since I have no visual

3289
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
artistic skill and coding is hard

3290
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
volume 11 became a

3291
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
book so interesting you had like a game

3292
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
idea that ultimately you poured into a book

3293
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
very interesting

3294
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
let's check out some of the answers over on

3295
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Facebook Raginator says back in my elementary

3296
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
school days I modded

3297
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
an edutainment typing game

3298
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
originally called turtle trot

3299
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
during the down time at the end of

3300
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
computer class I made it a very

3301
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
obscene pervy renaming it turtle

3302
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
twat and the game talked dirty to

3303
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000

unexpected twat oh what

3307
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Raginator making a game out of poop and

3308
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
fart jokes is unexpected I beg

3309
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
to differ

3310
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
no I mean just I was

3311
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
the word twat to me

3312
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
is intensely hilarious

3313
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
and whenever I hear it

3314
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I just

3315
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
twat are you talking about I can't hear you

3316
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I thought you live on twat avenue

3317
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
that was the old one sorry

3318
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
anyway one thing I

3319
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
wish to make is a new OLR dream

3320
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
game a moral combat clone or parody

3321
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
featuring wilford brimley the golden

3322
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000

3323
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
landsbury etcetera

3324
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
which I entitled in the chat room earlier

3325
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
as smash tv land

3326
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000

monty boggs says in banjo

3329
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
kazooie nuts and bolts there was a mission

3330
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
to defend a statue from enemy planes for a

3331
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
set time instead of building

3332
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
a combative plane as most would I

3333
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
created a giant cone cover with

3334
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
propellers to simply cover the statue

3335
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
and absorb all the damage that

3336
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
game was fantastic at rewarding

3337
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
creativity so kind of

3338
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
talking about a game there that has

3339
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
you create as part of the game

3340
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
mechanics

3341
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
febreeze mentions on facebook

3342
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I programmed a version of the tron light

3343
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
cycle game for a school project

3344
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I really want to pick up programming again but don't know

3345
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
what to choose there's so many programming

3346
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
languages I have no idea where to start or

3347
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
which is the most useful well I hope you got something

3348
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
out of tonight's show I do have

3349
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
a dream game I want to make a pure

3350
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
sega arcade racer like daytona

3351
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
sega rally and

3352
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
those awesome games well surely

3353
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
he knows about that kickstarter from a few

3354
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
months ago right yes exactly

3355
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
that looks pretty awesome and

3356
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
er says I did some flash games in high school as

3357
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
part of my web design class pretty much

3358
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
all were clones of existing games for

3359
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
example one was a mario clone where

3360
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
you played as link nintendo ripped me

3361
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
off for nes remix now

3362
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I know he said that comment very tongue in cheek

3363
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
but it made me think of when people used to hack roms

3364
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
like people put

3365
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
zelda in mario because they would hack the

3366
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
rom and put the little

3367
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
picture of link in there although

3368
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
I realize it's a questionable

3369
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
legality territory the reality

3370
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
is people have done it and some people got

3371
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
their start doing it and of course

3372
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
you know somebody made like super penis

3373
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
brothers where they were all naked yep

3374
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
they did we played all of those roms

3375
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
to see who they were and and they're all

3376
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
garbage and

3377
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
uh

3378
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
dark tetsuya says I've been writing games off

3379
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
and on ever since I learned basic on the apple

3380
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
2 series back in the day wrote some simple

3381
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
dragons lair esque text adventures

3382
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
uh twine sounds

3383
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
right up your alley dark tetsuya because that's uh

3384
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
what that does text adventures uh lately

3385
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I've been tinkering with programs like the games

3386
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
factory writing some simple arcade

3387
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
style games and other game makers the

3388
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
most recent of which is called construct 2

3389
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
the first paid edition is pretty

3390
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
pricey but the free one does plenty

3391
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
if you're just getting your feet wet

3392
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
and lastly steven d on

3393
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
facebook says I was 8 in

3394
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
1984 and my friend's father made

3395
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
us a little stand up arcade cabinet with a back

3396
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
board to be used for the screen we

3397
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
drilled pathways in the back board and would

3398
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
take leds on hangers

3399
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
and move them around like spaceships

3400
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
can't remember what we did for the controller but

3401
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
it was awesome

3402
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
so there you go a lot of uh cool little

3403
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
answers very diverse the way people have been

3404
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
making their games uh on

3405
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
facebook and google plus

3406
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
uh hopefully lots more people gonna

3407
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
participate in our game jam

3408
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
the vog game jam all the details

3409
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
next week and you know I realized

3410
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
something by the way I as much

3411
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
as I would love to give a tangible prize

3412
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
to everybody that participates I have to

3413
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
pay shipping on everything out of my own pocket

3414
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
so it probably it probably will be limited

3415
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
to like 10 something

3416
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
and we can take any leftovers

3417
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
that we have still we'll take with us to

3418
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
gx next year I have lots of steam codes left

3419
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
over so there's always digital stuff

3420
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
that's true there is a lot of digital stuff

3421
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
so we'll try to put it all together this week

3422
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
honestly talk of this idea

3423
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
started on thursday

3424
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
and I loved it so much I was like we

3425
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
need to make it happen and bobby put a good

3426
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
idea out there he said well people

3427
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
should probably have the holidays to work on their

3428
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
projects cause a lot of people have downtime

3429
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
from work I was like oh crap you're right

3430
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
so we better make it happen fast so

3431
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
we will anyway let's

3432
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
get on to some more news tonight

3433
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
we have a few more stories for you guys Loki

3434
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
alright so as much as I like

3435
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
the call of duty series the last few years it's been

3436
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
kind of not doing as well as

3437
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
it used to it used to be kind of record

3438
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
setting each year where it would sell

3439
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
out you know beyond

3440
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
what you know the previous years edition

3441
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
did and unfortunately that

3442
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
kind of gone downhill since

3443
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I want to say black ops

3444
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
2 which is sad

3445
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
because black ops 2 is actually a really good title

3446
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
but they're saying

3447
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
basically advance warfare

3448
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
is down

3449
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
27% year over year

3450
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
and that's

3451
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
that's not good and that's

3452
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
kind of sad cause I thought that was gonna be a

3453
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
little bit more of an interesting

3454
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
game but I guess people

3455
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
just aren't getting the call of duty as much as

3456
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
ever and honestly they're just

3457
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
milking it too much maybe they need to

3458
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
sleep it for a year maybe

3459
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I think it

3460
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
they tried some different stuff with it but it

3461
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
still did feel a little bit like black ops

3462
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
2

3463
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I don't know it's

3464
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
it's an interesting game it's just

3465
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
and

3466
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
maybe it's just not peeling maybe it's

3467
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
not different enough year over year where people

3468
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
are like yeah I don't really need to

3469
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
get this one I

3470
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
can understand that and honestly like

3471
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
even like the new mechanics in the game it does

3472
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
enhance some things but it's not

3473
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
you know completely

3474
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
different but I don't know

3475
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I mean you know like Madden

3476
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
and stuff like that they enhance things and they don't really

3477
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
change everything so

3478
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
people still buy that

3479
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
it did well it still was you know one of the

3480
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
best selling games this year it's just

3481
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
unfortunately not a lot of people

3482
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
are buying it I think also still

3483
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
we're kind of in that phase where maybe

3484
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
people are picking it up right now because they're

3485
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
gonna pick it up on another console later on once

3486
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
they decide to you know bump up

3487
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
to a current gen console

3488
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
maybe that's the situation

3489
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
or maybe they're skipping it this year because

3490
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
they're saving up for that console or maybe

3491
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
because there's too many fucking games that

3492
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
come out you know in the month of November and

3493
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
October I think it

3494
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
could be a lot of those things or

3495
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
you know there was this big shooter game that came

3496
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
out that was kind of an MMO called Destiny

3497
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
that did really well

3498
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
so I think

3499
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
a lot of those factors play into it but

3500
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
I think if next year if it's

3501
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
kind of still

3502
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
on the down turn then maybe they have

3503
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
milked all they can out of it

3504
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I don't think that they have

3505
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
but maybe I'm sure

3506
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
they'll try to figure it out maybe go back to

3507
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
World War II again I don't know

3508
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
do something different

3509
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
maybe you should fucking buy the rights

3510
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
of time splitters and put out a new time splitters

3511
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
game because that's really what I would want to see

3512
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
now you're fishing now you're fishing I know

3513
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
well maybe people aren't playing the new Call of Duty

3514
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
because they can't let go of the shooters they've

3515
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
been playing for like seven years now

3516
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
one of those big popular

3517
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
shooter games is Team Fortress 2

3518
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
it's also popular because

3519
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
it's free and Team Fortress 2

3520
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
is going to be getting a new

3521
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I guess update

3522
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
I don't want to say expansion because they're calling it an update

3523
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
but the update is called End of the Line

3524
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
and I went oh does that mean this is

3525
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
the last one and Team Fortress 3

3526
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
imminent? Not really

3527
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
can't count to three

3528
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
even though End of the Line will have

3529
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
21 cosmetic items

3530
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
and it'll have a new taunt for the pyro

3531
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
and a new multi-class melee weapon

3532
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
and apparently a big

3533
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
focus on ducks

3534
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
like collectible ducks and duck tokens

3535
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
and so forth okay this whole

3536
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
thing is actually based on a community film

3537
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
that's actually also called

3538
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
End of the Line so they were

3539
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
oh my god is it

3540
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
oh that sounds awesome then because that film

3541
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
was fucking rad so

3542
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
yeah it's a fan film that runs

3543
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
14 minutes on End of the Line

3544
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
yes yes please more

3545
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
of that that is pretty that is pretty rad

3546
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
it is something that they are

3547
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
building into the

3548
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
official canon then of Team Fortress 2

3549
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
so lots of folks looking forward

3550
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
to that and bless Valve

3551
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
for keeping this game going that

3552
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
honestly you know with

3553
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
some of those Team Fortress 2 videos

3554
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
you're missing that VoG Team Fortress server

3555
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
right about now aren't you no no no

3556
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I once again

3557
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
too much stuff to play but I

3558
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
honestly would love to see a

3559
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Team Fortress movie I think that would be awesome

3560
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
because they have some really great characters

3561
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
they have a lot of machinima they do but

3562
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I would love to see something that was like a few

3563
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
hours long that was actually in theaters you know

3564
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Seattle in our chat room not a fan saying

3565
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
End of the Line was such a disappointment

3566
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

3567
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
they should have partnered with Disney and done

3568
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
End of Line as DLC to dress up your characters

3569
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
as Tron characters that's what I said

3570
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
when I first saw the story I was like

3571
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
oh shit is Tron in Team Fortress oh

3572
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
it's End of the Line

3573
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
got it that's what everybody says

3574
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
our guild in Final Fantasy is actually

3575
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
called End of Line and it's because of Tron

3576
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
but we get like people

3577
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
send tells their ass all the time shouldn't it be

3578
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
End of the Line

3579
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
no in this case

3580
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
it is End of Line because it is a quote

3581
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
from a movie anyway

3582
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
and also it was a legit

3583
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
statement command

3584
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
I know I know

3585
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
anyhow Dark Soccer

3586
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
you got some legit news for us

3587
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
I do

3588
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
actually you know

3589
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Valve had the big holiday

3590
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
auction thing going on

3591
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
they actually had to shut it down

3592
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
and restart the holiday auction

3593
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
because

3594
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
there were some activity done

3595
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
by a few people

3596
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
where they were

3597
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
basically just

3598
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
let me

3599
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
start over basically they figured out

3600
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
there was a Reddit thread that said

3601
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
that there were some weird

3602
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
things going on basically that you could

3603
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
use a duplication exploit

3604
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
and people were exploiting it

3605
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
and they were just getting tons

3606
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
of freebies

3607
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
you know by

3608
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
actually even creating a second hand market

3609
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
to sell gems for

3610
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
money so

3611
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
basically Valve just

3612
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
rebooted it started it over

3613
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
and have been doing

3614
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
the cases

3615
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
item by item so

3616
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
they just started it over they're like

3617
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
fuck you guys for doing this we're just starting it over

3618
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
screw you guys I'm going home

3619
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
well yeah

3620
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
no but I mean

3621
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
it sucks that people have to

3622
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I don't know anyway

3623
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
if you've got a system that someone

3624
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I know that has a manipulation

3625
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
in it I know

3626
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I know it just sucks it's the holidays

3627
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
people

3628
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
people are monsters I know

3629
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
it sucks

3630
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
alright so twitch kind

3631
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
of going the route of esports

3632
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
because they know that that's popular

3633
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
and hell a lot of people

3634
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
stream their esports stuff on

3635
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
twitch so it makes sense

3636
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
that they've acquired

3637
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Goodgame which I guess

3638
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
they're saying it's a company that the world's

3639
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
first full service agency dedicated

3640
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
to esports and live video game

3641
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
broadcasting communities

3642
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
so is that like a recruiter

3643
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I don't know but basically

3644
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
there is a good game has an amazing

3645
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
reputation in the industry for its

3646
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
expertise in both sponsors

3647
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
sponsorship sales and talent

3648
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
support their passion for helping

3649
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
the content creators and pro players achieve

3650
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
success has elevated the entire

3651
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
industry in the minds of

3652
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
brands worldwide so it's kind of

3653
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
like a promoter you know

3654
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
talent scout type thing it sounds like

3655
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
I'm sure now

3656
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
that you know

3657
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
it would be a good angle for them to go I guess

3658
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
because esports are pretty big

3659
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
and they kind of have the

3660
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
grasp of you know

3661
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
streaming on their site so

3662
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I don't know

3663
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
advertisers

3664
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
interesting

3665
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
apparently

3666
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I didn't see how much so they purchased them for

3667
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
but

3668
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
it'll be interesting to see how they take

3669
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
that if they're going to try to maybe make

3670
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
esports more like

3671
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
well mainstream

3672
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
it's interesting to see twitch acquiring companies

3673
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
when they themselves were just acquired by Amazon

3674
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I mean I realize that you know it's still

3675
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
in a lot of ways business as usual

3676
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
but it's just interesting that all those chess pieces

3677
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
are moving the way they are well now that they have

3678
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
an extra almost billion dollars to do

3679
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
that with they could probably spend

3680
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
some of that you know on this

3681
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
kind of thing we're for sale by the way no I'm kidding

3682
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I'm kidding alright moving on

3683
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
talking about games

3684
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
for windows yeah no really

3685
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I'm going to talk about games for windows or at least

3686
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
what the hell is Microsoft's future

3687
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
in gaming on the PC

3688
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
because we don't really know a whole lot

3689
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
about what that has in store

3690
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
you know we talk about things like valve and

3691
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
all these other store in fronts you know Microsoft

3692
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
wants a piece of that and they've tried before

3693
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
and surely they're going to come back

3694
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
at some point and what's interesting

3695
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
is there's been a

3696
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
tweet that Phil Spencer

3697
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
actually responded to

3698
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
the tweet asked Phil Spencer

3699
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Phil can we expect some UI

3700
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
footage of windows 10 on

3701
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
xbox one in January

3702
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
and Phil responded to it saying

3703
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
I'll be focusing more on what we are

3704
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
doing on windows 10 in January

3705
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
it's time for us to talk

3706
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
about gaming on windows

3707
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
hmm so

3708
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
what are they going to do with windows 10

3709
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
a new store that's so exciting

3710
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
I can't wait to

3711
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
see what windows 10 brings

3712
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
nope sorry I don't care

3713
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I honestly I'm just like

3714
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
you know they've it seems like Microsoft likes

3715
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
to try to do things that other people

3716
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
do and don't get

3717
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
me wrong they do a great job

3718
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
on their gaming platform but as far as

3719
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
like some of the other platforms

3720
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
that they try like PC is a

3721
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
art phones and tablets

3722
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
and you know

3723
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
mp3 players haven't

3724
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
exactly been stellar and

3725
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
like I'd say their PC storefront

3726
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
is not

3727
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
excellent but I would

3728
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
assume that whatever this is going to be is

3729
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
going to tie together xbox one

3730
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
as well as

3731
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
you know windows phone

3732
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
as well as the PC

3733
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I know the idea

3734
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
is that they want you know

3735
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
those cross platform applications

3736
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
to where okay say I get

3737
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
you know

3738
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
say I buy a game or something

3739
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
on my PC

3740
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
well it runs on my PC it now runs

3741
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
on my xbox one and it runs on my phone

3742
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
is the perfect world scenario

3743
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
of that but I just

3744
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I don't know I just don't think

3745
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
anyone's really really care

3746
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
what exclusive apps could you possibly

3747
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
have that would

3748
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
that anyone really

3749
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
really care if they ran across all those platforms

3750
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
minecraft

3751
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
yeah but minecraft already is on those other

3752
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
platforms minecraft 2

3753
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
cool I guess

3754
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
I'm waiting to see that

3755
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
that seems to be

3756
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
that's going to be the key piece I'm very curious

3757
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
to see if that's that's what they pull out

3758
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
and put out on the table that's

3759
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
their only card I mean then that's

3760
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I mean cool that well it's an expensive

3761
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
card exactly their ace of spades

3762
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
and more power

3763
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
to them if that helps drive their

3764
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
platform but you can't

3765
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
just run a platform

3766
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
it's just like me okay I have origin

3767
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
installed in my system because I wanted to play

3768
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
titanfall I played the

3769
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
titanfall demo I didn't uninstall it but doesn't

3770
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
mean I'm shopping for games on origin

3771
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
I mean that's the same thing with minecraft 2

3772
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
I will buy it on

3773
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
their store if this is the only way I can

3774
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
buy the game is through their storefront then sure I'll

3775
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
buy it through their storefront doesn't mean I'm going to use their

3776
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
storefront to buy more games

3777
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I just I don't know what they're

3778
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
trying to do with it whatever let's see

3779
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
I really want to see what windows 10

3780
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
does to enhance the experience of the

3781
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
xbox one that's what I'm curious to see

3782
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
that and directx 12

3783
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
or whatever it is that they're on now

3784
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I'm curious to see how

3785
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
because that's actually supposed to do a little bit more

3786
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
but we'll see I mean

3787
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
don't fuck it

3788
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
up

3789
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
good advice good advice

3790
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
some comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

3791
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
bonds 006

3792
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
says they killed game for windows

3793
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
and I won't go back

3794
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
rama is saying that windows 10 is pretty fucking sweet

3795
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
I haven't

3796
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I guess they do have the whole like preview build

3797
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
or whatever but I haven't really checked it out

3798
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
I feel like when it comes to OS's

3799
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I don't want to screw around with something that's not

3800
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
like finished

3801
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
if I had an extra computer

3802
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
maybe but I don't really have that luxury

3803
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
alright

3804
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
let us get to the

3805
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
mailbag every week you guys send us

3806
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
emails

3807
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
participate at orange lounge radio

3808
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
.com and usually

3809
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
dark soccer will dive in head first and read the

3810
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
emails but I believe I'm doing it tonight right

3811
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
yes because dark soccer

3812
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
is still got a little bit of the voice we don't want her

3813
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
to use it too much

3814
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
she has to use her

3815
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
she needs her voice

3816
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
for complaining

3817
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
not to read emails tonight

3818
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
alright

3819
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I'm going to read some emails here instead

3820
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
so let's get to it

3821
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I'm going to go ahead and stop the music now

3822
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
because I got to multitask here

3823
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
so let's go to AZHP first off tonight

3824
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
saying just wanted to submit a small

3825
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
correction from last week's podcast

3826
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
where Rob stated that instead of Marvel

3827
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
or Star Wars being included or considered

3828
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
for Kingdom Hearts 3 that it would only

3829
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
be frozen that would be added to the game

3830
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I pulled a quote from the source interview

3831
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
which will clarify the vague quote Rob

3832
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
quoted last week well how dare you try

3833
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
to correct me on something how dare you insinuate

3834
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
that I thought that was a joke not necessarily

3835
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
well let's get

3836
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
to the quote that AZHP

3837
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
emails us here saying and by the way I'm kidding

3838
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
AZHP says when I asked whether

3839
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I could safely infer that Star Wars

3840
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
and Marvel are not off limits

3841
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
Yase confirmed

3842
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
that they are being considered well

3843
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
yeah they're all under consideration he

3844
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
said nothing's off limits we're considering

3845
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
all of the worlds there are so many

3846
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
wonderful concepts we're happy about

3847
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
that but at the same time it's really tough

3848
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
to choose the

3849
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
email goes on from AZHP

3850
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
while I would honestly prefer if Star Wars and Marvel

3851
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
were in Kingdom Hearts 3 myself

3852
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
since I would prefer more cartoony characters

3853
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
in the game I wanted to let you guys know that it

3854
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
actually is what they're considering

3855
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
that sounded like

3856
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
though honestly thank you for the clarification

3857
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
but that did sound like a lot of a non-answer

3858
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
answer he just said

3859
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
oh yeah you know we're considering everything

3860
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
but it's so hard to choose and

3861
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I'm not telling you shit

3862
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
I still stand by

3863
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
what I said last week though that Frozen's

3864
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
got a better chance of either of these things

3865
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
on showing up in the game

3866
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
real world stuff doesn't always tend to show up

3867
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
in Kingdom Hearts I do realize Pirates of the

3868
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Caribbean made an appearance

3869
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
that was a pretty rare exception and that's still

3870
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
a very very very very

3871
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Disney grown thing at heart

3872
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I just

3873
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
you know when we talked about this

3874
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
story last week we were coming off all this other

3875
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Frozen mania and I just

3876
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I just see it happening

3877
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
for Kingdom Hearts 3

3878
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
that doesn't mean the other stuff can't happen

3879
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
but I just don't get your

3880
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
hopes up people don't get your hopes up Star Wars

3881
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
has their own line of video games as does

3882
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Marvel I think in some ways

3883
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
it would be really weird if they showed up in

3884
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Kingdom Hearts I wouldn't hate it I'd actually

3885
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
kind of like it but it does make

3886
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
sense to instead

3887
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
showcase these other properties that may

3888
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
never show up otherwise I don't know

3889
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
regardless it was a huge

3890
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
non-answer answer in my opinion and

3891
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
we just we don't know we're going to continue

3892
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
to speculate and fan wank

3893
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
all the way until we see some

3894
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
more concrete information I would assume

3895
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
at the next E3 maybe

3896
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
actually it'll probably be two years from now because next E3

3897
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
will be all about Final Fantasy 15

3898
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
maybe in 2016 we can finally

3899
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
fucking talk about Kingdom Hearts

3900
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
yyr emails us

3901
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
saying I found the discussion on

3902
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
quote games that define last generation

3903
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
from last week's show to be really interesting

3904
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
partially because I'm not quite certain that one can

3905
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
define last generation with a list of games at all

3906
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
how do we define define

3907
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
anyway I would take it to mean something like

3908
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
this games that have the look and feel

3909
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
made possible by that generation

3910
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
and that influenced many games to

3911
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
come both as part of that

3912
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
generation and for generations afterwards

3913
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
it's easy to put games like Super Mario

3914
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Brothers Sonic the Hedgehog and Final Fantasy

3915
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
7 on lists such as this but the

3916
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
sheer length of time between last generation and this

3917
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
one along with a massive number of and diversity

3918
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
of titles released makes this almost

3919
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
impossible gaming has transformed since

3920
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
the release of the 360, PS3 and Wii

3921
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
some things that define the generation

3922
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
for me include the Gears of War trilogy

3923
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
the introduction of achievements

3924
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
the first Dead Rising, the indie games channel

3925
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
and the availability of online fighting games

3926
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
these are all revolutionary in their own way

3927
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
but for many people none of these things will have

3928
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
even been on their radar which leads

3929
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
me to my point there is just too much

3930
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
about this generation to fit on a short list

3931
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
for example I personally

3932
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
wouldn't define it with such events as the rise

3933
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
of motion gaming or the popularity

3934
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
of the American music game because outside

3935
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
of the genre faithful

3936
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
both of these turned out to be fads and are no

3937
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
longer popular at all but

3938
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
both definitely belong on a bullet list

3939
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
of things that defined it for many people

3940
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
it's just that this will wind up becoming a very very

3941
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
very long list don't forget that

3942
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
the very same hardware that ran the brand new

3943
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 also ran the brand new

3944
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Ridge Racer 6 with an 8 year

3945
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
gap in between I guess what I'm trying to say

3946
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
is this I would not want to attempt taking

3947
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
on this task because I believe it would be nearly

3948
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
impossible let me stop

3949
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
there because the rest of the email gets into something else

3950
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
it is a huge task

3951
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
but so is trying to name the game of the

3952
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
year yet people seem to do it

3953
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
anyway and I think it's really too hard sometimes

3954
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
to name just one game of the year

3955
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
and that's going to change from person to person

3956
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
just depending on your experiences

3957
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
and you know what you like and that's

3958
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
why diversity is great because everybody

3959
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
brings different things to the table

3960
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I do want to clarify though I don't know if

3961
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
the rise of motion gaming was a reference to

3962
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Wii Sports but I just want to clarify

3963
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
I put Wii Sports on

3964
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
not just because of the motion gaming

3965
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
but because the accessibility is a huge thing

3966
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
and more people that started playing

3967
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
games as a result

3968
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
but I would agree with the fact that it is very

3969
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
hard

3970
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
to define the one game

3971
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
that changed the generation that is a very hard thing

3972
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
to do but I could try to pick

3973
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
the one that I think

3974
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
is a huge opinion I think

3975
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
did it the most out of all of them

3976
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
and that's why I picked Wii Sports and I think Wii Sports

3977
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
out of all of them did it the most

3978
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
but certainly is not the only game

3979
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
that would define a generation which you're right

3980
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
is kind of a vague concept to begin with

3981
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
but then again so is game of the year

3982
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
does that mean the best game the most fun

3983
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
game the prettiest game

3984
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
who knows

3985
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
anyway the rest of the email here from

3986
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
YYR also thank you for the information

3987
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
on the upcoming Wii U CD-ROM attachment

3988
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
but the latest news suggests that while it is capable

3989
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
of playing CD-ROM discs it will not

3990
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
actually allow users of the Wii U to play

3991
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
music CDs oh well

3992
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
finally thank you for suggesting a subtitle for

3993
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Pixel Shits 2 projectile explosive

3994
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
diarrhea however I heard

3995
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
the PED is illegal for most athletes

3996
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
some game developers and

3997
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
a few podcasters

3998
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
anyone else play Acrophobia back in the day?

3999
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Aaron YYR

4000
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
uh yes yes

4001
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
really I played

4002
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Acrophobia back in the day I sure did

4003
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
that was a fun game that's why

4004
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
I think that's why I do have

4005
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
such a soft spot for like when we had the

4006
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
uh guys from Jackbox Games on a couple weeks ago

4007
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
cause a lot of the old Berkeley stuff

4008
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
like that's where most of them ended up

4009
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
so uh that's why I probably have a

4010
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
soft spot cause I loved the old

4011
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
uh Berkeley games

4012
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
alright lastly but not leastly

4013
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
actdeft emails us hello

4014
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
from your friendly neighborhood Mexican actdeft

4015
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
you know how amiibos have been actually

4016
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
quite popular running out in places and even

4017
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
selling for more than their worth but so

4018
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
far the only game that has given them some use is

4019
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Smash Brothers granted they're still new

4020
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
and all but I hope that Nintendo does more with

4021
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
them in the future and try to give them more than

4022
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
an quote use an amiibo

4023
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
in game to unlock items thing that they have

4024
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
going right now in fact I do have

4025
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
an idea I think it's a really great one

4026
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
since Animal Crossing Wii U is apparently

4027
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
coming either next year or in 2016

4028
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
it will probably have amiibo support

4029
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
but instead of just giving you items in game to decorate

4030
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
your house how about they make the amiibo unlock

4031
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
a neighbor of that same character

4032
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
like you place the Kirby amiibo on the game pad

4033
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
and the game will give you Kirby as a

4034
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
neighbor for your town wouldn't it be fantastic

4035
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
having your regular neighbors and special

4036
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
neighbors maybe have the amiibos

4037
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
live in an apartment complex or something like that

4038
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
oh see I like that idea it would be like

4039
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
um Tomodachi life or something

4040
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
where they all live in a building

4041
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
I posted this idea on other sites like Reddit

4042
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
and got a somewhat mixed reception

4043
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
as you will get on Reddit

4044
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
but I wanted to know what you guys in the chatters

4045
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
and other emails or callers think of this idea

4046
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
anyways thanks for reading hope you're having a great Sunday

4047
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
and he does end with a PS

4048
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I have a code for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade

4049
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Edition on Steam and since I got the Lego

4050
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
movie code for PS Vita a few weeks back

4051
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
I thought I should pay it forward

4052
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
or back I don't know either any of you

4053
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
can keep it or give it away in chat

4054
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
enjoy well thank you for that

4055
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
steam code I'm going to put that

4056
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
over in the prize pool for the vog jams

4057
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
there you go that's the first thing going in the prize pool

4058
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
steam code for Super Street Fighter 4

4059
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Arcade Edition on Steam we'll just put that in the prize pool

4060
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
for people to participate

4061
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
um as far as the part

4062
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
about amiibos your idea is cool

4063
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
um

4064
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
I do realize Nintendo had

4065
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
to kind of back the car in so to speak

4066
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
with amiibos as far as

4067
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
you know what they did with Hyrule Warriors

4068
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
what they did with Mario Kart and so forth

4069
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
so I don't judge them too

4070
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
harshly on

4071
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
what they did there

4072
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
however I think the really telling

4073
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
thing is going to be what do they do in

4074
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
next year's games

4075
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
the one to really keep an eye on in my

4076
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
opinion I want to know how those

4077
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
amiibo will work in

4078
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Splatoon I think

4079
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
however amiibos function

4080
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
is in Splatoon is going to be very

4081
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
telling for the future of amiibo

4082
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
is that what it's going to be hats

4083
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
is it just going to be have amiibo unlock

4084
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
crap or would there possibly be

4085
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
that you could play some of those characters in Splatoon

4086
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
or that you would level

4087
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
up maybe you have the hat but you're kind of

4088
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
doing like a level up thing that's the one thing I like

4089
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
about the amiibo is that you're leveling it up

4090
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
but it's like if I level it up in Smash

4091
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
then what? I think that they're doing too much

4092
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I mean I don't have a problem with

4093
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
them doing like the unlock crap stuff

4094
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
because honestly it's unreasonable to

4095
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
expect them to incorporate every single amiibo

4096
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
that they're ever going to create into

4097
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
all of these games like I shouldn't be able to play

4098
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Mario in like

4099
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Hyrule Warriors although

4100
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I would totally love

4101
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
to see a kingdom was it

4102
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
a mushroom kingdom warriors or something like that

4103
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
would be fucking amazing but

4104
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
I understand that it's unreasonable

4105
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
for me to expect them to have

4106
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
all these characters playable in every single

4107
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I mean Wii Fit Trainer it doesn't make any sense

4108
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
I have a good idea here's my idea I'm going to pitch out there

4109
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Mario Maker is coming out soon

4110
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
right? What if

4111
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
in Mario Maker there's certain

4112
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
new things not existing things

4113
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
new things that you can use

4114
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
if you have an amiibo

4115
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
that you've leveled up to a certain

4116
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
point in some other game

4117
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
so for example like

4118
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
maybe I get a Kirby picture

4119
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
that I can have in a stage somewhere

4120
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
or Kirby music oh even better

4121
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I get Kirby music and if I have the amiibo

4122
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I can use one song in a stage

4123
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
yes I know I'm talking Kirby music in Mario

4124
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
but roll with me here but maybe if I've

4125
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
leveled my Kirby fighter to level

4126
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
30 in Smash Brothers then I have a

4127
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
second song I can use or maybe it just skins

4128
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
everything to Kirby yeah

4129
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
or maybe changes the colors to Kirby colors

4130
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
or like you can have

4131
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
like you know for Yoshi it changes everything

4132
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
Yoshi Island style or something

4133
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
but I love the idea of I would have to

4134
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
and this would be really smart for Nintendo to do

4135
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
you have to do something in this game over here to make it happen

4136
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
over here but maybe not necessarily restricted

4137
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
to just one game I kind of think

4138
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
the amiibo should level up as a

4139
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
whole so that way like

4140
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
okay I level it in Smash Brothers

4141
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
but then if I want to push it even further

4142
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
and even though it might not do anything in Smash Brothers

4143
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
my like amiibo level I would

4144
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
use it Mario Kart and then I would use it Mario Maker

4145
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
it'd be cool if like they'd have different

4146
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
stats or something like you could up you know

4147
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
if I play them in Smash Brothers become stronger

4148
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
and you know they

4149
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
gain fighting skills or something like that where if I

4150
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
play them in Mario Kart

4151
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
they gain driving skills or something

4152
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
doesn't necessarily mean if I have a level

4153
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
50 amiibo in Smash Brothers that's

4154
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
good at driving or something I don't know

4155
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
it's an easy thing to balance but

4156
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
you know Nintendo has

4157
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
gone down this path and I think there's a lot of really

4158
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
awesome shit that they could do with this

4159
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
but I just worry is Nintendo

4160
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
going to be too stubborn to do it as

4161
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
they often are I don't know

4162
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
and maybe amiibos are too popular for their own

4163
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
good I don't know

4164
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Tigerclaw in chat says they're probably

4165
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
going to make amiibos specific to Splatoon no

4166
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
doubt well with

4167
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
as much as those things are selling

4168
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
why not make more more more more

4169
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
alright that's it for the mailbag if you want to participate

4170
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
with the mailbag in a future week participate

4171
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
at orangelaungeradio.com

4172
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
let's get into the FUs

4173
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
of the week

4174
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
it might sound a little bit odd

4175
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
there's a lot

4176
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
of positive posts going on

4177
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
about people

4178
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
you know how people will do

4179
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
romance mods for games

4180
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
oh well I want to be able to romance

4181
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
this person even though they're straight

4182
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
or I want to romance this person even though

4183
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
they're gay and there's a bunch of people

4184
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
going around saying well you can't

4185
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
change a person's sexuality don't

4186
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
do it for the game

4187
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
don't take but

4188
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
then these are the same people who are also

4189
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
shipping characters

4190
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
in TV shows that are

4191
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
canonically of a different

4192
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
sexuality if it's

4193
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
wrong to do it in one genre it's

4194
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
wrong to do it in another genre

4195
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
and it doesn't just apply

4196
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
to wanting to make

4197
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
homosexual characters straight it also

4198
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
applies the other way around it applies to

4199
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
wanting to make asexual characters

4200
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
have attraction to

4201
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
bits or something

4202
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
respect the

4203
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
way the author or the

4204
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
creator of the universe has said it

4205
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
they're not in control of it no more

4206
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
than real people are in control of it

4207
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
if you are going to write your

4208
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
fiction I have no problem with you exploring

4209
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
themes but accept that

4210
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
it is not actually the way

4211
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
that it was intended

4212
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
and that you are creating an alternate universe

4213
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
the end okay so I was just gonna say

4214
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
devil's advocate like if somebody

4215
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
is making fantasy

4216
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
and that's fantasy then that's fine as long

4217
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
as they acknowledge it as fantasy

4218
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
there are people who say this is

4219
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
like they'll try to insert

4220
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
canon it's not

4221
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
canon but don't push your fantasy

4222
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
on everybody else exactly

4223
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
and there are people out there saying oh well

4224
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
it's just another canon no no no

4225
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
it's an alternate reality

4226
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
canon refer canon means the author

4227
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
wrote it the word canon

4228
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
relate originated with

4229
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
religious canon in

4230
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
a religious doctrine in this

4231
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
case canon refers to something that is the

4232
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
way that the author created you can

4233
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
have a head canon which is

4234
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
your addition to things that

4235
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
happen in the canon that might

4236
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
be plausible

4237
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
in the canon but when you go

4238
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
and you change something that

4239
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
is completely outside canon

4240
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
and

4241
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
your little fantasy world does

4242
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
not apply to how the author

4243
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
created it and I'm writing a book now so I

4244
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
start thinking about these things

4245
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
and I was like I don't want people to take

4246
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
this asexual character

4247
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
that I'm writing and make

4248
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
them you know completely interested in

4249
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
this guy's dick no

4250
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
dick's gross that's

4251
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
how I'm writing her so

4252
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
hey you know what else is not you know what else is not

4253
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
canon the Star Wars

4254
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
extended universe aww

4255
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:06,000
too soon indeed

4256
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
I approve of that one Rob

4257
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
low key

4258
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
um I guess

4259
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
just the fact that I haven't had a lot

4260
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
of time to work on the programming

4261
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
stuff I literally get sometimes

4262
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
at work just like 15 minutes

4263
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
and it's just not enough time to even

4264
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
sit down and open my laptop and

4265
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
work on anything just

4266
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
can't switch my

4267
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
train of thought to something

4268
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
different so it's kind of disappointing

4269
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
you know that's all

4270
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
uh my FU

4271
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
goes to I have a

4272
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
crazy week at work ahead I like

4273
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
my job and all but oh my god FU

4274
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
to the fact that I probably have to get up at 6 am tomorrow

4275
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
not looking forward to that thanks

4276
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
means I have to be in bed in less than an hour

4277
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
that's not going to happen if I want 8 hours of sleep

4278
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
that won't happen we all know that

4279
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
alright uh

4280
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
there it is the FUs of the week just a couple more stories

4281
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
for you guys then we're going to quickly take some calls

4282
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
but I warn you guys I'm not keeping the skype line

4283
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
open very often if we don't get calls

4284
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
we're wrapping up cause like I just said

4285
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
I have to be at work I have to be up

4286
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
really early tomorrow so uh

4287
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
we will allow though it is the show

4288
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
where every gamer has a voice so if you do want to call in

4289
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
we will take a couple quick calls

4290
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
uh a couple

4291
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
quick stories here at the end though

4292
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
so it's hard to believe that OC Remix has been around

4293
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
for 15 years but that's

4294
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
what they're celebrating is 15 years of

4295
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
independent remixes

4296
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
of video game music and that's pretty cool

4297
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
in fact including with that

4298
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
they have um

4299
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
some new tracks

4300
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
that they've been putting together 15 new

4301
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
remixes uh that

4302
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
from 15 different game consoles

4303
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
and this is all in celebration

4304
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
of you know

4305
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000

4308
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
albums that they put out I mean it's just

4309
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
crazy I can't believe that they've

4310
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
been around that long

4311
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000

4328
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
coming through some Japanese paypal

4329
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
users apparently uh

4330
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
some correspondence went out to them revealing

4331
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
the launch of December 18th

4332
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
uh a reddit user actually shared

4333
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
the email that they received which

4334
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
does mention that the sale will start on December

4335
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
18th and run through January

4336
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
2nd of course we do not

4337
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
know what the uh thing will

4338
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
entail but if it's if it's like

4339
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
any previous steam sale you know it's gonna

4340
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
be on sale everything

4341
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
except maybe the new new

4342
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
releases and the stuff that's still commanding

4343
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
$60 call of duty will not be on sale

4344
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
call of duty well you never know even call of duty

4345
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
if it's not selling so well

4346
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
maybe they'll even knock it down take a page from

4347
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Shadow of Mordor and I'm not even sure why Shadow

4348
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
of Mordor is marked down so much but

4349
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
shit that game was like

4350
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
half off for like a long time

4351
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
it just came out

4352
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
I don't think it was selling that bad of course

4353
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
uh Valve not commenting on these

4354
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
rumors but uh of course but this is

4355
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
how it's leaked out in the past so

4356
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
it doesn't it makes perfect sense that's right

4357
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000

02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
cool hack that's going on for

4368
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
uh remote play that you can get it to work on

4369
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
an android phone

4370
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
that's kind of neat I don't think that's

4371
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
actually um yeah

4372
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
it's uh an app that they have that

4373
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
you can actually use a tablet device or

4374
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
something to do remote play

4375
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
on in case you don't have a Vita

4376
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
alright we are gonna go to the phones

4377
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
cause it's lighting up hi you're on orange launch radio

4378
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
who's this uh hello this

4379
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
this is Hitstun hey Hitstun how are you

4380
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
we haven't heard from you in a long time what's up

4381
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
yeah I'm doing alright I'm the man that used to do tech support

4382
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
for the fastest internet in the chat

4383
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
hahaha nice

4384
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
alright um I'm really excited

4385
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
you guys are doing like the vog jam

4386
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
a game jam here that sounds great

4387
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
me too so

4388
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
officially count me in on that

4389
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
yes that's awesome

4390
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
I'm pretty hyped for that I'm hyped for it too

4391
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
you know and it's scary uncharted

4392
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
territory cause who knows people may

4393
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
hate the theme but uh I think

4394
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
you'll find a way to work with it even if you end up

4395
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
hating the theme I think people will find a way to work

4396
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
with it cause it doesn't mean that has to be

4397
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
the central theme of your game you know or whatever

4398
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
uh and it's scary I don't know if you can do worse

4399
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
than the most recent Ludum Dare though

4400
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
oh entire game on one screen

4401
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
that's what they picked oh wow

4402
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
uh like that you could do anything

4403
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
with that but it's a little too wide you

4404
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
know um when you guys are picking a theme

4405
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
like I mean try to

4406
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
try to give something that at least gives

4407
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
us a little bit of direction about what the game

4408
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
should be about or like a topic maybe

4409
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
well I would think you know even if we did

4410
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
something like Puzzle Sluts

4411
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
like Puzzle Sluts maybe doesn't necessarily have

4412
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
to be a puzzle game Puzzle Sluts

4413
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
could be you know you're looking

4414
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
for missing pieces of the puzzle

4415
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
in a point and click adventure mystery game

4416
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
you know what I mean like yeah and obviously I'm

4417
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
making that up completely that's not

4418
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
gonna be the theme but well that might be too

4419
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
narrow but if you just do Sluts we might be

4420
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
able to use more

4421
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
we could do all kinds of games well

4422
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Puzzle Sluts, Fighting Sluts,

4423
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
Action Sluts the ingredient is

4424
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Sluts!

4425
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Awesome!

4426
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
So tune in next week to find out

4427
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
that I'm really excited

4428
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
about it and what's really exciting

4429
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
is that we have a lot of people who have

4430
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
experience jumping into

4431
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
this like you know Bobby says

4432
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
he'll do it you're gonna say you're gonna do it

4433
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
YYR is gonna do it now even the

4434
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Cookie with Unity guys are saying

4435
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
they're gonna they're gonna keep an eye on it and they might do it

4436
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
too I know

4437
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
right but remember this isn't about

4438
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
quality and that's why I wanted to stress that because like

4439
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
if somebody's like I don't

4440
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
know how to like this

4441
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Unity stuff I don't have time it's too

4442
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
scary like I appreciate it but you know what

4443
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
I just want to make a slutty little big planet level

4444
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
then cool

4445
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
you know we want to do it

4446
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
just don't get banned

4447
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
So it'll be awesome to see what you guys come up with

4448
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Let's see

4449
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
I don't really have to do Plug for the Instagib stream

4450
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
because Raven's Dolphin did it for me last week

4451
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
thanks dude

4452
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
so instead I'm gonna Plug something else

4453
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
there's a convention

4454
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
coming up at the end of July

4455
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
called Replay FX

4456
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
I'll go ahead and

4457
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
throw it in chat here but it's in Pittsburgh

4458
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
and it's a gaming convention

4459
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
and it's also attended by

4460
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
PAPA, the Professional

4461
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
and Amateur Pinball Association

4462
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
also run out of Pittsburgh

4463
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
and it's gonna have like 700 arcade machines

4464
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
and I think, sorry

4465
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
700 pinball

4466
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
tables, 2000 arcade machines

4467
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
and I'm kinda interested to see if there's

4468
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
anyone else involved that's going to that

4469
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
so we'll probably see without shakedown

4470
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
maybe it'll be a forum topic or something

4471
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
and we'll see

4472
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
I don't know of a lot of listeners in the Pittsburgh area

4473
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
at least I can't think of any off the top of my head

4474
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
but if it's on the east coast

4475
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
it's certainly possible Rama will go

4476
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
yeah, that'll be cool

4477
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
hopefully we can get Rama out of that one

4478
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
I'm also going to PAX East

4479
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
so I will see you there

4480
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
yes, I will

4481
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
pretty excited for that

4482
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
and that's about it I think

4483
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
alright, well hitstun I'm gonna let you go so we can try to

4484
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
get a couple more calls in but excited to see

4485
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
what comes out for the game jam

4486
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
yep, doing my token

4487
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
call in saying yeah I've been listening for 9

4488
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
years and

4489
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
keep going for a good 12 more

4490
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
oh my gosh, we will try

4491
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
that means so much, just don't tell me how old

4492
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
you were when you first started listening because that always throws me

4493
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
alright, have a good one

4494
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
it's all good, have a good one

4495
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
alright, take care

4496
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
on orange lounge radio

4497
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
we haven't heard from him in a long time

4498
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
it's always good to hear from him

4499
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
I love the people that call in all the time

4500
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
but I love hearing from new people and

4501
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
blast from the past as well

4502
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
I was literally thinking of Jim Sally the other day

4503
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
and I don't even remember what made me think of him

4504
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
but I was like, we haven't gotten a call from Jim Sally

4505
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
in so long

4506
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
I must have, I heard a train

4507
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
or somebody imitating a train

4508
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
and I was like, oh my god, is Jim Sally here

4509
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
I don't know, we got a call on the line, let's get to it

4510
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
hi on orange lounge radio, who's this?

4511
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
uh, yeah, this is Zormac

4512
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I'm sorry, Zormac?

4513
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
I'm Zormac

4514
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
oh yes, yes, yes, how are you my friend?

4515
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
good, how are you?

4516
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
am I coming okay? I don't know how well

4517
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
we can hear you, it's a little bit

4518
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
like a walkie talkie sound, but that's alright

4519
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
it's good enough, we can hear you, what's up buddy

4520
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
ok, great, so first of all

4521
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
this talks to the

4522
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
final hill 4

4523
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
little music during the break

4524
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
it was running late, I didn't get to hear the first part

4525
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
but to just like, log in

4526
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
and hear that was pretty awesome

4527
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
um, well, Silent Hill 4

4528
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
was actually our classic game of the week

4529
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
this week, because believe it or not

4530
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
that game is 10 years old

4531
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
yeah, I uh, I actually remember

4532
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
uh, running around

4533
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
I'm not saying anything else, but

4534
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
to play it at home, but uh, yeah

4535
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Silent Hill 4 The Room, correct?

4536
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:27,000
correct

4537
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
yeah, yeah, so I remember

4538
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
playing that back in the day, it's been almost

4539
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
forever, since I've actually heard it, so

4540
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
uh, the other thing I wanted to talk about was

4541
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
the

4542
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
whole gaming, uh

4543
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
people playing, making their own games and stuff

4544
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
is that, could be a thing

4545
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
that you guys are gonna start doing now, it looks

4546
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
pretty interesting that you guys are

4547
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
going into that, well, I wouldn't say

4548
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
we're changing the whole show

4549
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
but, you know, we're about

4550
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
being the show where every gamer has a

4551
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
voice, and I think one thing

4552
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
you know, any show you watch on TV

4553
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
is gonna have a story arc that

4554
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
goes on for weeks and weeks sometimes

4555
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
and I think right now, kind of the arc that

4556
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
we're embracing is, why don't you use your

4557
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
voice to actually make some games

4558
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
um, because, there's

4559
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
I think especially this year, it's kind of a

4560
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
there's been a lot of

4561
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
talk this year about

4562
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
diversity in games, let's just put it that

4563
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
way, right? And what better

4564
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
way to diversify

4565
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
games than get everybody

4566
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
making games

4567
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
to diversify the voices that are making them

4568
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
it's kind of like they said in that interview

4569
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
the guys from Cooking with Unity, we need to get more

4570
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
gamers making games

4571
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
is what we need, so I don't think there's

4572
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
I kind of see that

4573
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
I like embracing that idea

4574
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
right now, now are we gonna turn into a

4575
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
tech oriented how to

4576
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
make your own games podcast?

4577
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Not necessarily, that's what

4578
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Cooking with Unity does, and there's plenty of other

4579
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
resources out there to help you out with that type of stuff

4580
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
but are we gonna do what we can to really

4581
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
kind of nudge people and go

4582
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
you ever thought about trying this, yo?

4583
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Nudge people and encourage people

4584
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
to try in a place

4585
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
where people, we will

4586
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
say, you are not allowed to hate

4587
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
here, this is not,

4588
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
OLR is not about hate, it's don't be a

4589
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
dick, I don't care who you are, where you're

4590
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
from, what you do, but here

4591
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
we respect each other, so

4592
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
you're gonna create a game and

4593
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
dammit, we're gonna embrace everything that is

4594
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
made, and believe me, there are gonna be some shitty

4595
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
entries in this game jam, because I'm participating

4596
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
there will be some shitty entries in this game jam

4597
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
but dammit, we're gonna love everything

4598
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
as long as somebody tries, that's the important part

4599
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
Alright, cool, so are you

4600
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
going to maybe point out

4601
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
your favorite

4602
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
website to kind of look at

4603
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
certain games being made in

4604
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
a different environment, I know

4605
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Unity is gonna be pretty much the

4606
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
primary language

4607
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
to create the game, but I'm pretty sure there's gonna

4608
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
be other websites that

4609
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
utilize other tools

4610
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
I would love to highlight

4611
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
different things every week

4612
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
to help people with ideas

4613
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
and I just wanna say, even though we had the Cooking

4614
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
with Unity guys on the show tonight, and

4615
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Unity is a great choice

4616
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
I don't wanna say Unity is the official

4617
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
platform of the competition, it's not

4618
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
the theme of the competition is create something

4619
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
dammit, so if you create it in Unity, awesome

4620
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
if this is what gets you to learn Unity, awesome

4621
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
but if this is what gets you to learn Unreal

4622
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
or something else, and that's what you've

4623
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
been wanting to do, then

4624
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
then we embrace that just as much

4625
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I think a great source, like I always

4626
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
tend to go, well for me, just

4627
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
doing Unity and stuff, I tend to go

4628
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
to Reddit a lot, so Reddit, you know

4629
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
they have the, our Game Dev

4630
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
and our Unity 3D

4631
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
are pretty good sources, if you're looking to do

4632
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
a different language, they have those as well

4633
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
our Unity, our Unreal

4634
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Engine, they have, I'm pretty sure

4635
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
they have one for the Coast Coast

4636
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
2D or whatever it is

4637
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
lots of different programming language out there

4638
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Game Maker, I think is free at some

4639
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
points, so you can do that

4640
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
RPG Maker

4641
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
lots of resources

4642
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
5th Dream in Chat with an excellent question here saying

4643
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
fuck, does it even have to be electronic, can I make

4644
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
a pen and paper RPG

4645
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
well I'm gonna consult the golden rule

4646
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
of the competition, which is

4647
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
create something dammit, so

4648
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
I actually think a

4649
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
board game, a pen and paper game

4650
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
if that's what you really wanna do

4651
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
it's starting to push it a little bit

4652
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
but I think I'm okay with that, because at the end

4653
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
of the day, create something dammit

4654
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
yeah, and that's pretty good too, because if anything

4655
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
if it's a really good game, pen and paper

4656
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
I'm pretty sure that they'll make some version of it

4657
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
you know, so people can play on the

4658
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
some sort of console

4659
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
I think the rule for that is that it has

4660
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
to be accessible online

4661
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
that means

4662
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
you have to publish the rules

4663
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
publish the rules online, basically

4664
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
indeed

4665
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
if you've got

4666
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
a board game, put the template up

4667
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
online, Cards Against Humanity

4668
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
great example, it's a game you play

4669
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
in person, but it's something you can download

4670
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
and print and make your own deck, right

4671
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
it's a great example, it takes like

4672
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
you can go in and make a 300 DPI

4673
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
game board

4674
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
I like that as a rule, so

4675
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
yes, it's fine if you do

4676
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
a board game or a pen and paper, but it has to be

4677
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
something I get online and I

4678
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
can, so that it is accessible

4679
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
all who are participating in the game jam

4680
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
ok, I like that, I like that, great

4681
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
clarification there, Brad from Pod Culture

4682
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
says, do drinking games count?

4683
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
ok, now you're pushing it, now you're pushing it

4684
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
ok

4685
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
only the ones where I'm drinking

4686
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
it's part of the development process

4687
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
alright, well my friend, I gotta let you

4688
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
go so we can try to squeeze in one more call

4689
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
but do you think you might participate in the game jam?

4690
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
um, yeah, I mean

4691
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
I'm gonna be looking at some of the

4692
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
websites for information

4693
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
and we'll see, I love it

4694
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
YouTube is a great help and

4695
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
I even went through some

4696
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
of these free courses for

4697
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
I don't know, just like

4698
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
even programming and stuff

4699
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
I had to try to teach myself

4700
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
and a lot of it was just kind of looking up

4701
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
examples online and just seeing

4702
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
how they do stuff and I'm still looking up

4703
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
like, oh, how do I use this command

4704
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
and how do I do this

4705
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
I'm still waiting for your vlog

4706
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
yeah, call him out

4707
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
call him out

4708
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
any information is good information

4709
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
yeah, that blog, hopefully

4710
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
I have a URL already

4711
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
and I just have to make the webpage

4712
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
someday, but that's time

4713
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
it's time away from programming, so I don't know

4714
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
we'll see

4715
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
you take care my friend, thanks for calling

4716
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
alright, bye

4717
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
alright, we're gonna try to squeeze in one more call here

4718
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
and this will be it for the night, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

4719
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
just the one and only

4720
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
Rama, how is everybody tonight?

4721
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
Rama, how are you?

4722
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
I am good, I just want you to know

4723
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
because of what Hitstun has said

4724
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
I am starting a Kickstarter call

4725
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
get Rama and the crew to conventions

4726
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
hahahaha

4727
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
you need a van

4728
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
like they have in Scooby-Doo

4729
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
well, I don't think

4730
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
it'd be hard for us to get a van

4731
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
because Mako-chan is pretty beastly

4732
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
when she drives, so you know

4733
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
we got nothing to worry about

4734
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
I'm just saying, clouds of smoke come out of both those vans

4735
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
well

4736
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
there is a reason why she does drive

4737
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
and does all the cooking, so

4738
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
haha, what's on your mind my friend?

4739
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
well this whole

4740
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
fog jam thing

4741
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
I might have to break out my visual

4742
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
basic skills and do something or

4743
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
learn Unity, since I now have free time

4744
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
fuck yes, and by the way

4745
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
AkumaJP in chat says, I don't want to be that guy

4746
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
but Unity is not a language, don't worry

4747
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
you're not being that guy, you're right, Unity is not a language

4748
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Unity is an engine, there is a big

4749
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
difference, but at the end of the day, the golden rule

4750
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
again, is create something, dammit

4751
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
so if you are going to use an engine, if you're going to use

4752
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
a language, if you're going to use, you know, whatever

4753
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
whatever it takes to

4754
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
get the job done, we encourage it

4755
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
so, love it

4756
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
yes indeed, yes

4757
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
a couple more things, I'm going to get out of here

4758
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
now this whole Lucky Chloe thing, now

4759
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
you already said what I said

4760
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
in the chat earlier

4761
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
but also, I have a feeling

4762
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
Lucky Chloe is going to be on the US release

4763
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
because I don't see Namco

4764
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
doing two separate presses

4765
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
of the game for separate coding for this

4766
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
I have a feeling

4767
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
it's going to be there, but

4768
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
it's just going to be locked

4769
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
so you can't access it, and then

4770
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
when all the drama dies down

4771
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
for $3.99

4772
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,000
you can have the character

4773
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:22,000
yeah, DLC, that would be the best way to

4774
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:24,000
stick it, is to give it to Japan for free

4775
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:26,000
and make us pay for it, it would be hilarious

4776
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
exactly, I just think dude's

4777
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,000
pissed off at what he read on the internet

4778
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
and I really don't think it's going to impact the final game

4779
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:34,000
I think in a slow news week

4780
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
people are really reaching for a headline here

4781
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:38,000
I think he said something when he was really pissed off

4782
03:02:38,000 --> 03:02:40,000
and he was kind of like, well maybe I should make

4783
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
this instead then, and people are reading

4784
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:44,000
that to say, oh he's not going to do it

4785
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
I think you're right, Namco's not going to

4786
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
make two completely different copies

4787
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
that's just not really what they're going to do

4788
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
she'll be in the game

4789
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
everybody just needs to pull their stick out of their

4790
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
ass and get over it, because again

4791
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
this is the same series that has

4792
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Panda Bears and Yoshimitsu

4793
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
come on, let it go

4794
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
let it go people

4795
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
exactly

4796
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Loki thought I was going to break into

4797
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
a song, that was last week

4798
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
I'm moving on

4799
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
the cold never bothered me anyway

4800
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
alright

4801
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
anything else Rama?

4802
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
Final Fantasy, real quick

4803
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
now I came across this on my

4804
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
Facebook and it does remind me

4805
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
of you and Al in a way of how

4806
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
you two met, I have a long

4807
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
time friend and she

4808
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
just got married, what I didn't know

4809
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
is that she met her now

4810
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
husband while playing Final Fantasy

4811
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
11, was this the

4812
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
story that was on Reddit? Yes

4813
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
and I tagged you in it because it was for a possible

4814
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
article, the girl

4815
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Jen, that's one of my closest

4816
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
friends, I've known her for like 10

4817
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
11 years, how funny

4818
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
we were a couple of conhors back in the day

4819
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
how funny, you're right, I'm sorry I didn't throw that in there

4820
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
tonight, just all the other stuff

4821
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
sidetracked me a little bit, but

4822
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
that's awesome that they met

4823
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
in Final Fantasy 11 and what, they play

4824
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
14 now right?

4825
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Probably, but right now

4826
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
real life

4827
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
has been taking over for them

4828
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
because they just came

4829
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
back from the honeymoon and this and this

4830
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
and that, you know

4831
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Well to be fair, Alan and I didn't really meet in a video

4832
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
game, although we did meet online

4833
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
and we met on LiveJournal, which

4834
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
I realize there's a lot of people now listening to

4835
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
the show that don't even know what LiveJournal

4836
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
really is, because it's kind of what

4837
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
predated Facebook, there's actually

4838
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
an Orange Lounge LiveJournal community, I don't think

4839
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
it's been posted in since 2007, but it's

4840
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
there, and I am a part of that

4841
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
and the only reason I said Final Fantasy is because I remember

4842
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
y'all two crossed paths that I think was

4843
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
a Distant Worlds concert or something

4844
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
like that, it was actually Video

4845
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
Games Live, I was close

4846
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
you were close, you were right

4847
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
the first time we actually met in person

4848
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
was at Video Games

4849
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
Live, and we knew each other

4850
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
virtually through LiveJournal, and it

4851
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
was actually, believe it or not, it was

4852
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
CaptainSpike from GameBooey.org who said

4853
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
oh, you guys haven't met? And actually

4854
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
introduced us, so

4855
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
then we met in person at that concert

4856
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
So, yeah

4857
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
I know, right? Just looking at the chat room

4858
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
it's hilarious, Fifth Dream

4859
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
says, I just said LJ, and

4860
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
onstov06 says, what's Hi5 or

4861
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
my yearbook? No, we didn't

4862
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
meet on Zynga, people, we didn't meet on Zynga

4863
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
or was it, sorry, not Zynga, Zongo

4864
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
what was that site called? Zynga

4865
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
It's still around

4866
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
Is it really? I believe so

4867
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
I knew

4868
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
people who used to post there, and don't forget

4869
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
with LiveJournal, there was a

4870
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
spin-off, there was Dead

4871
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
Journal for the gods, Dream

4872
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Journal for the people who

4873
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
were psychics, and you had Open

4874
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
Journal, and this journal, and that

4875
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
journal. Every time LiveJournal

4876
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
did something to piss people off, it was like

4877
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
I'm getting a dead journal, that's the day

4878
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
And then there's the ultimate alternative

4879
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
Dream Width

4880
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
Still going strong

4881
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Crazy, crazy. Alright, my friend, I gotta let you go

4882
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
so we can wrap up the show, but have a good one, thank you for calling

4883
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
You too, thank you

4884
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
I love that he's thinking

4885
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
about starting a Kickstarter to get his

4886
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
van, his

4887
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
posse, the anime jam session posse

4888
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
He needs to come back out here

4889
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
and do a con

4890
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Or send me a plane ticket so I can

4891
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
go out there

4892
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
And you're

4893
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
not even going to PAX East, I'm going to the East Coast

4894
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
Finally

4895
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
You know what?

4896
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
See, this upcoming year

4897
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
is going to be the year of lots

4898
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
of money saving, not just by the house that we're in

4899
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Dan and I hit our 10 year

4900
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
anniversary

4901
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
And we're either thinking Disney World

4902
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
Because I'm not going to

4903
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
a con on my anniversary

4904
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Or Disneyland at the Grand Californian

4905
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
Nice

4906
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
So I'm going to be on the shoestring for

4907
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
GX3, but yeah

4908
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
My car has paid off this year, so I'm hoping

4909
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
I do the smart thing and save a little more money

4910
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
instead of spending it on frivolous things, but

4911
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
there will probably be a few frivolous things here and there, let's be real

4912
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Anyway, if you didn't

4913
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
get through tonight, I'm so sorry, but please consider

4914
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
sending us an email, participate at

4915
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
orangelaunchradio.com, but we are

4916
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
waiting way long you guys, we have got to wrap

4917
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
things up for the night, but what an

4918
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
awesome show tonight, and

4919
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
yeah, even though

4920
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
to follow up on that one call,

4921
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
Orangeland Radio is not changing, we're still the show where every

4922
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
gamer has a voice, and we're going to talk about news every week

4923
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
and comment

4924
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
on it and give our opinions just like

4925
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
we always have, but if we can

4926
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
encourage more people to

4927
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
make games, you know what?

4928
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
Because one of you guys out there

4929
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,000
might have the idea for the next great game

4930
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
that we talk about on a future show

4931
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
and so

4932
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
why wouldn't we not

4933
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
want to start that and foster that?

4934
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
So yes, it will be the theme

4935
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
over the coming weeks here at Orangeland Radio

4936
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
Thanks again

4937
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
so much for staying up late and listening to

4938
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
our show, be it on the podcast feed

4939
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
or being here

4940
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
live at the Voice Gees Network, vognetwork.com

4941
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
As we say every week, if you like the

4942
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
show, please tell a friend or five

4943
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
about the show, help spread the word

4944
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
we are an independent production

4945
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
and indie voices are so

4946
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
important out there, help spread the word

4947
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
not just about us, but your favorite

4948
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
indie podcast, that's why I say that

4949
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
and if for whatever reason

4950
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
you can't think of a lot of people, you really rack your

4951
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
brain, you're like, I just don't know anybody

4952
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
please consider leaving us a five star review

4953
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
wherever you found this show

4954
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
iTunes, Stitcher

4955
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
even if you do tell friends

4956
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
consider leaving a five star review there as well

4957
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
those go a long way

4958
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
in helping promotion on those various

4959
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
websites, because the makers of those sites look at that

4960
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
information when they consider who to feature

4961
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
so really appreciate your consideration for five star

4962
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
reviews on sites like iTunes

4963
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
Stitcher or wherever you found this show

4964
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
It's time to go around and get

4965
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
everybody's final thought for the night

4966
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
we will be back here in seven days to do it

4967
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
all again on the 21st

4968
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
we're getting towards the end of the year

4969
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
we might have to do, Latke Fest

4970
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
because it'll be right at the end of

4971
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
Hanukkah

4972
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
starts Tuesday right?

4973
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
which while I was high on coding

4974
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
I did the dance of Hanukkah around my house and

4975
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
decorated

4976
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
well happy Hanukkah to all of our listeners who celebrate

4977
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
this coming week and we'll check in with y'all on

4978
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Sunday and see how the festival's going

4979
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
and we will have the

4980
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
VoG jam ingredient

4981
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
will come out of the show

4982
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
next week in an epic edition

4983
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
of Listless

4984
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,000
I'll be a dreidel, just kidding

4985
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:28,000
now were we gonna have people submit

4986
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
ideas as well?

4987
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
we want your, yeah

4988
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
if nobody submits an idea

4989
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
fine, we'll make our own damn list

4990
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
but what we want to do, and this is different than our usual

4991
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
Listless, Latke, we want people to submit

4992
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
their ideas for

4993
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
us to consider for

4994
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,000
putting on the list, we don't usually do that in advance

4995
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
well that's good because I have no idea

4996
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
so submit away

4997
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4998
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
is the place to send those

4999
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
and you can also send those to

5000
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,000
our VoGnetwork.com

5001
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
posting of the show, for those of you listening on the podcast

5002
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,000
you can leave your ideas there as well

5003
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,000
again, it should be, what should

5004
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
the theme of the game be?

5005
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:08,000
Should it be about cats?

5006
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:10,000
Cats who are

5007
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
Now Rob, we have to specify

5008
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
that it's felines

5009
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
and not pussy

5010
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
Should it be

5011
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,000
Then we would have twat masters

5012
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:22,000
Should it be cats with labels?

5013
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,000
Should that be the theme of the game? Who knows

5014
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Send us your ideas, remember nothing

5015
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:28,000
that's copyrighted, please, we have to

5016
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:30,000
throw those out immediately

5017
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts

5018
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
for the night. Dar Sacher, I'll start with you

5019
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
our sick one, please feel better

5020
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,000
and we'll see you next week

5021
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Is that your final thought?

5022
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:42,000
Really? I hate that

5023
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:44,000
Where's my mute button?

5024
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:46,000
Alright, feel better

5025
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,000
My final thought for the night, my final thought is

5026
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,000
I don't think I've shaved in like ten days

5027
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
I really should probably do that, it's a good idea

5028
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,000
And I'm really excited that I finally

5029
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
have a BurgerTime cabinet in my house

5030
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,000
sort of

5031
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:00,000
It's multiple things and there's more games

5032
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,000
emulators on there

5033
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
Super BurgerTimes on it too

5034
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
There's more emulators on there, I will be

5035
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,000
making a point this week though, Rob

5036
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
to copy my ROM set off

5037
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
of my other cabinet because it's a lot better

5038
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
and it has Miss World nude

5039
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,000
That was the one thing I needed on the cabinet

5040
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
I had to make it work appropriate

5041
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
it was on there and it

5042
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
still actually may be on there, that's what I was looking at

5043
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
earlier, but I couldn't find it

5044
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
so I will copy my old ROM set

5045
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:28,000
and I'll dump it on there and then you'll have

5046
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,000
You'll have all the weird

5047
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
games on there including

5048
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:34,000
all the, was it

5049
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:36,000
Are we allowed to do Twitch streams of Miss Nude

5050
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,000
World 96 or is that against their terms of service?

5051
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
It's probably against their terms of service

5052
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
You can't do emulated stuff on Twitch

5053
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
anyway, I feel like

5054
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
I need to do a U stream or something

5055
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,000
I don't know if that computer is

5056
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:50,000
You could probably do it, it's not

5057
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
that fast, I don't have to run it from the cabinet

5058
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
I can run it from there, just thinking

5059
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
Anyway, Loki last

5060
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,000
but not least, your final thought tonight

5061
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
I'm going to work on lots of programming this week

5062
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
trying to make it a point that my son is going to want me to play

5063
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
Lego Marvel with him, that's fine, I can play Lego Marvel with him

5064
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
while he's awake, program him when he's not awake

5065
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
so, sounds good, sounds like some motivation

5066
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:10,000
this week, I am very motivated

5067
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,000
I can't wait to work on some new

5068
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
stuff, it'll be interesting

5069
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,000
to start from scratch again, by the way

5070
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,000
check your email, because our buddies

5071
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,000
from Cooking with Unity told you how to play

5072
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 with them

5073
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:24,000
Yes! Damn it, that's going to take me away

5074
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,000
from programming, but that's okay

5075
