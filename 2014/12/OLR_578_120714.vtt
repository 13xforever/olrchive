Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week Sony brought us the re-release of Final Fantasy 7 in glorious HD quality, upscaled, and ported. Uh, thanks?

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
But that's not all, we'll have more from the award show, plenty more news, your comments and calls right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this December the 7th of 2014 with the 578th episode of our show.

00:46.000 --> 00:57.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you over the next few hours to talk about all things video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and food. With my co-host, say hello to DarkSakura.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
I haven't had any food today.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh my gosh, how are you going to go for three hours without food?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
We're going to get food before we leave.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
No. Dan, go get me food.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
This is not going to be pretty. Uh oh, wait a minute. If you're talking to Dan, that must mean Dan the man is here in the house today joining us.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
I gotta go get food.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
Dan will be leaving, actually. So Dan, any final thoughts for us?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
No.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
How are you doing, Dan?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Good.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Good, yeah? Awesome.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
I can hear a feedback click every time I turn the mic on.

01:28.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, you don't have to turn the mic on and off. Don't worry about it. I do it over here. If I have to mute you, I just push a little button over here and it shuts Dan down.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
You can't silence me!

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Which will be all the time.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Oh, you're so loud the internets can hear me. On Jamie's mic.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Alright. Also, I have to introduce, of course, every week here with us, Techmaster Loki.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Hello.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I'm okay.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah?

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Good morning.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Afternoon.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
So, yeah, if you guys aren't aware, we're taping at a special time today, or broadcasting, whatever you want to say.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
We are live at noon on Sundays. We've been saying for the past couple weeks what we were going to do. We're live at noon today.

02:04.000 --> 02:14.000
This will rebroadcast at the normal time at VOG Network, six o'clock. So if you're listening at six o'clock, wondering why the chat room seems emptier than usual, it's because, oops, you forgot we were going to do the earlier time today.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
But we're rebroadcasting. And then, of course, our podcast listeners all get the same thing that they're used to, the show delivered on the podcast feed for you guys.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.000
But we do still have the chat over at live.vognetwork.com and folks chatting away.

02:27.000 --> 02:35.000
Some folks in chat talking about tea. Dungeon Buster saying, time for tea and crumpets. I guess because of the earlier hour. It's noon tea here.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.000
Or, in Loki's case, noon sandwiches. Because the sandwich place you'd love to go to was actually open today. Oh, not tea, Red Bull. I see.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Of course, this is Loki we're talking about here.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Who's calling me on my phone?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, who'd be calling you? Don't they know you have a show?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
No, they don't.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
All right. That is a loud, loud ringer for sure. All right.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
Anyway, the joys of doing live radio. Phones going off. People showing up. It's all good. You guys showing up in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, I don't have the chat room yet.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
You don't have the chat room yet.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
Because I just got this a few days ago.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Yeah, you have a new toy that you brought to the studio with you.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I have a 13-inch MacBook Pro.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Yeah?

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Because I go for the superior machinery.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Is that one with the pretty retina and all that stuff?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, it's retina.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Nice. I bet pornography looks beautiful on that thing.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
Twat and 2000 DPI. I don't know.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
Awesome. Well, how did you Christian it? What was the first thing you had to do on it?

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
The first thing I had to do was set up the internet.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
Really, that was about it. Well, actually, I had to do a system update, which was fine.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
I had to make sure that all the stuff that I normally see going on with Yosemite wasn't happening.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Right.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
And I have a perfect computer. I have named her Edie.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
Have you done any gaming on it? Oh, wait, gaming on a Mac.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Did you not see the post I made on my Facebook?

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm just giving you crap. Calm down.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I have both fractal and transistor.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Oh, nice. Okay.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So, playing through those.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Yeah. And there's more and more stuff, to be fair.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
There's more and more stuff, especially, I think, thanks to Steam in large part.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
You know, kind of putting things out there on Linux and Mac.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
There's more and more and more stuff showing up.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
A lot of the stuff on the Steam store, by the way, is available through the app store.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Okay.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
That's where I got transistor and fractal.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Nice.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Borderlands is on there. All the Borderlands games.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Bioshock.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
If you beat something on Steam PC, or, sorry, not beat something.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
If you bought something on Steam PC, don't you automatically get it on Steam Max?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Like, if you log into your library, you'd be able to download whatever?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I do, indeed.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Yeah, that's good.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I was going to say, but if you buy it on the Mac store, you don't get the trading cards.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
They don't have trading cards on Macs?

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
No, no, not if I buy through the app store.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, got it.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
No, not on, you know, Mac on Steam has trading cards.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And you don't get achievements, Steam achievements, or whatever they call it over there.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
It's achievements.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
I get smug superiority.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And that's very important.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Speaking of smug superiority, let's talk about this for our kickoff topic.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.000
This was a really crazy, busy week, considering that usually this time of year is very, very dead

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
because all the games have already been released.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
A lot of game developers are not even really working during this period because their games are out.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
And so, you know, this is the time of year where they actually get their time off

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
before they're putting in their 10- and 12-hour days again to ship whatever game is coming in 2015.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Usually things are awfully quiet.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
But we've had an insanely busy week in news.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Like, it's almost been like a winter E3.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
And that's in large part to the Game Awards happening this week and, of course, Sony's PlayStation Experience.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
Which the PlayStation Experience seemed like it was more of like a...

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
They had actual presentations versus just like, oh, here's some Sony games.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Yeah, they're doing panels and things like that, too.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Like, they are really turning it into their own, like, I don't want to say their own Penny Arcade Expo,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
but in a way, it's kind of what they're doing.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
I mean, it's probably a little smaller right now, but it's the first year.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
But we'll talk more about the PlayStation Experience a little later.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
Obviously, there's these very two distinct events going on.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
But I want to talk first about the Game Awards because it is the thing that happened first on Friday night.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
I don't know how many of you guys actually watched or maybe watched on the back end or whatever.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I forgot that it was on that day, so I had to go back.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And all I did was kind of skim through YouTube and went and watched all the trailers

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
and then skimmed through it some more trailers and then caught up to live and that was it.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
Well, you guys know if you listened to the show a few weeks ago, I was really skeptical about the Game Awards,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
especially how fast they were trying to put the whole thing together.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I was like, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of time here.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
But I actually did end up watching most of it.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I watched two... It was kind of long.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
It was a three-hour show, and I watched the first two hours,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
and then Alan needed me for something else, so I stopped.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
And I missed the best part, so I had to go back and watch it on YouTube the last hour.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
I kind of did what you guys skimmed through the last hour to watch all the Zelda Wii U gameplay, which was huge.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
Yeah, I gotta say, Zelda on Wii U, which they showed at the Game Awards, that does look really hot.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
It was very interesting the way they presented it, though,

07:22.000 --> 07:30.000
because they filmed Miyamoto playing on a television, but they never showed a direct feed of the TV.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
It was always showing what was on the TV.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
And I'm not sure why they chose to do it that way.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
Perhaps that was to prevent such a scrutiny eye to pick out the little things in the interface.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
I don't know. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with that.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
But yeah, they were showing it all off the little TV instead of a direct feed.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
But still, however they decided to show it, it looked great.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Dan, did you get a chance to see this footage yet of the Zelda Wii U?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I have not.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
Oh, you gotta check it out at some point. It looks gorgeous.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
You can definitely see where maybe the Skyrim, because we've heard this before,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
that they're being influenced by Skyrim a little bit,

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
and you can kind of see that even in the little bit that they showed with the gigantic world map,

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
being able to place a marker where you want to go, get on your horse,

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
and ride to the marker and kind of kill things along the way.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
They're doing a lot of that in this new Zelda game, and it looks interesting.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
It looks like it's going to be really rad. I'm excited.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
I've been playing something very similar to that called Dragon Age.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Freeform questing in Zelda.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Maybe. They didn't say anything about...

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
For the first time since, like, what? Zelda 1?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Well, they didn't say anything specifically about how questing would work,

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
so we can only infer that. We don't know that for sure,

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
but I would think there would at least have to be side quests, you would think.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
But I don't know. I mean, there's still a lot to be determined.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
That wasn't really what they were talking about with the reveal.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
But anyway, Nintendo really did kind of dominate the game awards.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I mean, there was some Sony and even Microsoft presence as well,

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
but Nintendo took a lot of the awards. Game of the Year, though, they didn't.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
They did not get Bayonetta 2, which a lot of people expected.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
Dragon Age 1 Game of the Year, which I get that, having played most of those nominees.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Game of the Last Couple Weeks.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Well, here's the thing. A lot of people are complaining, like,

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
how could you give Dragon Age Game of the Year when it's only been out two weeks?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
But you guys are forgetting. These critics have been playing them.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
All those people that were on the jury.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Whatever. The sponsor paid the most.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
Well, I heard about that too.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I mean, really. Really. It's like, oh, it's been out for, like, 13 seconds.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
It's Game of the Year.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Yeah, and I...

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, admittedly, it is a pretty hot looking game.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
I haven't played it, but I've watched it over Jamie's shoulder a lot,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
and I've been like, damn.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
And I saw a lot of people complaining on Twitter, and I was just kind of like,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
Bayonetta 2 is a great game, don't get me wrong.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
And if it had won, I couldn't have been upset.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
But I feel like the people criticizing Dragon Age for winning haven't really played it.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So, whatevs.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
But I mean, I can also see an argument that Bayonetta 2 is a better game. That's fine.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
But I just don't think there would be such anger if you've actually played Dragon Age

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
and you kind of go, oh, this game is really, really, has a lot of depth to it

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
and extremely well done storytelling.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
But the 16 people who are playing Bayonetta 2 realize how great it is.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
I hope it's sold better than that. I really do.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
They deserve it. They deserve a great success.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
Platinum is awesome. I mean, they make great games, but...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
And you can't feel...

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
Going single platform on Bayonetta was probably not the best call.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
I have a hard time feeling bad for Nintendo when Nintendo did win Developer of the Year.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
They got what? Sports Game of the Year for Mario Kart 8.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Because that's really a sports game.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Well, it's considered sports and racing.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
It's the best sports slash racing game.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Okay, whatever. But anyway, they did pretty well for themselves.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
They got best fighting game for Smash Brothers on Wii U as well, right?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
So, I mean, they did pretty well.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
But there weren't that many fighting games out this year.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
And they were nominated twice for Smash Brothers.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
They had two spots. Smash Brothers 3DS and Smash Brothers Wii U.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Come on.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
I kind of think the awards themselves are sort of...

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't want to say meaningless, but I think...

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
No, no, no. Meaningless is probably an accurate term.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
I think the community and Twitter and so forth is making it to be a much bigger deal than it really is.

11:19.000 --> 11:25.000
I mean, again, it's a group of 20 people who voted on what they believe the best game of the year is.

11:25.000 --> 11:33.000
And there's such diversity in the gaming world that I would not want to listen to just what one person or even one group of 20 people feel is the best game.

11:33.000 --> 11:40.000
It sounds kind of weird for me to ask this since I've had the exposure to your guys' program that I've had over the last 100,000 years.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
But do you guys do a Game of the Year, like an Orange Lounge Awards, anything like that?

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
Because the truth is, the things that you guys called Game of the Year would be just as meaningful as whatever they called Game of the Year.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That is the point exactly.

11:56.000 --> 12:04.000
I think the Game of the Year that any 20 people grouped together would call Game of the Year is just as meaningful as what these guys end up picking as Game of the Year.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
That is exactly the point.

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
Usually, the last show of the year will kind of try to do like a, what was your top three sort of thing.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
And it can kind of vary from year to year because also, we are not paid to do this full time.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Nor is most podcasters you're listening to their show unless it's tied into a major website.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
We're not paid to do this anytime.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
So most of the people that are talking about their Game of the Year haven't played everything that have come out in that year.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
And I always kind of put that disclaimer out there as like, this is my personal Game of the Year from what I've played.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
And there's also some years where I don't get around to the games of 2013 till 2014.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Well, and it used to be like, think of it this way, right?

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
So it used to be that there were, what, a dozen video game magazines that had some sort of relevance.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
You know, you had your EGM's, your game pros, your video games, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
And you had several editors and they would all do games of the year.

12:58.000 --> 13:08.000
And you know, you could actually at that point have probably had a consensus of industry professionals who could probably put together a fairly meaningful Game of the Year.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
You know, instead each magazine would just do their own.

13:11.000 --> 13:19.000
So now, what was it, Spike TV, was that 10 years ago they started doing their Game of the Year awards or the Spike TV Video Awards?

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
But that's all just so super commercial that you know that it's just sponsorship money talking, baby.

13:26.000 --> 13:36.000
And as much as I'm kind of saying some what could be construed as negative things about this awards ceremony, I actually thought it wasn't as bad as we all feared it was going to be.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
It was fairly decent.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
Sure, there were a lot of things that could have been done better, but for as rushed as that whole thing had to have been, I thought it was pretty decent.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
And a lot of that, Dan, is because that commercialism, a lot of that was really sucked out of it.

13:50.000 --> 13:59.000
You didn't really have the actors that were forced out there on stage and pretty men and pretty ladies who probably played Candy Crush Saga and that's it.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
You had a lot of people up there on the stage that were actually like game developers and game players.

14:06.000 --> 14:15.000
I think one moment that kind of put a bow on all that was when Trey Parker won the award for best voice acting or whatever they called it.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
He won the award for best voice acting for all those voices he did in the South Park game, right?

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
So he got up there on the stage and he said, only at the video game awards could I beat Kevin Spacey for an acting award.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
And he raised the trophy and walked off the stage. Kevin Spacey wasn't even there.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
So I thought that was kind of one of the moments to sort of sum the whole thing up.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
So I thought from that standpoint they did really well.

14:38.000 --> 14:49.000
But I'm going to tell you my favorite, favorite thing, the thing I loved most of all, the thing that, oh my god, I would have watched three hours of nothing but this and they need to do it again next year.

14:49.000 --> 14:59.000
Kudos to whoever got Ken and Roberta Williams to come out of hiding and take the stage at the video game awards to accept their award for gaming icon.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
That was awesome.

15:01.000 --> 15:19.000
And if you don't know who Ken and Roberta Williams are, you really need to go back and do some gaming history research because pretty much every amazing 80s and 90s point and click adventure game that came from Sierra On-Line Entertainment or even other companies was inspired by something that Ken and Roberta Williams did.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
And they left the game industry in the late 90s.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
I think Phantasmagoria was the last game that Roberta Williams was really intimately involved with.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
She might have produced one of the later King's Quest games but Phantasmagoria was kind of the last one.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
And things in the industry started to shift.

15:33.000 --> 15:43.000
We had a phase where we were getting away from adventure games and so they kind of left the industry at that time because people weren't really playing those kinds of games anymore.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
And they have really disappeared from the public eye and they rarely make public appearances.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
I think they've been spotted once or twice in the past decade.

15:52.000 --> 16:04.000
So to see them come out on stage and the audience really... I'm so happy that the audience was cheering and screaming and we love you and all that stuff and not like, who dis?

16:04.000 --> 16:14.000
Thank you, video game audience, for knowing it's so important who Ken and Roberta Williams were and making them feel welcome because I kind of hope it might convince them to try something else.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I don't know but if they want to retire forever, they certainly deserve it.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
They've done so much for the industry.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
That was seriously my favorite part.

16:22.000 --> 16:31.000
I know that seems like one little thing but that gave the whole thing so much more cred, in my opinion, to see that.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
I was very, very, very happy with that.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Did they come to get bought and disassembled by EA or Activision?

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
I believe it was Universal, then Vivendi, then Activision.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
So it's kind of a chain of events.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
A free level disassemble there.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, exactly. And I think it was the Universal acquisition that didn't... because it's kind of what King's Quest VIII turned into.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
But looking at the footage from the new King's Quest game, that kind of surprised me because the new King's Quest does not appear to be a point-and-click adventure at all.

16:59.000 --> 17:09.000
It appears to be something a little more like... I don't want to say like Dragon's Lair but it's definitely more like... I get that more like cartoony 3D adventure sort of gist from it.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
It looks really good and to hear Roberta Williams go, I want to play this. I've seen it and I want to play it.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
That alone makes me go, all right, I'm going to listen to you because you know what you're talking about.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
She's like, and there's two L's in Williams on the check.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Yeah, right.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
DungeonBuster says in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, DungeonBuster says,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Seeing Ken and Roberta Williams on stage is my favorite moment from the award show.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
ActDev says, Activision probably considering the King's Quest reimagining.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
Oh yeah, that was... I mean, getting them out there to unveil the trailer was certainly a huge part of it.

17:43.000 --> 17:52.000
DungeonBuster says, They're so incredibly private after they left that all anyone has really seen from them is the occasional text blurb or short form interview.

17:52.000 --> 17:58.000
Alan Alchemy says, Their presence gave so much more legitimacy to the show over anything Spike did.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
I... without sounding like a fanboy, although I guess if I'm going to fanboy for anything, it's going to be Ken and Roberta Williams.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
It's always a good idea to pander to the 40 year old audience.

18:10.000 --> 18:17.000
Well, that's why I said thank God the audience did know who they were and was cheering and made them feel the love.

18:17.000 --> 18:24.000
Because if you enjoy The Walking Dead, which was the game of the year a couple of years ago, right?

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
A lot of what you see in that game, you can thank Ken and Roberta Williams for. Let's be real.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
Every... it's like every adventure game owes its origins to either Ultima or King's Quest.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Every single one of them.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Everyone.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
So, you know, if people don't understand who they are, I mean, it's understandable because they've stepped out of the limelight. They don't make games.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
The truth is game creators are fairly underappreciated.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
And when they do become rock stars...

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
Especially in that age.

18:49.000 --> 18:57.000
Right. When they do become the rock stars of game creation, then they normally get a little too full of themselves and they try to make a Daikatana and it kills them.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
So, you know.

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
But yeah, I mean, speaking of King's Quest or Ultima, next year if they want to get Lord British on stage, just let him talk for three hours because Lord knows the man could do it.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
I would be totally fine with that as well.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, because, you know, you just want to hear Garriott talk about how fucking great he is.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And that he's an astronaut.

19:15.000 --> 19:24.000
I went to his panel at Dragon Con and listened to him talk about his fucking mansion for like an hour and it was worth every minute of my time.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
It was worth every minute of my time.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Garriott is like...

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
The man's a fucking genius.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm the best motherfucker that's ever lived.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And yes you are. Yes you are.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
Did you ever see the documentary that he did talking about his mansion?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Lord British.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Just like showing all the secret passages and stuff?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
No, I did. I need to watch that.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
You need to watch that. It's pretty awesome.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
Yeah, I do. I do. No, he talked about it.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
It's called Lord British. I'm so great.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Alright. So, anyway.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Although. Although.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Although.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
He is responsible for that really shitty Facebook game that had to play.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
I get over it.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Although.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I'm sorry. I'm not getting over it.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Listen. You're better than this.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
You don't need to have a garage sale game on Facebook.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And Tabula Rasa. I understand. I understand.

20:08.000 --> 20:13.000
But the man's allowed a few stinkers in his decades long great career.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Anyway.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
He made a terrible RPG when he was a teenager when nobody else was making terrible RPGs.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Give him some slack.

20:23.000 --> 20:28.000
As much as I'd love to just talk about people I love from 80s and 90s computer game development.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
I do want to get back into some of the other stuff.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
I just want to mention one other thing that I thought was really weird about the award show.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Okay. So, it was a video game award show, obviously.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Although, there was lots of trailers.

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
I mean, it was really three quarters trailers and new game presentation and like a quarter awards.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
So, one thing that was really awkward is that, you know.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
Jeff Keeley would be talking to somebody like Reggie Fils-Aime and he'd be like.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
So, tell us about what Nintendo's doing. And then he'd be all.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
And by the way, congratulations because you won developer of the year. Here's your trophy.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
Like, it was very much like I purposely brought you over here to kill two birds with one stone.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
And get you to pimp something and then hand you a statue.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Like, that happened a lot throughout the whole awards presentation.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
That was kind of weird.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
But at the same time, the freaking thing was three hours long and kind of needed to be cut back.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
So, they needed to cut some corners.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
So, I'm not sure where that happy balance is.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
I actually think they might have done.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
And this is going to sound really weird.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
They might have done too many world premieres.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
And I think they really should have focused on the stuff that was really new.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
You know, things like the Tacoma trailer.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
But I like a third trailer for No Man's Sky.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And yes, I understand it's the same thing every time.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
Don't let me start it on No Man's Sky.

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
I have had it officially with flying through fucking space.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
Okay, here's the problem with No Man's Sky that I'm seeing right here.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And I'm going to tell you, here's my worry about this game.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
I think it's going to be fucking boring.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Because it looks really amazing that you can visit all these planets and stuff.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And there's somewhat different things on there.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
I think I'm going to get so bored so fast with that game.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
And that's what I'm worried about.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
It's like they haven't really shown what you do other than exploring new things.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Okay, I was bitching about that on Twitter.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And of course, Bobby jumped in and said,

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Well, Rob, look at this YouTube. It's all right here.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
And he leaked me this YouTube.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
And sure enough, there was a 14-minute GameSpot had done a preview or something

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
where they actually showed some of the gameplay and the fact that,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
yes, those ships do shoot things.

22:22.000 --> 22:27.000
And you can explore the planets and all this stuff.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
So there is a game in there.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
But these trailers we keep seeing don't really show any of that.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I still want to buy it, but I just think I'm going to get bored with it really fast.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Seriously, when I saw it again at the PlayStation experience,

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
I was like, all right, this is now past bordering on pretentious.

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
And I understand I'm probably pissing people off with what I'm saying

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
because some people are very excited for that game.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
And I understand it's more of an indie company and all this stuff.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
But I'm just like, you guys, at these big, big, big awards shows,

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
they have shown the same thing three times.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
So I really need to see some...

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
It's essentially the same trailer, just different planets each time.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
And yeah, that's cool.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
Okay, here's my example.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Here's my example and why I'm concerned.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
Because there was another game almost ten years ago at this point

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
that was very big on this whole,

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
we're going to go from the smallest of smallest of micronisms

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
to getting bigger and bigger.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
And then it's going to be a civilization and you take over the world and all this stuff.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
I know what you're talking about.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I'm talking about Spore. Remember?

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
And there was a lot of good ideas in Spore as well,

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
but ultimately the game felt like a collection of mini-games.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
So if you want to know why I'm sitting here giving No Man's Sky a hard time

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
for doing the same thing over and over,

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
it's because I've played Spore and I feel like I've kind of been here before.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
So I just want to see a little more about how do those littler parts

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
make the big thing function?

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
Because that's a very important part of the game, if that makes sense.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
I would love nothing more than for this game to come out and blow my fucking mind

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
and be like, I really shouldn't have given this game such a hard time on all those trailers

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
because this game is fucking amazing.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
I would love nothing more than for that to happen.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
But right now, since I haven't played it, I can't really say that yet.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
All I can say is, okay, I've seen the same,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
it's been the same joke three times.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
It's like an episode of this show. Come on.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
So there you go. That's my thoughts on No Man's Sky.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
I go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
DungeonBuster says, I'm excited for it, but I understand where Sky is coming from.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Raven's Dolphin says, that concert was something, just show the game.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
Static 68 is cool, but show off the game, it's just colorful and whatever.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, No Man's Sky seems way too ambitious.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I hope they deliver in the end. Yeah, me too.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
EB says, oh, Spore was such a disappointment, right?

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
But there was so many, I mean, and it's really hard to figure out where that game went wrong

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
because there were so many good ideas in it.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
But I think at the end of the day, it felt like a bunch of little mini games.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
It just didn't feel cohesive.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
It didn't feel cohesive. Yeah, exactly.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I think that was a big problem with it.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Those comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Alright, so that's the Game Awards in a nutshell.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
Anything else you guys want to say about it?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I didn't watch it.

25:17.000 --> 25:24.000
I didn't think that the Dragon Age Inquisition thing was as clever as the Mass Effect thing last year.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
Oh, with the little Conan O'Brien spots where he's saying,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
so what do you do in this game? Question dragons?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
Some of that was a little silly.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
I get that Conan O'Brien does these hilarious- Even the introduction thing.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Yeah, I know.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
It was a little, I hate to say it, but if they could have cut something,

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
maybe that's something they could have cut was those little Conan O'Brien bits

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
because they did get a little grating.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
But, Dar Sakura, do go back and watch for Ken and Roberta Williams

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
because I literally got verklempt watching them get on stage.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
I was at this thing called work.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
So, even though I skimmed all of it-

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
There's this thing called YouTube.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
I didn't notice that they had anybody calling gamers nerds or anything like that.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Like, I think it was Joel McHale was doing last year.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
Yeah, yeah.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
You know, gamers are nerd, you know, basement dwelling.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
No, none of that.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
Thank goodness they've realized that, hey, those jokes aren't funny anymore.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
And they never really were that funny to begin with.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I mean, it's like, okay, yeah, you're the first person to make the reference

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
that gamers live in their mom's basements and play video games all day

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and don't get exposure to the sun.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
It's like, oh, wow, that's the first time I've ever heard that joke.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Do you remember when I came back from the very first GamerX

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
and I was a little critical of Pandora Boxx, who's the famous drag queen

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
who was on RuPaul's Drag Race because she was making those same type of jokes

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
at GamerX, and I was like, know your audience.

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
Hello, you know, those jokes are really cheap and it wasn't funny at all.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
It's kind of funny, but it's a very similar sort of thing.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I just compared a drag queen to Joel McHale.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I'm okay with that, totally okay with that.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
All right, anyway.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
Great job, sir.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
that we have been playing this week, and then we can get into some news.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
Actually, for all the work I've been doing, it was pretty busy.

27:15.000 --> 27:19.000
I played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition, and I've managed to get almost back

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
to where I was in about 10 hours less gameplay,

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
plus I'm a higher level than when I left off, so I'm doing okay.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
And I've been playing Fractal because I freaking love Fractal.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I got a...

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Fractal seems to be like your Tetris of sorts.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
It's like the old go-to puzzle game you can always rely on for a good time.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
It requires a lot of thought.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Yeah.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
How do you play it then?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Get in the kitchen and make me a sandwich.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
I don't even care if this isn't our house, but make me a sandwich.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Speaking of pretentious...

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Um...

27:59.000 --> 28:02.000
I've just been playing a few things then.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Okay, I'm just giving you crap.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I've played some Bejeweled.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Yeah?

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
That's...

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
What else did I play, though?

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
I played something else because I picked up something through one of the...

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Stupid sales...

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh, yeah, I played more Mountain.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Game is so stupid.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
But, like, I'm gonna spin the mountain for a minute.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Okay, I'm done.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Awesome.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
All right.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
Oh, yeah, and Dan got me Knights.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
Oh, Sonic.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
Was that in the Sega Humble Bundle?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
The Sega Humble Bundle.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Nice. Very cool.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
It was okay.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah, I played really only two things this week.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
A lot of it because my son's actually playing it now.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
It's hilarious.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
He actually knows how to play games now.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
Back from when, oh, I used to put Grand Theft Auto on and he'd sometimes hit the gas and drive straight.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
Now he can actually control a character using the analog stick and stuff and walk around the city and do things.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
How far he has come.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
So I've been playing a lot of that.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
Just trying to unlock things.

29:11.000 --> 29:20.000
So now I figured out how to get to the part of the helicarrier where I can actually unlock the Deadpool bricks to give you, like, multipliers and stuff.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
And so I'm trying to get some of that done so I can unlock more characters and all that stuff.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
So I played a ton of that this week, which is surprising because I have Grand Theft Auto 5 that I haven't really touched much of.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
That's surprising.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Well, not really.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Because Grand Theft Auto 5, I've played a ton of it already.

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
And so basically I'm playing the same game again, whereas Lego Marvel Super Heroes, I've never played through it before.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
So I can see why I'm more interested in this right now than I am Grand Theft Auto 5.

29:45.000 --> 29:52.000
Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 5, I got really excited for a minute because I thought that that game was going to be on sale this weekend.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Because they were saying something at the Game Awards.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
Go on Steam and all these Game of the Year things are going to be on sale.

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
So you go on Steam and sure enough, you can get, like, the South Park game for what, like, 15 bucks?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
18 for the entire thing.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Right, but Grand Theft Auto, not on sale.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
No.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Well, it's not out yet on PC.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Oh, that's right. Well, even pre-order or whatever.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
In January.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
I thought maybe it was PlayStation 4 then. Maybe they said something about PlayStation 4 because they were like, oh, it'll be out on Play...

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, no, I saw that.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
And there's no sale there either.

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
Yeah, they do have the thing for the PlayStation Experience stuff on there, but yeah, they don't have it.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Sorry, I got that. Lots of sales. I got that twisted in my head.

30:27.000 --> 30:35.000
Then it was the PlayStation Experience sale and they said go online, there's a bunch of stuff on sale, and Grand Theft Auto 5, they, like, showed the logo and I was like, yes, I'll finally get it.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
But they are going to still, they're doing their holiday sales still, but it's still week one.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
It's been week one for, like, a week and a half now, so I'm waiting for them to switch it up.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
Very, very, very, very close to buying Wolfenstein and New Order.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
I may do that today. I don't know. I'm that close because it's 50% off right now, but we'll see.

30:55.000 --> 31:02.000
Anyway, so yeah, I was surprised. I was kind of playing that more than anything, but once again, it's a new game to me.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
And surprisingly, there's a lot to do in it.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
I actually was reading some, they're talking about, you know, I was reading through some of the facts and stuff.

31:10.000 --> 31:19.000
They were saying that it's very similar to Lego Batman 2, so I have to see if that's, I don't think that was on PlayStation 4, so I may have to check that out, though.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.000
That sounds interesting.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
But it's a fun game. I'm having fun with it.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
The humor's good. I mean, that's kind of what I enjoy about it. It's pretty funny.

31:26.000 --> 31:33.000
And then the other game I played, very briefly, but I'm running into a problem because it is early access and it's still buggy.

31:33.000 --> 31:40.000
And one of the known bugs is that the controls don't work well with my gamepad on Windows 8.1, but it's a game called I Am Bread.

31:40.000 --> 31:47.000
And it's a game from the folks that brought you Surgeon Simulator.

31:48.000 --> 31:57.000
And you know, Surgeon Simulator has a very unique control style. Well, this is just the same. A little bit different.

31:57.000 --> 32:04.000
You use the, on gamepad, you use the shoulder buttons and the triggers to move your toast.

32:04.000 --> 32:11.000
So each corner of the bread, or I'm sorry, your bread, and you're trying to become toast.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
So you're a piece of bread trying to become toast. Simple premise, but you have to move across a room in order to get there.

32:18.000 --> 32:28.000
And so each trigger controls a corner of the bread. And so you stick, you know, one side down and you kind of tilt with your analog stick.

32:28.000 --> 32:35.000
And you stick the next side down, you kind of roll around. But you have to be edible, so you can't like roll through things that might get you dirty.

32:35.000 --> 32:40.000
And in the same time, you're also destroying the house because, you know, it's just hard to control.

32:40.000 --> 32:46.000
Gaming is so strange right now. She's been playing a game about a mountain. You've been playing a game about bread.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
Somebody created an OLR dream game about shit. Actual shit.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Pixel shit.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
This is just, this is a very interesting time in gaming, is it not?

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
It's a funny game though.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
No, it sounds great. It sounds great.

32:59.000 --> 33:06.000
But that's it. I mean seriously though, think about it. The premise of this game can be some, you are a piece of bread that's trying to become toast.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
That's the premise of the game.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
What do all three of those things I have in common have?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Bread that eventually leads to shit?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
No, it's just the fact that...

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
And you can poop on a mountain.

33:17.000 --> 33:26.000
It's just the fact that all those things are like these very obscure concepts, original concepts, but that could be still very simple in execution.

33:26.000 --> 33:36.000
But it's funny because it's so hard to control. It's just like, it's the same appeal that you have with Surgeon Simulator where, you know, of course you're fucking stuff up.

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
You're dropping the drill in the guy's face because you can't maneuver your hand well with the keyboard and mouse.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
So this is kind of the same thing.

33:44.000 --> 33:50.000
I'm gonna have to try to do it with keyboard and mouse I guess because I can't, they don't have a workaround yet.

33:50.000 --> 33:56.000
The problem is with the gamepads that the triggers are backwards.

33:56.000 --> 34:04.000
So instead of pulling down the triggers to have it where you kind of grab the ground, you have to let them go so they're reversed.

34:04.000 --> 34:07.000
And so it's kind of hard to train your brain to do that right.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
I wish they had a way just to flip the axis on it, but they don't.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
So there's unfortunately no workaround for it yet.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
But maybe a joy key type thing will fix it.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
But right now they're working. It's early access, it just came out.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
So I think I have a story about it later on so we'll talk about it.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
But it's funny.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
Well it sounds like you're not the only one that's being tempted by these sales going on.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I'm looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
Fabrice is in our chatroom saying, I bought Wolfenstein yesterday, didn't have time to play it though, but that'll be something for tomorrow.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
Well already there's free, I downloaded Injustice and I haven't got a chance to play that yet.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.000
Yeah but a Playstation Plus perk is a little different than actually purchasing.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
It's so many games though!

34:48.000 --> 34:57.000
Seriously, my digital library on Playstation Network is starting to get, it's not as bad as Steam because that would be a lot more money.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
There's not as many discounts there, but it's getting pretty big.

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
It's just like, I'm never going to play these games, but I'm downloading them just in case!

35:06.000 --> 35:13.000
Sony's trying to compete a little more with dropping games to a really, really low price to make them more appealing.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
There's a lot of stuff on sale right now.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
I buy digital a ton on there, it's just so convenient.

35:17.000 --> 35:23.000
Instead of going to the store and buying stuff on sale, or use games, which I probably should.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
Alright, let me talk about my gaming week real quick and then we'll go over to Dan.

35:26.000 --> 35:33.000
I actually don't have a lot of new stuff because the only real new stuff I played, I played Ultimate NES Remix on the Nintendo 3DS which just came out on Friday.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
What?

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
What?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Yeah, it's 30 bucks.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
I gotta get it.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah, I can get my DS if you want to check it out.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
It's the only reason I've even close to wanted a Wii U is NES Remix.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
So now that it's on the 3DS, fuck the Wii U.

35:46.000 --> 35:55.000
And so, yeah, it's kind of a greatest hits compilation, but they finally got leaderboards on every level which is kind of a nice thing to see.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
I only played like 30 minutes or less of the game so I don't really feel comfortable giving the thing an entire review.

36:00.000 --> 36:08.000
But if you already own it on the Wii U, you might want to just think carefully about buying it on the 3DS as well because there's not really a lot of new stuff.

36:08.000 --> 36:14.000
Except for the fact that they have, I don't know what they call it, like Ultra Super Mario, or like Super Fast Mario Brothers or something.

36:14.000 --> 36:21.000
Which is basically an emulated version of Super Mario Brothers, but with the speed turned up to like 500%.

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
So you're like running super fast.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
So does the time go that fast too?

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Yes, so you have to be very fast to get through the levels.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Gotta go fast, gotta go fast.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
And there's also like, they have the championship mode.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
Sorry, just because of what we're talking about here.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.000
I know we were not going to talk about it because at least I don't think we're going to talk about it.

36:44.000 --> 36:50.000
But that Mario Maker looks pretty awesome though.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
It does.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
You know, I wasn't really giving it much credit before.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I'm like, wow, that does look pretty sweet.

36:56.000 --> 37:01.000
Their last trailer that they did was really like, ooh, that's some pretty cool stuff there.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
It's going to be like Little Big Planet for Super Mario Brothers.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
This is the game a lot of people have been wanting, so I'm excited for that.

37:08.000 --> 37:18.000
So I also played just a little bit of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, which very much struck me as, wow, EA has definitely this multiplayer model.

37:18.000 --> 37:26.000
Because this looks very similar with the whole opening the packs and stuff as Mass Effect multiplayer had, and as I'm seeing in the Dragon Age multiplayer.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
But I didn't really play enough of Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare to tell you much more.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
But I imagine a lot of you are playing it this week, and we'll get into why later on.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Otherwise, some of the same stuff I've been playing.

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
I'm up to level 97 on World of Warcraft Warlords of Draenor.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Alan and I have been playing more Diablo III.

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
We got to level 70 on his seasonal, which is nice.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
So Alan got his transmog gear for season one, and now I have two level 70s in seasonal.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Because I have an addiction.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Yeah, all on PC.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I do have a level 70 on PS4, though.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
But there's no seasons on PS4.

37:58.000 --> 38:04.000
And there never will be because you're not always connected on PS4, and people have already figured out how to hack the game.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
So they're not going to do it because they know people will cheat.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
Because the game is not always online.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Who cares?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
I know, I know.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
So yeah, that's really it for my gaming week.

38:18.000 --> 38:25.000
More Final Fantasy XIV, a little bit of Dragon Age, more Geometry Wars III, which I awfully still enjoy quite a bit.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
Was able to beat the second boss in that, and now I'm making my way through the green stages.

38:29.000 --> 38:34.000
When I'm not playing some of the retro stages in the game, but that game is a lot of fun as well.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
That's my gaming week.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Dan, how about you? How was your gaming week?

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
I've done very little gaming this week, unfortunately.

38:40.000 --> 38:47.000
I did buy the Humble Bundle for Sega, and I played Sonic Generations for the first time, and I played Sonic in the All-Stars Racing.

38:47.000 --> 38:54.000
And actually what happened was I bought the Humble Bundle for Sonic All-Stars Racing, and then they re-released it with Generations.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
So I bought it again so I can get Sonic Generations.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
But it's an opportunity to give money to my favorite charity, Sega.

39:01.000 --> 39:06.000
So, there you go. Most of the other stuff I gifted to Jamie.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Fair enough. That works.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
I probably could have given you a Sonic Racing since I already bought it.

39:12.000 --> 39:18.000
I seriously am swimming Steam codes in my Humble Bundle library that I just have duplicates of.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Why don't you just pay some in chat? Be like, here guys, thanks for listening.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
They may not work internationally, though. That's the only thing I'm worried about.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
We are fortunate we are joined by people in time zones that usually can't tune into the show.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
I think it should be fine. I think that they don't.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
One way to find out.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Yeah, let's do it.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Let's see what happens.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
Alright, so that is it for all our gaming weeks.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Let's get into some quick housekeeping. Don't forget to follow us on Facebook.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
Orange Launch Radio will be returning live at its normal time next week.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
Sorry for that. Some people have told me, I like the noon time better.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
Sorry guys, it's just that we have to kind of make a lot of rearrangements to do the show earlier.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
We can't move the show to noon ourselves every week.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
But don't forget the show is podcast and the great thing about that,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
you can listen to the podcast whenever you damn well please.

40:12.000 --> 40:16.000
I know some people that don't listen to the show until Saturday.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Because that's when it's convenient for their schedule.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
So, you know what, that's the great thing.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Or some people binge listen to O-L-R too.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
They're like, I gotta catch up on a month worth of O-L-R.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
So I'm gonna play M-M-O's and listen to O-L-R literally all day.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
I've had people tweet me that before and I think that's really awesome.

40:31.000 --> 40:37.000
And I don't mind being in the background while you're grinding wolf pelts

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
and whatever you need to get in your M-M-O.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
It's okay, I was listening to Mist in History when I'd go to the gym.

40:43.000 --> 40:49.000
I would learn about Crazy King Ludwig and lose calories.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
I listen to What's the Tea with RuPaul and Michelle Visage.

40:52.000 --> 40:56.000
Because it keeps me laughing and gets me going.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I don't do podcasts, but I do...

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
Wait, you don't do podcasts?

41:00.000 --> 41:04.000
Well, listening to podcasts. I don't really listen to podcasts too much,

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
but I do watch the web series, which, as you probably saw,

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I'm trying to get them on the show, so hopefully soon.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Just have to get them to commit to a day.

41:11.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah, nice. I should give a plug, because they're always good about plugging us

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
to some of the other shows that some friends of mine do,

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
because I do listen in the car a lot to GameBui.org,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
which today is Captain Spike's birthday, by the way.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
I listen a lot to Koopa Club, which we were talking about our game of the year,

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
which depends on what group you are.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.000
I can already tell you Koopa Club will name Bayonetta 2 their game of the year,

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
because they love Nintendo that much over there.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Video Game Realness probably will also name Bayonetta 2.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
There are also big Nintendo fans over there.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
Game Bar, there's lots of great other shows I listen to as well.

41:45.000 --> 41:49.000
I would like a Wii, but I just can't justify buying one without my wife getting mad.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
You never know. You never know. They might even...

41:52.000 --> 42:00.000
So family, if you buy me one, then that's okay, because then I can get one.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
All right, let's get into some news.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
We're going to get into the news for the week, of which there was quite a bit,

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
thanks to PlayStation's event, and even without that,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
there was still a lot of stuff going on. It was a very busy week.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.000
It was interesting. So this week, there was a couple announcements

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
from Capcom regarding Street Fighter.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.000
One being, of course, that Capcom is bringing Ultra Street Fighter IV

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
exclusively to PlayStation 4 this spring.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
They're saying that the port of the game will come with all the costumes

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
that have been made available so far via DLC.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
No firm date has been given yet to when we can expect that.

42:38.000 --> 42:45.000
But on top of that, not only are people on PlayStation 4 getting Ultra Street Fighter IV,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
they are also getting Street Fighter V.

42:48.000 --> 42:55.000
That's right. Street Fighter V has been announced as a PlayStation 4 and PC exclusive.

42:55.000 --> 43:01.000
And before you think, hey, that they did the same thing with Tomb Raider on Xbox One,

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
I'm just going to wait until the exclusive period is done,

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
they made sure to clarify that, in fact, as Adam Boyce said,

43:09.000 --> 43:15.000
PlayStation 4 will be the only console this game ever appears on.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
I don't think you get much clearer than that.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
Well, until Super Street Fighter V. Or Street Fighter V Turbo.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Or Street Fighter V Turbo Ultra Mega.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
Yeah, I'm not holding out that they're not going to have six or seven different re-releases of the game.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
I think a big thing to consider why Microsoft didn't get this game,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
and I'm not trying to hate on Xbox One.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
Xbox One, I don't think there's any reason why Xbox One doesn't deserve the game.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
However, exclusives are a part of the industry.

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
This is why Mario doesn't show up on PlayStation 4.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
You know, what would Nintendo have for their Wii U if they didn't have exclusives?

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
So exclusives are just a part of this industry, and wheeling and dealing and all this stuff.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
However, there's another huge factor coming into play,

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
which is why the Xbox One got shut out of this,

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
and that is the cross-platform play between PC and PlayStation 4.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
That's huge.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
And we all know that Microsoft, for whatever reason,

44:14.000 --> 44:19.000
has chosen to exclude themselves from these types of cross-plays.

44:19.000 --> 44:24.000
Which is weird, because they used to do that back in the early Xbox 360 days.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.000
Xbox One could have Final Fantasy XIV.

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
Square Enix wanted to do it for Xbox One, but they would not run separate servers for Microsoft.

44:32.000 --> 44:40.000
So, in a way, although I think at the end of the day Sony and Capcom have an arrangement,

44:40.000 --> 44:46.000
Capcom is a Japanese company, the Xbox One is a non-factor in Japan right now.

44:46.000 --> 44:49.000
As much as that might, you know, sting to hear, it's the reality.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Xbox One's a non-factor in Japan right now.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
It makes this relationship make a lot of sense.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
But at the same time, this is going to put a lot of pressure on Microsoft,

44:57.000 --> 45:02.000
because I think there's going to be a perceived notion that a big reason why the Xbox One didn't get this

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
is because it doesn't support the cross-platform play.

45:04.000 --> 45:09.000
And I think if you are hoping that Ultra Street Fighter V, or whatever the fuck they call it,

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
will come to Xbox One, that wall will have to drop.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.000
So this is going to put a lot of pressure on Microsoft to reverse that policy.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
And I'm going to predict, I'm going to be one of those guys making predictions,

45:21.000 --> 45:28.000
this is, that's mine, this is going to be one of those things that they come out at E3 next year

45:28.000 --> 45:31.000
and say that they're going to drop the wall.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
I'm actually going to go so far to predict they're going to announce Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox One next E3.

45:37.000 --> 45:43.000
And this will be their big, we are no longer requiring that Xbox One have their own isolated servers.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
So, we'll see.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I still think they're all full of crap.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
Well, what do you guys think of the Street Fighter V reveal?

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
Because I'm seeing a lot of people, I mean, there's definitely two camps.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
There's definitely some people that are very, very, very excited to see it.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
But there's some people that are like, it looks a lot like Street Fighter IV.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
It does look a lot like Street Fighter IV, just with more particles.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
I like how the stages are, though, where they're busting through the wall and it's kind of extended out.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I think that's something that...

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Mortal Kombat.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
And Justice.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
And Justice I know did that.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
But I want to say that I think King of Fighters had that as well.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Yeah, way back in the day, yeah.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
And that was special when it was done in Mortal Kombat II.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Or, no, actually, I think even Dead or Alive did that.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
I don't know, they've all done that at this point.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
But it looked different.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
It's something that's separated, I guess.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
I still feel like what we got.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.000
I think that gameplay trailer that we got was an apology from Capcom for the whole thing leaking a day early.

46:50.000 --> 46:54.000
Because Yoshinori Ono looked a little surprised.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
He was kind of taken by surprise because the guy was like,

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
oh, we do have some gameplay footage to show.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
And he was kind of like, oh, okay.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
He's so adorably cute and he's skipping over to see what's on the phone.

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
I love that guy.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Anyway, so he kind of looked a little surprised.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
And I think that was probably Capcom's apology.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Because that Street Fighter V trailer had leaked a day early.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
That took a lot of wind out of the PlayStation Experience keynote sales.

47:17.000 --> 47:21.000
There was a lot of other good stuff at that keynote.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I'm not saying it was a bad keynote or anything.

47:23.000 --> 47:27.000
But that Street Fighter V unveil, exclusive on PlayStation 4.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Imagine if they were able to keep that a secret.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
That would have been a huge moment for that room in Vegas.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
Huge moment.

47:33.000 --> 47:36.000
And so to kind of have that knocked away, they needed something to make up for it.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
So I think Capcom gave them the gameplay as an apology.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
But I think it's so, so early on.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
I think it's just too soon to tell.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
I think there's many, many more layers to be peeled back about this game.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
So I think it's definitely too early.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
I mean, right now, yes, it looks quite a bit like Street Fighter IV.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
But I'm still hopeful that we're going to see more of the differences as time goes on here.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
That's for sure.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
I want another Marvel vs. Capcom.

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Dungeon Buster says,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Street Fighter IV is still going strong.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Seems a bit too soon for a new one.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
Well, it did come right after that talk about Ultra Street Fighter IV.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
Yeah, Ultra Street Fighter IV would be in the spring.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I'm guessing this would be coming out in fall.

48:17.000 --> 48:22.000
Actually, maybe even late summer, I'd guess.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Because I know Capcom tends to release stuff at weird times.

48:24.000 --> 48:31.000
They like to use August or October usually for their releases like this.

48:31.000 --> 48:36.000
Well, I think 2015 is generous.

48:36.000 --> 48:41.000
I think there's a distinct possibility Street Fighter V not till 2016.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Honestly.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Who cares?

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
No, seriously, who cares? We're going to get new Mortal Kombat next year.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
We're going to have Ultra Street Fighter IV.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
Oh, yeah, I think it's alright.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
Can we get new PlayStation All-Stars? I'd be down with that.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Maybe I'm in the minority there.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
I think you might be.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
Moving on, speaking of Steam, we've talked a little bit about Steam tonight.

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
Steam came out with some big news independent of all these other events going on the weekend.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
Steam unveiled Steam Broadcasting this week.

49:13.000 --> 49:20.000
Steam Broadcasting will allow you to stream your gameplay to friends, strangers, and any Steam user

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
without having to use open broadcast software any other time.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
It's built into Steam.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
So if you start playing and you hit the broadcast button, you can broadcast your gameplay.

49:31.000 --> 49:36.000
You can also, and this is a pretty neat thing, you can also keep your streaming private.

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
So if you only want to stream to a handful of people, you can do that.

49:41.000 --> 49:47.000
So this is very interesting, is that Steam is now throwing their hat into the broadcasting ring.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
And it's very important to note, this is not Steam sending a signal to Twitch or Ustream.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
This is Steam broadcasting within Steam.

49:54.000 --> 49:59.000
There's also quite a few limitations right now, such as you can't use a webcam with this,

49:59.000 --> 50:04.000
or any type of custom layers, or things that people like to do on Twitch.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
It's just the gameplay and your voice.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
So it's even kind of behind where the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are at with the streaming.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Well, they do have a chat window, I think, as well.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
They do have a chat window. They do have that.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
But it's all still early. I mean, again, it is in beta.

50:19.000 --> 50:24.000
But it is very interesting to see Steam throwing their hat into the ring.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
I think a lot of us have been saying for some time it would be nice to see Twitch get a little bit of competition,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
because competition is going to make things better.

50:31.000 --> 50:37.000
And Hitbox isn't really taking off, and Ustream is really not good for game streaming.

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
If Steam wants to come up with another U2, I'd be down with that.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
Oh, yeah, that would be awesome.

50:44.000 --> 50:55.000
See, I've been noticing that the various streaming services out there are really, I'd say, finding different niches to cater to.

50:55.000 --> 51:05.000
Like Ustream and Livestream both seem to be a combination of artists doing stuff and political activism.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
Yeah, Ustream seems to be also more for concerts and entertainment type events.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
I mean, I do realize the PlayStation 4 streams to Ustream.

51:12.000 --> 51:18.000
But if you look, like, filter Ustream and look at what people are broadcasting on Ustream,

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
and it's almost all playroom streams, because they can't go to Twitch.

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
And what do people do on their playroom streams? Talk shows and showing titties.

51:28.000 --> 51:33.000
Now, Twitch actually did respond to this whole thing, so I wanted to mention this real quick.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
The VP of Marketing, Matthew DiPietro, I hope I said that right, said,

51:37.000 --> 51:42.000
We are huge fans of Steam and work with Valve regularly on various events and product integrations.

51:42.000 --> 51:48.000
While Steam's broadcasting solution and the Twitch platform are very different things with vastly different feature sets,

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
it's really validating to see a company like Valve embrace streaming in this way.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
Live video is the future of social connectivity for gamers, and this is another proof point.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
We wish them the best of luck.

51:59.000 --> 52:06.000
So that was a statement that was like, well, we don't want Valve to not let people stream on Twitch anymore,

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
although that really can't happen, I mean, you can't filter a game out of Twitch very easily,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
so I don't think that would really happen.

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
But they are trying to say, like, this is very different from what we've got going on at Twitch.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
These are two very different things.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
And to be fair, he's right, they are very different things.

52:24.000 --> 52:31.000
You know, you can't get Steam broadcasting right now on your iPhone or on the PlayStation 4.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
You can't do that yet.

52:33.000 --> 52:41.000
Now, would this be a very logical thing to build into the iOS and Android app that Steam already has for the future?

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Absolutely.

52:42.000 --> 52:45.000
Ooh, they could do that on iOS and watch me play Bejeweled all day.

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
Would this be an easy thing for them to integrate into the Steam box in the future?

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Absolutely.

52:52.000 --> 52:59.000
So, again, very early beta, I think there is a lot, lot more to come from this.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
We shall see.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Let's move on with some more news.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
DarkSakura.

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
Well, to jump into a little bit of piracy talk, argh.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
Argh.

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
Well, there was an app that was on the Google Play Store for Pirate Bay.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
And Google's like, nope, took it down.

53:17.000 --> 53:26.000
It was basically, it took down not just the Pirate Bay, but it took down Pirate Bay Proxy, Pirate Bay Premium, Pirate Bay Mirror, and Pirate App.

53:26.000 --> 53:38.000
And basically, they just are like, we are not going to have anything related to torrenting at all involved in our service.

53:38.000 --> 53:53.000
And the official reason for removal on the thing says violation of intellectual property and impersonation or deceptive behavior provisions of the content policy, please refer to the IP infringement and impersonation policy, help article for more information.

53:53.000 --> 54:05.000
So, basically, the Pirate Bay Proxy developer who goes by Gavin said he was disappointed because they didn't do anything to other browsers.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
Well, they weren't, let me start over.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
They weren't doing this to other places.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
He said that the app was no different than Firefox or Chrome.

54:15.000 --> 54:21.000
But in this case, because it was specifically for Pirate Bay is why they took it down.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
It's not like the Google Store doesn't have a piracy problem all their own, but I digress.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Yeah.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
It's, I mean, what could these apps have really done?

54:31.000 --> 54:38.000
Is it more of like a image thing where Google just doesn't want to be affiliated with it because of the image?

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Well, some of them, like, it depends.

54:40.000 --> 54:49.000
Like, some of them I know that you can download, like, torrents for actual, you know, APKs and stuff like that so you can download the actual apps from it.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
I guess I'm just naive because I didn't think you could do all that crap on your phone.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Yeah, you can do BitTorrent on your phone.

54:54.000 --> 55:01.000
They haven't blocked the app for people who've already gotten it because, I mean, over 900,000 folks have used it.

55:01.000 --> 55:08.000
Wouldn't a lot of folks, though, that might be into using a site like the Pirate Bay, wouldn't a lot of them kind of know how to sideload apps, though?

55:08.000 --> 55:13.000
They would. It's more of a convenience thing. It's like, oh, I want to download Angry Birds now.

55:13.000 --> 55:23.000
I mean, I don't know why you would do BitTorrent. I mean, you can just download something like that, you know, other ways that's maybe a little bit more direct, but I don't know.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Yeah. It's just there.

55:25.000 --> 55:34.000
But, I mean, at the end of the day, it does no company good to say, oh, we're going to embrace you, people that love piracy.

55:34.000 --> 55:40.000
So, that's why they had to distance themselves from it. I think at the end of the day it's an image thing more than anything.

55:40.000 --> 55:46.000
So, that's that. But I would like to see how Google Play is going to tackle some of their other piracy problems.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
But anyway, let's move on. Loki.

55:50.000 --> 56:09.000
All right. So, apparently, even though it's been out for over a year now, Target in Australia has, at least now, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not exactly sure when Grand Theft Auto 5 released in Australia, but I would assume it's around the time that it came out in North America.

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
But I'm making an assumption there. So, if that's the case, then, yes, it's been out for about a year or over a year.

56:15.000 --> 56:30.000
So, now it's being taken off the shelves of Target because, you know, basically saying we've been speaking to many customers over the recent days about the game and there is a significant level of concern about the game's content.

56:30.000 --> 56:37.000
We feel the decision to stop selling Grand Theft Auto 5 is in line with the majority of our customers.

56:37.000 --> 56:44.000
Basically, they're saying that there's feedback from customers about the game's depictions of violence against women.

56:45.000 --> 56:56.000
Which I don't get that because I've played through the game 100% and there's not really exact instances where you're targeting women in the game.

56:56.000 --> 57:03.000
Aside from, oh, you can run around and beat up anybody and there just happens to be women walking around as well as men.

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
Which I think that's equal opportunity defenders if you ask me. I mean, but whatever.

57:09.000 --> 57:19.000
And also, Grand Theft Auto is Grand Theft Auto. You don't go into that experience thinking, like, oh, it's gonna be, you know, happy Hello Kitty, Friends Forever type of stuff.

57:19.000 --> 57:28.000
Yeah, I don't understand. So, you think it's okay that, okay, so you think it would be okay to, like, say, have it where you can't hurt women but you can kill men or something? You think that's fair?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
No.

57:29.000 --> 57:37.000
That's exactly what I'm saying. You can maim anybody in the game, including wildlife.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Silence for all.

57:38.000 --> 57:52.000
You know, you can beat up a deer if you want. I mean, so, I don't know, I just think it's kind of ridiculous at this point why that now, like a year after it's been selling, that, oh, it's bad.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
Well, speaking of piracy, this just encourages it.

57:55.000 --> 58:06.000
And on top of Target, Kmart has joined Target in taking up Grand Theft Auto 5 off their shelves. To which I say, there's still Kmarts?

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Yeah, it was that one near my old house.

58:08.000 --> 58:18.000
Are they, like, time capsules in Australia like they are? Do we have anybody else? The time in Australia is gonna be awful right now for this new show, but I'm curious in general if anybody's listening over there on the podcast.

58:18.000 --> 58:30.000
Is, are there Kmarts in a time capsule like the ones over here? Because I would say, did Kmart even have Grand Theft Auto 5 in the first place? Like, aren't they still selling, like, you know, Sega Genesis at the Kmarts in Australia?

58:30.000 --> 58:43.000
They've Grand Theft Auto, like, one, three, San Andreas. They've taken San Andreas off the shelves because they think it's the same game. I don't know, I think it's a little ridiculous.

58:44.000 --> 59:00.000
Yeah, there's violent, there's, you can do violence against women, but there's not, like, a mission that says, oh, go kill these women. It's, like, there's a mission where you're torturing somebody who's a man, but, I mean, no one seems to be having to, you know, taking offense to that, but, oh, but, you know.

59:01.000 --> 59:18.000
I'm gonna say one thing. True equality, which should be the actual goal of feminism here, means it goes both ways. You can't have, oh, well, we don't like that just because of how women are treated and that when every character is treated the same way.

59:18.000 --> 59:27.000
It'd be one thing if it was a disproportionate number of actual missions in game that were considered belligerent toward women.

59:27.000 --> 59:43.000
Well, and I kind of think, I don't know, I get the feeling we're focusing too much on the women versus men aspect in this conversation because I think Australia as the territory has a history of kind of being oversensitive with a lot of video games.

59:43.000 --> 59:54.000
I mean, they tend to ban a lot of stuff. They ban Mortal Kombat over there. They've banned, I know they've banned other games as well because it seems like every few months on this show we're talking about such and such game isn't available in Australia.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
I don't know. I think they banned that a long time ago before they had that R18 rating or whatever that they have now.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I heard that wasn't really stopping games from not happening over there, though.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I don't know. I think it's ridiculous.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:19.000
This tells me that there's a very, like, you know how we have people in the US, ultra sensitive, conservative people that want to govern. And I'm not saying if you're conservative, you're bad. Listen, hear me out here.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:27.000
It's a certain set of conservatives that want to police morality. We have that here, right? I think Australia probably has a lot of that, too.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And since maybe they've failed because of what you're talking about, the rating system, this is their new approach.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Contact retailers and get the games pulled off the shelves and use these clips of beating up on women as an example. That's what it is.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:58.000
My friend that lives in Adelaide was telling me that there actually is a really crazy conservative environment right now, especially, I mean, if you look at the I don't know if you paid much attention to the overall political environment in Australia right now, but their PM's a dick.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Yeah.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And there are a lot of people who are just sort of taking it as a license to be extra conservative because that's the way that the government is going.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:21.000
There are certain areas out there that will really try to to crack down on just anything that isn't fitting the conservative norm.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And so I think that's also another contributing factor to why this is going on.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Yeah. And then, like, you know, to be fair, it is, you know, this retailer's choice to do that. And also to be fair, if you live in Australia, I'm sure they've got a God.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:44.000
I don't even consider Kmart a decision, a choice anymore for buying video games, but like Target, I guess could be.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But there's plenty of other choices out there if you want to buy that game at retail and how you can buy digitally as well.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So I wouldn't say that these two retailers taking off shelves is necessarily dooming.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But I mean, remember, like Wal-Mart over, you know, in the United States, you know, taking music, you know, they've taken different albums off the shelves because of, you know, lyrics and stuff like that.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000
So I could see that they want to position themselves in a certain way to their customers and fine, then just don't do business with them if you don't like it.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And I think that's fair since, you know, it's not like that the whole country is banning the game. So you've got options.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:38.000
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about one event at the PlayStation Expo that many are saying is the troll event of the year.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000
The biggest troll that's happened all year. So, and I'm sure a lot of you guys have seen this, but let me set the stage here.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So Square Enix gets on the stage at PlayStation Expo and says, well, we're celebrating, you know, 20 years, and I'm summarizing here, we're celebrating 20 years of the PlayStation.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And you know, it's been many, many years since this game came out and the Final Fantasy 7 logo comes out on stage or comes up on the stage, right?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And he says, so it's time that we bring Final Fantasy 7 to the PlayStation 4. And I don't know about you guys, but I did the gay gasp.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:23.000
When he said Final Fantasy 7 on PlayStation 4, I did, I did, I did that because I was like, oh, it's happening. Like, this is, this is like the really happening, right?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That, that infamous Final Fantasy 7 remake that we've been, you know, saying Square needs. And I realized there's Final Fantasy 7 haters out there that are like, move the fuck on with it.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But you have, you can't, you need to shut up because we don't care. You can't ignore, there's a large amount of people who want to see Final Fantasy 7 get remade, just like four got remade and three got remade.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Or even just a style of Advent Children because Advent Children is fucking amazing.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Right? So when they said Final Fantasy 7 was coming on PlayStation 4, and then the crowd goes wild, right? They're like, whoa.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
And I'm sitting there at home going, you know, like, oh my gosh, this is really happening. Heavy breathing.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I know, right? Yes. Heavy breathing, cat picture, right? You know, so, um, and then they show the, the miasma in like the, the high definition, the live stream.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:25.000
And I'm sitting there like, they're going to show, you know, everything in HD, right? And then they show the Final Fantasy 7 in a little tiny window and I'm like, okay, they're just showing the original game, right?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:40.000
And then they're going to show what it looks like now. Nope, it's still the original Final Fantasy 7 because it's just the original Final Fantasy 7 as it was ported to the PC with the slightly up-res textures and the slight differences.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's right. It's a PC. Okay. So Final Fantasy 7 ported to PC, ported to PlayStation 4. That's what was announced.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
And the entire audience.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
F you! You son of a bitch!

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Now, now, now that's not the biggest troll ever. I mean, after all, Mega Man being in Marvel versus, was it Marvel versus Capcom? No, uh, Street Fighter X Tekken. That was the biggest troll of them all. I'm sorry. Yeah.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Or the fact that there was even going to be a Tekken X Street Fighter was a pretty big troll.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Yeah, that's hilarious.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Remember, that's... It still could happen. That was the tweet I wrote, by the way, when they announced Street Fighter 5 exclusive for PlayStation 4. I said, don't worry Xbox and Wii U, you can have Tekken X Street Fighter.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But yeah, it's just... I won't buy it. I already have it on PC. Not playing it on PC because, you know, it's in my Steam library. But I just don't see a reason to buy a shitty port of a game. I'm sorry. No, I won't buy it.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I'm sure it'll look alright on PlayStation 4. It'll look alright! It looks alright on PC, but no, I'm not buying it. You can buy Final Fantasy 7... Well, I guess you can't buy it for PlayStation 4, because the...

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:19.000
It better be fucking dirt cheap, then it better be like 8 bucks on there, not like, $29.99. It'll carry the Square Enix tax. It'll be $19.99. Fuck that. Ain't buying it.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Do they think that we don't have access to the internet and we just don't realize that, you know, it's just a port of the PC title?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Well, let's give Square Enix a call. Oh! I'm hearing yes. They just replied yes. That's what we believe. Alright. DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Well, back to a little bit of politics. There is a Senator, Ron Wyden, who's a Democrat from Oregon, who has put in a bill to ban the use of backdoors to circumvent encryption.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:02.000
As in, not just computer encryption, but encryption on phones, other devices, any type of digital data. It's called the Secure Data Act.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:10.000
It'll basically prevent the government from telling manufacturers that they have to provide a way to decrypt personal data for investigations.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Meaning that it's not just to be protection from other people, but protection from the government, from snooping, as it were.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:36.000
But the thing is, that would also, of course, apply to, I believe, justice cases. But at the same time, we already started having this go on when Apple said that the iPhone 6s, they were not going to allow any external access for decryption.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I think it's actually a really positive step in the case of user advocacy. But, I mean, we're probably going to see this expand to, you know, maybe people's VITAs or DSs, or, you know, for people who crack their own devices, their encryption is going to be protected.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Very interesting. Do you think this has a chance of actually passing?

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:17.000
I think there's going to be some pretty hardcore lobbying against it. I think anything has a chance, as long as people think with their morality instead of their wallet.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Well, I mean, I know we've heard a lot about, like, the government is asking Facebook for all these records and Yahoo, and didn't somebody told them no? Was it Apple that told them no? Somebody said that they came out and told the government no.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I know Apple did for the iPhone 6 encryption.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:55.000
So, but, very interesting. We'll see what comes of this, because I don't think anybody likes the idea of the government being able to snoop on them, but I also get the double-edged sword of, well, but then there's those, you know, one bad person out of 10,000 that we need to be able to hear those conversations.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:01.000
So, I don't know. It'll be very interesting to see what develops from this. It'll be a very controversial issue, I'm sure.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of video games coming out near you soon. Loki, if anything, this might be a very empty week.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Yeah, it would be nice if, you know, we had websites that actually had release dates now, but some certain websites decided to remove that information.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
There's nothing else left.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Yeah.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I know of one thing in the US this week. I know of one thing in the US.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Well, there's not really any retail releases, I don't think. I'm getting there, but, yeah, I want to say that last week was pretty much the last set of releases that we had for this week as far as retail goes.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I want to say, I think Game of Thrones is this week, but I don't think that was retail. Maybe that was last week. That was last week.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
I think Game of Thrones is already out, but maybe that was last week.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah, that was last week.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris, I know.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Oh, that's right, they're doing a retail release of that. I forgot. Yeah, so they have that coming out. That's pretty much it. I don't think there's anything else. Like I said, I'm trying to get there, but I don't see anything. In fact, actually, here we go.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah, I don't see anything coming out.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Right, yeah, it's going to be a slow week.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Unless you want some Assassin's Creed hoodies, in which case, then, yes, there's lots of those.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:24.000
It's more of a digital distribution week, then, with Lara Croft, and I think Suikoden 2 gets its big hyped release this week. I know a lot of people were very happy to hear.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Yeah, it was Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris, and apparently they are doing Lara Croft and the Guardian of Lights getting a disc release as well.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Oh, I'm sorry, no, that's not good.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
It would make a lot of sense if the two of them were kind of bundled or something like that.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000
This is all digital. Is Tetris Ultimate coming out this week, it looks like? Yeah, Tetris Ultimate is coming out digitally.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Neat.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I don't see what else here. This is all digital shit.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Yeah, okay, so here we go. So Lara Croft and Temple of Osiris coming out, retail, and then, if digital, I guess, Destiny's expansion, the Dark Below is coming out now.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:20.000
What else was there? That Tetris game on, looks like, PlayStation 4, and that's it. That's it.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Alright, let's travel to Japan. Believe it or not, they have a lot of stuff still coming out this week, including, I love this, this is a limited edition PlayStation 4.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:37.000
People losing their minds here over that 20th anniversary PlayStation 4, but over in Japan, they're getting a Dragon Quest Metal Slime PlayStation 4.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:45.000
And that's coming out this week, and that looks really cool. It's like a little actual metal slime on the box, and, oh gosh, that looks really cute. I want one of those.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Unfortunately, it's going to cost me $800 if I want to import it, so maybe not.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
You don't want that bad.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Yeah, I don't want it that bad, exactly.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:59.000
But there are some games as well. Grand Theft Auto 5 gets its release in Japan this week. JoySound TV Plus also gets its Japanese release.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Need for Speed Rivals Complete Edition, which I'm assuming that means it includes all the DLC, is this week.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou with Power Up Kit comes out in a regular and a treasure box this week.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000
So, that is out on the PlayStation 4.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Going over to the Xbox One. The Xbox One has Grand Theft Auto 5 this week. That is really its only release.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Seeing if there's still things on the PlayStation 3 this week. There are.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Shining Resonance from Sega is out this week on the PlayStation 3, as is Assassin's Creed Rogue.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Nobunaga no Yabu Suzou. Hajime no Ippo the Fighting.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Ryu Ga Gotoku 1 and 2 HD Edition gets a price reduction, as does Ryu Ga Gotoku 5 gets a price reduction as well.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
So, some games getting discounts there on the PlayStation 3.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Looking at the Wii U this week? No, but you have Sonic Tune on December 18th.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:58.000
And on the PlayStation Vita this week, we have Sengoku Hime 5.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Earth Defense Forces 2 Portable V2 comes out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Yeah. Not gonna import it?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:15.000
No, I don't have a Vita anymore. So, no. Although, the new Earth Defense Force game may be.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Grisaia no Rakuen la Iden de la Grisaia comes out this week.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And the Portable V2? I think that's just a remake of the last one that they put out.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Because they did have a portable, was it 20? Well, it was over here.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Yeah, it was a portable 2017 V2, I think. I don't remember what it was called.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Now, next week in Japan, big, big release on December 13th.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Yokai Watch 2 Senuchi comes out next week.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
And this series, pretty big deal over in Japan.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I can't wait till we get it.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Yeah, so that's a really big release on the 3DS.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.000
So, even though things are slowing down here, this is a big week in Japan for releases.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Moving on to Dark Sakura and the UK releases.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:08.000
On the 9th, we have Star Wars The Old Republic Shadows of Revan on PC.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
On the 11th, we've got BlazBlue Continuum Shift Extend on PC.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Rune Factory 4 on 3DS.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And then on PC and Mac, we have The Talos Principle.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
On the 14th, it's Halo Spartan Strike on Windows Phone and PC.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
That's it.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
But first, Loki.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:41.000
So, thanks to the PlayStation Experience in celebrating 20 years of the PlayStation.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:50.000
EA has decided to be generous and give away free games for the length of the PlayStation Experience.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
So, ending tonight, December 7th at midnight.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
They're going to be giving away, or up to that.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
They're going to be giving away on PlayStation 4 Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Mirror's Edge on PlayStation 3 and Need for Speed Most Wanted on the Vita.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And those are going to be free on the PlayStation Store during that time.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
So, if you haven't done it yet, go ahead and download those.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Or, at the very least, go on the Sony Store online and just mark them all to download.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
That way you have them for the future.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I'm not sure if you need PlayStation Plus to get them.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I know I had that, so I don't know.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Which Need for Speed Most Wanted is it?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
It's the one that was on the Vita.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
I don't know. It must have been the new one.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Yeah, I think it's the new one.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
It's the new one, but it's only on the Vita.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
It's like the old school PS2 version.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Yeah, I know.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
That guy's awesome.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
No, that guy's confusing.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Yeah, it's the new Most Wanted.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
And sadly, a lot of the podcast listeners, it's going to be too late by the time you hear this.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
But hopefully, I mean, hopefully you guys are tapped in enough to the game blogs and Twitter and so forth that you already heard about this and got your games flagged for download.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
What do you guys think, though?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
It's a very interesting, I mean, EA has no real need to do this.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
The interesting thing, though, I will throw this out there.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I mean, Mirror's Edge, I really feel like a lot of people already own that game one way or another.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
And EA does have a sequel they want to create awareness for.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Plants vs. Zombies.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Has a lot of microtransactions.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Microtransactions and to be honest, I was not interested in buying that game ever.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
So it looked OK, but it was like it never was.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Oh, when I get a PlayStation 4, I'm totally going to buy this game.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
No, that never happened.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Again, I don't want to review something based on only like 30 minutes, but it's not exactly the type of game that's, you know, get me like super excited.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It's not as awesome as it's supposed to be, like team portraits, too, with plants and zombies.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Yeah, sort of, sort of.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
So, but yeah, they can still make the money from microtransactions and so forth.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
So not that I'm trying to belittle what's going on here, because, you know, free games are a good thing.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:59.000
But I don't think the risk factor or how much EA is going to lose in this is necessarily a huge, huge deal.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Because I think what they lose in Garden Warfare sales they'll make up for is people...

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I think Mirror's Edge is like 10 bucks now on the PlayStation Network, so.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And Most Wanted, well, but it's probably...

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Yeah, I don't think a lot of people are seeking out that game anymore, you know, so there you go.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
As far as Mirror's Edge goes, though, is by somehow you have still missed this game time and time again,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
do go get it now that it's free.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I mean, at least check that one out if nothing else.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
If you got a PlayStation 3, which a lot of you do, it's just...

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Just market download. I mean, what's it going to hurt you?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Exactly.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:35.000
ActDef says, I got the free game, but no space in my Vita memory card.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Well, at least if you have it flagged on your account, you can always download it when you get a bigger memory card.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Because that's the interesting thing, is that the price of the system keeps dropping, but the memory cards are still expensive.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Anyway.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
That's because they still use their stupid proprietary memory cards.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Yeah, right.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Alright, well, one more story for you guys before we get to the end of this segment.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And that is a Wii U game that EA was working on.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000
And speaking of EA, they're giving away these free games, but the Wii U is getting nothing.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Because here's the deal, EA was working on SimCity for the Wii U.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.000
That's right, EA's recent SimCity release was at one point being planned for the Wii U, but...

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Which joke should I make? I don't know.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
It ended up being cancelled.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Was it because it didn't support online very well?

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Well, we don't know why the game was cancelled, ultimately.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
Or because the game was just not good?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
It could be because the Wii U's not tapped in online.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Or because they have a hate boner for the Wii U?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I don't know. Maybe the Wii U's didn't sell enough?

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
SimCity didn't have enough inertia to really justify the Wii U release?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
I don't know. We'll never know.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.000
They haven't said why it was cancelled, just that some things leaked out about that it was something that was being planned at one point.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
SimCity on the Wii U.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Which, I don't know if you guys ever played SimCity 2000 on PlayStation 1.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:01.000
But I think the only time SimCity really worked well was the original on the Super Nintendo.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
And that's because Nintendo kind of put their own little magic on it.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.000
You know, they did their own little thing to it to make it a little more controller friendly.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.000
But those games really require a mouse and keyboard to really play.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
However, the touchpad I think could have really made up for a lot of that.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
So it's kind of too bad we'll never get to see how it could have executed on the Wii U.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Because I bet it could have been pretty good.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So, we'll never know.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
But there you go. SimCity was a thing that was being working on for Wii U.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And was ultimately cancelled.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Well, not cancelled and running strong week after week after week is the classic game of the week.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault, take a walk down memory lane and find a game that she thinks,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Hey, you guys should be checking this out right now.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
The classic game of the week.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Dark Soccer, what is this week's classic game of the week?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
The classic game of the week is a game that came out on the ZX Spectrum in 1984 called Deus Ex Machina.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And I wanted to pick something on the Spectrum since we didn't get the system over here.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:15.000
We've got our UK listeners today, our European listeners.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
This is actually a really weird game.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Basically, it does have an amazing voice cast though.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.000
It has Ian Drury, it has Jon Pertwee in it, as in we knew him as the Third Doctor.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Quite a few people and including the composer Mel Croucher.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
The music in this game is really good too.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:42.000
It's basically a game that you cover the life of a defect that grows inside of a machine.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000
From conception through growth, evolution and death.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And it's sort of based off the seven ages of man from As You Like It.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The game is...

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It was really, I think...

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Well, it got lots of great reviews, but it wasn't necessarily anything that people knew what to make of right when it came out.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.000
It was really odd and then people didn't know how to sell it either.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
So it was, at the time, only mail order direct to the public.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Pirated a whole lot and the game's now got this massive cult status.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Visually today, it's really not a lot to look at.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000
In 1984, this is pretty crazy go nuts.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
And you start off like the level that we're looking at.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Now you follow its DNA formation.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Then you follow watching the embryo grow.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Then you follow it through childhood and everything.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And it's quite a bit out there.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Even today, it's quite a bit out there.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:50.000
But I think that if this game were to be remade today, I mean, it'd probably be nothing to run it.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
But it would still be one of those...

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
It reminds me of a lot of indie games that you see today.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
So that's why I think it's really...

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It's a big influential on, I think, a lot of our indie gamers.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:09.000
There was a reimagining of the game in 2010 that went under Deus Ex Machina 2.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
And the same director, everything.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
And it had Christopher Lee as the programmer.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
The main character in there.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
But I don't know if they ever actually finished it.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I didn't see anything about it if it was actually finished.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.000
But the game was listed as one of the 1,001 video games you must play before you die.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
And so there you go.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
It's really trippy and it seems like...

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
So the whole voice acting thing was like...

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
It wasn't because these old computers couldn't play CD quality.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
It was off cassette.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
So you would play this cassette while you play the game.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
That's so weird.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
But it's that way you get, though, the whole experience together.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
So that means everything that you're actually doing in the game has to be timed.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000
And if I'm right, actually, I think that the game played off the cassette.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I would want to say.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Interesting.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Yeah.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
What a neat little concept.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Yeah.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:09.000
So, I mean, for its time, definitely innovating.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Yeah.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
So that's the game I picked.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
All right.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
There it is.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Your classic game of the week from the Spectrum.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Deus Ex Machina.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Very obscure choice.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I like that one.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
All right.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Well, that is going to do it for part A of the show.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Oh, wait.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
And it's not related to the Deus Ex series.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
This is completely different.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Yeah, it has nothing to do with the newer series.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Which I do recall that the reason why they couldn't call Deus Ex anything more than that

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
was because of copyright on this game.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Well, guys, we have to, before we actually get to our break here,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
we actually have some breaking news.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
This is an envy.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
All right.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
So let's get to.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
No, it's not.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
It's O-L-R.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
We have some breaking news.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
This is not happy breaking news, actually.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
This is kind of crappy breaking news and very unfortunate.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
But Ralph Baer, the father of video games known as,

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
he has passed away at the age of 92.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
That's a good run.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah, it's a great run.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So, you know, but if you don't know the name,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
he actually was called the Thomas Edison of the home TV game

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
in Popular Electronics magazine in 1980.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And that's because he created the Odyssey,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000
which was really the first home video game system,

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
the patent being filed in 1970 and released by Magnavox in 1972.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
You can thank Ralph Baer for home video game consoles.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I just don't like that they insult you.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Plus, Nolan Bushnell totally stole the idea for Pong from him.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So there it is.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
It's also the first home light gun game.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
An add-on for the Odyssey called Shooting Gallery was Ralph Baer's as well.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
His contributions were recognized by receiving the National Medal of Technology

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
by then President George W. in 2000.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And then he was named President of the National Medal of Technology

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
by then President George W. in 2006.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Also created Simon.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Did he really?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Yep.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
I did not realize that.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Yeah, the story behind that is really cool.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Atari made a game called Touch Me and Baer saw it and then made Simon.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
And it was the biggest seller of 1978.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
So to make up for getting Pong ripped off from him,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
he quickly ripped Touch Me off from Atari.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000
There you go.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Well, there you go.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000
A tip of the hat and pouring out the 40 to Mr. Ralph Baer.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Rest in peace.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Okay, we're going to use this opportunity to take a break.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
But we will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
The Fugu Question of the Week, some rapid-fire news,

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
your emails, of which there are a lot tonight,

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Twitters and live calls.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
We will still take live calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
right after this.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000
episode number 578 in progress,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
live at a special time at vognetwork.com.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
We're taping a little early today because Dark Sakura

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
and I have some plans in the Bay Area this evening.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So it's this recurring thing that's been going on for years and years.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
And every year we miss it because we always do an OLR.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:23.000
So we said, you know what, this year, let's do two birds with one stone.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
We'll be able to make this gathering and we'll do an earlier OLR.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Because once every few months, probably actually it's more like every six months,

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
we like to do an earlier show just so people in different time zones

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
are able to participate as well because it is the show, of course,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
where every gamer has a voice.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I really wish we could do a different time for everybody every week,

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
but unfortunately we have our own personal lives to juggle.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I'm sure you can understand.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
But that's why we have the podcast, which you can check out at iTunes,

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Stitcher Radio, TuneIn.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
There's millions of places to check out podcasts.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
You can also just listen to it directly at either orangeontradio.com

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
or vognetwork.com. Take a pick.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Lots of great ways to catch up with the podcast every week.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.000
at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, stop.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
All right, let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Lots of other news going on this week. Loki.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
All right. So this is kind of cool.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Some of the announcements that they're making during the PlayStation experience

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.000
included some games that are getting ported over to different platforms,

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
including Broken Age and Day of the Tentacle,

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
the special edition coming to PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
So no idea what's special about the special edition for Day of the Tentacle,

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
but I love Day of the Tentacle, so I'll probably have to buy it.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And then they're also saying that on top of that,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Gang Beasts, I guess, is coming to PlayStation 4 as well,

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000
which actually is a pretty fun-looking game.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:00.000
And, you know, I guess, what else here?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
No, that's it so far.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
So, yeah, that was during their keynote that they announced those.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000
No timeframe.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I'm super excited for the Day of the Tentacle.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I thought of you when they announced that, actually.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
I'm down, so that should be awesome.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000
And then, actually, the game I was trying to play during break,

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:22.000
but my expat or thing is not working correctly.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000
It's a game called I Am Bread, and it just released on Steam Early Access.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.000
It's from Bossa Studios, who did Surgeon Simulator,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and if you want a game that just is really weird and silly,

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
then this is probably going to be up your alley.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I think it's 15% off right now.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I think it's like $8.99 instead of $9.99 or something.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And, basically, the premise of the game is you're a piece of bread,

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:53.000
and you control the bread by holding down different corners of the bread.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Kind of like QWOP.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Yeah, it's sort of like QWOP.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It's very difficult, I guess.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:04.000
You get used to it, but it's difficult to control, I guess, on purpose.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
But, yeah, each corner is a different key,

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
and then you have to kind of hold those corners down

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.000
and provide momentum using the analog stick or mouse or keyboard,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
and you have to move across the room to get toasted,

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and you're graded on a few different things,

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000
including edibility and deliciousness,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
and you also break things while you happen to be doing that.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So the way they put it is like a piece of bread apparently trying to toast itself,

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
and it's a lot of fun.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
So I took it as early access.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
There are issues with the game, though.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I did run into the problem, as I mentioned before,

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
where my gamepad doesn't work with it because it's Windows 8.1 right now,

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
so that doesn't work too well.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
That's why I was trying to get the keypadder thing to work

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
so I could assign keys to it.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
But I tried it with keyboard, and it works okay,

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
although then I got on the floor,

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
and my edibility started dropping really fast.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I was like, ah, I need to get to the counter,

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
except I'm very awkward with that game,

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
and so I started moving in the opposite direction.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
But check it out. It's pretty cool.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And then if you're a fan of Yakuza,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
and definitely there's a lot of rabid fans out there of Yakuza,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Yakuza 5 is going to be coming to North America on PlayStation 3.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Apparently they're saying that Yakuza 4 and Yakuza Dead Souls

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:36.000
will also be now on PlayStation Network starting this week as well.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
But that's a big deal for people wanting the Yakuza series

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
to come over to North America.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So, pretty awesome that that's going to happen.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I bet Deakman, who is an integral part of our orangeonitrader.com website,

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I could hear him fangirl screaming when they announced the Yakuza 5.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Absolutely.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
There was a lot of fangirl scream moments out of that

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
between either Day of the Tentacle or Suikoden was another big one.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
You know, Suikoden 2 is finally happening.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
There's a lot of great, great moments.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Alright, moving on.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.000
This probably isn't as scream-worthy, but it still is kind of neat.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:24.000
You can get some, I guess, faceplates is what they would be for the PlayStation 4.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You can get these for $25 a pop.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000
The Order 1886 or LittleBigPlanet faceplates.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
They're available on the Sony store right now.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And you can actually pop them on to your existing PlayStation 4.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So it's not going to change the way the entire thing looks,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.000
but kind of like the front half, you can change how that looks.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Yeah, it looks like the part that's over the disk drive kind of on top.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
You know what's funny is I actually looked at my PlayStation 4 the other day

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
and I'm like, wow, it's upside down.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000
It's on its side, but it's the wrong way.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
The PlayStation logo is upside down.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I never realized that that thing could pop off so easy.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
But apparently it's designed to do that,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
so you can get a new faceplate and just pop that right there.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Or is that, I haven't replaced the hard drive.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Is that where the hard drive is maybe?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Oh, maybe. That could be it.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
So PlayStation 4 faceplates are a thing.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
That'll be happening.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
This is neat.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Deep Silver is going to be auctioning off the real life Saints Row Genki Mobile,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
which there's a little picture of it circulating around the internet.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And it's available on eBay.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And it was starting at $7,500 even though this vehicle has 80,000 miles on it.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I don't know who the hell would drive this out in public.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I'm not entirely sure it's street legal either.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Yeah, so this might just be something you aim at your neighbor's house.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I don't know what the practical purposes would be.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
The cool thing though is that cannon in the back actually does work.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
It fires t-shirts, right?

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Yes. I would fire tons of t-shirts.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Things like that have been done before.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Well, so here's the thing. It started at $7,500.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
It's up now to $7,700.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
You got like one or two people interested.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Three bids so far actually. Three bids on this so far.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I would like to know what the hell somebody's going to do with this.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000
But if you would like to get in on this, it's going to end Saturday at 9 a.m.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
So you still have a good five days.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:19.000
So podcast listeners, if you have $7,000 or $8,000 sitting around,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
send it to us here at Orange Tons Radio.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.000
We will make better use of it than buying a t-shirt cannon.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
It worked better when Gorillaz did it.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.000
If you're a real big Saints Row fan that you're ruling to drop $8,000,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:37.000
if you were ruling to drop $8,000 on the GameCube mobile,

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000
just save that and you could drop a significant less portion of that

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000
on a bunch of the shoes, the clothing, all that shit, the games,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and still have several thousand dollars left over.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Yeah, you could go to Party City on an $800 budget

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
and probably decorate your own pickup truck and all that.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Yeah, I was going to say, you can DIY that.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
In fact, you know, maybe for like $1,000,

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
OLR will come out and decorate your vehicle.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Nope, nope. I won't come out for $1,000.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
All right.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
As long as you can cover the travel as well.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Anyhow, Sony Santa Monica Studio announced some things

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:21.000
that they are preparing at the PlayStation Keynote the other day,

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
including Fat Princess Adventures, which, you know,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
if you're into Diablo, Gauntlet, that type of stuff,

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Fat Princess Adventures looks very similar to that sort of thing.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Whatom was a game that they showed that really made no sense at all.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:37.000
But when you consider that it's coming from Keita Takahashi,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
that's right, the creator of Katamari and Noby Noby Boy,

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
then it makes sense why it did make sense.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Which, by the way, was it just me or was he drunk when he was on stage?

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Because there's this gif around.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I noticed this too when it was happening live.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
He's like literally stumbling around in a circle while he's on stage

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
trying to watch what's going on.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
It's very... I hope he's all right.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
You know what?

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
I hope he was just really nervous.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Can you imagine a Katamari game, though,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
with the amount of particles that the PlayStation 4 can handle?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I know, right?

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
He's probably not interested in revisiting it, but...

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I don't care if he's interested.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Goddamn it, make me another one.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And again, that series really has never been as good as the original.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Anyway...

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Or make another strange game like Noby Noby Boy,

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.000
where you eat your own butt.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:32.000
I actually was still playing Noby Noby Boy on my phone for, like, years.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Now, did you notice, though, that Wadam is kind of one of those names

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
that is the same if you flip it upside down?

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
So I wonder if that's kind of the gist of the game.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
What's the word? A palindrome?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Yeah, because the M, if you flip it upside down, is a W.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So if you flip that word...

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Oh, yeah.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.000
It's like the same thing.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So kind of a double whammy.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Yeah, maybe there's a meaning in there somewhere.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I don't know. Who knows?

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Anyway, another strange trailer that they showed,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.000
What Remains of Edith Finch.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
There's a bunch of short stories around a cursed family.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
The trailer was very ambient and kind of horror film-ish.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So I like, though, that there's all these kind of, like, original ideas coming out.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
We're not just talking, like, you know, here's, you know,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
part seven of this ongoing series.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I mean, there's room in the world for those games, too.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
There's ongoing series called Final Fantasy.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Yeah, right?

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I mean, there's room in the world for those games, too,

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
but I like that we're seeing a lot of new concepts, as well.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000
So we'll see more about these games at a future date, I'm sure.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Some people, I think, play in this stuff at the Expo.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.000
I wish we had had somebody lined up to call into the show today,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
because the Expo's going on right now.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Somebody could have called in, but...

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
We had some people going, too.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
I only know, like, one listener out there,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
and a friend of mine on Twitter's out there, too,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
but they're probably playing games.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
They don't want to stop for 20 minutes to talk to us.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I understand.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
I don't take it personally.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Very hard.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
DarkSakura.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Well, there's one thing that we like.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:58.000
It's SNK.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Whoo!

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
So they are going to be bringing more games from the EOGO catalog

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
to the PlayStation Network,

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.000
starting off with Metal Slug 3 for PS4, PS3, and PS Vita.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
It's also the upgraded version, like we saw on Steam,

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
with the online multiplayer and leaderboard, whatever.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
And then they are polling fans to see what we want next.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000
So the 15 candidates we've seen...

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.000
Twin Star Sprite...

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Twiggle Star Sprite, sorry.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Neo Turf Master, Sengoku 3,

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Gairo, Mark of the Wolves,

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Samurai Shadow on 5 Special, and Last Blade II.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000
My vote would be for Last Blade II, because that game's fun.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
So, good on that.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
We also have The Legend of Zelda,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Symphony of the Goddesses,

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000
is on the Master Quest Tour in 2015,

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000
meaning that they're going to be going on a worldwide tour to play Zelda music.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.000
And it's done to celebrate the upcoming release of Majora's Mask on the 3DS.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000
They're going to be...

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
It looks like just a handful of locations on this tour.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000
It kind of looks like it is really whirlwind.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Nothing really near us, but we've got a few Canadian ones.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
We have a few...

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
We have also just a few over in Europe,

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:24.000
and we have one in Hawaii, one in Tokyo.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Who did none near us? Because I would have wanted to go.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Couldn't be bothered to roll through San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose,

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
I don't know, Silicon Valley.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I don't see any in California. That's what I was looking over.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So I guess we have to go to Texas.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000
No, thank you.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
No, thank you. Not on purpose.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
I could go visit Travis, give him some shit.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Let's just go to Toronto.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
All right. That'll work.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Oh, the Video Game Realness guys are out in Toronto.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
We could go to Montreal.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
That's right. All right.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:57.000
So anyway, last but not least, we have Shovel Knight News.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Yay, Shovel Knight.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
It sold 300,000 copies.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Yay. Not bad for kind of a quiet little game there, right?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
But Shovel Knight's fun, and it's one of the Kickstarter games,

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:18.000
and it's Kickstarter made four times what they asked for,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:25.000
which ended up being a total of $311,000.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So not bad.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Not bad at all.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Did you see the little bit out of the PlayStation experience where...

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I haven't touched our PlayStation anything in ages.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
No, no, no, no.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
On the announcements that came out the past couple days,

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
well, Shovel Knight's coming to PlayStation was the big thing,

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
and they're doing an extra stage or something because Kratos is a boss in it now.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
So that'll be interesting.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000
Interesting.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Yeah.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
That's a good word for it. Interesting.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Yes. So we'll see how that plays out.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Also interesting, every week, you guys lend your voices to the show

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
in a segment we call the Fugal Question of the Week.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Thanks, Mario.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
We go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
You throw those words together, you get Fugal.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And every week we ask a question of our communities,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.000
and we read our favorite answers here on the show.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000
And tonight our question was all about the Game Awards

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
because we were curious, you know?

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Did you guys watch it? Did you check it out?

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
So our question was, did you watch them?

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
And if you did, what did you think they did well,

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
and what do you think they could do better?

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
And if you didn't watch, what's something they could do to get you to watch?

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Fabrice starts us off over on the Facebooks saying,

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Didn't watch. I wasn't very interested in another top three show that drags along.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It did drag a little bit.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I'm not sure how they could super tighten it up,

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:49.000
but it did drag a little bit, so I don't blame you.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
But you can watch The Highways on YouTube, I guess.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Andy R. said, Didn't watch.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I was driving to the PlayStation Experience during that time.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Good enough excuse, I suppose.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
LowCatFrog responds and says, I don't watch award shows.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Even this one I would not have watched.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Everything I watched is streamed, no TV.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Well, LowCatFrog may not have got the memo.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000
This actually wasn't on TV.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
This was something that was only available on streaming,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.000
so somehow you missed it. I don't know.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Fifth Dream. Okay, now we've got somebody who did watch them

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
because Fifth Dream says I did watch them, and I was actually pretty impressed.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
So many award shows are just embarrassing, but this one wasn't.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:28.000
It had a nice mix of industry people, world premiere footage,

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and musical performances.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
It wasn't without hiccups, but they were pretty minor.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
The industry icon award being presented to Roberta and Ken Williams

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
is a pretty great moment.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Overall, I actually enjoyed the show.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And Red The Haze says, I watched while I played a game on my Vita.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
It was definitely a step in the right direction.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
It did have a lot of awkward moments,

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
but it wasn't as bad as the older Spike VGAs

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.000
that were targeting non-gaming audiences.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:55.000
I think those comments last two really sum it up for me as well

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000
because, you know, I think it was a step in the right direction.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
I think it's a very good way of putting it.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000
But let's go over to our Google Plus page

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:06.000
because we have some comments there as well.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And over on Google Plus, we have

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
At Deft replies and says, I watched later that night,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
and the tribute to Ken and Roberta Williams

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
was probably the best thing about the whole thing,

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
and the music segments were spectacular.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
The whole ceremony has lots of room for improvement,

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
both in presentation and technical stuff,

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
but overall it was enjoyable.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I could probably do with less advertising from publishers

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
and more actual recognition to the industry as it deserves.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Redtertainment says, I didn't watch them,

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
but I find it hard to watch things on the internet while I'm at work.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I've heard general mocking of the game awards,

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.000
but as we all know, gamershateeverything.com.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
If I could change anything, I would change the fact

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
that I couldn't easily watch it on my TV after the fact.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Perhaps being able to download the show on iTunes

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.000
or watch via streaming like Hulu or Netflix.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
And then Alicia L. follows that up over on Google Plus saying,

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
yes, put it on Netflix.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
So some people wanting to have a little more on demand.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.000
I believe it is on YouTube, but I know YouTube...

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
It is on YouTube.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
It is on YouTube, but that...

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I mean, YouTube is and isn't accessible

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
depending on where you're at and what device you're carrying, so...

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
But that's how I watched the hour that I missed at the end there,

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.000
and the ultra important Ken and Roberta Williams tribute,

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
which is really the thing you most need to see.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.000
And to be fair, wouldn't that be hashtag gamershateeverything these days?

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
No, there's actually a website that Bobby registered some time ago

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
called gamershateeverything.com,

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
and you go to it and it says, do gamers hate everything?

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Yes.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
There it is.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
There you go.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
That's it.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Just like the whole...

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
They do that type of website for everything.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
There's, you know...

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Is Half-Life 3 out yet?

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Is Half-Life 3 out yet?

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
You know, is there a Steam sale?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Things like that.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So anyway, let's move on with some more news.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Loki.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Alright.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:58.000
So, you know, definitely there's at least some love from Sony for the Vita,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000
and they're kind of trying to show that with more releases coming to it.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
And so, some big name games are actually scheduled to be coming that way,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
including the Banner Saga, which is pretty awesome,

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Suicoden 1 and 2,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Super Time Force Ultra,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Towerfall Ascension,

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Octodad, The Dadliest Catch,

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Resident Evil Revelations 2,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
and more.

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:36.000
So they're saying also that, I guess, they've already got ports of Geometry Wars Dimensions and Bastion

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
coming to the Vita as well,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
but at least they're going to be supporting with more games.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And Resident Evil Revelations, that's supposed to be coming out spring of 2015.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
So, not bad.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Yo, it was nice to see the Vita getting a little bit of attention.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.000
I wonder how the Vita TV's doing, or that PlayStation TV's doing.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I'm curious as well, because it was very curious.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
There were some things in that Sony event that they didn't talk about.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
I mean, granted, the thing kind of started to go on a little long anyway,

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:15.000
and for me, overall, the last 30 minutes really lost steam compared to the first hour 30 minutes.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
So, they needed to end it.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000
But there were some things they didn't really talk about at all, and that Vita TV is one of them.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Like, they didn't mention it, the whole keynote, and I really thought that was an extra chance.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Maybe it's just not doing that well. I don't know.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
I don't know.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Maybe they'd rather you buy the regular Vita.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:34.000
The other thing that surprised me, PlayStation Now was not talked about at all.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
You know, that thing that's been in beta for a year or whatever,

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
they didn't really give any updates or any announcements that, oh, more games...

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
It's only been like a few months.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
It feels like it's been longer. I think it's only been public a few months.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000
No, maybe.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Because they were giving away the codes at E3, and even before that, it was something that some people had.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Because before it was on the PS4, I think it was on the PS3?

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Yeah, I mean, it's been testing for a while.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:03.000
So, I'm surprised there were no updates on that either.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.000
But I'm happy to see that, you know, for people that invested in the Vita, or will be investing in the Vita TV,

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.000
and maybe that's why it's time to talk about it, they are showing, like, here's how we're going to support it.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Not a lot of exclusives.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
I mean, there was a couple in there, but, you know, all right.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000
At least as an alternative in portable gaming.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Well, for people that don't own a PlayStation or an Xbox, maybe you finally are checking out Final Fantasy XIII on the PC.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Or maybe you checked out Final Fantasy XIII on the PC with the assumption that, oh, it would run better, it would look better.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000
And then we're shocked to find out that, oh, the graphics are locked down.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:51.000
You can play either in full screen 720p, or you can play in a window that is not going to take up the whole size of your desktop.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
And many people were really pissed off with the limited graphic options in the game.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Well, some good news.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Square Enix has posted an announcement on their forums over on Steam saying,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:05.000
the Final Fantasy XIII team has been working hard to improve your experience on Steam.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:17.000
We're happy to announce that custom resolutions, 720p, 1080p, and graphic options will be added into the game from December 11th will be the date of that patch.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Except they've already been hacked into the game by other people, but now they're just doing it officially.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Now it's just official.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:30.000
And this is very interesting, because I can't think of many times in gaming's history where we've talked about now being patched into our game.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Graphic options.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000
The graphics are literally being patched in after the fact.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
You don't hear that a lot these days.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
We're now giving the option to change the resolution.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
What's that?

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
We're now giving the option to change the resolution.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Oh my gosh, I can't believe it didn't handle full screen windowed like Final Fantasy XIV does.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
It's like there's other Square Enix games that'll do it.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
But it's because it's just an emulator or something.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I think it's a fast and easy port is what they're doing, clearly.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
You don't say!

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
A fast and easy port of a Final Fantasy game!

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Like, I don't know, a Final Fantasy game that we might be heading towards the Playstation 4.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
You don't say that they do fast and easy ports of their Final Fantasy games.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
That's shocking to hear.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Dungeonbuster in chat says, Square Enix late to the party with PC standard settings.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Quote, sorry, here are the doors for your car.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
That's kind of what Final Fantasy XIII is missing right now on PC.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:33.000
It's kind of unfortunate.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000
I won't buy XIII II or Lightning Return.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000
They are making literally the least amount of effort possible to do this stuff.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Well, you know what, though? It did finally bite him in the ass.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Because a lot of people complained about this in a lot of negative Steam reviews.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
They were really pressured to fix this shit.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I'm glad they're doing it.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I hope they're pressured to make a remake of Final Fantasy VII that's not a port of the old PC version.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
I can understand that a little more, though, because there's a difference there, Loki.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Because this XIII, we're saying, is admittedly a Playstation 3 emulator that Square's running their own internally.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.000
It may not literally be a Sony Playstation 3 emulator, but it's able to use the same code.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
It's a fast and lazy port, right?

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
That's what they're doing over here.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
But to give you the Final Fantasy VII you want, that's not going to be a fast and lazy port.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
They're going to have to go back and redo all of the textures in the game.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
You know, it's different.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Well, I feel so bad for them then.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000
As they're rolling around in their pools of money.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:38.000
If only we had 3D models of the Final Fantasy characters that were in high resolution.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000
You know, something that might be considered movie quality.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:48.000
If only we had made a movie with Final Fantasy VII characters in several locations that were featured in Final Fantasy VII.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Hmm. That would be very convenient for us to make a game out of.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Or perhaps we use similar models to, I don't know, make some Vita games.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000
Or not Vita games, Playstation Portable games.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000
You know.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Or maybe everybody just moves the fuck on and lets Final Fantasy VII go.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Because it was okay to start with.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
But it wasn't that great.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
We don't listen to Dan for a reason.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
You know it wasn't that great.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
It was that great.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Oh yeah, you loved Eris. I remember that. That was like one of your favorite characters ever, right?

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I'm going to stab that bitch in the face again.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Alright.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
In the face.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
You know, Jaime, I think you need to let it go.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Let it go, let it go.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
That's what I was saying.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
You know, it didn't make the show roll tonight.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:44.000
But they did register, was it, they have the rating or whatever in Europe for the Sing Star or Frozen.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.000
That did make it into the show roll and that was my story.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I was helping Jaime out there with a transition, Loki.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
God dammit.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Read the show roll.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Nah, I don't want to.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Alright, well I don't need to talk about it then. Oh well.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Sing Star or Frozen. There we go.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Don't throw a fit. What else? There's got to be more to it than that.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
It just has a rating out for it.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:10.000
It says it's going to be published by Sony on the PS3.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And that it's going to have all the songs from Frozen in it.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.000
And basically they confirmed that yes, it's going to be out and a complete PS4 version as well.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:22.000
But they don't have any other information on it.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
It's not out yet and I already hate it.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Frozen is getting as annoying as Final Fantasy 7. It's just taken 17 less years to do it.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
But that's okay though. They're going to make as many sequels as Final Fantasy 7 received for Frozen as well.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Yeah, they already are working on the sequel.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Frozen 2. Re-frozen.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
It's not just the whole...

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
She won't let it go.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Like, did you hear about Disneyland? They're finally getting rid of the Mad Tea Party.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Which, you know, good riddance.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
But they're not bringing it back for, or they're not doing it to bring back Electronica.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
They're going to do a Frozen party.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:59.000
They're turning the Muppet 3D theater into a Frozen sing-a-long theater.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
And there's all this like, it's like, okay...

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Oh, you mean the dance thing?

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
I thought you were talking about the teacups. I was like, fuck you!

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
No, no, no, no, no. The dance thing.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
No, no, it's just like, enough! Enough! Frozen!

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:16.000
What about Brave? What about Big Hero 6? What about any other movie you've released?

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Have you seen the licensing for Frozen?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Yeah, no, they ain't getting rid of that shit any time soon.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Or why are you making like, a Toy Story 4, when you could be making an Incredibles 2?

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I mean, seriously.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.000
They are making an Incredibles 2.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
I know, but it's not coming quick enough!

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Instead, I get another Toy Story, which I don't fucking want to see another Toy Story.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Toy Story's awesome! What the fuck is your problem?

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
This is what surprises me, though, about this whole thing.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000
SingStar is that, you know, Sony, Siri...

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Wait, Disney has their own game development thing.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Why did they license it over to Sony?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Because they don't want to do it anymore.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:49.000
They don't want to do their own...

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Disney didn't have a game development thing anymore.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
They sort of do, but they don't want to deal with it anymore.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.000
I can't remember, I'm thinking maybe LucasArts here, that they only want to do licensing now, but...

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
I was like, somebody's making...

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And that's good, because...

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.000
But I don't think Disney's SingIt did really well for them, so they probably don't want to continue on it.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:12.000
That they'd rather just, once again, license out the stuff to someone else that wants to do it, and just get paid the...

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
So, if it bombs, who cares? We got our licensing fee, so whatever.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:22.000
And Disney does have something, because, yeah, there's that Star Wars iPhone game that Disney made that's doing very well, and Disney Infinity.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:29.000
But I think there was one branch of Disney, the studio that made Split Second and so forth, I think that is what you're thinking of.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
But Disney's real big.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Black Rock Studios, I think, remember?

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Yeah.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.000
They brought out a bunch of developers and closed them and dismantled them and ruined them.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
I didn't know Disney was still in the games business. At least I was hoping they weren't.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
They're in the Disney Infinity business.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
And then, of course, iPhone and Android is a good fit for the Disney stuff.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
But, yeah.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:55.000
SingStar, though, I don't know if you've checked it out, but now you don't need microphones to play SingStar anymore.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I don't know if you know that. It's free on PlayStation 4, I think.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
That's just called singing.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Yeah, you don't need a microphone anymore, because you download an app to your smartphone.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000
And through the network, the smartphone sends the scoring over to the device.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:17.000
It actually works out stupid well. I've actually downloaded it and sang some songs.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
And, of course, it was ABBA.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:28.000
No, because, okay, rant time. You can't import the stuff that you have on disc onto the PlayStation 4 versions.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
So my SingStar Queen and SingStar ABBA are worthless.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:38.000
But the other stuff that I downloaded, I don't know who did it, but I somehow have three Britney Spears songs

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
and two Spice Girls songs on my SingStar library.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
So I was able to download those to my PlayStation 4.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Well, that list of suspects is pretty short.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:51.000
And via my cell phone, you know, it was your wife that made me download Whitney Houston songs, by the way.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Well, don't give in to her demands.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
So I can sing into my phone,

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.000
The greatest love

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Yeah, I can sing into my phone.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
And he was holding the phone up to his face when he did that.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
That's right, because that's how it works.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And then it scores me, and I fail.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Never get trophies, and then rage quit the game.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Well, you can also play Just Dance for free that way, too.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Yeah.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
But why would you?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Why would you?

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Yeah, to your point, it is just singing.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.000
It's like on these cable and satellite networks they have,

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:29.000
Hey, we have hundreds of channels that are garbage, but some of them are karaoke.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:34.000
And you can pull up karaoke songs on demand and sing to them.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
For free.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Let's move on with some more news, Loki.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Alright, so PlayStation 20th anniversary.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:52.000
So now it's time to release a slightly different color, PlayStation 4, and charge more for it than we could for any other color.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:59.000
That's right, the 20th anniversary PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Grey, or whatever the hell they're going to call it.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:02.000
They're making 12,300 of these because it's such a random number.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000
And you can buy one for $500 pre-orders now, and it includes also a grey camera and DualShock 4.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
But you're paying $500 for a system that's actually $400, so you're an idiot.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Here's the deal. I would actually buy that if, when you start it up, it makes the PS1 noise.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
That would be pretty awesome.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
That would be fucking amazing.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Well, there's that theme.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Don't well me. I'll kill you.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
PlayStation 4, well, Dan.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Well, Dan. Dan, food.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Actually, for the last two weeks, it's been like, Dan, computer. Dan, computer.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Dan, PlayStation.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:50.000
And on the PlayStation 4, they have that free theme, the PS1 classic theme, and it does play the classic boot up.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
So when you turn it on, it does that. See, that would be just about worth it.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
There you go. You saved yourself $500.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I don't have a PlayStation 4.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Well, that's $100.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
You can download that to any PlayStation 4.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
So far, I've saved myself $400.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Yeah, but wait a minute, because Jamie's got a new laptop, so you didn't save that much money.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Discount.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Oh, and here's a quick update in case you were interested in purchasing one.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000
It's sold out.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
It's sold out.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
It's sold out in like two seconds.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Mel got one.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Two seconds or 12 hours.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
It took that long.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
And it has like the little, it has the original logo on it too.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
It does.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000
So people were having issues, like their servers were crapping out.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
I don't doubt that people are going to scalp these, but whatever.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I don't remember.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000
You're, I don't know.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.000
They should have acquired your gamertag or something to at least filter some of these people that scalp.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
They should not make them limited.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
That's a great idea too.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Just sell as many as people are going to buy.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
That's a great idea.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
What, are you allergic to money or something?

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Especially if you consider that if all the sales stuff we're hearing out of black Friday's to be believed,

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Xbox one's outselling PlayStation this holiday.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
And it should include a copy of Ridge Racer.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Ridge Racer.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I'm telling you, they put out a decent Ridge Racer game on PlayStation four.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I'd buy it.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
They could have thrown in like Vib ribbon.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Like I'm trying to think of the PS one stuff they've actually put on PS four right now.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Oh no.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
That's supposed to be on PS four, but not yet.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I don't know.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
I guess they don't have PS one games playable on PlayStation four.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Delicious irony.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Delicious irony.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I can play them on my PlayStation three.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:36.000
They still don't have that PlayStation one technology emulating on the PlayStation for you.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Crazy stuff.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000
All right.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Well, here's something you'll be able to play on your PlayStation four, whether it be 20th anniversary or not.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Eventually it's Kingdom Hearts.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Is that Mickey Mouse holding a lightsaber?

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000
It is Mickey Mouse holding a lightsaber in this little picture, but that's not, that is not a.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I want to say that's probably Disney infinity, so don't go crazy now.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000
It probably is.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Cause if you unlock, if you unlock all the characters or I'm sorry, purchase all the characters, then you get a lightsaber.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Yeah.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Anyway, that's all of the money.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
This is about Kingdom Hearts three.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:15.000
And here we go again with some wank going around that Kingdom Hearts three will be including star Wars and Marvel characters.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000
This is because of some statements that was made by the co-director of the game.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Tai Yasue who said, quote, yeah, I can't go into specifics, but there's a lot of new Disney stuff and we have our plates full.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
There's a lot to consider.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:31.000
We're looking at all of Disney, the new ones as well.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
They have a lot of pull and drop.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000
It's like, I can't go into details, but motherfucking star Wars and captain America are going to be in this shit.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
That means fucking frozen.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
There's going to be fucking frozen in Kingdom Hearts three.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000
That's what it means.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Sorry to burst your bubble people, but frozen yet again, we'll be coming to Kingdom Hearts three.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I don't really have a problem with that.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Because I want to see Sora run around in Lederhosen.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
So are we going to have like the gummy ship taking on TIE fighters and shit like that?

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Because that would actually be excellent.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
No, because that's what people want.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Oh yeah.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.000
So is there going to be a lazy port of a PC version that they're going to do for this?

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000
No, no.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
That'll be the final fantasy level.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I think Kingdom Hearts three will be pretty awesome, but see, he didn't say anything about Marvel and all that stuff.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I think that meant frozen.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.000
That's what I take it to mean is that it's like frozen and maybe the Pixar stuff.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I think the Pixar stuff would be awesome.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Wally.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Why not?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:28.000
But you're not even the main character.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
The main character is Sora.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Toy story or the incredible-

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
That was last week.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Just up.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
It'll be just a world where you cry for 30 minutes through the whole thing.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
It'll be great.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000
So there you go.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
More wank about Marvel and Star Wars.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:45.000
More wank dies and everyone's depressed.

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Don't get me wrong.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:53.000
I would love that if it would come out to the PlayStation four in Kingdom Hearts three.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I just don't really see that happening.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000
That's all.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.000
All right.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Let us go to our next segment, which I believe is the mailbag.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:07.000
And every week Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag and dives in head first and tries not to drown in there with all the emails.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
But she's going to pick out a few emails that she believes are worthy of reading on air tonight.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:15.000
If you want to send us an email, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to do that.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Dark Sakura, what is awaiting us in the mailbag tonight?

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:20.000
My first email comes from Robert M.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
And it says Minecraft VoG server.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.000
I admit I'm entirely guilty of being inactive on the server.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
But I hope one factor doesn't enter into the decision to close it.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:40.000
When 1.8 launched, all one got when seeing the VoG server on their list was a big red X and alert that the version of craft bucket being used is no longer compatible.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Hence the most recent inactivity.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Of course, the cost of updating everything to chase the game's updates isn't worth it for the rest of the population you have been getting.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
I fully respect the decision.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I just wish there had been a survival server.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Fun fact.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
All Minecraft mobs, including villagers, are basically gender neutral.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Also, mushrooms.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
I just feel like I'm wasting my time.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Don't inherit the job.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:39.000
No, it's just I want it to be on another server.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.000
They have, for example, I think it's PC Gamer or something like that.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
They have their entire website has a server.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
And there's a ton of people on there because there's a ton of people to go there.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.000
And it's a lot easier to, you're always going to have people online.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Whereas ours, we had quite a few people on the list to get in, but you'd be lucky to see somebody playing for a few hours.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:08.000
It just wasn't as hard to coordinate stuff.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.000
Minecraft's one of those games that I kind of gravitate to when there's not a lot of other big stuff going on right now.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
So now is just not the time of year for Minecraft because there's so much other games out right now.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
Minecraft's that thing I'll visit in March when I'm like, oh, I've kind of finished these other games.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
And oh, remember Minecraft? That's fun.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
So that's just me anyway.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Next email.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Next email.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Howdy peoples.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.000
It starts off with a link about Winnie the Pooh being banned from Polish playgrounds.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Your discussion from last week about gender identity of Toad and Toadette reminded me of a story that broke recently about a Polish city council discussing Winnie the Pooh.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:58.000
This is the discussion that reflected the city council's fundamental misunderstanding of the characters being discussed as well as the nature of and definitions of hermaphroditism and homosexuality.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I'm wondering if the people who think negatively about gender expression in Mario games don't suffer from the same fundamental misunderstanding.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:16.000
I think that we can all agree that if you are thinking deeply about the sexuality and gender expression of characters in children's programming, that you need to rethink your priorities.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Also conservative...

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Well, but...

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Have you even been on the internet?

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
But talking about Bert and Ernie being gay is okay, right?

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Yeah, because they're totally.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Also, conservatives need to do their fucking research before they talk about shit.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Stay black. Retertainment.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.000
This message has been brought to you by Pixel Shits 2, projectiles of exercise impediment.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Trainer.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Did he say to stay black?

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Yes.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
I actually like that guy's email now, but before I thought it was totally lame.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:47.000
People will come on every week and say that ever since you did that on the show, Dan.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I have been the trendsetter.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
You're supposed to say it to Ranma.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:00.000
So, yeah, I think some people are way overthinking, especially when it comes to the children's books and stuff.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
It's just... I don't know.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Take it away, gay!

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Yeah.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:12.000
The nice thing is that kids don't have that problem. Parents have that problem.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.000
That's right.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Adults overthink shit.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
And parents pass it on to their kids.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
And they don't just let it go.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Let it go. Let it go.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
It just doesn't go away.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:29.000
I'm coming to Kingdom Hearts 3 with Sora and Goofy.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
That was good.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Thank you.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Did you practice that all night?

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Yes, I did.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Good job.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:19.000
I think most would agree the classic example of this would be NES's Super Mario Bros., the popularized side-scrolling, or PS1's...

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
But didn't invent it.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Final Fantasy VII and the lavish production quality standards that most RPGs attempted to replicate in its wake.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
But is shallow and lame.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:33.000
In Dan's opinion.

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000
It is. It wasn't even the deepest Final Fantasy game when it came out.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Here we go.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.000
That's just the question. And Dan doesn't get to answer.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Yes, you do.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
The defining game of the generation.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:51.000
I feel like we tackled this question on a previous episode and had a real in-depth conversation on it.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:07:01.000
And I want to say, and Dark Tetsuya knows this show better than I do, it was either the week before the Wii U launched or the week before the PlayStation 4 launched.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
We did a show.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:04.000
Did we do a list list about it?

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I think so.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:13.000
So you might want to go back in the archives because I feel like we had a discussion about the past generation of games as we were transitioning from one generation to the other.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.000
But to humor the question because it is a good question and opinions can also change.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I haven't sampled necessarily as many games from the last generation a year ago as I have now.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:31.000
But I would still say, and this is probably what I would have said on the other show, the defining game of the last generation, absolutely in my opinion, was Wii Sports.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Wii Sports is the defining game of the generation.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
And for a multitude of reasons.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Not just because of what it did for the Wii and the fact that the Wii was the number one system in sales of the last generation solely on the back of Wii Sports.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Really.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:51.000
But the fact that it brought motion control into what we see now in games.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Although it's kind of turned into this rock band, guitar hero oversaturation.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Now it's only dance games that seem to really use it and so forth.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
It led to the Wii condom.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Right. Yeah, yeah. The breaking of the TVs.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:12.000
But it also got, and this is very important, there's more than just the motion control why I say Wii Sports.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:18.000
It got a lot more people playing games that weren't playing games already.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Which is, you know, when we talk about the Wiis being in retirement homes and things like that.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:29.000
That's a theme that's carried on into this generation as we talk about now mobile gaming, Candy Crush, Farmville, yada yada.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
There's that.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.000
And also the simplicity of Wii Sports.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
This is building on something Loki said earlier.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:43.000
If you have a basic concept, that's really all you need to have a really awesome game.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000
And Wii Sports really feels like something that could have been done by an indie developer.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
It really does.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:54.000
So I think for all those reasons, Wii Sports was the defining game of last generation.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
But that's my opinion.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Loki, I don't know if you have an opinion.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Grand Theft Auto IV.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Grand Theft Auto IV is awesome.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Was it the defining game of the last generation?

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Last generation? I'd say the last generation of the defining game would have been Grand Theft Auto V.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000
But that was just Grand Theft Auto.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
It was awesome!

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000
It is awesome, but it's Grand Theft Auto with better graphics.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Grand Theft Auto IV is pretty good.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000
I don't know, as far as games that really kind of did something different.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Yeah, I guess Wii Sports would be pretty good.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:35.000
The whole Wii in general was pretty good just because it was completely different at the time of everything that had been out there.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
You play with controllers, now we're going to do motion controls.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000
And it kind of worked, as opposed to the iToy or something like that.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
That didn't really work too well.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
So I think it was neat.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:50.000
Too bad that people at retirement homes don't buy games.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.000
And people that bought the system unfortunately don't buy a lot of games either.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
And so that's where they lost the support.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:04.000
It was an underpowered system that they didn't want to embrace HD in a time where HD was becoming popular.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:07.000
If only they'd put a supermarket sweep game on the Wii.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:14.000
If only they had a system that was as powerful as the Xbox 360 that had motion controls at that time.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
But now we have the Wii U and that's that.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.000
But now our systems are even more powerful and they're stuck in the same fucking situation again.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Dan, I'm sure this is a thought that keeps you up late at night. What would you say is the defining game of the last generation?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Five bucks, Jamie was going to say Mass Effect.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
I was going to say Mass Effect 3 for one thing.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:35.000
No, I actually have a reason not just because of the game, it's because of the shit that went on around the game.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:51.000
About having the fans speak up and voice their disappointment to such a degree that the company would bend over backwards and make DLC that would fix those problems in their point of view.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:57.000
And then throw out the total, oh by the way here fandom, here's a cookie for the Citadel DLC.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I think that it was the first situation where they really, really took to heart what people were saying.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Dan, to be fair, I think she makes a damn good point.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Oh no, I just knew that she would say Mass Effect.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
But I think her rationale makes sense because...

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Oh absolutely, I wasn't saying it's not rational. Mine is kind of similar.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
If the internet had existed when Final Fantasy 7 came out, they would have had to change the ending there too.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Maybe, I don't know.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Alright, anyway.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
And Square would have been like, fuck the internet! Moving on.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.000
They still do say that.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
What, you guys want Final Fantasy 7 again? No, we don't want money.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:38.000
I would say, strangely enough, I'd say Call of Duty 4. The first Modern Warfare.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Which you think, oh it's just another FPS, it just had better graphics, which is true, but it essentially redefined every FPS that came after and made FPSs the dominant genre for the rest of the generation and carrying over into this generation. It's almost ridiculous.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Well, have you guys seen, they've just put this out for Dragon Age Inquisition, the cinematic tools.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Which had come based on the Call of Duty cinematic tools where people are actually doing whole machinima movies using Call of Duty and its engine.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:17.000
All the later ones because of the scope of the levels and all of the hidden things and just how well developed they are.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Rageinator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, the Wii didn't need a supermarket sweep game, the Wii needed a Matlock vs Golden Girls fighting game. With fatalities.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Matlock would have kicked ass in that.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Matlock would have kicked ass.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Oh no, Sofia's pretty mean.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Robert M. in chat says, what was one of the first popular indie titles? Minecraft. And you could make a case that Minecraft was a defining game.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:51.000
So what you're essentially saying is that you're looking for a TV Land, Injustice, Gods Among Us type of game. TV Land, Gods Among Us.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.000
They move around in the car 54 where are you car and listen to the monkeys play the background.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Dibs on the maid from the Jeffersons.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Lawrence.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Lawrence was awesome. She epitomized sassy black lady.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Archie Bunker yo!

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
So there's more to the email.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Wait real quick, real quick. Robert M. says, I'd say to answer my own persistent question, probably Braid and or Cave Story.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Act F says, Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:20.000
So the rest of the email?

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Yes.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:33.000
With that said, my pick is Demon Souls for PS3. The fact that you can lose all your progress by dying twice in a row and not reaching your blood stain was a revelation to me and made every single encounter in the game an intense fight for survival.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Also the obscure take on multiplayer and PvP was something I'd never seen before.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:43.000
This game may not have been the peak of the series, but it was a solid foundation that created the framework for each game to follow.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2 and the upcoming Bloodborne.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.000
It's a game I'll always look back fondly on and one I compare most action adventure RPGs to now.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Your turn go. We already went haha.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:05.000
So for those of us, by the way, who remember life before checkpoints and safe states and all that, remember when dying in any game three times in a row meant you lost all your progress?

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Yeah. Yeah. Right? Like Battletoads?

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Any game. Oh, and I'm starting from the beginning.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Ghouls and ghosts? Yeah.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Anyway.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
The source of many, many profane statements.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Golden9007.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:27.000
PS, I've been listening to you guys for over nine years and have loved every minute. Keep up the good work and happy holidays. That comes from Tonic Vision.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Wow.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Thank you, Tonic Vision.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
That's amazing. Nine years. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Dance.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I haven't even been wanting to do the show that long.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
Wait, somebody's been listening to this show for nine years. Can you believe it?

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Morons.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
I mean, hi.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.000
I'm going to set you on fire.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
PUNNING!

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Alan Android in our chat says Gary's Mod or Journey?

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Like Journey Escape? That was on 2600.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
No, no, no, no. Journey, the adventure, you know, PlayStation 3.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I think that game came a little late to really define the generation. I think we have yet to see what that's going to really inspire moving forward.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I think Journey just threw it all for a loop.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
I think in a way. So anyway.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I do agree with Gary's Mod.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Good email. Even if I did say, I think we had this discussion before, we probably didn't have Dan there. So now Dan's.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Probably not.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Alright.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Last email.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Greetings, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle series turtle.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000
I'll start out by saying that I firmly believe in voting with my wallet.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:40.000
And in the spirit of that belief, I almost never buy PC games day one, mostly because of the recent acceptance of publishers releasing broken games that they plan to patch later.

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Now why would I want to play through half a game with lots of bugs before it gets patched?

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I want my experience to be as enjoyable as it can be.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.000
And don't get me started on early access, AKA, pay the beta test.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:57.000
Let's take Far Cry 4 as an example. I planned on buying that game immediately upon release.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:09.000
But a week before, Ubisoft released bonked Assassin's Creed to the populace and now I don't want to support them at full price.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.000
I have no problem waiting three to six months for all the patches and a Steam sale.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:24.000
So my question, if enough PC gamers waited on the games to be patched and bought them on sale later on, would some game companies reconsider building games for the PC platform?

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I want to send a message, but I also don't want the developers to negatively retaliate to said message.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
I just want a working game. I look forward to your thoughts.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
As always, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:48.000
I agree with the concept of being able to vote with your wallet and kind of rejecting a lot of these broken games.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:56.000
I mean, I literally just reported five stories ago on a game that was released on PC that's broken and they're having to patch in graphics.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:08.000
And that's, you know, that's not okay. And I think we do have to sometimes resist that gut reaction to buy things until we know that they're working because clearly that expectation is no longer there.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
The games have to actually be working in order to be sold.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Maybe Nintendo was onto something way back in the 80s when they used to have that seal of quality. Remember that? The Nintendo seal of quality?

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Not that it necessarily made the games good to carry the Nintendo seal of quality, but at least you know they weren't super fucking broken.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Maybe a little broken, but not super fucking broken. Do we need some type of seal of quality standard back in the industry?

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Do we need a Steam quality badge or a GOG badge? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just throwing ideas out there.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:57.000
This is not a new problem. Even before the easy patches and the broadband internet and all that, in the 90s, in the 80s, you can go out and buy a game from your PC and you can go through the install process and it was going to be broken.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:16.000
It was much, much more unusual on consoles because consoles were managed not just by the publisher, but they were managed by, like, to get a game to go through Nintendo, you had to submit it to Nintendo and they'd send it back and they'd submit it to Nintendo again and they'd send it back and submit it to Nintendo again before they finally said...

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
And you had to submit to Nintendo on your knees. You can only do three games a year.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:26.000
And then they would do it, you know, and Sony was the same way on the PlayStation and Microsoft's the same way on the Xbox. Nobody does that on the PC.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Now you've got a question of games being so big budget and patches being so easy to put out there that, you know, Assassin's Creed is, I think, kind of the watershed of the issue because it's a huge title at this point in time.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
It was hugely anticipated.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Huge fan base.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:57.000
There were tons and tons of people who had already kind of been up in arms about it because the developers were all, uh, yeah, we can't put female models in it, so just deal and everyone was already pissed.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:06.000
And then they booted the launch, which at least shows us that they were fucking serious about not being able to put their female models in because they could barely put their male models in.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:19.000
But yeah, it just ended up being, I think that it's going to be finally kind of the breaking point where hopefully, like you were saying, vote with your wallet. Tell Ubisoft to eat a dick.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Don't give them your next game at full price. Let them figure it out. And if they lose the revenue, they'll get more serious. I agree.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Don't buy games until you're satisfied that they're going to be good. And when they lose their revenue, then they'll be like, oh, maybe we should be a little more conservative with that release date.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:49.000
And I'm definitely understanding of glitches that are kind of not necessarily something that you'd normally run into, but like when the whole face is missing off of somebody and it's like, come on, you should have seen that testing.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Yeah. Well, and then it's like, you know, and Assassin's Creed has a lot of very devoted, very hardcore fans. There's a lot of people who are going to give that series money by default.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:13.000
It's like the people, okay, the people who went and saw Star Wars Episode One because it was Star Wars and you have to go see it and then Jar Jar Binks comes on screen and your childhood is being ruined right in front of your eyes.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Why Lucas? Why, why, why? Assassin's Creed was the episode, Assassin's Creed Unity is the Episode One of the series in some ways.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
You know what the coolest thing about Episode One was?

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
The pod race.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:32.000
No. The lightsaber battle that happened in the parking lot waiting for the movie.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:36.000
The fact that Greg Proops is one of the commentators during the pod race is the coolest part of Episode One.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
I love Greg Proops.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
But yeah, no, I do think that this is going to hopefully make a fundamental change.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Yeah.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Especially, at least to Ubisoft at exactly what releasing an unfinished game is going to get you.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Who are they going to pick on? Last year it was EA over the whole Mass Effect.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Look at EA though. I mean, perfect example of how someone that's kind of, or a company that's sort of learned from their mistakes, you know, with Battlefield 4 and that mess that was there online.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:09.000
You know, and now they've kind of taken things a little bit different. They gave Dragon Age Inquisition more time and that turned out great.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.000
And now they're giving Battlefield Hardline more time and we'll see.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Right, and so it seems like EA is making the adjustments.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:23.000
EA's problem though, almost more than just like we're releasing a ridiculously broken program, is literally always their DRM.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I think we need a list list here at some point for 2015 because, you know, like we said, EA usually has, or EA was fucking up a couple years ago.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Ubisoft's been fucking up this year. I think we need to do the 2015, the 2015 prediction, big video game company fuck up that we predict for 2015.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Activision.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Yeah, but not just necessarily the company, but what will the fuck up be?

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:48.000
No, no, I'm with him. Activision.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Well, that's a very logical conclusion.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
It's sort of a verb and a noun.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Activision.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.000
What's going to be fucked up in 2015?

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Activision. How are they going to do it? Activision. Booyah.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:05.000
I would like to get into a little more of like the how. How is it going to fuck up?

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Activision.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.000
What?

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
They're going to do something with Call of Duty. I don't know.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:18.000
I liked Advanced Warfare somewhat. I mean, it's just, I think that it's starting to trend downwards.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:22.000
I mean, Ghost, no one really liked. Advanced Warfare is a little bit better, I think, than Ghost.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.000
But next year, I don't know.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.000
I'm going to put it out there. We'll do the listless officially at some point. We don't have time for it tonight.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000
But I'm going to go out on a limb and say Sony is going to make the big fuck up next.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I think Activision is too easy. Sony's coming off a couple really, really good years.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:44.000
They've had some really good years. I think it's time for a really good fuck up.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Well, Sony, the Sony Pictures division, even though it's separate from the game side, that's going through a pretty big fuck up right now.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:23:00.000
No. EA's fourth quarter, we're due for, I think, was it Titanfall 2 maybe? Maybe we'll see that.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:06.000
You know, Sony really only fucked up once. It was a big fuck up with the PlayStation 3.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Kind of that whole generation if they just deleted it. But the PlayStation 1 was a giant hit. The PlayStation 2 was the giantest of hits.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:17.000
PlayStation 3 was even successful if you gave it, what, 10 years.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:24.000
You're forgetting about another, Sony had more than one fuck up. They've had plenty more than one because you're forgetting about the Sony hack that happened on PlayStation.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Well, that's part of the PlayStation 3. That's part of the PlayStation 3. Like the whole PlayStation 3.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
The PSP Go was a fuck up.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:36.000
PSP Go was a fuck up. But I'm just saying, Sony's only, but PSP Go was a small fuck up.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
There are some people...

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Because it was, you know, portable.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:46.000
There are some people that still stand for the PSP Go. Like I do have a couple friends that are like, the PSP Go's not that bad, it was just ahead of its time.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:48.000
It was really easy to steal games for.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
The Xperia Play.

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Anyway, alright.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Well that was no.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Oh my god, Raginator actually has a pretty good idea. Like sometimes Raginator's jokes aren't funny, but this one actually kind of is.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Raginator says, OLR should hold its own annual award show and make one category the biggest fuck up of the year.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I love it.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.000
The Fuck Up Awards.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Winner!

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
No, no, no. One category. You don't have to have the whole thing based on something.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:17.000
No, you need to have a whole thing based on something.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Here's the problem. We gotta walk a fine line. Because I don't want to be that show that's just, the gamers hate everything.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:33.000
The jaded, I hate everything, cynical gamer stuff. Like I kind of think if that's your angle, then you shouldn't be doing a show on games in the first place.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I'm sorry if that's going to be a shots fired comment for some of you, but if you carry your back on the fact that you're a cynical gamer, then get a new fucking hobby.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Why are you looking at me, Rob?

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I'm not just looking in that direction.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
I'm not cynical. Jaded. Fair.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:57.000
At the end of the day, no matter what negative thing we say here on OLR, we talk about fuck ups and all that stuff. I love video games. We all love video games here at OLR, even on their worst days.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:07.000
So my thing is that if we're going to do an award show based around fuck ups or whatever, I still want the overall message to be, we do love video games though, but goddamn, stop fucking up.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Should be like the Orange Lounge Radio listless. Have the whole thing, all the categories be done in that manner and then have everybody vote on them.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Maybe. We'll have to think that one through a little more. We'll talk to our people.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Did I miss the joke that listless is like listless? Is that intentional?

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Yes, totally.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Listless carries over. It's the one segment that has persisted since my college radio show.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
How come I never heard that term mentioned before today?

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.000
I don't know.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000
God damn.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.000
This is how old that segment is.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I need to quit sniffing glue.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Dan, you ready for this? This is how old that segment is. My ex-girlfriend named it.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Damn.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
On that note, I think we're all done with emails, right, Jamie?

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Oh yeah, we're done.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Gorgeous.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
I don't care if we're done. We're fucking done.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.000
We are so done.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I can't even.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000
So let's then, clearly, if we are unable to even anymore.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
I so cannot.

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
The even awards, because some days we just can't even.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
All right, it is time for the FUs of the week.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Here is punishment.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
This is fucked up.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.000
FU to randomly spraining or pulling my hip, whatever the crap I did to it.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Because I was a little sore earlier. Now I'm in a lot of pain.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000
So FU to that.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Feel better.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Logie?

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:50.000
Um, I guess.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Um, I don't know. FU to my cat, maybe?

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000
She woke me up again early this morning. I hate her.

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Well, just because of that.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
She's fine. Then she's also messing with the tree.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Trying to bat at it.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I thought you said Canada.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
No, I don't hate Canada. Canada's not knocking on my door early in the morning.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Don't live in the right neighborhood.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
I guess not.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
So, I don't know. That's all I've got. I'm not really mad.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
Let's see. My FU of the week.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Actually, things are pretty... FU to yard work.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.000
Yard work sucks.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
And there's a reason I don't do it very often.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
But we finally decided, you know, there's a lot of leaves on the lawn.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
We should probably do something about that.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000
So we did something about that the other day.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:42.000
And so FU to the fact that after I, you know, made my back sore, my legs sore during yard work.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
That today, lawn's covered in leaves again.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
That's why you have to wait until the leaves are on the ground.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Or until it floods and your neighbors are like,

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Hey, you know, we should probably rake those leaves up.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Because it keeps blocking the gutters and the street flooded.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And so that was my week.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.000
Yeah, right.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Or you just need to mow.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I just told Alan, I said, can't we just mow them over with the lawn mower?

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Can't we just get the lawn mower?

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Nope, nope. I know that logic. I've tried it. It doesn't work.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000
It just makes the leaves smaller and harder to pick up.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
So it's just... it's not...

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Yeah, but once they're all mulched and chopped up...

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Exactly. Leave them... Exactly.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Leave them there. It's going to make your lawn even better.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Because they're going to, you know, they're just going to rot away into a soil.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Your lawn needs it.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.000
No. They fucking stay there for a whole goddamn year and get covered with more leaves.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:21.000
It doesn't work. I've tried it. I've tried... I have a mulching mower.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
I went over them several times.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:25.000
That's the problem. You need to not have a mulching mower.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.000
You need a mower that just picks the shit up.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Dan, do you have any for you this week?

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Uh, no. Everything is good.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:33.000
I have nothing that I'm upset about.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Everything is awesome.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Everything is good.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Everything is good.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Everything is good.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Everything is awesome.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
You need to say F you to my hip.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
F you to Jamie's hip.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Alright.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Jamie is flipping me the bird.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:53.000
F you to Jamie's bird.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Um, I love this. Some people...

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
But you love the cat.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:28:59.000
There's some people in the chat room trying to help us flesh out ideas for the OLR award show that we could do.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Act deft, suggesting the fuck up of a lifetime achievement award.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
That is a great idea.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
I don't know if it has to be lifetime because there's always going to be bigger fuck ups.

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:09.000
No, because I'm thinking...

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.000
For like a fuck up icon type of award, like Jack Thompson should be the first inductee.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Like fuck up of a lifetime.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Engage.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:19.000
The Engage would be a great nomination.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Or maybe not necessarily Engage, but side talking.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:23.000
You know, I don't...

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:25.000
That should be kind of a fuck up.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.000
No, no. You were right. The Engage.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Yeah, the Engage is a good fuck up of a lifetime.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.000
You know, the Engage was a misunderstood...

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Not a good system, but a misunderstood system.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Now the Game.com, that was a fuck up of a lifetime.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I like where this is going. You guys are smart in your chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
And you don't hear that very often.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:48.000
No, I love our listeners. You stop.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Well, you can love them all you want.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Alright. Moving on. Loki, let's get some more news and then we'll take your calls pretty soon here at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. All one word.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Okay, so there was this issue with Nintendo and Philips over, I guess, this patent for virtual body control device.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:16.000
And apparently they've resolved their dispute by signing a licensing agreement with Philips.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:23.000
And I guess per the agreement, Nintendo and Philips will cross license portions of each company's patent portfolio.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
This is a really old story, right?

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:28.000
No. This is...

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.000
It's about the CDI and like Mario Brothers.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:36.000
No, no, no. Stop. No. Yeah. I can see the whole reason they came down the agreement. It's like, really? You're going to sue us?

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Look what you did to Mario and Zelda on the Philips CDI.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:45.000
But in good news, Philips will be making the Nintendo Wii U CD-ROM next year.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Anyways, so I guess, yeah, this was from back in 2011. They had a notice because of this patent, the virtual body control device.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:02.000
And then there was another one, user interface system based on pointing device.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.000
I love these very, very generic patents. That's fantastic.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:17.000
And apparently that second one was used for the Wii, Wii U and DS consoles and other most interesting tech and cameras.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:25.000
But, I don't know. Yeah, so yeah, really, they should be paying Nintendo for what the fuck they did to Zelda.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:30.000
So Philips is so far gone at this point, they're patent trolling? That's sad.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:34.000
They deserve it for what they did to Zelda, though.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:40.000
All right. Well, you know what? Speaking of money being thrown around aimlessly, this is crazy.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000
So I think last week we probably talked about this. You know those little Amiibos?

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Nintendo's new niche they're trying to get into are these little Amiibo.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:54.000
And there was a misprint or a mispressing of some of the Amiibo for Samus.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:32:02.000
And there was a Samus floating around out there that had two arm cannons, which if you know Samus, she does not have two arm cannons. She has one.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.000
But that's awesome.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Yeah, it looks awesome, because that looks like Samus.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
It's awesome until she falls on the ground and she's like...

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Tips over because the guns are too heavy and the Amiibo won't stand out.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:14.000
But Samus doesn't have that problem, she'll just turn into a ball.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Yeah, good point.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.000
But the dual gun Samus looks amazing because that's what she should look like in the movie trailer.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Like as she's walking out with the fire, like the two guns on the side.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Incidentally, Metroid Prime 4.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Yes, right? But anyway, so somebody bought one of these Samus with the two gun figures at Best Buy and sold it on eBay $2,500 to buy a Samus Amiibo phone.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Now that's not exactly accurate. He did include a regular Samus Amiibo with it.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:58.000
So really, if you look at it, they're only $1,250 a piece. And that right there is only, what, $1,000 premium on each?

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:13.000
It was bought at Best Buy for $13. And the seller was asked on Reddit if he'd considered keeping the Samus Amiibo or donating it to a museum or donating it to Nintendo.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
He's like, fuck no, I want money.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Yeah, he said, the thought had not crossed my mind. However, if approached by Nintendo, I probably would have. I was considering hanging on to it to sell at a later date if the value increased.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:33.000
However, with the high level of interest shown at the time when I posted it, I thought I'd go ahead and sell it now in case the value went down or a whole tub of them was discovered at a later date.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Meanwhile, Nintendo's got a warehouse full of these that they're pissed off at the manufacturer for and they're just like, wait a minute, these things are worth $2,000 a piece?

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Hate this guy all you want? He's fucking smart. I'm sorry. That's the most American thing I've heard of, what he just did.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.000
The only thing that would have been more American is he was eating one of those KFC bowls at the time.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:07.000
That's awesome. The thing is, it's not like he bought something that was unusual and he bought them up and then has trotted them out on eBay.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:15.000
He found something that was a one-off and someone said, probably, you know, I want it. Someone's probably worth something and he threw it out there to see what he could get.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:23.000
It wasn't like he threw it up there for like a $2,500 buy it now. I mean, you know, more power to him. It's not like he's playing a slimy game.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:28.000
He probably at the very least, he's going to make his money back and what he purchased it for it.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:37.000
I get this more than the ET cartridges. At least the Samus doll wasn't thrown away and dug out of a landfill.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
But it was thrown away by Atari.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:46.000
I'm sure Atari's thrown a lot away. Do you want like a stick of gum that Nolan Bushnell once chewed? Is that a value?

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Yes.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Actually, then again, one of the coolest Christmas presents I ever got.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Stick of gum?

02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:03.000
No, a friend of mine got me index cards that were actually used on the 1970s match game that had questions on it.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000
There you go.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Richard Dawson might have touched those.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Right? And so that's why I'm like, okay, actually this is one of the coolest presents I've ever gotten in my life.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:17.000
So anyway, Charles Nelson Reilly might have spit on it.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Maybe. He might have had like skin cells from Betty White.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Anyway. Okay, so there we go. That is it for the news tonight, which means we are ready to go to the Skype line.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.000
We're ready for your calls. So now's your chance. Time zones don't usually get to participate.

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, if you'd like to talk about anything we've talked about tonight.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:46.000
PlayStation Experience, the Game Awards, Steam Broadcasting, anything. It's been a very busy week.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:51.000
I will turn to Loki real quick and see if there's any last minute stories while we wait for those calls to come in.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Nope. No. No, they are not.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.000
No, they are not. Well, luckily we have a call coming in so at least we can get to that.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000
And we will take this call now.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Do you see me?

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
I do. Is that Ravenstaufen?

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000
It is Ravenstaufen.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Oh. Amiibos. Hey, wait. That Samus only has one gun. It's less cool.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:14.000
I know. It's only worth $1250.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:21.000
I got so much stuff in here, man. I mean, I went crazy. Like bipolar crazy.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I heard a rumor, and this is still rumor status, but you held up that Villager amiibo. You might want to keep that in the packaging.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:34.000
The rumor I'm hearing, Villager, Marth, and Wii Fit Trainer already discontinued.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Oh, I already have? I have all of them.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000
How many of those things have you bought, sir?

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
All of them. I bought all of them for that reason.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000
I want a Villager.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Every single amiibo.

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. Sorry. Let me go get them. Yeah, I got the Marth one, you're saying. I got them all, man.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Pikachu, Marth.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Just so you know, Nintendo is proud of you. You've completely bought into the marketing and bought them all.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000
That's right.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
Because consumerism always wins for me.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
How does it feel to be a consumer whore for Nintendo?

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:16.000
I am a consumer whore. I admit it, but yes, I've been keeping a few in the box.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:23.000
But yeah, to that day, just like that guy, you said it, Dan. You said, nothing wrong with that, and then when the day comes, cash in.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.000
That's right.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Like I said, it's not like you bought them all on the shelf and you're trying to sell something that some five-year-old wants.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:39.000
That's true. Just saying, it will happen because someone will go out there and say, maybe Rob will go like, I want Wii Fit Trainer. Guess who has it?

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Actually, I do kind of want Wii Fit Trainer, but I wish they'd had, I mean, you know, I just, I prefer male Wii Fit Trainer because of, you know, some of my...

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:52.000
It's all good.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Yeah, exactly. If you're going to wear a skin tight outfit, I prefer...

02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:00.000
I want to see, like, someone make a mod of those, like, fat Wii Fit Trainer. That'd be hilarious.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.000
Why not? Alright, so I don't think you just called in tonight to talk about your various collection of amiibo.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:13.000
God, no. No, no, this is, uh, I wanted to talk about the VGAs some more if I could. Not the VGAs, but the Game Award.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Did you check out who won Trending Gamer?

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Uh, that was the one that Total Biscuit won, right?

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
That is so weird, because guess who else was on there?

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:25.000
PewDiePie!

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Yeah, and he's, he's super famous, huh? Here's, I'm gonna, Raven's Dolphin, can I be honest with you in the listenership for a minute?

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Yeah, please.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:38.000
This is gonna really surprise some of you guys. You ready? I didn't know who any of those people were. I didn't know who any of them were.

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:47.000
And I, I do, I do have a familiarity with PewDiePie because I see his articles on Yahoo about how he's the biggest YouTube celebrity out there.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:39:01.000
So I'm not gonna say like, oh, I'm so hipster, I don't, but I watched maybe two minutes of one of his videos and I was like, alright, I've seen this a million times on Twitch and various channels and I would just rather watch my friends than these guys.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:05.000
I'm like Total Biscuit, I mean, he seems to be, you know, interesting, but that's about it.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
I don't, I don't know any of those guys and I don't know a thing about him.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Well, I was ready for, you know, oh geez, this guy got 30 million people, it's going to PewDiePie, it's going to him, it's going to him, and they said Total Biscuit. I went like, this thing's saved, thank God.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:31.000
I went like, I don't know, I don't know the 30 million people, but they seem quite a, I mean, like I said, I'd rather have a chat room full of 100 smart people than have 30 million blah people.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Yeah.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:39.000
PewDiePie's videos are annoying. I can't understand why people are so into...

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Wasn't his big thing, he got big because he did the scary games and would scream really loud?

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:48.000
He got big because of the scare cam. The scare cam was his invention.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:40:03.000
I don't, you know, just, I can't, I mean, maybe I haven't watched enough of a sample of the material, but man, it's just really just, you try to watch his videos and it's just like, oh, it's 30 million people want to watch video games played by the world's most annoying person. This is totally sweet.

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:15.000
The viral phenomenon is very strange because it's very interesting who goes viral and who doesn't. I mean, look at us, we've been doing this fucking thing for 12 years and we're not a big show by any means.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:25.000
There's still a lot of people out there that listen to a lot of podcasts, have no idea. There's been a gaming podcast for 12 years, but I'm okay with that because like you hit the nail on the head.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:35.000
We're fortunate here at OLR that the people we do bring in are all pretty cool and the people that have bad attitudes tend to leave pretty quickly and I'm totally okay with that.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.000
You hit the nail on the head, the 100 cool people outweighs 30 billion trolls, you know what I mean?

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Dozens and dozens of hardcore fans.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000
That's right.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Like I said, I watch you guys and you guys are pretty genuine people. Everyone's been chasing that dollar and don't get me wrong, I chase the dollar too, but my first thing when I consider Tekken Games is the first goal is to not make the dollar first, but to make the community happy.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Yes. And you know what, I'm not slamming on these guys. Congrats to them, they did something right, they caught that viral wave. I'm happy for them, I am. I'm not familiar with their work because the great thing about the internet is that anybody can do this, so I prefer to just, there's plenty of content out there with friends and other indie people that I know that do stuff that keeps me busy.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:36.000
One other thing, me, Hitstun and everyone else, we're on InstagibTV, no relation, but we do our thing on there and people are liking it.

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Awesome. That's just a plug, right?

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:54.000
For both of us, yeah, like I said, we do our direct capture thing and we do our help thing, but I'm not concerned about like, oh man, one day I'll be 30 million because those 30 million will be hanging on every word you're saying.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:05.000
That's true. And yeah, if PewDiePie says the wrong thing, there's going to be like a hate campaign on Twitter and all that stuff and I'm kind of glad on one hand that we don't have to deal with a lot of that yet.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:15.000
I mean, I fear the day when one out of context thing I said in 12 years of broadcasting goes fucking viral. I mean, that is a fear we have to kind of live in a little bit.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Yeah, we're not that far above the radar for that to happen.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Hashtag I hate Rob.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Maybe. Who knows? Who knows? Go into our chat. I'm over at live.vognetwork.com. Martan is in our chat saying, you're right, Rob. You are the trending gamer, aw shucks.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:36.000
And Fabrice says Sky is the mother of all social gamer celebrities. The drag mother, perhaps.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
And how? You bet at stream.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Alright, Ravenstauff, anything else? Any other plugs?

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:50.000
One last thing I want to say. I want to say thanks for doing an early stream. Your stuff, when I do my stuff, is around your stuff.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:43:03.000
So I'm never around to like to be a witness to a live broadcast and I want to say thank you for doing. I know this is for the international listeners, but I like that you're taking chances and saying, alright, three o'clock people.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:10.000
Because I was listening to your last show, playing Halo, doing my thing. We're like, I'm going to join. I'm going to join. I'm going to join. I'm going to join.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000
And I'm glad that you did it. Thank you for making me a part of it.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:21.000
It was for anybody who could be here. In all honesty, it was really so that we could go to dinner somewhere else tonight. But usually the early hour doesn't work for us.

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:25.000
So I'm happy it worked to get some other people in. Because we do want to be the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:35.000
Yeah, I appreciate it. I just want to say thank you and have a nice night. And Jamie, congrats on the MacBook. I am too poor for a MacBook.

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:41.000
Trust me, we'll talk. It took me a bit of doing.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.000
So is she.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Take care, my friend. Bye.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. But the Skype line is lighting up with more calls, so let's get to it.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:53.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Hi, it's Fabrice.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Fabrice? Oh, this is one of our listeners in Belgium, isn't it?

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Yeah, that's right.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:09.000
What is up? Welcome to the show. I'm so excited that we get different people on tonight. I mean, I love the people that we hear from every week, don't get me wrong.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:13.000
But I love that we mix it up a little bit tonight. Well, how are you, my friend?

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Well, I'm fine. Thanks for doing the show.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:20.000
You're welcome. Thank you for calling in. What's on your mind tonight?

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:26.000
Well, nothing really. I'd really like to call to say thank you for doing the show for so long.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:34.000
So I've been through a rough time last couple of months, so you've kind of helped me get through it.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Wow. I'm blown away by that. You're welcome first.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:52.000
And that's always the compliments that carry the most weight to hear people say that, like, I was having a shitty day and you took my mind off of it for three hours.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:45:00.000
And I'm just like, that's such a huge compliment. Like, you don't even know. Because I know I have those shitty days.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I know how it makes me feel when somebody can kind of take me out of that mood. So thank you so much. That is such a huge compliment.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:14.000
And thank you for telling us that because it just motivates us to go another 12 years. Right, Dan? Want to go for 12 more?

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:20.000
I guess. I ain't got nothing to do. I'll show up once every six months or so.

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Go ahead.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Yeah, well, I'd like to tell that I miss the Sega that used to live a long time ago. I really miss their arcade games.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
We do too.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:47.000
Anybody with taste does, sir. I miss the Sega games. Well, at least there was that Sega Humble Bundle. I mean, is that kind of stuff open to the international crowd? Were you able to pick up that Sega Humble Bundle?

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Yeah, but I already own most of those games.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Well, yeah, that happens too. That's like when they're giving away Mirror's Edge for free and you're like, oh, but I already own Mirror's Edge. Oh well.

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Or Injustice is the PlayStation Plus game of the month. Oops, sorry about that. Oh well. That happens.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:14.000
When they finally release the game again, you know, I buy it day one because they only release a couple of games a year anymore. So yeah.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Yeah, that's true. Sega's only going to put out a few things a year. Well, actually, I was hearing not so good things about the latest Sonic game on the Wii U.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:30.000
I'm hearing it's Sonic 06 bad, and that's not good. That's really not good to hear. Yeah, it's pretty bad.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Yeah, I didn't even bother playing it.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.000
I just want to see more outruns and Space Harriers and stuff like that, and it's gone.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:44.000
Well, they have that one game that's supposed to come into the Wii U that was a Kickstarter, that 90s racing game or whatever. I forget what they call that.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Oh yeah, but that wasn't really, that was some personalities from Sega.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
Not another 90s racer. That's what they should call it.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:56.000
It wasn't even that. It was just a game done in the style of like Daytona USA and Sega Rally.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:58.000
I don't know if it ever came out.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:00.000
It's not out yet, but it looks good.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:04.000
No, it's been postponed for like a year and a half now.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Of course. That's what happens to games. Of course that's what happens.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:12.000
Yeah, they had all the trouble with the AI of the other 40 cars on track.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Oh my gosh.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
And it's like, really, how hard can it be?

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.000
You know, you've made like a thousand games like this, you know?

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Well, no, this was an indie guy that was doing it. It was someone that was making it in Unity or whatever.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Oh, that's cool.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Did you say it was going to be 40 players?

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000
The thing that bugs me most about Sega right now is what's going on with Phantasy Star, because they refuse to release that shit in the US.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Like, Japan just got Phantasy Star Nova on the Vita, and I really want to play that, and it's like a Vita game, right?

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:46.000
And they're, nope, not coming out in the US. Nope. Unless there's a surprise announcement at E3 or something.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.000
It's very frustrating. But at least we're getting you Cruise of Five, I guess.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.000
And you've got to wonder why Sony's not on that. Why Sony's not just like, hey, Sega.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Yeah, right?

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:01.000
Let's make it worth your while, because in Japan, Phantasy Star is what's keeping that shit running.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
That's the reason there is a Vita.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Let's get your nose out of Nintendo's butt and put it in ours.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:15.000
Exactly. See, I'm upset because Phantasy Star hasn't been Phantasy Star since, like, the days of the Genesis.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:22.000
You know, I would love to have a Phantasy Star game that's an RPG and not like its weird little quasi-MMO.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:30.000
But MMOs today owe a lot to Phantasy Star Online. Like, Phantasy Star Online defined, you know, we're talking about generation-defining games.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Phantasy Star Online is a generation-defining game of its day.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Sure. Yeah, there's no doubt that it's the first kind of online adventure. Yeah, it was a big thing.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000
But I would love to see a Phantasy Star game.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Dungeon Buster, in your camp over at our live chatroom, live.vognetwork.com, I'd really like to see another Phantasy Star in the same vein as Phantasy Stars 1 through 4.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:53.000
It'll probably never happen, but I can always hope.

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.000
I would love to see real localizations of Generation 1 and Generation 2, which were on PS2.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:03.000
I played a fan translation of Generation 1. It was awesome.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Yeah? Awesome. Well, Fabrice, anything else you want to share with us tonight before we let you go?

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Yeah, well, you know, Shenmue 3.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:12.000
No kidding, huh?

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Yeah. It'll probably never happen, but you know.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:17.000
No, no.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Well, never say never, because who ever thought that we would finally get Final Fantasy VII on the PlayStation 4? And here we are!

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000
We did it! We did it, everybody!

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Shenmue 3 is more important than Final Fantasy VII.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:39.000
I actually agree with you there. Honestly, coming out of the PlayStation Expo, this is the first time this has ever happened, and some people have been waiting decades for this.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.000
People walked out of the PlayStation Expo more excited for Suikoden than they were for Final Fantasy.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
Do you know how long some people have been waiting for this day?

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000
What, for Suikoden?

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
People were more excited about Suikoden news than Final Fantasy news.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Right, they're doing a new Suikoden?

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.000
No, they're just re-releasing an old one, and it's still more exciting than Final Fantasy VII.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
How's it going? Can Ami get the...

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:08.000
Fabrice, I gotta let you go so we can get some more callers, but thank you so, so, so much for calling in and the nice words. We really appreciate it.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Okay, thank you guys.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Take care, my friend. Bye-bye.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:18.000
That's so awesome that we have people international in a country that I'll never be able to afford to fly to.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Who likes Sega.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Yes, who loves Sega. It has such good taste.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:24.000
You chose a good day to call.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
I'm glad we could do the earlier show to make it work.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Let me quickly go to the Twittersphere and see if, as I thought I saw some tweets coming in earlier before the show,

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:42.000
but you know, I am such a great radio host that I didn't bring up the Twitter in advance,

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:46.000
but I'm doing it now, because live radio is a joy.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Production!

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000
And everybody on the house is on the internet.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Kidman Project tweeted us and said,

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Bloody typical, I'm missing the convergence of our time streams,

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:00.000
so here's a big cheers for always making my Mondays less shit.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:04.000
So, he's over in the UK, but it sounds like he couldn't make it today anyway.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:06.000
So, that's too bad.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Let's see, yeah, there's some thoughts from Twitter, so let's go to another call.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Hi, this is Raginator.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:19.000
Hey, Raginator, buddy. How you doing?

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Pretty good, how are you?

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Eh, no, we're doing really good. What's on your mind?

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Well, I was going to touch on something that you were mentioning earlier in the news segment.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Go for it.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Yeah, you were mentioning how Steam, just the other day, introduced the Steam broadcasting feature on their server.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Yeah, they're like answering a Twitch in a way that's built into the service, yeah?

02:51:53.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Yes, well, to go into a little detail to really participate in terms of broadcasting yourself,

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:12.000
you have to opt into their beta program, which you do there by going to your options on Steam.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Yes, it's a good reminder to check, because I thought I was already opted in, and apparently I wasn't.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:24.000
So, when I couldn't see broadcasting in there, I was like, what the hell, I thought I was in the beta stuff, but I wasn't.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:26.000
So, yeah, check that out.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:40.000
The trouble is, the update that they released, I think it was on Thursday night, or Friday night, I think it was on, probably Thursday night,

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:46.000
but anyway, the update had a major flaw.

02:52:46.000 --> 02:53:00.000
It worked, completely and utterly worked, this one file, I think it's called steamui.dl, for a lot of people,

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:13.000
and to the point where if you were to close Steam for whatever reason, and that file was worked for you,

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
you would not be able to relaunch Steam.

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:24.000
How do you know that this happened to you? Because I, of course, am getting all the updates, so now you have me a little worried that I'm going to have to reinstall everything.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Do you get an error message that makes it very clear that this happens to you?

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:40.000
Yeah, if you were to close, let's say for the sake of conversation, you were to close Steam right now, and then try to launch it again,

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:57.000
you'll see like a little dialog box that says fatal error, and then it'll list SteamUI.dll as being the issue.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:08.000
So you can't just have it scan your computer and find all the games again, you actually have to go in and redownload everything, which that's a lot, oh my gosh, that's so much.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Yeah, yeah, well, some people are saying that you can rescan, assuming that you got the games on like a separate hard drive.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Now, if the problem is with me, A, I didn't know that, and B, I get my games between two drives, an internal hard drive and an external hard drive.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:45.000
And at least with the stuff that's on the Steam hard drive and the Steam application itself, when I went to uninstall Steam, it deleted the games that were on the Steam hard drive, so I had to reinstall those anyways.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Well, Raginator, I think this might be a challenge, but only install those games you're actually playing, and that should cut it down to like 100 megs.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Only install the games you're actually playing.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Yeah, well, you know, the trouble with me is, you know, sure, there's certain games that I consider my go-to games, like, you know, me, I go on and on and on about the Magic the Gathering games.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Of course, that's alright, it's like Me and WoW, or Final Fantasy.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Yeah, but at the same time, you know, I have a lot of games that I haven't touched yet, and now I've been always the type to, yeah, I'm probably going to get around to it.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:43.000
And a lot of times when I'm not playing the Magic the Gathering games or, you know, the Geometry Wars, you know, well, I end up choosing a status usually just totally seemingly random.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:48.000
You know, one second I could feel like playing Sam and Max, and the next second I could see them.

02:55:49.000 --> 02:56:00.000
Alright, so because you have what I lovingly refer to, because I have this too, as gamer ADD, you just, you need all your games there at a moment's notice, because you might have to switch from one, you know, to another in five minutes.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.000
I understand, I understand.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:03.000
Exactly.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Alright, so lesson learned, wait another week, maybe don't opt into these betas, because you might lose everything, who knows, or back things up, or just be careful, be careful.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Alright, Rachel, I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call, but take care my friend.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Sure, bye, have a good one.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Bye, good luck with all the restoration.

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:31.000
At least, you know, I mean, especially if you're capped on your bandwidth, I don't know how you're going to manage in that situation, that's just going to suck.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:45.000
But at least he didn't lose the digital rights, because I still remember that guy had a problem a few years ago on his PlayStation 3 or something, where he tried to download all this video, and then like, it disappeared, and he couldn't, like, re-download him. I just remember that was a huge issue.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:51.000
I think you can just re-download the DLL, the Steam UI, you don't have to re-download all your games.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:55.000
I don't know, but I would think Rage Nator probably poked around on the Steam forums, and you know.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Well, who knows.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:08.000
Hopefully, who knows, who knows. That's usually what I do. The first thing I do is I Google it, and I narrow down the search to the last 24 hours, or today, to try to see if other people are posting and bitching about the problems.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Alright, we are going to take one more call, so we've got one more call coming in here, and then we'll wrap up. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:15.000
This is Eric RPG.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:17.000
Hey, Eric RPG, how you doing?

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Fine.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Good to hear from you.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Going on, undergoing a cold, I think.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Oh, no. I somehow have avoided the sick thing, knock on wood, somehow avoided that. Well, what's on your mind today, my friend?

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:33.000
I just want to talk about one game in particular I played this week that I should warn everybody not to play.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Uh-oh, what's that?

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:41.000
This is a game called Haunted House Crypt of Graves, which is actually a remake of the original Atari Haunted House game.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:49.000
Oh, we've reported that this was a thing on this show before, because I remember, I don't know if you're old enough to remember the 2600 version, but I remember the 2600 version.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
It was, for its day, it was awesome.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:54.000
It was brilliant.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:58.000
It's not exactly the game that I go, gosh, they should remake that.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Yeah, but when you're, like, five years old, that game is, like, awesome.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Yeah, it was awesome. So it doesn't hold up well, huh, Eric?

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Yeah, basically what they did is they made it a first-person adventure type of game, but they also made it kind of like Amnesia, but they failed miserably in every conceivable way.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Oh, no.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:24.000
The controls are sluggish and awkward, and there's lots of graphical glitches.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Like, I was running away from invisible enemies, and apparently the only way to see them is to use this, like, supernatural vision that this character has.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:39.000
But I was jumping up around trying to get away from them, and I ended up on top of them for some reason.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:41.000
Whoa.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Yeah, unfortunately the house has trouble rendering.

02:58:44.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Not only that, but the staircase that you took to get down to that place, you can go down it just fine, but you have to actually jump up the stairs because they didn't design it in such a way that you could just walk back up it, and it's awkward as heck to get back up there.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:06.000
You can go down the stairs, but you can't go up. What kind of house is this? This is like the Winchester Mystery House. What is this?

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:08.000
It's like a roach motel.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:19.000
There's really terrible voice acting, and for some reason the voice acting of the old man character is somehow worse audio quality than the main characters.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:29.000
Wow. Oh my god. It's like people probably recorded it over Skype, which is fine for doing a show like this, but not for voice acting. You're going to actually put it in a video game.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Waynein1 in our chat room says, I just saw a video of Haunted House today on YouTube. Looked pretty bad. DungeonBuster says, the original is awesome, just a pair of eyes bumping into walls and the scary lightning.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:51.000
Never mind the games using Unreal Engine 4, but it's like totally not taking advantage of it, and it looks terrible, and it's so unoptimized that even my PC can't run it very well.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:58.000
My PC isn't the greatest. I'm still using a dual core, but it should be running somewhat confidently.

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
It should be better than it is. I'm sorry to hear that.

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:09.000
I'm going to give this game a 1 out of 10 on GameTactics.com. I'm not even going to bother finishing it because it's that bad.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:14.000
It's so bad. Don't check it out. Now everyone's going to check it out because they want to see how bad it is.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:21.000
So what you've done is unwittingly lead people into the trap. You're part of the problem. You're not the solution.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Is it showgirls bad? Because that's kind of good when it's that bad.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:27.000
It's not so bad. It's good.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Okay, that's too bad. It's just bad.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Yeah? Well you don't know shit.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:37.000
You are a whore, darlin'. Alright, well we gotta go. We're going to go eat some brown rice and vegetables.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Alright, take care my friend.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
I'm ordering a hamburger. Rob's going to have dog chow.

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
I don't think Eric got the joke, the showgirls joke, but yes.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:47.000
Hi, Alan's here. Hi Alan.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:49.000
Hi. What's up? Do you want candy?

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Yes, candy, candy, candy, candy. Yay. Ooh, he brought me the really yummy. Oh, in theme with tonight's show, we were talking about Australia earlier.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
This is Australian black licorice.

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Dude, sweet. I love black licorice.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:04.000
We can eat it in the car with Jamie.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:06.000
I'm going to be so nauseous.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:11.000
I know some people can't stand black licorice, but I love it. Dan, it must be a Dutch thing.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:13.000
Maybe.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.000
I can't stand black licorice, so when I get that I'm being super nice because it's candy that I can't have.

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
I've bought Dan some before and then I left the house.

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
I've bought him mayonnaise and you all know how I feel about mayonnaise.

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.000
I love mayonnaise.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:28.000
Alan, let's have a mayonnaise party.

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Do you have a mayonnaise and black licorice sandwich?

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:35.000
The worst thing in the world is a tuna, because canned tuna is also, I can't stand.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:40.000
So he makes those fucking tuna fish sandwiches. That's what, canned tuna and mayonnaise.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.000
It's like licking up, like, you know, oozing up a side of mayonnaise.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:47.000
God, I gotta shit. Alright.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:54.000
Alright, well that is going to do it for the Skypline tonight. Thanks to everybody who called in, appreciate it.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:02:00.000
If you didn't get through or you'd like to participate with the show, maybe you forgot that the show was early tonight, so you're listening at the six o'clock hour.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:07.000
You can always tweet us at twitter.com slash o-l-r or you can always email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:16.000
But we are going to go around and start to wrap up the show because I don't believe Loki had any last minute stories, nor does Jamie or Dan, so that's it.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:21.000
Thank you guys very much for being here. Those of you guys that tuned in live at the earlier hour, appreciate it.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:27.000
Those of you guys that forgot, that are kicking yourselves, that are listening on the repeat, sorry, but we'll be back at our regular time next week.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:31.000
And those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're all still awesome.

03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:35.000
And I would love to hear from those of you guys, we had an emailer this week that said he'd been listening for like nine years.

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:38.000
I'd love to hear from more of you, especially those of you that have been listening for years and years.

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:40.000
Yeah, well I've been listening for twelve years.

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:42.000
I've been dealing with this crap for twelve years.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:44.000
I've been ignoring for twelve years, no I'm kidding.

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:51.000
That's what I want for Chris McQuanzica. I want emails from listeners that have never emailed us before that have been listening for a long time, or even a short time.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:56.000
That's what I want. You want to give me a really easy Chris McQuanzica gift? Give me that. Why is Alan wagging his finger?

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:58.000
A dozen unique emails.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:00.000
Yeah, right.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:09.000
The only caveat to that is that if you've been listening to the show for like nine, ten, eleven years, don't say, I started the sixth grade and now I'm at a bar.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:11.000
So don't do that.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:17.000
No, no, that's awesome. You should totally do that because if you're listening to this show in the sixth grade, you've got problems.

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
And we've contributed to those problems.

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:25.000
Yeah, don't tell me that you were in elementary school and you started listening and now you have your own kids. That I don't need to hear.

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:31.000
Oh come on, one of our listeners was in high school when he started and now he's my coworker.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:33.000
I can't, I can't.

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Anyhow, Dan, I want to thank you so much for being here tonight. You're always a fun time to have on the show.

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:40.000
I didn't have anything better to do.

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
I understand. Do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:45.000
No, no I do not.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:47.000
Alright, sounds good.

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:49.000
You know you can just take that cabinet because he's just not going to use it.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:51.000
No, you can't take that cabinet.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:53.000
I want to use it.

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:55.000
He just said I could take it, so it's happening.

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:57.000
No, take it back. Alright, let's see. Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:02.000
Speaking of cabinets that aren't being used, I have to dust off my arcade cabinet at home.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:04.000
It's not easy is it?

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:12.000
We're turning that room into a playroom, so it's still going to stay there because thank God I don't have to move it out because I don't, I barely made it.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:25.000
My hallway, the way it is, I have to make like two sharp 90 degree turns to get the arcade cabinet in there and there literally was like maybe a half quarter of an inch clearance.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Is it the same one that was in your guys' apartment?

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:30.000
No, oh God.

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
No, we moved, we moved that thing upstairs.

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:42.000
We moved to an upstairs apartment like, ah, that is getting dismantled. That is not coming with us. I am not lifting that upstairs.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
No, I have a Sega Astro City that I have.

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:47.000
Okay, you have a candy.

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
Yeah, so I have that and it's all nice and redone, but I don't use it ever.

03:04:51.000 --> 03:05:02.000
I have Street Fighter IV on it though with my nice octagonal restrictor plates and shit that still doesn't make me any better at the game, but it's nice.

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Alright, my final thought tonight is I want to thank Dan for running and getting tacos during the show. There's no, there's no better way to say I'm a good friend than to buy somebody a taco.

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Add a hungry wife.

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Alright, and speaking of hungry wife, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:23.000
I fucking love my new computer. It's so fucking pretty.

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:28.000
Hey, by the way, the local Toys R Us has those ColecoVision flashback consoles.

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:30.000
It sucks. Don't get it.

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:31.000
I got the Intellivision one.

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:35.000
The controllers are not good at all. The Intellivision one is sweet.

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
Yeah, I got the Intellivision one. I haven't got the ColecoVision one.

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:43.000
I was thinking of it as more a gift for my dad because he had a ColecoVision that he gave me a long time ago, so...

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
The controllers are almost unusable.

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Alright, and it seems like you guys liked really...

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:57.000
Oh, yeah.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:02.000
Dan, sorry, I didn't realize Dan was talking and not into a mic. Sorry, guys. That's definitely the time to...

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:04.000
Sorry, we're having a side conversation about it.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:06.000
Yeah, clearly, clearly, and I'm trying to wrap up the show.

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
We can talk about ColecoVision flashback for like 45 more minutes.

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:11.000
No, no, no, no. We got to wrap up.

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:17.000
I do want to say, Wayne in one in chat says, thanks guys for doing this early show. Great to be able to tune in live for the first time since 2006.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:21.000
You know, it seems like a lot of you guys like the earlier show, so it's something we'll have to consider.

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:26.000
I mean, we can't do it all the times, and certainly the folks that are used to six o'clock that can't be here at this time don't want us to do it all the time.

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:31.000
But we will definitely consider doing more of these in the future as we can work it out in our schedule.

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:33.000
It'll be random OLR times.

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:38.000
Man, this is so much easier to do with a laptop than on my old iPad.

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:43.000
You know, we have to do a show some week at like four in the morning, so that way our friends in Japan can tune in and listen.

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:45.000
Okay.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
That's it, guys. Thank you so much for tuning in to another edition of Orange Laundry.

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:55.000
We'll be back next week, normal time, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern at vognetwork.com, but 24-7 on the podcast feed.

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
Have a great week, everybody. Happy gaming.

03:06:58.000 --> 03:06:59.000
Stay black.

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
See you next week.

03:07:55.000 --> 03:08:02.000
.
