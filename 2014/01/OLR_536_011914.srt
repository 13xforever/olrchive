00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's a new year of growth, despite what the pundits are saying all about Nintendo.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
New games are being created by the people we love, and new services are expanding their horizons,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and new updates are available to amuse and entertain us.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Join us for all the details on this episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January the 19th of 2014, episode number 536 of our show.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Our program, about three hours or so, give or take like an hour,

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
dedicated to all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week, and welcome back to the show this week.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How are you doing?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As I said, Husky.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Husky, yes.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm about to take a cough drop for my Husky cough.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
As she was telling me before the show tonight, not during the first take,

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
where maybe her mic wasn't on that I had to cut out.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I would never make a big mistake like that. I'm a professional.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Rob is a flawless goddess.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's right, don't you forget it.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Anyway, so yes, you have a bit of the Kathleen Turner thing going on with your voice tonight.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, I was telling my friend, who I'm Tumblr pals with,

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
that I either sound like a 13-year-old boy or like a sex phone worker.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So, I can say, you know, what are you wearing?

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And have it sound hot.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Other than like, bitch, I don't care what you're wearing.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Can we get you to say just once for the listeners, I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Great, now I have a clip for the next intro.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Alright, also say hello.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
By the way, what you told the chatroom, all that sucking that they can do, join in.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They were, every single one of them was yelling at me after the mistake of not having your mic on for a little bit.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Alright, anyway, let's go over to the Skype line where, believe it or not, he is here this week.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I didn't think he'd be here tonight, but he is. He persevered. Here he is.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Say hello, everybody, to Techmaster Loki.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He just doesn't want to come out. I don't know. He likes it in there.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, you better be careful, Loki. I didn't want to come out until I was about 20 years old.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, just saying.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How you doing, Loki?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tired.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Tired, I bet.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, what's going on? We have a baby delay, so it's no longer going to be Martin Luther King Jr. Day baby.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's going to be Tuesday baby, right?

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, we, Josh caught a cold on Thursday or Friday, and so we're just giving him an extra day to not be sick so that the baby's not sick.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Makes sense. Makes sense. Completely understandable. Makes fair.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That was like, I just totally did that thing from Mean Girls where the guy goes, gruel.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I meant to say great, and I thought cool, and it came out as gruel.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I did that whole sounds fair and makes sense. It makes fair. It makes fair.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm broken tonight. You know what I blame? Dark Sakura comes back to the show tonight.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't blame me.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You know, she was off last week. No, I'm going to blame you for this.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And she brings with her, what does she bring? She brings a flask because that's how she rolls.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And in that flask, she's like, I made my own liquor. Check that out.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To elaborate, I have this hobby lately that's infusing vodkas with different flavors.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And what a hobby.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And I did.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You know, some people crochet. I do that too.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm totally into hooking.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You've seen what I've made. Anyway.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You should totally infuse vodka with the flavor of vodka. You can call it yo dog.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's a good one. That's a good one. No.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I did two batches. One was infusing a dark chocolate bar, and the other one was infusing coffee.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right. Because you know me and coffee.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I finally ended up mixing the two together, and it's so good.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It is pretty good. It's like mochas.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It is. It's mocha vodka. And I only use potato vodka because I hate grain vodka.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It just tastes not like vodka to me, you know? So I use potato vodka.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And also with the extra filtering, it comes out a little bit higher grade than when it started.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Right.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I brought a flask over to share with some of my favorite dudes.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, always drink responsibly, kids. It's very important.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Unless you're me, you put it in your coffee, and then you drive for the show.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
An hour later, an hour later.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Here with us tonight, who is drinking Mountain Dew Code Red,

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
because he's got to drive back to San Francisco a little later on.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So that's his hard course he's going to get tonight.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Have to drive back to San Francisco on about two to three hours of sleep.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Did they win that game? Alan told me they were winning that game.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Broncos won. I haven't revisited 49ers game yet.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So as much as I don't really always bring up sports ball on the show,

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and to be fair, I don't like to talk about award shows either,

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
because every single one of them gets in the way on Sunday nights.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Not that you're scorned or anything.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If they won the game, we may have to get out the inflatable bed.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ooh. Yeah, I may not be able to make it back over that bridge back into San Francisco tonight.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
They may have actually burned it down, Jason. You might be.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will be checking the news legitimately before I go back tonight,

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
because if we win, we riot. If we lose, we riot.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, you know, something's going down tonight.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I do have a spare bed. Just saying.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Wait, wait, wait. You're talking the Raiders or the Niners?

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Niners. Raiders didn't make playoffs. This is a playoff championship.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, they'll still riot anyways. You know, they'll riot by proxy.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Loki, there doesn't need to be a contingency plan, because the Raiders never win anything.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We all understand that.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I understand that, but, you know, they want to get in on the rioting.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Not to mention I don't technically drive into Oakland, so I just skirt the danger zone.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You just clip by. You just clip by.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All right, Alan says right now it's 20 to 17 Seattle.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It is 20 to 17 Seahawks. Ten minutes to go in the fourth.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He might get a losing riot. You're right, that would actually be worse,

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
because a winning riot, people still have to save their energy for Super Bowl Sunday,

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
but a losing riot, they're going to get it all out tonight.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You know what kind of riot I'm having? A laugh riot.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Cough riot, actually.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You know, if only a certain game company would just let all their assets ride on the Seahawks.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're doing okay.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Look, look, look. Bonds006 in the chat says,

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The reason I am here is to avoid football. All right, look, I understand.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Except for Tecmo Super Bowl. That's the one exception we grant.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, Tecmo Super Bowl. Super High Impact would be an exception as well.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
NFL Blitz.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, NFL Blitz is acceptable too. All that would be just fine.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So, getting things back on course, if her voice drops anymore,

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
she's going to be rivaling my job all of a sudden.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I know, right? She'll have to do the intro.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're listening to Orange On's radio.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Too bad I just did that intro for Hoard House a week ago.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You would have been perfect for that. Oh well.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anyway.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Except a week ago I had no voice.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought you said you liked mine.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I do, I do. But you do all the intros.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't have a problem with that. You used to do all the intros.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
To register participation for Orange On's radio.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Wait, wait, don't throw them off. I should plug that real quick while I have a chance.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Then we'll get into our kickoff topic.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But, you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And that's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, which is another great show about gaming here on the network.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And lots of great geek programming throughout the week at vognetwork.com.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But one thing that makes us kind of unique is that you can actually check into the shows.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So if you're actually listening live tonight, head over to vognetwork.com.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You can actually click the little link, check in, you get five VoG points for checking into the site.

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But if you are listening in the podcast, you still get a chance to get those points.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because somewhere during the show, we're going to have a little, you'll hear a little noise.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It goes doo doo doo doo doo doo. And then it says to register participation, you get a keyword.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So you take that word, you go put it in the front page of vognetwork.com and it's just like you were listening live.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So for example, what if the keyword was vagina?

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, if the keyword was vagina.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You would type in vagina on the check-in site.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, that's exactly how it works.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But it's never anything as sexy as vagina.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It isn't.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We did have ball last week.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We did have ball one week. Yes, we did.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Which we can say now because if you use that word now, it ain't going to do shit.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It has indeed expired.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I just want to know the day we get dongle because I want to record that shit.

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay, but here's the good news. Here's the good news.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you check into the shows, whether it be live, whether it be on tape or whatever it is,

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
if you check into the shows, then you are eligible for the raffle.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Now, it's an opt-in raffle.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're not automatically entered because we don't believe in, unlike Google, we don't automatically opt people into things.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You have to elect.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes, so if you go to vognetwork.com, you can actually enter the raffle.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This month, we're actually giving away a three-month subscription to either Netflix Instant Streaming or Hulu Plus.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What a great little way to enhance your game console by catching up on whatever TV show you want to watch.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can watch Scandal on Hulu Plus, you can watch Doctor Who on Netflix, whatever you want to do.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Orange is the New Black or any other myriad of entertaining original shows.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You choose, but it's got to be one of the two.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Last month, things got crazy because we gave away a gift card and everybody was like,

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
well, can we get a gift card for Google Play?

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, okay, look.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I want a gift card for Macy's.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Maybe next month. Here's the catch.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sadly, it's U.S. residents only and I'm very sorry to the folks overseas.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We're not purposely trying to screw you guys.

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The problem is that we're not allowed to buy here in the U.S. the codes for you guys overseas.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's ridiculous, but it is what it is.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Hopefully, in future months, we will have more inclusive raffles.

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Last month, I think we tried to do one all-inclusive.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I am not making the moon noise from Sherlock.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So I can't get a three-month subscription for like browsers or something like that?

180
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, you get Netflix or you get Hulu Plus.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You get A or B.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But the other good news is that you might be like, I already have both of them or I already have one.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You can actually use the code to just...

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's on us for three months.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It'll be on us for three months. That'll be really cool.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So that's one less thing out of your pocket.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can use the money to buy, I don't know, like a $20 download game or something.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Here you go.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And if you don't win the raffle, you lose!

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You get nothing! Good day, sir!

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
No, you get loot at vognetwork.com.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And what does the loot do?

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It increases your EP.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What does the loot say?

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
One little bit.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Shut up.

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Nothing. It's loot.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's move on.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We got to get into tonight's kickoff topic because some people are here wanting to hear...

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Bonz006 tuned in because he wanted to hear video game chat.

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He didn't want to hear football.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He didn't want to hear me talking about Netflix and Hulu Plus.

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Live.vognetwork.com where you can have a voice as we talk about video games.

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Jamie going to start us off tonight with quite the whopper of a story that's making its way around the internet tonight.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, and there is talk about the particular situation that Nintendo is in.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Especially in regards to their big leading console, the Wii U.

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And it seems that the Wii U has underperformed by how they had anticipated it would.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And they have cut their sales forecast by about 70%.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Is it a flop?

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Some say yeah.

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Nintendo doesn't think so.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They're not going to say, oh no, we flopped.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Nintendo is fine and making money.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We've even said they have pulled up with the 3DS.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
They're still holding treading water.

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So Nintendo has not flopped.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But what about the system?

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Also, and very important to say, I'm so glad you bring that up.

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because one of the particular articles that was going around, because it was right on the front page of Yahoo and so forth.

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think the site was TechCrunch or something said.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The headline was Nintendo admits Wii U has flopped.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They said nothing of the sort.

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, TechCrunch did, but Nintendo said nothing of the sort.

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I take a big issue with that.

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You can't sugar coat these sales numbers, that's not what I'm trying to do.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Has the Wii U flopped from an opinion perspective?

228
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's not doing as well as it should be, that's for darn sure.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But to say that Nintendo said it flopped?

230
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Nintendo is a stubborn motherfucker.

232
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They are not going to admit that their system flopped.

233
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They're going to spin these numbers.

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They're going to talk about new strategy.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
They're going to do whatever they can.

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Can you imagine Reggie Fils-Aime getting out there and saying, well, we flopped.

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No, it's not going to happen.

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That we fucked up.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Sorry guys, we fucked up.

240
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, it's not going to happen at all.

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Sound the click whore alarm.

242
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I would like to disagree with Alan saying the Wii U is the new Saturn.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because Saturn was a lot fucking cooler.

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Just saying.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I got something to say as well about everybody that's saying,

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Welp, it's time for Nintendo to jump ship and make a Mario game on mobile phone.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Nope.

248
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Or Nintendo is going the way of Sega.

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Nope.

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It took Sega a good three consoles before they were finally throwing the towel.

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
One is not going to ruin Nintendo.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh yeah?

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Iwata is saying that they are looking into smart devices to grow, as he says, the game player business.

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
His quote is, it's not as simple as enabling Mario to move on a smart phone.

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Of course, Microsoft and Sony already did look into the game player business.

256
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Because they both have second screen and that's the big hoopla this year.

257
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Tablet and phone second screen to the console.

258
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Honestly, in my opinion, Nintendo's biggest problem right now is they just need to get out of their bunker that they're in.

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I mean, that bunker served them very well in the era of the Wii, but it's not working out so well.

260
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I think back to the story on Eurogamer, whether you want to take it or leave it, about the development of the Wii U.

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Where the executive said, oh we've never tried Xbox Live. Really?

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Nothing served Nintendo well with the Wii except for Circumstance.

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Nintendo did not make the Wii a good console.

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Honestly. Like, am I wrong in saying that the Wii was not exactly like you think of your favorite gaming console?

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
With the one single exception of a unique control method, the Wii was not exactly outstanding when it came out.

266
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I got really bored with my Wii after a week.

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Performance, titles, and everything else.

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, no, because Super Mario Galaxy would like to say hello.

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It was not a launch title.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, it wasn't a launch title.

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It was two years into the system.

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes.

273
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Zelda was.

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And it was something that buoyed up the system all those years later.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But, I think I've made this point a couple of times on the show.

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Wii Fit, Jason. Wii Fit.

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll do, I'll, no, no, no, I completely agree with that, but I know I've made this point a number of times.

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The Wii was not a successful gaming device. It was not.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It was a exciting entertainment device.

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It was what you lend to your in-laws so they can play bowling.

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I, I, I kind of can't with, I can't with that comment, Jason, because it is the highest selling system of all time period.

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That is a fact you cannot dispute.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Because, because people that have never bought any other console now had a reason to do so.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Which is where the bunker served Nintendo well.

285
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No. No, that was circumstance. That was not, like, Nintendo, Nintendo makes fun, easy, accessible games.

286
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That is the truth of them in their entire history.

287
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Going back to card games and everything else, pre, pre-digital games.

288
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The Wii was not designed to find the success that it did.

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's just that Wii Sports using their mantra in style was exciting and benefited so many people because of,

290
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
you grab a remote, you push a button, you figure out how to play and you go to it.

291
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Wii Sports, especially considering that Wii Sports was the top selling game of all time, was never sold.

292
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That is the very definition of a system seller, but not to the regular purchasers of consoles.

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Like, my, my, my biggest problem, tablets for all of their excitement are not exactly the things that, that people go to because they're tablets.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They go for them because they're low maintenance and you just open it up, press a button and start tapping on the screen.

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
People don't give a shit that the Wii U has a, has a, has a gamepad. It's worthless.

296
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The Wii found attraction, not gaming. That's why it took off.

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And if they're going to map, if they're going to chart their course, their outlook for the Wii U based off the Wii,

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
they're going to fail miserably and that's where we are.

299
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But I feel like you're trying to say that we did not have great gaming experiences on it.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, of course it did.

301
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It did, yeah.

302
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And it was unable to do so because of the runaway response it got at the start of the generation.

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But Zelda was a launch title.

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If, if I may interject.

305
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, sure.

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There, there is something to say though for both Microsoft and Sony biting off the concept of the Wii.

307
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
LOL move.

308
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah, with the move, which was I guess okay.

309
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The move wasn't that bad, honestly. I think it worked a lot better than the Wii and Wii remote did.

310
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Which technically I would say bolsters my argument a little bit more.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Sony tried the same thing and they never reached critical acclaim with it because they had nothing to attract people to use it.

312
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Because Sony didn't know how to make a game for it.

313
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And the Kinect I think is more of an expansion of the same thing.

314
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's like how, you know, people sort of reversed the, uh, the Wiimote to do like the head tracking devices and similar things.

315
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I think that sort of, you know, and Microsoft I think has had a history of being good at taking an okay idea that's out there.

316
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And turning it around into something that's been a little bit better.

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Um, so they did what they do best.

318
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They, they bit and made it better.

319
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Um, as honestly as what I think the Kinect in its true essence is.

320
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's sort of a reverse Wiimote where you're bringing the events of the outside world in instead of just affecting what's on the inside world.

321
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Absolutely.

322
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know. So far the, like, Kinect enabled games that are coming out at launch for the Xbox One.

323
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So far the only ones that are actually any good were Just Dance and, you know, the exercise stuff that's on Xbox Fitness.

324
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So once again they're stuck in that rut where those are the only games that end up working out for the Kinect.

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's just basically a big old gimmick again.

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Which coincidentally were the best games on the Kinect for the 360 as well.

327
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And I also think that the selling point of the Wii is watching Rob play Just Dance Abba.

328
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay. Our chat room is blowing up as you can imagine over at live.vognetwork.com.

329
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I've got to get some of these other voices out there with some of the feedback.

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
WhatupG says Nintendo went after a different audience with Wii.

331
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Agree with that for sure.

332
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Alan Alchemy says as awful as mandatory Kinect. Jason's shaking his head over there.

333
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Alan Alchemy says as awful as mandatory Kinect is and Microsoft refusing to let it go, I must commend them for working hard on making the technology be something gamers want.

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Not that they're doing a good job.

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Sony put out the move as an obvious the Wii but hardcore accessory and then immediately forgot about it.

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's see.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
WhatupG says Zelda on Wii was made for GameCube and Tech 2030 follows it up saying I feel like Zelda was a tacked on launch title.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The game was much better on the GameCube.

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah it was totally a GameCube port.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Sorry Logi.

341
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Rama says the Wii was a successful console with one hell of a gimmick that Microsoft and Sony jumped on.

342
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Akuma JP says I'm sorry but I have to say this since I never interested in the Wii, I was born with a Wii and I still use it.

343
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh I see what you did there. It's still that damn name isn't it?

344
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's still that damn name.

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Anyhow sorry Logi go ahead and get your thought out.

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh I was going to say even though I still don't think people want the Kinect.

347
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
To be honest I think a lot of people just don't give a shit about it.

348
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And at least Sony kind of tried something with the move.

349
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They supported it with a lot of their first person shooters and stuff.

350
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The only way that they supported Kinect with anything that Microsoft did was voice commands for Halo or something like that.

351
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Or crappy head tracking of Forza.

352
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It just doesn't work.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That being said I've been very very polite about the fact that this article came out.

354
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I know it's very easy for me to make all sorts of jokes.

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But honestly it's not that big of a surprise that their sales numbers are down.

356
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Because one there's just no games coming out for the system.

357
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I mean yeah there are some first party games but third parties have pretty much jumped ship for the system.

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And it's not getting any better in 2014 I can tell you that much.

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So it's going to be a big struggle for them to regain some of that console market.

360
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
My opinion was I say they just stick with the handhelds because they're rocking on the 3DS.

361
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I mean there's tons of stuff coming out there and that's a great platform.

362
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And hey why not play both fields. You can have the first party and third party.

363
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'd love to see some Mario games come to other platforms.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think that would be pretty cool.

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Just a couple more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetware.com.

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Bonds006 says we got the big numbers because it was sold to people who were not regular system buyers.

367
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I agree with that.

368
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
100% that is my only point.

369
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And the very first comment you read about Nintendo targeting a different audience for the Wii is 100% incorrect.

370
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But Jason the only problem with that idea that it was only sold to people that didn't buy consoles in the first place is that their software tie ratio.

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because that was going to be my argument.

372
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's like well only people bought it for Wii Sports or something.

373
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Their software tie ratio was not that different than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for example.

374
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The Wii software tie ratio kind of globally was 9% or I guess 9.05 maybe not 9%.

375
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So 9 games per system were sold on average versus the Xbox 360 which is 10 and 3 quarters.

376
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And the PlayStation 3 was about 9 and 3 quarters.

377
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So it's not that different.

378
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Let me shift gears here a little bit because it's only a 3 hour show and we could have this debate all night.

379
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But I want to get this story out because I had a little bit of a moment of clarity today.

380
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Because I think when a lot of people talk about oh Nintendo should go mobile, Nintendo should go online.

381
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I think there's a lot of people thinking oh Nintendo should copy Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and have something that robust.

382
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Or Nintendo should put Mario on the iPhone and so forth.

383
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think that's where people's heads go.

384
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But I don't think that's necessarily true.

385
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And you know especially tonight I'm usually the one that will defend Nintendo in these situations and so forth.

386
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Because I do still I think it says a lot that yes Nintendo only put out a handful of games last year for the Wii U.

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But at least one of them showed up on every single person's top 10 list and usually it was multiple games that showed up there.

388
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So you can't deny Nintendo makes the games that hardcore gamers and soccer moms alike want to play.

389
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So that's you know something big.

390
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But they need to get out of this bubble is the biggest problem.

391
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And here's the moment of clarity I had today.

392
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's not necessarily that they need to copy Xbox Live.

393
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's not that they need to copy mobile phones.

394
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Here's an example where Nintendo not going online and going mobile phones I think did them bad.

395
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And it's not the obvious thing but these are the types of things that Nintendo has to do.

396
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Okay out with it already.

397
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I spent $60 on a new device today.

398
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
And it's a very hip little thing and a lot of people have them.

399
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
And it's kind of the craze right now.

400
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And when I bought it there was a part of me that said I feel like I've bought one of these before.

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Like I feel like I've had something like this before that's supposed to do the exact same thing but yet here I am buying it again.

402
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What is it Jason?

403
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I have three of these in my pockets on me right now.

404
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I have a different model. I have a Fitbit.

405
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The new iPhone 5S has a motion coprocessor so it can act as a pedometer as well with the appropriate software.

406
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And our 3DS's.

407
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Right so okay.

408
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Pedometers.

409
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Exactly they're all pedometers but here's the thing in particular about Fitbit.

410
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And even before the 3DS integrated that whole thing as well which is another great example where Nintendo could have had this.

411
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
They could have bottled it and they didn't and that's where they failed.

412
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's a little too large but make your point.

413
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay remember back on the Game Boy Advance.

414
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They sold this game and it was called something like Everybody Walks or something like that.

415
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It was on the Game Boy.

416
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
No it might have been the regular DS.

417
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It was either the Advance or the DS.

418
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I apologize I can't remember which off the top of my head because there wasn't exactly really a game there.

419
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
All it was was a little pedometer that you carried around.

420
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It was the DS.

421
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It was the DS thank you.

422
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It was a little pedometer that you carried around in your pocket.

423
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And at the end of the day you turn on this game and transmit the data from the pedometer into the little system.

424
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And you can track the number of steps you took in a day.

425
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And the game is looking at this little chart.

426
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You could connect online to see how much has America walked to the moon.

427
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oooh ahh.

428
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay.

429
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
It's like Noby Noby Boy but with an actual return.

430
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It was this thing that was like in and out in like a couple months.

431
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But this all came at the height of Wii Fit Mania.

432
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
This was, everybody was crazy about Wii Fit.

433
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
And this was kind of like, this was Nintendo's attempt to bottle some of that on the DS.

434
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Was to put out this everybody walks game.

435
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
My point is, Nintendo was sitting on Fitbit.

436
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
They could have had this.

437
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
If they would embrace online.

438
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
If they would embrace smart phones.

439
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Because where did Fitbit succeed?

440
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Fitbit tapped into Facebook.

441
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
It turned it into a game.

442
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
It turned it into something you want to motivate your friends to do.

443
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It was more of a robust experience.

444
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Where you have this website where you track your calories and get plans.

445
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If Nintendo would get out of their bunker and open up their eyes to online and the things you could do.

446
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
They could have made everybody walks Fitbit.

447
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's my point.

448
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Was everybody walks third party?

449
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I don't believe so.

450
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Somebody can feel, can correct me.

451
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You're getting two games confused.

452
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
There was one that was actually a fitness game that was, or fitness application that was on the DS.

453
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
That was by Nintendo.

454
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Then there was this really shitty game that came out from Konami that was on the Wii.

455
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Where you walked in place.

456
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I am not talking about the Konami game.

457
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I am talking about the advanced game.

458
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Do you remember what the name of that was?

459
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I can look it up. I don't remember.

460
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Nintendo Personal Trainer Walking.

461
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Thank you.

462
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Personal Trainer Walking or whatever it was.

463
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You guys got the point of what I was talking about.

464
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Now the 3DS, they liked this idea so much they built it into the 3DS.

465
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I didn't know that on the original DS it actually came with an accessory to track that.

466
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I had no idea.

467
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
See?

468
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And the 3DS has this built in.

469
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But can you go, why do you carry the 3DS in your pocket?

470
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You get coins because you want to get higher kiddies and find me, right?

471
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Which is okay.

472
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's a little bit of innovation.

473
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
But it's still within the Nintendo bubble.

474
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Online leaderboards, motivation, cheering people on that can be pushed to people's 3DSs.

475
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Just like it is with the Fitbit and the iPhone.

476
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Nintendo could have that.

477
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
They don't.

478
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Now that the 3DS actually has the Nintendo network and that's a little bit more flexible.

479
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The horizon is broadening.

480
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Nintendo seems more cooperative than competitive though.

481
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Wow.

482
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
You know what would be even better with Fitbit?

483
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Is if you could mine Bitcoins by exercise.

484
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
People have probably hacked the Fitbit to do that so I wouldn't put that out of the question.

485
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
But anyway, I guess that was kind of the point I was trying to make.

486
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Is that this isn't necessarily about Nintendo has to put Mario on the iPhone.

487
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
But this is about Nintendo needs to be more aware with how they can work with some of these other technologies that are already out there.

488
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I don't know if somebody wants, maybe somebody wants to refute my point which is fine.

489
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Or add to something similar.

490
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't know, Jason?

491
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I, obviously they attempted to do so.

492
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I keep glancing around Jamie's head and I'm staring at the lovely little Wii U gamepad chilling on your setup over there.

493
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They obviously tried to.

494
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh, tablets are the next big thing.

495
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Let's give you a 4 inch screen that you can do, to their credit, very interesting things on.

496
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You have been playing, my recollection of it is that you have been playing NES Remix purely on the gamepad.

497
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And you had to switch it back to the TV only for the fact of me being able to actually see it.

498
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
They're doing interesting things.

499
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
All of them, no, not even by a long shot.

500
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But they're doing interesting things, they have new technology, they are working on improving it.

501
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
The 3DS was improved to the point that it can access a reasonably modern network service.

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You know, something new was backported to an old system.

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
They try.

504
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Do they miss the mark?

505
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Yes.

506
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Is that rooted in Japanese culture versus American culture?

507
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I want to say yes, but I don't actually know, so maybe I shouldn't say that.

508
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:24,000
But it's, it's not necessarily just a straight up gold mine because people have to know about it and understand it and be willing to make the investment to do it.

509
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I really, I really feel, I don't mean to bring the conversation back to me, but I really feel that my point still applies.

510
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Nintendo has been doing the same thing all along.

511
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They just had a nearly viral runaway hit, and they're trying to continue that forward, but it doesn't work that way.

512
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I want to point out, before we get the email saying, Rob, you forgot to talk about XYZ because I'm getting messages in chat and so forth,

513
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
is that Wii Fit U actually does have this pedometer thing with it as well, and it's the big thing where you can actually go in and do that.

514
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I kind of think they're doing...

515
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You mean syncing a 3DS to a Wii U and...

516
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
No, there's actually a little Wii Fit U pedometer.

517
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Yet another accessory.

518
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That's the whole little thing, is that now Nintendo's, excuse me, but I feel Nintendo is trying to copy something they should have had in the first place.

519
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I feel like Nintendo's trying to copy the whole Fitbit thing, although that should have been theirs to own in the first place.

520
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
But I kind of feel like, A, they're not doing a very good job selling it that way because I plain forgot until you guys started sending me messages about it,

521
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
which says a lot that I do a gaming enthusiast show, and I didn't, I totally forgot that that thing came with a pedometer.

522
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And B, I bet 10 to 1, the online experience with your Wii Fit U pedometer ain't anything like it is on Fitbit.

523
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Not to mention the fact that you have to boot up a console and boot up a game to be able to do anything with it, where the Fitbit phone plus computer just happens.

524
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Bingo. What was the first big problem with Wii U as a whole that they had to fix? It was too fucking slow.

525
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And has that actually changed?

526
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Well, it's not as fast as it should be, but to be fair, PlayStation 4 isn't instant either, but it's a lot quicker.

527
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
This is the same argument that we had with the handoff with Bobby about Netflix and Hulu versus On Demand in cable boxes.

528
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The interface and the implementation are just completely different and serve the same goal in two very different ways.

529
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
One of them is terrible, some people put up with it anyways, one of them, in our opinion, is not.

530
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
More comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Akuma JP says,

531
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Sky, big companies don't usually innovate. It's not that they didn't think about it, but it is the way big companies work.

532
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I have to tell you also, my friend, I have a friend that works in Nagoya, who was actually just complaining on Facebook today,

533
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:46,000
that as much as companies need to innovate to grow, she's really disillusioned by the stagnant corporate cultures in Japan.

534
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That there is such an adverse, this is what I'm trying to think of, that generally change is looked upon as dangerous and will damage the business,

535
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:09,000
when we've seen in practice that more companies that innovate tend to either be highly successful or suffer really badly for it.

536
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's that level of risk.

537
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
This is actually a very complimentary point. You cannot trust something new to maintain the level.

538
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Companies have to grow. If they want more, if they want to do more, they have to grow.

539
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
They have to get more money, hire more staff, make more investments.

540
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And a big company cannot rest on redoing everything.

541
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So big companies cannot make these landslide changes to say,

542
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
well, we're done with this product because it's completely tapped out, let's come up with a new one.

543
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's not necessarily going to be successful. And then you're going to have to shutter 80% of your workforce and start all over again.

544
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But great things in gaming do come from risks. I mean, let's look at Guitar Hero.

545
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Tell that to Halo 4.

546
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Well, here's the thing. With Guitar Hero, obviously part of our big history as music gamers, Konami should have had Guitar Hero.

547
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Konami was sitting on Guitar Hero. They didn't want to take the risk to put out in the US and get the license that they needed to make it successful.

548
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
For the last six years, they've still barely done anything.

549
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
They literally have made their game look better.

550
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Discounting Rock Revolution, as far as Guitar Freaks itself, they've had six years to do something with it.

551
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And as far as I've been able to tell, they literally haven't.

552
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Activision ruined music games for a good long while.

553
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Activision pooped in the pool, and so it's going to take a while before music games.

554
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Like, where's Disney Fantasia evolved?

555
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Harmonix is waiting on it a little longer. It'll be out later this year when it can be distanced a little more from all the other music games.

556
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Because Harmonix does make good stuff.

557
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Well, it seems to me that this is a danger in letting a company get too big.

558
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And having them become these all-encompassing giants where it stops being about the consumer market and becomes more about the bottom line.

559
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So that's why I think it goes back to why we're seeing a bigger surge in independent developers that are making the games that people actually want to play.

560
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,000
You know, instead of, yeah, maybe they want to pool in enough revenue so that they can make the next big game or stay ahead of water or, you know, pay their bills.

561
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But when it becomes all about greed, then I think that it's time to cut them in half.

562
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I do want to get to our chat room for just a couple more comments.

563
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
And I do want to try to wrap this conversation up because, again, we can spend all three hours on this point.

564
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I do invite, I know some of you are very passionate on this topic. Maybe you disagree with what we're saying and you want to send feedback.

565
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Please do. It is the show where every gamer has a voice. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

566
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I want to also get into a few chat comments here because there's one in particular I really want to respond to.

567
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh, here it is. Tiger Claw on chat says, Rob, what if Nintendo were to put out an app on the iPhone and Android that allows you to access the Miiverse like you do on your desktop browser?

568
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Exists.

569
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, it's coming. The Miiverse app, so to speak, is being made.

570
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Miiverse is accessible on the web.

571
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It is accessible on the web and it does have a mobile-friendly site, so you can bring it up in the mobile phone.

572
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's not all of the features of Miiverse by far, like the ability of the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, two. I bought this. Start downloading remotely.

573
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Here's the thing. Miiverse ain't going to fucking fix Nintendo. We need to get, I mean, Miiverse does do some neat things. It's neat.

574
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,000
But it's not like, you know, I don't think that's the answer to Nintendo's problems.

575
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Here's the iPhone-Android app Nintendo should make. I'm going to throw a crazy idea out there. Take it or leave it.

576
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What's Nintendo big on? Nintendo's big on, you know, they resist online play because they want everybody to be in the same room and do the parties in the room and do, you know, playing with your friends in the same place.

577
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Mario Party epitomized.

578
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Something like that. I think Nintendo should do an app that helps you organize Nintendo parties, which could include maybe unlock things that work in the Wii U games or, you know, some type of interaction there to make people really want to download it and check it out.

579
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But the real true functionality of the app is to like, oh, let me pull up my Facebook friends list and I'm going to have a Mario Party, Mario Kart 8 party on Friday at 8 o'clock and I want to invite these friends and it's going to send them a reminder, don't forget to bring your gamepad and all this stuff.

580
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Like, you know, you guys might think I'm crazy or whatever, but that, I kind of think that's the thing where Nintendo needs to go is new ideas that interact with the technology that's out there, not just Miiverse on your fucking phone.

581
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That invitation could include pictures of penises.

582
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I was going to say two words. Pictochat pedophiles. Pictochat predators.

583
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I agree with you.

584
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Okay, but as my mobile phone as it is, Jason, I could open up my pants right now, take a picture of my penis and send it to you. I don't need an app to do that.

585
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:03,000
People don't care. And that's not the point. The point is that something that is largely targeted towards kids or families that have kids is unfortunately a common factor of attack.

586
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I think if Snapchat can exist, Nintendo Party Planner can exist.

587
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Parents don't open up Snapchat and give it to their kids.

588
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,000
No, I think that's the problem right there. Is this console, once again, remember with the Wii and, well, I don't know so much the Wii but like the GameCube.

589
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:25,000
At some point they decided, hey, you know what, we're getting the stigma of being like only a kid's console and that's it.

590
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
We need to really broaden out and have some more hardcore games and stuff like that to get people interested.

591
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
And that's what they promised, I think, with the Wii that ended up not happening. The Wii U.

592
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And I just don't see that. And that's the problem. There's still a stigma that this is a very kid-safe console.

593
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And they keep promoting that. But let's be honest. There's people that are dicks everywhere.

594
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And honestly, it comes with the territory that when you're playing online games with people, they're gonna be dicks.

595
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And guess what? Those dicks are kids.

596
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Couple more comments here. Rama in chat says, what will fix the Wii U's sales? Decent fucking video games.

597
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Mario 3D World would like to say hello. As would Zelda Twilight Princess HD. As would Pikmin 3.

598
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
That's awesome that they have first-party games. Where are the third-party games?

599
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's the problem with that comment. Nintendo doesn't need decent fucking video games. They have amazing fucking video games.

600
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:30,000
They need more fucking video games. That's the real problem. They gotta figure out how to get those third parties back.

601
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And I really don't know what that is. I sorta think the online thing did a min.

602
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I really truly think EA jumped ship because Wii U could not whore online the way they needed it to be hoarded.

603
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I think that's 100% what it boils down to. Give me my tinfoil hat, please.

604
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Numerous new titles that didn't have DLC on the Wii.

605
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well, that and I think that they switched over to running their games all pretty much on the same engine and that engine just doesn't run on the Wii U.

606
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I mean, I think there's more politics involved with it, but it's not just EA that's not putting games on that system.

607
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
There's plenty of other publishers who are just like, eh, nah.

608
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:19,000
EA is still putting out pop-cap games like Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare on the Xbox 360. There's no reason that can't be on Wii U.

609
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Kegel 2 is on Xbox One, guys!

610
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
There's no reason that can't be on Wii U.

611
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Can Battlefield 4 be on Wii U? No, but is EA withholding things intentionally from Wii U? Yes.

612
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Alright, I think that's about it for now. We could go on and on with this forever.

613
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But I'm sure you guys have feedback.

614
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. This is a very contentious topic.

615
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Quickly, before we get into our gaming ways and the types of things that we've been playing, let's go around the table real quick.

616
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,000
What do you think, quickly, Nintendo can do to turn these numbers around?

617
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Because even the most hardcore Nintendo fanboy, it's really hard to sugarcoat what's happening with the Wii U.

618
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So, what do you think Nintendo can do to, I don't necessarily want to say to make Wii U's, but what can Nintendo do to have a more favorable report next year?

619
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I don't know. I really don't know. I can't see them doing anything new. So, I really don't have an idea.

620
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Jason?

621
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Don't gauge Wii U expectations based off the Wii.

622
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Loki?

623
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
They're going to need to drop the price of that big time. Big time.

624
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Because they just don't have the games to support it right now, so they can't promise more.

625
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Like, for example, I looked at, you know, the IGN ran a thing, I think it was IGN, that had like, you know, the games of 2014.

626
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And I gotta say, 90% of those games are TBA date games. Like, okay, Bayonetta 2, that should come out this year.

627
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Does it have a date yet? Nope. Does that mean it's going to come out this year?

628
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I hate to sound fanboy, but I honestly think this is the only way to save the Wii U, and I really think this is a cliche thing to say, but I really do think it's the answer.

629
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Nintendo needs to drop the price of the Wii U to $149, and the way they're going to do it is they're going to cut the tablet.

630
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The tablet is now an accessory and not a mandatory device. You don't need that tablet to play Mario 3D World, which is still a great gaming experience.

631
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And a lot of people I talk to do.

632
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I still think that, I'm the exception, unfortunately, and these numbers prove it.

633
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I can agree with that.

634
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
So, I mean, it would be great that the tablet is optional for those that want it. I think Nintendo should still push a bundle that has it all included.

635
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But they're going to, if they want to save the Wii U in particular, they're going to need to cut the tablet and really emphasize the, you know, $149 to really get these things moving.

636
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Throw in Mario 3D World if you have to for free. I know that might be a huge hit for Nintendo, but they don't have a lot of options right now.

637
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:14,000
And the console could still flourish via Mario Kart 8, via Bayonetta 2, via Super Smash Brothers, via New Zelda.

638
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,000
All these games, I kind of have a feeling, aren't going to need the tablet that much either, and will still work.

639
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Let the 3DS be a second screen if need be, you know, or whatever it takes.

640
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Here's the thing too, also with that, like you mentioned Smash Brothers, that's another problem with them too, is these games that are coming out, they're not necessarily just on the Wii U.

641
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Like Smash Brothers, I don't need to buy a Wii U to have that game, I could get a 3DS.

642
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And I don't think that's helping.

643
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Yeah, Jason, final thought on this.

644
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm still going to buy a Wii U this year.

645
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I've always meant to. I've always wanted to.

646
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I think it's an important thing to note, despite what you said earlier.

647
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I wasn't, nothing I said was deriding Nintendo. Not a single thing was anti-Nintendo.

648
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
This is how I see what they've done with their console.

649
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I 100% plan on buying a Wii U, money permitting.

650
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
That's the only reason I don't have one already.

651
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I wouldn't say I come from a place of anti-Nintendo either.

652
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Neither of us were.

653
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
But I get fucking frustrated with them sometimes.

654
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I get real fucking frustrated with them sometimes.

655
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'll buy a Wii U.

656
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Rob, to go back to how you were saying there's games that EA could be putting on the Wii U

657
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and one of those being Plants vs. Zombies.

658
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
As I figured, Frost sprite 3 is what it uses.

659
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
That can't run on the Wii U.

660
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That's the same engine that runs Battlefield 4.

661
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But it's on the Xbox 360?

662
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
And it's on the Xbox 360.

663
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Those engines can run on the Xbox 360, same with Ignite.

664
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But they can't run on the Wii U.

665
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
It's so underpowered, it can't run those.

666
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And that's why you're going to see a lot of these games not coming.

667
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It could be that they're totally fine with porting it over,

668
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
but they just don't have an engine that that game can run on

669
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
because it doesn't run on the system.

670
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It's not enough power.

671
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Even though they said that that thing was more powerful than the Xbox 360.

672
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Get my tinfoil hat ready.

673
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Get my tinfoil hat ready because, Loki, I'm going to be honest,

674
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
my reaction to that is that this is coming from EA.

675
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And I'm sure that Frostbite engine won't run on Wii U,

676
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
just like SimCity won't be an offline game.

677
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Done and done.

678
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Very good.

679
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

680
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And we're going to talk about the types of video games

681
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
that we've been playing this week, no matter what engine they use.

682
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

683
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Since I spent most of this week ridiculously sick,

684
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I haven't done a lot of gaming.

685
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I played Animal Crossing, which I even skipped.

686
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I skipped my first day of Animal Crossing, Rob,

687
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
when I was doing nothing but sleeping.

688
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And then I played a little Fractal.

689
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
That's about it.

690
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Oh, and I started Bioshock Infinite.

691
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh, what do you think of the Bioshock Infinite so far?

692
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It's so...

693
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's per day.

694
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, I love the environments.

695
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
It's so great.

696
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeah.

697
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Great little...

698
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm pretty pleased so far.

699
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I just have to play in small increments

700
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
because I get emotion sick.

701
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So that's all I've done, mostly, like I said,

702
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
is just being sick and not, you know,

703
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
having a lot of energy to sit up and play.

704
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
I'm the opposite, because when I'm sick

705
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
is when I get my most gaming done.

706
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, usually if I'm sick, I'm fine to sit up and do stuff.

707
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You know, I'm really a push-through-it kind of person.

708
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But whatever it is that I have, or got over, I should say,

709
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Dan's got it now, has just been exhausting.

710
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'll sit up for a couple hours.

711
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I'll sleep four.

712
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'll be up another couple hours.

713
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I'll sleep another four.

714
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And apparently other people who've had the same thing

715
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
have felt the same way I have.

716
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
You know, I think Victoria and Bobby both have it.

717
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Not Bobby Blackwell.

718
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Other from Bobby.

719
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yeah, Barbara.

720
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah.

721
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
They were Disneyland sick.

722
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
That was...

723
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I hope they don't have an H1N1,

724
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
which they say is that the flu strain

725
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,000
is going around right now.

726
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Is it?

727
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Well, they talk about how they have the flu

728
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and how crappy they feel.

729
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm like, they probably have H1N1.

730
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I didn't know that was going around again.

731
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, oh yeah.

732
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Well, whatever it was that I had,

733
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I mean, well, keep in mind, when I had swine flu,

734
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I only felt mildly sick too.

735
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And sorry I gave it to you.

736
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah, I know, I know.

737
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But I mean, I just, you know,

738
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
didn't really feel much like playing anything.

739
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So I played my few things.

740
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I can understand.

741
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Sleep is good when you're sick.

742
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
All right.

743
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Let's go over...

744
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Sleep is good all the time.

745
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What are you talking about?

746
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Let's go over to Jason.

747
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I want to check in with you again.

748
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Which by the way, Jason,

749
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
even though we promised we wouldn't talk a lot about football,

750
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I think I do owe Jason the PSA of saying that,

751
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
prepare for sad riots tonight because...

752
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
So says Bobby Blackwell.

753
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Let's see what SSG100 Matt said.

754
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
SSG100 Matt says,

755
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
so it's the Seattle Betty Whites versus the Denver Betty Whites

756
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
and the Betty White Bowl in two weeks.

757
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yes.

758
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And what's also very important is that...

759
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Featuring puppies.

760
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
You have...

761
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And lingerie.

762
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
You have the Washington team and the Colorado team.

763
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
The two states that legalized marijuana this season.

764
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Going to the marijuana bowl.

765
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They're going to smoke the Super Bowl.

766
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
They're going to smoke the Super Bowl.

767
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
In New Jersey where they're probably going to cause it to burn down.

768
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I sent a message to my coworker and said,

769
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
let me know if the bridge burns down and I won't be able to make it back in, please.

770
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh, that wouldn't happen in New Jersey because they'd just close it.

771
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So I checked out this game this week that...

772
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's kind of a godsim where you play a single character,

773
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
so maybe not so much a godsim,

774
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
where you're able to make goals at any point in time,

775
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
but then energy level and various other resources can determine

776
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
whether or not you'll actually be able to fulfill those goals.

777
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
This is, by the way, a 100% lie.

778
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Games like this don't exist.

779
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That was just my week.

780
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Oh, yeah, I'm going to work on the video tonight.

781
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Oh, wait, it's 3 a.m. and I'm still at the office socializing with coworkers

782
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
that I don't usually see, oops, Tuesday, same thing.

783
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Wednesday, same thing.

784
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Thursday, same thing.

785
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Needless to say, I literally played nothing this week.

786
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
You don't play anything to pass the time when things get really crazy?

787
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I don't have downtime.

788
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
There were 15 people in from out of town this week,

789
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
plus the fact that things are ramping up like normal,

790
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
like truly everybody's back from holidays and all that kind of stuff,

791
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
and there is enough going on as part of my mission to do as much as possible

792
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
while I'm in the area in Cannes.

793
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm usually literally out with people constantly

794
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
and don't really know what they're doing.

795
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
All right, all right, all I hear are excuses.

796
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm important and busy and I'm having fun.

797
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
No, I killed like eight hours last night finishing off a video and uploading it.

798
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's rather fun.

799
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
All right, all right, they're here to hear about video games.

800
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Maybe Loki won't disappoint them with gaming week chat.

801
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
No, I guess.

802
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So I played a lot of Minecraft this week

803
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
because I've been tweaking stuff on our server

804
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and setting up plug-ins and that kind of thing.

805
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So mainly I've been focusing on some of the Crackshot plug-ins,

806
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
which Crackshot allows you to add guns to Minecraft

807
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
and make some really interesting ones.

808
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
So I've been playing around with those. That's been kind of fun.

809
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And then, let's see, I played a little bit of,

810
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
it was some Flash game.

811
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I should say, not Flash, a Unity game called,

812
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
I want to say it was Catastrophe or something like that.

813
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It's a first-person cat game

814
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
where you're supposed to knock things off shelves onto the floor.

815
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I heard of that. That sounds awesome.

816
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome and the guy has,

817
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
it's kind of like a little demo for that and stuff.

818
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's hilarious because all the graphics,

819
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
it reminds me a lot of Katamari.

820
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
They're very simple like that.

821
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And just the whole premise seems kind of silly

822
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
because that's what my cat does.

823
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
And then I decided,

824
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
today I took Josh to Golfland

825
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
to go play some mini golf and stuff because he's never done that.

826
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And I saw DDR there and of course he wouldn't let me play DDR

827
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
because he got scared of the Terminator gun game that was there.

828
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Because he saw the Terminator on top of it

829
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
and I don't know, he got scared.

830
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So I ended up, right before the show,

831
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I drove down there and decided to play some DDR

832
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
on Max 2 and put in,

833
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
slipped on a card twice because hey,

834
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I thought I was going to play a game of doubles

835
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and you need to do that.

836
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
But then they had the mode where

837
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
it only takes one credit to play two player or doubles.

838
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So I went ahead and did that and I found out it's four songs each.

839
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So I started off like, yeah, I can do this.

840
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I'm going to pick something a little easier

841
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
because I know I'm a little out of shape.

842
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And then in the middle of my fourth song or whatever,

843
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I swear my body was just pulling a Danny Glover saying,

844
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
you're getting too old for this.

845
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'm like, shut up, I'm going to play another set of songs.

846
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
About song three, I'm like, fuck this,

847
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I don't want to play this anymore.

848
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And then so the last one,

849
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
the last song, I was like,

850
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
oh yeah, I'm still going to play the last song.

851
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I was like, I can't do this, my feet won't move.

852
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So I had to hobble back out to my car afterwards.

853
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It's funny though because I was like,

854
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
oh, I totally want to play DDR and after I was done,

855
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I was like, I don't want to play DDR anymore.

856
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But I don't know.

857
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So that was that.

858
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Did the state of the arcade

859
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
lead you to great sadness outside of DDR?

860
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Honestly, the machine is working.

861
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
It's super loud.

862
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I mean, holy crap, it's loud.

863
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I wanted to have Josh try it

864
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and he was afraid of it because it was too loud.

865
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It was just like screaming ear.

866
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
There was a Disney rave there,

867
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
but it's turned off.

868
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So I guess it's broken.

869
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It didn't seem like it was in that bad of shape.

870
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
The pads seem to be working just fine.

871
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's amazing that those games

872
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
still make money all these years later.

873
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Well, they have it marked down.

874
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
It's four songs, three doubles,

875
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
for 50 cents.

876
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Still, I mean, it's a great moneymaker for the arcade.

877
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Those machines have paid for themselves

878
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
five times over by now, I'm sure.

879
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Probably, yeah.

880
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
All right. Well, if that's it for your gaming week,

881
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I will quickly touch on my gaming week,

882
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,000
which I don't actually have a whole lot of new stuff to share,

883
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
just a couple games.

884
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Of course, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV,

885
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
way too much of it,

886
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
and continuing to play some stuff on the PlayStation 4,

887
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
like Don't Starve,

888
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
which I continue to actually play a little bit on the PC this week

889
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
because Loki gifted me that copy some time ago,

890
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
which that version is...

891
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
It's pretty much the same thing on PlayStation 4,

892
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
but I was finding some slightly different stuff in it,

893
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
and it just has the different feel with the controller,

894
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
or with the keyboard,

895
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
as opposed to the controller and mouse and so forth.

896
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
But I will say this,

897
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
because I was a little harsh on Don't Starve last week

898
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
because of the fact that it doesn't have a tutorial mode,

899
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
and it doesn't really give you much...

900
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
It doesn't really tell you, like,

901
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
how to go about playing the game at all,

902
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
which I understand was a design choice,

903
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
but I just get really frustrated with games like that.

904
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But I will say this,

905
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
after kind of figuring it out,

906
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
and watching more YouTubes,

907
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
and reading some FAQs on it and so forth,

908
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I kind of went back now that I understand the game a little more,

909
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and I'm actually having a lot more fun with it,

910
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
now that I kind of understand,

911
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
oh, okay, you gotta gather all this stuff

912
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
so you can try to start to make a little base,

913
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
and this is how you can get your food and so forth.

914
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So it just...

915
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It actually enhanced it a little bit,

916
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
of hand-holding you just a little bit,

917
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
because I think it did make it more fun and exciting,

918
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
although some will disagree with me there, and that's fine,

919
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I just feel like I almost missed out on this game.

920
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
If I hadn't really gone to the PlayStation 4 live channel

921
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
and watched some other people play,

922
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I don't think I would have kept going with it.

923
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
But now I'm glad I did, because I'm enjoying the game.

924
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
One other new game that I checked out this week,

925
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
because I decided to catch up on my Steam backlog a little bit,

926
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
so I bought a game during the sale,

927
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I hadn't checked out, but I decided to check it out this week,

928
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
and that game is Guacamelee,

929
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
which is a game that's...

930
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Melee.

931
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I like Guacamelee, but fine, Guacamelee.

932
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You can...

933
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
This game is kind of like a Super Metroid-esque type of game,

934
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
where you have the exploration and so forth,

935
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
but it has more beat-em-up style mechanics in it,

936
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
like I don't want to say it's like Double Dragon or something like that,

937
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
but I don't exactly remember Samus

938
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
kind of doing combos on people and uppercuts and all this stuff either,

939
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
so it's a very different type of feel, a game, when you're playing it.

940
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
But I gotta say, it's fucking great.

941
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It is a fucking great game.

942
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I am really, really enjoying the game.

943
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Obviously, I love me some Super Metroid,

944
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
but it's not even just that.

945
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I mean, yeah, that's a great skeleton for your game or whatever,

946
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
but I just love doing the combos

947
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and actually being able to throw guys and other guys and all this.

948
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Some of the puzzle mechanics get very interesting, too,

949
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
with the whole light world and the dark world

950
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
and constantly flipping back and forth between the two.

951
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And I love the references, constant funny references,

952
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
to internet memes and other video games.

953
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
They are all over the place, and they're really funny,

954
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
and there's been so many that I've had to go,

955
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
oh, my God, Alan, look at this, look at this.

956
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
This is a riff on the oh, really, yeah, really, owl

957
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
from like ten years ago.

958
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Or a walrus.

959
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
A walrus in his bucket.

960
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
No, I have not seen a walrus in his bucket yet,

961
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
but I wasn't really looking out for it either.

962
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
But I did see the Super Hermanos

963
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
with the red suit and the green suit,

964
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
kind of a riff on that.

965
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And then in one of the backgrounds,

966
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
you can just very faintly see a Mega Man

967
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
cut out in the bricks.

968
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
There's just little references like that.

969
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And they're not shy about it either

970
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
because you get your power-ups from,

971
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I think they call them chorizo statues.

972
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
They call them a different name,

973
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
and it's just really funny.

974
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
But they look like they do in Metroid.

975
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They don't even try.

976
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But I love that. I love it.

977
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
And I know the game is really big

978
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
with speedrunners right now,

979
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and I know it's going to come to PlayStation 4

980
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
at some point, and I'm really excited

981
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
because I love how the game is loud and vibrant,

982
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
the music's great, it's fast-paced,

983
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
and it's a Super Metroid clone on top of all that.

984
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Honest to God, this is a great example

985
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
of why I can't ever, at the end of 2013,

986
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
say, here's the best video games that came out in 2013

987
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
because I just don't have time to play them all,

988
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
because if I had played this before December,

989
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I would have put this in my top ten for sure.

990
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
This says PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Spring this year.

991
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Yes, it is going to come out in some way.

992
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Should you do a music game called Guaka Yooka-Laylee?

993
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
You never know.

994
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
I don't know if there's going to be DLC expansion,

995
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
but supposedly these other versions on PlayStation 4

996
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
and Xbox One are supposed to be expanded.

997
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
So yeah, the game is an awful lot of fun.

998
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I really...

999
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Rageinator, your joke completely fails

1000
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
because Melee is fighting.

1001
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Um, 13 cross forever in our chat says,

1002
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Rob, you should try Mutant Blobs Attack.

1003
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I'll just have to put that on the list.

1004
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Tech2030 says, some intense platforming in that game.

1005
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Let's see.

1006
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
That's actually an L.

1007
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Oh, ActDeft. Ooh, I love this.

1008
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
ActDeft says, if we're saying it in Spanish, Rob is correct.

1009
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Guaka Mealy.

1010
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Melee isn't the...

1011
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Really?

1012
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I will trust what the Mexican listener of OLR says.

1013
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But it's a play on...

1014
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
It's a portmanteau of Guaka Mealy and Melee.

1015
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What is the etymology of Melee?

1016
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
What is that language rooted in?

1017
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I'll find out. I think it's Latin.

1018
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
And Tigerclaw says, of course, since the game is inspired by Mexican culture.

1019
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And I gotta say, it's great.

1020
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Like, I love the environment and the way...

1021
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
It's played off so well.

1022
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Just between the amazing soundtrack and the characters.

1023
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
And the way they taught...

1024
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
And you can see a lot of the inspiration from the culture as well.

1025
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
It's great.

1026
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I mean, it's... Yeah.

1027
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
I know I'm speaking very highly of this game, but it's for good reason.

1028
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It was old French, actually.

1029
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
The word was melee.

1030
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But it was French.

1031
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Also, it does have a co-op mode, apparently.

1032
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Haven't even touched it yet.

1033
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But that just even kind of enhances the game.

1034
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Stream it! Stream it!

1035
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I probably will at some point.

1036
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I was going to, but another program was on when I was playing it.

1037
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
So I didn't want to...

1038
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I don't like to broadcast at the same time as other bog shows.

1039
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Alright.

1040
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I lied. I did play stuff this week.

1041
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
What did you play?

1042
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I don't remember...

1043
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I knew it.

1044
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I don't remember if I covered this when I was talking about the Xbox One last week.

1045
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I was showing a coworker that only has a PS4, the Xbox One.

1046
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I tried playing Forza and some very strange bugs started happening where we played one race and then could literally never play another one.

1047
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Because whenever they pressed start, it would take us back to the main menu screen.

1048
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
And I played a four-person match of FIFA with other coworkers.

1049
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:08,000
And it was fine, if not ridiculously confusing, because the camera cannot adjust for four people that well.

1050
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
But yeah, more Xbox One stuff, being able to introduce more people to it and see their reactions to it.

1051
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
More hilarity with testing out the Kinect and that kind of stuff.

1052
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:29,000
More equivalent frustration when I realized that you cannot create an account on the Xbox One without binding it to a Microsoft account.

1053
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
A Windows Live account, whatever the principle one is nowadays.

1054
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
You cannot have... I assume you can have essentially silver accounts, whatever they're calling it now.

1055
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
But it has to be signed on, authenticated, registered via Microsoft's authentication service.

1056
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Or a guest of another profile that is on the system.

1057
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But no local system accounts.

1058
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
But yeah, just those two.

1059
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Gaming-wise, nothing new. Just a couple rounds with new people.

1060
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Also, being reminded of one other game I did play a little bit this week.

1061
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Code Man just joined our chatroom at live.fognetwork.com saying,

1062
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Rob, someone killed someone in your Minecraft sex dungeon.

1063
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Y'all need to stay the fuck out of my house on Minecraft.

1064
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Can I get an alarm installed in my house? Get out of my house!

1065
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
That'd be a pretty cool mod, actually.

1066
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Unless I consensually invite you into the sex dungeon.

1067
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Stay out!

1068
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You can do that, actually.

1069
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Can I? I'm gonna put a...

1070
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
We have World Guard on there.

1071
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
You can block people from entering.

1072
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I need to think about that.

1073
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
No, I don't mind the little jokes and things like that.

1074
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
But let me have some creativity, too, people.

1075
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
But actually, I will say this.

1076
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Here's what I've loved on the Minecraft vog server.

1077
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I've actually gone in and I've played.

1078
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
So not only did they build that giant Normandy in front of your house, which is hilarious.

1079
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Somebody put, and I think this is Loki, put a giant penguin near my house.

1080
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I don't mind if you build stuff near my house, because the penguin actually cracked me up.

1081
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Because I was like, what the hell is this thing inside the penguin?

1082
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And Loki says, you put something on there and you pull the lever and it shoots it at its butt.

1083
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah.

1084
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And I'm like, that's fucking amazing!

1085
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I gotta check that out.

1086
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And then I think it was Codeman or somebody built a giant moogle riding a chocobo behind my house.

1087
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
So that's great, too.

1088
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Lots of awesome creativity on the Minecraft server.

1089
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I do have an odd question, though.

1090
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Can you incorporate other maps people have built into an existing map?

1091
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I don't think so, unless there's like a third-party copy-paste type of thing.

1092
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
There is a third-party copy-paste thing.

1093
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,000
You can load schematic files, which is how I created the Normandy and also the penguin.

1094
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Because I found a complete ocarina of time that someone built with all the buildings and the rooms and everything perfect.

1095
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I think that would be just really large.

1096
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,000
A lot of times what they do with other maps and stuff is they'll have a hub part in a server,

1097
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and then they'll be running multiverse, but they'll have multiple servers with rooms that go to different things.

1098
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
They'll have a pixel art room and all sorts of stuff like that.

1099
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
So we could do that. I just don't know how much the server could really run.

1100
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I mean, it's meant to run up to 20 people at a time. We never get close to that, so maybe.

1101
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Right.

1102
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
But I will say this. The creativity on the Minecraft server is pretty amazing.

1103
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
That roller coaster, I don't know if that was you that built that, Loki.

1104
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
That was awesome.

1105
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Yeah.

1106
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I sat in that and took a ride in that.

1107
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Except I had to put some extra minecarts on the track because they all got stuck in one part, but whatever.

1108
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, I fixed that earlier.

1109
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:37,000
There was a plugin that had, it's called Craftbook, that had some stuff messed up where different blocks do different things to minecarts.

1110
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And so I had to disable all that.

1111
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Because I remember when I built the coaster the first time, I ran that same problem.

1112
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And I'm like, why is it not working?

1113
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I'm like, I know it's a plugin that's doing this.

1114
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
And so I went into Craftbook and I'm like, oh, there it is.

1115
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So yeah, it should work now.

1116
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Awesome.

1117
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Is there a way to switch the perspective?

1118
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Because one time I was riding in the coaster and all I could see, like half of my screen was the cart.

1119
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Is there a way to?

1120
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That's a glitch, but yeah, you can change the perspective of your character.

1121
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I don't remember what it's set to.

1122
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Check that out.

1123
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Because I do mine through a gamepad.

1124
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I don't remember.

1125
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I'll look it up. I'll figure it out.

1126
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I do want to give props though, because I believe the Netherworld, I was very impressed with that as well.

1127
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
And the whole transportation hub that's built under there.

1128
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
And I think a lot of that was hitstun, right?

1129
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Yeah, that's pretty much all of him.

1130
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Dude, I'm pretty impressed with that little elaborate system that you built there.

1131
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That was something else to go in there and see that too.

1132
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
So at some point I'll do a livestream from the VoG server for those of you that don't own Minecraft.

1133
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Just so you can see the creativity of the people on there.

1134
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
But that was a lot of fun.

1135
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
If you want to join the Minecraft server at VoG network, check that out in the forums over at VoGnetwork.com.

1136
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It's almost always in the five recent posts thing on the very front page.

1137
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So just check that out.

1138
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It is a whitelist server, because we don't want jerks coming in and ruining things.

1139
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
We want people that we kind of know who they are in case they try to destroy things.

1140
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Or fuck with my house.

1141
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
You can find that all at VoGnetwork.com in the forums.

1142
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
But we're welcoming of any VoG participant who wants to check that out.

1143
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Alright, we gotta move on to some news.

1144
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
We're running a little behind, but that's okay because we had some good discussions so far.

1145
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Someone starts her first day of work tomorrow.

1146
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I know, right?

1147
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So let's quickly do housekeeping.

1148
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Twitter.com slash OLRs where you can follow us on Twitter.

1149
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
We're also on Facebook.

1150
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1151
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
We will still be here next week and so on.

1152
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I can't think of any shows we have off coming up.

1153
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So I think everything is still on track.

1154
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
We'll let you know though if something comes up.

1155
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

1156
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1157
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Sure.

1158
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
YouTube.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1159
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
The YouTube is definitely worth plugging.

1160
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Tell the listeners what they can see in last week's episode.

1161
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
You can see epic dog editing when we were talking about release dates last week.

1162
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:01,000
There was some kind of a shoot-em-up looking game with a big Shiba Inu like dog meme.

1163
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And we were imitating dog meme and I had a hell of a fun time doing that in video.

1164
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh, I got to check that out.

1165
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Very well.

1166
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Much edit.

1167
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Such editing.

1168
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Much learning.

1169
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Now I can do it all over again.

1170
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Wow.

1171
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
All right.

1172
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Whatupgnchat says, OLR doing the Super Bowl.

1173
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Yeah.

1174
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Why wouldn't we?

1175
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I don't remember the last time I watched the Super Bowl.

1176
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Ooh.

1177
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Oh, Jesus.

1178
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Is that next week?

1179
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
No, that's the second.

1180
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
February 2nd.

1181
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Oh, great.

1182
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I...

1183
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, damn.

1184
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
You may end up missing your last show.

1185
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I might.

1186
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Because I was just talking to my coworkers today saying, Super Bowl party!

1187
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Hey, I completely understand, you know, taking time off, you know, for a Puppy Bowl.

1188
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Yeah, I was going to say, I'll watch the Puppy Bowl in the morning.

1189
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Did you know that they posted the lineup for the Puppy Bowl in the Kitty Halftime?

1190
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Yes, I'm so excited.

1191
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
No, there's penguin cheerleaders now.

1192
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Oh, what?

1193
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yes.

1194
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh, this year they're sparing no expense at the Puppy Bowl this year.

1195
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I'm excited about the Puppy Bowl.

1196
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
By the way, did you do...

1197
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Okay, I have to say this.

1198
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Did you see the labra husky?

1199
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
There is a dog, and for me, okay, keep in mind, I'm super allergic to labs and huskies.

1200
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
However, I would have this dog in an instant and live on Benadryl.

1201
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Imagine a cute little lab, but the shape of a lab with pure white, you know, like a husky,

1202
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
and the little black markings, and those eyes.

1203
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
A labra husky.

1204
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Did you hear who they got for the Halftime Music Show?

1205
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Who?

1206
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Keyboard Cat.

1207
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Keyboard motherfucking Cat is on that show.

1208
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Yes, I heard that.

1209
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Yeah, Keyboard Cat's doing the Halftime Show.

1210
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
The reincarnation?

1211
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Yeah, because original Keyboard Cat's kind of dead, because that video was from the 80s.

1212
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Yeah.

1213
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But, um...

1214
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Seriously?

1215
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Is it Pistachio Keyboard Cat?

1216
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It's like a new Keyboard Cat or something.

1217
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh my god, I didn't know that.

1218
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I knew that Cat wasn't alive.

1219
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
That video was from the 80s, yeah.

1220
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Oh my god.

1221
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It's like America's Funniest Home Videos or something.

1222
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Alright, anyhow.

1223
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
News!

1224
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Yes, please.

1225
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I could talk about Keyboard Cat all night, but let's get into it.

1226
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Alright, so Valve, of course, they had their Dev Days this week, and no one was allowed

1227
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
to talk about Dev Days.

1228
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
But people did talk about Dev Days, and some of the things that came out from tweets and

1229
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
all sorts of stuff.

1230
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:19,000
That, of course, and this is kind of a big duh, that Valve wants to offer digital music

1231
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
video and TV as part of SteamOS.

1232
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
In other words, I'm guessing they want to implement music streaming services and movie

1233
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
streaming services, Netflix, Hulu, that kind of stuff.

1234
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It makes sense.

1235
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I mean, most game consoles nowadays have something like that, if not all of those services.

1236
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,000
So, I would be fine with that on SteamBox as well, even if it's not necessarily part

1237
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
of SteamOS, just on Steam.

1238
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
That would be fantastic, because then I would be able to get rid of our crappy boxy.

1239
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
This is kind of interesting, because it's not a surprise, especially considering Steam

1240
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
already sells desktop apps, this is not one bit of a surprise that this exists.

1241
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And Canonical, the company, the for-profit company behind Ubuntu, has done much the same

1242
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
thing.

1243
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Cloud storage and music and videos and any other licensing deals that they can get their

1244
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
hands on, I'm assuming in addition to also promoting copyleft things like Jamendo and

1245
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:29,000
other non-all rights reserved copyrighted materials.

1246
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It is interesting to me, as far as I know, Steam is a couple hundred employees, maybe,

1247
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:41,000
but when you scale to this size, when you support an OS and sign deals and post this

1248
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
kind of stuff, their company size is going to triple.

1249
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:51,000
If SteamOS goes somewhere, their company is going to grow by at least three to four

1250
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
times.

1251
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Just the sheer volume of dealing with publishers and anybody else that they start doing business

1252
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
deals with.

1253
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Great, another system for me to have Netflix on.

1254
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

1255
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Well, at least we wouldn't get, at least on Hulu, we wouldn't get those messages saying,

1256
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
sir, you can only watch this on the web.

1257
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Fuckers, I wanted to watch the end of fucking 30 Rock.

1258
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:25,000
That's very true, Steam is intending to be, I assume, very much the antithesis of that.

1259
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
We'll see.

1260
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundromatia with fognetwork.com,

1261
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
use the pass phrase, beast.

1262
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
One of the things that maybe I'll be able to watch on my new Netflix Steam box will

1263
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
be the Magic the Gathering movie.

1264
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
That's right, Magic the Gathering is apparently going to be adapted into a movie.

1265
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I thought this was supposed to happen some time ago, but I guess, I don't know, I guess

1266
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
this has got some motion with it.

1267
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
20th Century Fox has acquired the screen rights to Magic the Gathering.

1268
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The film studio wants the 20-year-old series of Magic the Gathering to become a mega franchise,

1269
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,000
you know, like Lord of the Rings, which took one book and made it three movies, or three

1270
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
books and three movies, or Harry Potter, which turned seven books into eight movies.

1271
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
If you can adapt, you know, Battleship into a movie.

1272
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Well, I thought that's where I had heard this before, because I want to say, when they licensed,

1273
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
like, didn't they license Battleship and, like, Clue?

1274
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Oh god, Candyland with motherfucking Adam Sandler.

1275
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh, that's gonna be fucking terrible.

1276
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Ew.

1277
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And, like, the Monopoly and, like, a bunch of other stupid shit.

1278
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Clue?

1279
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Clue, but not to be confused with the greatest movie of all time, The Clue from the 1980s.

1280
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
It was not a remake of that, it was something, it would have been worse.

1281
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
You can't get better than Clue from the 1980s.

1282
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm not even, we're not even pretend that they're even remotely related to that.

1283
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
The math is simple. The math is simple. One plus one plus two plus one.

1284
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Flames, the side of my face.

1285
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I can't do it because I can't do the voice.

1286
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Heaving, heaving breaths, heaving.

1287
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I can do it.

1288
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I miss you, Madeline Kahn.

1289
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I know, I miss her so much. Alright, anyway, and Eileen Brennan, let us not forget you.

1290
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
But, you know, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.

1291
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Alright, moving on.

1292
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Different movie, but still.

1293
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Sorry, Magic the Gathering.

1294
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So, we don't know much, I mean, there's no director attached or anything like that.

1295
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This is just something that they are working on.

1296
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
It's going to be made into a movie at some point.

1297
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
But, you know, video game movies don't always exactly have the greatest track records.

1298
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
We'll see how that Warcraft movie turns out.

1299
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It's time to rip off.

1300
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
What?

1301
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Because it was a card game turned into a multimedia Digimon.

1302
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
I don't know. I mean, the good news is it's not like the movie is going to be about people busting out cards.

1303
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Like, that's not how it's going to work.

1304
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's what you think.

1305
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Maybe it will.

1306
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,000
The Battleship the movie incorporated a huge gigantic feature that pushed on a certain square of water and then a torpedo...

1307
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Did it have Liam Neeson saying, you suck my battleship?

1308
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Maybe.

1309
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Because if it didn't have that, then fuck that movie.

1310
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It didn't fucking see that movie.

1311
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,000
It had the pegs. The pegs were in the movie. That was the best part about it.

1312
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Are you serious?

1313
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Seriously, it's in the trailer.

1314
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I'm now equally motivated to see this movie and stay far, far away.

1315
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
There's no interest in Battleship unless it has Liam Neeson saying, you suck my battleship.

1316
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
You know what the advantage now of having rough voices as I can make my favorite complaint about everything.

1317
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Her dismissive voice.

1318
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
All right then, Dar Sacher, if you have some better news for us, why don't you go right ahead?

1319
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
For the record, Xanadu is a better movie.

1320
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
If you want to talk about good, bad movies.

1321
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Well, at the start of the show, we talked about how the Nintendo was said to have flopped and they lied.

1322
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Or I should say Nintendo, the Wii U had flopped.

1323
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And it's a very big thing usually in light of fiscal underperformance that a CEO will be pushed into resigning.

1324
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Or may resign on his own.

1325
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:14,000
However, Satoru Iwata said that he's not going to resign.

1326
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
The direct quote says there will be no major management shake up in the short term.

1327
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:27,000
He does say that he feels responsible and that it is important to get business going back again.

1328
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And another thing too that people aren't seeming to mention is that Nintendo went from having a 200 plus billion yen projection.

1329
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:46,000
To operating at a 35 billion yen loss for the upcoming year.

1330
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
I think they honestly can make it back.

1331
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But he says he's not going to step down.

1332
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Good thing they're sitting on piles of money.

1333
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I know, right?

1334
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But I mean, they've still got the 3DS. It's still performing incredibly strongly in Japan.

1335
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It's still performing decently in America and around the world.

1336
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It's still printing money.

1337
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
So I don't think that they're going to be...

1338
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
He has no reason to step down.

1339
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,000
He hasn't ruined Nintendo, you know, with the release of the Wii U.

1340
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Yeah, all those damn pundits have ruined the Wii U.

1341
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Well, now that you go there, I go, see, this is why Nintendo is not going to come out and say that a console of theirs flopped.

1342
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Because their president isn't going anywhere and he's very stubborn.

1343
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
And that's okay. I don't necessarily blame Iwata for this.

1344
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
But I do think, and I'm a little hopeful in what I'm hearing here, that they talk about a management shakeup.

1345
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I don't think that means that Reggie's going to get fired or something stupid like that.

1346
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
The crap did Reggie have to do with any of it? He's been the big cheerleader.

1347
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Well, because you know in an internet comment section somewhere, that's what they're saying on NeoGaf or some shit.

1348
01:14:52,000 --> 01:15:01,000
But anyway, what I really want to say about that is that maybe the good news that comes out of this as they talk management shakeup is that they'll hire someone from the outside.

1349
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And now that's how the bubble gets broken. If somebody comes in with some fresh perspectives, that could be a very, very good thing.

1350
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:17,000
It does seem that Nintendo is very insular and that usually if they bring somebody in, they have to eventually, you know, tow the Nintendo line.

1351
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It's like their own special form of cultism, you know.

1352
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Can you imagine, sorry to add to the wank, but I can't resist.

1353
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Wait, I have to do it.

1354
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's a gaming fan podcast. I have to.

1355
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I'm doing the wank motion.

1356
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
All right, here we go.

1357
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Can you imagine if Nintendo had hired Don Mattrick?

1358
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Fuck.

1359
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I mean, but I could see a type of Nintendo coup along those lines, not necessarily him, but along those lines.

1360
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I could see them trying to lure over a big executive from some other company to...

1361
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
That's just not the...

1362
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Tigerclaw, I don't think Iwata is going to be replaced by Miyamoto.

1363
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I mean, I don't think that it would happen and I don't think Miyamoto is...

1364
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I don't think Miyamoto wants to be that guy.

1365
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I think Miyamoto is more of a creative type than a business type.

1366
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Miyamoto wants to make games.

1367
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Exactly. He's living his dream.

1368
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
He does that very well being that face of creativity.

1369
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Like when you see Miyamoto, like genuinely excited about one of his games, you can't help but be excited too.

1370
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:32,000
No matter what you think about Nintendo, I think it's hard to argue that Miyamoto's enthusiasm is fucking infectious and Microsoft and Sony don't have that.

1371
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
They don't have Miyamoto.

1372
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:42,000
That's the thing that I think keeps Nintendo strong is the fact that they have people who are passionate about what they do.

1373
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Who love their jobs and want to keep doing the best that they can.

1374
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I really do like that they adhere to an ideal.

1375
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Because you don't really see a whole lot of that.

1376
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I mean, you certainly don't see it so much with...

1377
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You really don't see it at all with Microsoft.

1378
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Unless, you know, you're counting individual developers or a few people here and there.

1379
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
For the most part, it's just towing their corporate line.

1380
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Sony is a lot the same way too.

1381
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Nintendo, you've got people who are enthusiastic about what they're doing and love what they do.

1382
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:21,000
And I honestly would even think that the underperformance of the Wii U would be taken as a personal disappointment.

1383
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I mean, certainly the fiscal standpoint is going to have something to do with it.

1384
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:29,000
But I think just from, oh, we love this thing and no one else loves it.

1385
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Like, when you have the ugliest baby in the world and you love it, but everyone else thinks you just have an ugly baby.

1386
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I hate to use that.

1387
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
What a strange analogy, but okay.

1388
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But you get what I mean.

1389
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I do.

1390
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I mean, the system's only been out for a year.

1391
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I don't really think it's a failure yet.

1392
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And it could grow out of being ugly.

1393
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Babies grow.

1394
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Did I just hear Loki defend the Wii U?

1395
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
He does it once in a while.

1396
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Nintendo was the prettiest girl at the whole ball last console generation.

1397
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Let's not forget.

1398
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Well, and here's the other thing.

1399
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,000
And I want to put people, you know, this just goes back to bringing up what if Iwata was replaced by Miyamoto.

1400
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Imagine that you were living your dream job.

1401
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
You got to make games.

1402
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
This is what your passion was.

1403
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Or, okay, it would go the same thing if they said, what if they made Koji Kondo CEO.

1404
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
He's a musician.

1405
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
What he does is make music.

1406
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
He develops the music and controls that part of whatever game environment he's working in.

1407
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:35,000
I think we need to get the guy that was doing the drumming as part of that stage demonstration for Wii music.

1408
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
That guy, he has a good future at Nintendo.

1409
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Well, my point is, if you try to offer that job to any of those guys, they'd probably turn it down right away and say, get someone who's a businessman to run the business.

1410
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1411
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Let's see, Fifth Dream says Nintendo's ugly baby is Mario.

1412
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Mario's not ugly. He's just plain.

1413
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Let's see, Rama in chat says, Loki defends the Wii U. Take a shot.

1414
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And then, of course, there's some wank in our chat about who they should hire and so forth.

1415
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Thank you for posting my favorite Mario fan art ever.

1416
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Uh oh, who posted it? Akuma JP?

1417
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I love you, Akuma-san.

1418
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It's a radio show. You're not supposed to be sending the artwork.

1419
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
No, it's one of the super buff Mario with the giant shroom.

1420
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It's Super Mario Bear, if you know what I mean. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1421
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah.

1422
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I did it.

1423
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Well, you've been in San Francisco for how long now?

1424
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I'll do it. I'll just bring the Wii U around.

1425
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
He doesn't look Italian with expression.

1426
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I can do it.

1427
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It looks like Zangief costs playing Mario.

1428
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Here you go.

1429
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Alright, let's move on. Loki, what do you have?

1430
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Like I said, I'll take care of this. I can bring the Wii U back.

1431
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It's all up to me.

1432
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
What would you do, Loki?

1433
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
What would I do? Well, what wouldn't I do?

1434
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
First off, you know, I put out some really kick-ass games on that system.

1435
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
You know, we need a new Metroid and fuck, we're getting F-Zero this year.

1436
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I would just lower the price and actually make online decent.

1437
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:18,000
All the OLR dream games, such as things like President Cat, Puzzle Sluts, all of them would be a reality.

1438
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
What, they play Snap? Definitely.

1439
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Awesome. Alright.

1440
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So Apple has to settle with the Federal Trade Commission and now they have to pay out millions of dollars, 32 million dollars to be exact.

1441
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And that whole in-app purchase suit where people, you know, apparently were unlocking their system for like 15 minutes or something and their kids were racking up tons of charges.

1442
01:20:48,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Which basically, I don't know. I mean, I think it's a little ridiculous because people need to be a little bit more responsible.

1443
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:09,000
But I understand at the same time, app developers are kind of making it very easy for people to rack up those huge numbers in in-app purchases.

1444
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And I know that they've kind of tweaked that now where it fixes that, but it's still kind of annoying that it kind of turned out that way.

1445
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:30,000
But yeah, so apparently they're saying there's some people that spent thousands of dollars of, you know, their parents' money on games. Free to play games.

1446
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
All those damn Smurf Berries.

1447
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I do like that they make it very clear now though.

1448
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And the Angry Bird Eagles.

1449
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Loki's right though. The changes are for the better.

1450
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Well, I think at one point, you know, they probably were making it so it's easy for you to make in-app purchases and they didn't really intend for people to do that.

1451
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:58,000
But then they probably heard about all these stories about people racking up those things and then they made it even easier for kids to make those purchases.

1452
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:06,000
But at the same time, I think there's a little bit of, you know, the parents not taking responsibility for their kids using their account and stuff.

1453
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I have to blame the parents a little bit, but apparently no one wants to blame the parents, so.

1454
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Going to the chatroom, because this is a really good point from our pal Segg over at live.vognetwork.com.

1455
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Segg says, the problem with in-app is that once you sign in for one purchase, you're not asked for a password for 15 minutes after.

1456
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,000
And on Google Play Android, it's 30 minutes.

1457
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So it's honest for a parent to go, oh, okay, I'll pay 99 cent for my kid and then $2,000 later, dot, dot, dot.

1458
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah, that's a really good point. I didn't realize it did that.

1459
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I like to prevent me. I'm the big kid I've got to prevent.

1460
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
So I like to be asked, like, are you sure you want to spend this money?

1461
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:54,000
So I don't like accidentally do something that's going to, you know, spend money or something if I, you know, have a moment where I forget to read something or whatever it is.

1462
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,000
You know, I just I like having that extra safeguard in there.

1463
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
So I didn't even realize it shuts off after 15 minutes.

1464
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
That's not or doesn't shut off until 15 minutes. That's not good. That's not good.

1465
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
All right. Let's move on anyhow with some more news. Jason.

1466
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Going back to episodes to Miss Dark Soccer's classic game of the week trend of featuring games that you may never have seen, whose characters have cameos in Namco High.

1467
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
She taught us about a little game called Wonder Momo.

1468
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I had indeed never heard of this before. We sat around watching the video available at YouTube dot com slash Orange Launch Radio.

1469
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:42,000
But Namco Bandai has launched a Wonder Momo teaser site at Wonder Momo dot JP.

1470
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
It is literally a site with a silhouette of Momo in her Wonder Momo outfit.

1471
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:55,000
And I really don't want to use a culturally incorrect picture.

1472
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It's a silhouette. So you just see, like, her helmet and whatnot. That's all you get.

1473
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
There are other accents in the silhouette, of course, but nothing quite that detailed.

1474
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And then characters at the bottom, which represent the audience, I believe, unless it's the creature she was fighting.

1475
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
No, it's pretty much similar to the audience heads.

1476
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Yes. The site literally features, as of this moment, features a splash that says Momo is back.

1477
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:29,000
There has been a Wonder Momo comic that Jamie also talked about during that classic game of the week segment.

1478
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
And we have no and this game never made it to America.

1479
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So, and again, it is also Wonder Momo dot JP, which announces some pretty specific intentions.

1480
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:53,000
We don't know when it's going to come out, if it's going to be a port revival, new game, new media, as seems to be the case between Namco High and, again, this webcomic for Wonder Momo specifically.

1481
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Speculation is hugely up in the air, but a series from the 80s is on its way back in a prominent form, and it seems to be gathering a lot of attention and buzz.

1482
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And that can't possibly be a bad thing. Seriously.

1483
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Wonder Momo is a cute game.

1484
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It is. It was very fun watching that.

1485
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Even with gratuitous panty shots.

1486
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
All of like six pixels, though? Let's be honest here.

1487
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
You know they'll look for the fan service wherever they can get it.

1488
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Yes. And back in those days, well, maybe not so much in Japan.

1489
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Aren't there other games, not counting Namco High itself, aren't there other games that have had other characters whose games have had similar reboots in the last couple of months?

1490
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Or am I just making stuff up?

1491
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I'm probably just making stuff up and thinking of Namco High itself.

1492
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:44,000
There's plenty I'd like to see.

1493
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Yeah.

1494
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Well, and what I didn't realize that the whole Namco High thing is that all the characters that they've brought in are, they have in their webcomic series from Shifty Look.

1495
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Which is also where this Wonder Momo webcomic is from.

1496
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Exactly.

1497
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So it's very much two-part.

1498
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And it will be nice to see how this continues and what prominence they decide to feature with Wonder Momo and many other characters.

1499
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Well, I would definitely, I would like to see either a remake or like an actual sequel or something.

1500
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It was a fun little game. I've played it.

1501
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Even Viewtiful Joe had the kind of implied with an audience motif and certainly there were some possibilities for Wonder Momo as well.

1502
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:30,000
You can even say that Super Mario World was set on the stage.

1503
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
That just short-circuited my brain.

1504
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Super Mario Brothers 3 had that literal stage where they had the curtain that raised in the very beginning of the game. Remember that?

1505
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Exactly. But there's actually a whole, I think, the first thing is, I kind of thought about it before and it had been mentioned before, but Game Theory, which is one of the YouTubes that I like,

1506
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:03,000
even went into detail about how they're all set on the stage, how everything is done up like, not Mario World, it was Mario 3, thank you Rob, I'm sorry.

1507
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:13,000
And how they're all on a platform and you can go behind the scenes to walk behind the scenery and then when you get to the end of the level, you're going backstage.

1508
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yeah, they're all kind of curtain-y, transition-y, exit, exit, stage left, stage right, technically stage left because it's one stage, but yeah.

1509
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I never really gave that design a lot of consideration.

1510
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:32,000
And it was 3 I was thinking of, but World had some of the same things incorporated in it.

1511
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Interesting. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that will be coming a little sooner than any other remake that we're talking about tonight.

1512
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Loki, is there anything for the US yet?

1513
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Not this week. 28th is the first step we get this month and then we'll be getting regular releases each week.

1514
01:27:51,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Alright, then give me a minute here, we'll travel to Japan and check out the releases there. Still no PlayStation 4 or Xbox One out in Japan, so there's no releases to read there.

1515
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,000
What is it, February 22nd I believe is the big day for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Do we have a date for Xbox One in Japan? I don't think we do.

1516
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Yeah, I don't think they've announced anything.

1517
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:22,000
It's still TBA. Well, meanwhile, you have some other things to look forward to, such as on the 24th we have, I'm sorry, the 23rd of this month we have on the PlayStation 3 Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel gets a price reduction.

1518
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Saints Row 4 also gets a Ultra Super Ultimate Deluxe Edition out in Japan. As far as new games go, you get Sengoku Basara 4 comes out from Capcom this week, that is finally out.

1519
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And I believe there is some special bundles and things that go with that as well, because, you know, who doesn't love bundles? Like limited editions and things like that.

1520
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:51,000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, just that same Saints Row 4 and then also Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z, which I believe is also on the PlayStation 3 as well.

1521
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
You love your Dragon Ball games, don't you?

1522
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I've been getting a little nostalgic lately just because, yeah, I really am nostalgic for some Dragon Ball Z.

1523
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Well, you could get it on the PlayStation Vita as well. It's also out there this week as well as the Sega game named Utagumi 575 comes out in regular and limited edition this week on the Vita.

1524
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And I'm kind of like, what is this? It says it's a new genre ground. It takes literary sensibilities and mixes it with popular Japanese music.

1525
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:26,000
The haiku, a Japanese poetic form that follows the strict rule of three lines following 575 syllables.

1526
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
I know, it's like they read my mind tonight. Per line, a new style of gameplay is invented.

1527
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Instead of the formulaic approach of only matching button presses to various tempo-based patterns, Utagumi 575 incorporates this with a hiragana guessing game.

1528
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,000
The result for players is that after filling the correct cadence requirements, a prompt for missing Japanese characters appears.

1529
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:52,000
And these are filled by paying attention to the phrase that's displayed, the context of the song, and the rules of a haiku.

1530
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
This sounds hard.

1531
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I was just thinking because I haven't said anything on air, but I'm planning on taking the JLPT N5 this year.

1532
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I was just thinking something like that would actually be really helpful for my studies.

1533
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:15,000
It's a SEGA rhythm game. I gotta say, as quirky as that sounds, I love that it's something kind of different.

1534
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
SEGA's made rhythm games more recently too, like that Rhythm Thief that was on 3DS. That was only last year.

1535
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to take a tangent, but I thought that was pretty cool.

1536
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Like a rhythm game that's haiku-based. It's kind of neat.

1537
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:31,000
On the Wii U this week? Nothing in Japan.

1538
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:38,000
On the 3DS though, you do get Carlos, the Beast of Re-Eden comes out this week.

1539
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I'm trying to see what kind of game this is. Oh, it's a shooter.

1540
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
It's a pew-pew shooting game.

1541
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It's more that isometric shooter though, not just above. It's more of using 3D shapes and stuff.

1542
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
You were exactly correct, by the way, that February 22nd is the PlayStation 4 Japanese release date.

1543
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And no date outside of this year for Xbox One in Japan.

1544
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Alright. I like hearing that I'm right. You should say it more often.

1545
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I can fact-check everything.

1546
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
You may be right about that, but you're so wrong in other ways.

1547
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Alright, let's see what the UK has to say for releases.

1548
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:18,000
On January 20th, which I guess is technically today now for them, is Kick Beat for PC.

1549
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,000
On the 21st is Chess 2, the sequel on Android. Whatevs.

1550
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It's chess. Again.

1551
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:33,000
On the 22nd we have Insurgency for Mac and PC and OlliOlli for Vita.

1552
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
On the 23rd there is Might & Magic X Legacy for PC.

1553
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Ninja Gaiden 3, the Ancient Ship of Doom for 3DS.

1554
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
That be it. Arr.

1555
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Alright, there it is. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1556
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
But first, Loki.

1557
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Alright, so let's see.

1558
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:59,000
We've got a little bit of interesting rumor here.

1559
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
And I don't know. It would be nice to get some new blood kind of in the series.

1560
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:12,000
But there's a rumor that Silent Hill 9 is being, I guess, resurrected by Hideo Kojima.

1561
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
That he is going to be working on the game series now.

1562
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And I don't know if that's actually going to be true now.

1563
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I know he's very busy with all the Metal Gear Solid 5 stuff.

1564
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But it would be kind of neat if he took it over because he does really good directing in his games.

1565
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
But I don't know.

1566
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
They need another solid series though. Pun intended.

1567
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Haha. A Kojima Silent Hill game.

1568
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I don't know. It sounds a little fan wankish to me.

1569
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
But if it is true, it could be very interesting.

1570
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I think Silent Hill needs a nice kick in the butt to kind of get it back to where it was in its heyday.

1571
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,000
I thought I saw another fan wank rumor not that long ago that they were trying to get Team Silent back together.

1572
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
And I was like, good luck.

1573
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I mean, Akira Yamagata works for...

1574
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Well, they were saying that they were supposed to be resurrecting Team Silent as well.

1575
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And here's the other thing too.

1576
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:20,000
The information that right now that they're kind of going off of is based off of a listing on IMDB which anybody can make.

1577
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
So I don't know.

1578
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Oh, that's nothing. Yeah.

1579
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
That's a huge rumor. That's for sure.

1580
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Alright. Well, let's talk about...

1581
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
We are about to get into the Classic Game of the Week.

1582
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,000
But let's talk about one of the great classics right now. Tetris.

1583
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Tetris always comes back.

1584
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
It's like a rite of passage for any generation of gaming consoles.

1585
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Where's the Tetris game?

1586
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Well, the next-gen Tetris game for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming from Ubisoft.

1587
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
They'll be the ones publishing this Tetris game.

1588
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,000
We don't know more details than that.

1589
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:55,000
It's just that the Tetris game will be on the digital channels.

1590
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

1591
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
So I guess they're going to focus on a download title, which is fine.

1592
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Because paying $60 for a Tetris game would be a little bit ridiculous.

1593
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
So I think the networks are the place to go.

1594
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
I don't know what next generation is going to entail.

1595
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But I would imagine that probably more online, competitive-based elements.

1596
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,000
You know, I gotta say though, since it's been a very Nintendo talking about what they've done right and wrong over the years.

1597
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Tetris on the DS was so freaking good.

1598
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It's going to be really hard to top that one.

1599
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Remember Tetris on the DS? That was a great port of that game.

1600
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Probably the best since the original NES version.

1601
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Just with all its different modes and the retro Nintendo stuff they brought into that.

1602
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Obviously Ubisoft can't do that.

1603
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
But it'll be interesting to see what they decide to add to this as well.

1604
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
So there you go.

1605
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
No word on when it's coming out.

1606
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Maybe a year from now? A holiday?

1607
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Yeah, whenever it's done. So you can just wait.

1608
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:56,000
While you're waiting for that Tetris game, maybe you want to take a moment out to experience a classic.

1609
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Well, Dark Soccer is here to help you out.

1610
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Because every week she dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1611
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Hey, you should be playing this game.

1612
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
In my case it's blowing dust off of it.

1613
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
She really likes diving.

1614
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,000
She does.

1615
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm not a good diver. I'm more just like...

1616
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Dives into the vault.

1617
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
She just plays Scrooge McDuck style.

1618
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
I do a cannonball into it.

1619
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Dives into the mailbag. Scrooge McDuck style.

1620
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
She plays one on TV.

1621
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
She dives into the UK. Scrooge McDuck style.

1622
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I wish I could just dive to the UK. That would be awesome.

1623
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
She's actually just singing Dive by B4U the whole time.

1624
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I just started humming that, but I have no voice, so stop it.

1625
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Dark Sakura.

1626
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Stop it.

1627
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
What is the classic game of the week?

1628
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
The classic game of the week is Taiko no Tatsujin.

1629
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
That's actually from the Wii version.

1630
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I was trying to find older stuff and it only felt like the Evangelion.

1631
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
But the Wii version had the cutest accessory.

1632
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
That little inflatable drum.

1633
01:35:52,000 --> 01:36:02,000
And since I'm sticking with my Namco high theme, Donko is a character that showed up in Namco High who is a character in this.

1634
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,000
And don't make me anything to look at while I'm doing classic game guys.

1635
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Taiko no Tatsujin came out in the US as Taiko Drum Master, but there were a bunch of different versions out in Japan.

1636
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
We've seen an arcade version.

1637
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:24,000
It came out on TBS, TBS, PST, PSP, Wii, Wii U, iOS, the Advanced Pico Bina, and other mobile versions.

1638
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I'm just watching this little video you got going.

1639
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
This is insanity. Listen to the drum beat in this.

1640
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Wow.

1641
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Wow.

1642
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Yeah.

1643
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
That one, I was like...

1644
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
No, it's not Donkey Konga. Shut up, Bobby.

1645
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I mean, hearts, hearts, hearts.

1646
01:36:49,000 --> 01:37:00,000
But like I said, there were Chinese versions that came out to be used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.

1647
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
And we've seen other versions.

1648
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I've seen knockoffs of the game too.

1649
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Remember the one, the big single Taiko that was at John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza, Rob?

1650
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
We've seen stuff like that.

1651
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yeah.

1652
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:26,000
So anyway, basically you have two Taiko, and you have your sticks to play with it, and your notes are called ompu.

1653
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:36,000
And as they move across the screen, you either have to hit the center, or you hit the end to make a certain type of sound.

1654
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:44,000
And you have your Tamashi Geiji, which is your spirit gauge to show how well you're doing.

1655
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:51,000
You have a red marker, which is your don, and your blue marker, which is your kato.

1656
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:58,000
And it's exactly, you make the, to describe the noises that you're making.

1657
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
So the don is in the face, the kato is the side.

1658
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:13,000
And then you have the large ones that are basically, you know, large don and large kato that are double notes.

1659
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So you hit with, basically you hit both buttons on both sides of the drum, and the console releases, or in the drum you have to hit just really, really freaking hard.

1660
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
And the drum just punched that thing in the face. That was adorable.

1661
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Oh Rob.

1662
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
You actually gave me several videos to take a look at here.

1663
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I did. I think the third one is the Evangel, or the second one might be the Evangelion one.

1664
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
No, this is Hatsune Miku.

1665
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Oh yeah.

1666
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
We're gonna look at here in this video.

1667
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
So I guess, is this one of her songs in the game?

1668
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I believe so.

1669
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
That's, I love the little chibi Hatsune Miku at the bottom. Anyway, sorry.

1670
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
And you see the little Miku running in the background?

1671
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Oh yeah.

1672
01:38:53,000 --> 01:39:00,000
So, and for the record I do have a little Taiko plushie.

1673
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:09,000
So you also have a yellow bar called Renda where you hit either don or kato as many times as possible across it.

1674
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
It doesn't build up your spirit gauge but gives you bonus points.

1675
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
You have a balloon, which is called Husen Ompu.

1676
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:28,000
You also have, it also goes with the Genki Renda, where if you hit don for a certain number of times within the time limit, then you get bonus points too.

1677
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:39,000
You have all kinds of different, I'm not gonna go into all of them because there's a Kusudama, there's a Suzudon, there's all kinds of stuff that pops up.

1678
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:48,000
And you get different kinds of power ups and health bonuses and different things to attack your enemy if you're doing boss battles.

1679
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Like on the DS ones like Dororo no Kai Daikessen and a lot of the different versions.

1680
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:11,000
There's also a wrestling version, it's called Dual Note, which is based on wrestling, where you have to hit the Taiko repeatedly, more than your opponent does, so that you win.

1681
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Like I said, it's almost more like a tug of war, you know, whoever hits more wins.

1682
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:23,000
And unfortunately this was only in the boss battles on Wii, Dodon, To, Todame.

1683
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:34,000
So there's different versions, you have Easy, which is Kanton, Normal, Hutsu, and Hard, which is Musukashi, which is really hard.

1684
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And then you have a fourth difficulty that's in later games called Donderful, which is a combination of Don and Wonderful.

1685
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And you've got basically all your different note charts for how difficult, how easy they are, and it goes all over the board for how easy it is, or how hard it can be.

1686
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:10,000
In your different options, and they've changed from different types, you have different Taiko sounds that will be working on different types of songs, I think, that play.

1687
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And they change them around, you can hit the different rim in your difficulty selection to change what your Taiko sounds like.

1688
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Oh gosh.

1689
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Pretty customizable.

1690
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I bet that's pretty funny.

1691
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
This was one I wanted to play because we were talking about Dragon Ball Z earlier.

1692
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I was going to say, we want to switch up the video here a little bit because that last one just ran out.

1693
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
So this is from the portable version of the game we're about to look at right now?

1694
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Yes.

1695
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:38,000
This is actually the intro song to Dragon Ball Z, the original intro.

1696
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
The audio is a little distorted.

1697
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
That's exactly what it sounds like in the anime too, so don't worry about it.

1698
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Okay.

1699
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
That one's actually a fun one to play.

1700
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,000
So you've got different modifiers.

1701
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
You have auto, which plays automatically, and you can look at the song, and you get full combo.

1702
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:59,000
You get hidden, or as it's called, doron, which it's like it says.

1703
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:09,000
You have speed modifiers, you have double speed, you have triple speed, quadruple speed, and then you can go up to eight.

1704
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I'm sorry.

1705
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It looks like it's just the symbols that move faster, like the modifiers we have in BeatMania.

1706
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:23,000
And these have been eight since eight and why why happy roku daime.

1707
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
You have perfect, where the song will end if a note is missed.

1708
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
So if you're playing in perfect mode, you have to finish the whole song perfectly.

1709
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
You have reverse, abekobe, which is backwards.

1710
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Different modifiers.

1711
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:46,000
You have one called whimsical and haphazard, where it changes your notes from red to blue or vice versa, so you have to look at them differently.

1712
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Just all kinds of different stuff.

1713
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:58,000
It's really, really just a complex little game for as much as it seems you're just hitting on a drum, or hitting on the rim of the drum.

1714
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:01,000
So all kinds of different versions.

1715
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:07,000
As far as what has come out, for the Japanese versions, there are plenty of them.

1716
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:19,000
We've had arcade versions starting with Taiko no Tatsujin through Taiko no Tatsujin 14, then an overhaul in September 2010.

1717
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
The first one came out February 2001.

1718
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:35,000
And then the revamp, which is Taiko no Tatsujin from November 2011, and Taiko no Tatsujin Katsudon, and the Sorayo version that came out in March 2013.

1719
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:39,000
For home versions, we've had three different on the DS, a bunch on 3DS.

1720
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:46,000
The last one coming out November 29, 2012 called Taiko no Tatsujin Wii Chogokaban.

1721
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
And there's been a Wii U version, Taiko no Tatsujin Wii U.

1722
01:43:49,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Tons on PS2, three on PSP, four on iOS, three on Android, one on Advanced Pikobina, and different mobile versions, two in Japan, which were Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Monthly and Taiko no Tatsujin Mobile, and then one that came out in South Korea.

1723
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:13,000
We have had different guest appearances within the games.

1724
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Like I said, Hatsune Miku showed up in Portable DX, and I sent you that link.

1725
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
And you can also play the same song in Project Diva.

1726
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
A little crossover.

1727
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
There's Puzzle and Dragons crossovers as well.

1728
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
So tracks that were for Puzzle and Dragons.

1729
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:36,000
But yet, I'm not going to be able to find any of this in America except for that one release they had, the Drum Master.

1730
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Nope. Sorry.

1731
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I remember one of my Balani friends had that, who I haven't seen him in forever. I miss him.

1732
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Well, there's been spin-offs.

1733
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Yeah?

1734
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:49,000
There was a Taiko no Tatsujin character thing done in clay anime.

1735
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:54,000
And it was in, it was for Kid Station, it was in Comic Bum Bum.

1736
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Then...

1737
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
My bum is on my bum.

1738
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:04,000
We had many versions, it was in Tales of the World, NariKiri Dungeon 3, which is, you know, another Amco game.

1739
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
And in the DS game, Nodame Kontabile.

1740
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:15,000
And then in Mario Kart Arcade GPDX, you have a theme. A Taiko no Tatsujin theme.

1741
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Alright.

1742
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,000
And so I was just doing Taiko no Tatsujin. I didn't even touch Taiko Drum Master.

1743
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
As we got it over here.

1744
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Yeah.

1745
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Which, I mean, basically it's the same game, we've just got different music, you know, licensing.

1746
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:35,000
And I have that. I actually have a legit drum for it, and I have one of the knockoffs.

1747
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
And it's fun, I love it. You know, like I said, I had to dust it off.

1748
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yeah.

1749
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
You know, so, uh, it's, oh wow, I'm totally lucky.

1750
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
A good music game memory.

1751
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I mean, I'm totally jealous of Ikuma JP.

1752
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Why?

1753
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I used to own a three foot don and katsu saiyan doll.

1754
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Adorable.

1755
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:56,000
What?

1756
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1757
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Taiko no Tatsujin, or Taiko Drum Master, if you will.

1758
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Uh, for, well, hell, there's fourteen of them, so it's pretty much on everything.

1759
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
In the arcades.

1760
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,000
In the arcades.

1761
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
In the many, many, many, many more versions.

1762
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Well, you remember, um, Loki downloaded Taiko no Tatsujin for his PSP back in the day.

1763
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Yeah, I remember that.

1764
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
He was talking about how to get all the important stuff.

1765
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Well, I just remember our friend Garrett had the big drum peripheral that he got.

1766
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And, yeah, I know.

1767
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I heard from Garrett.

1768
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I don't know what happened to him.

1769
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Yeah.

1770
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Hmm.

1771
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Oh well.

1772
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Get him back on the show at some point would be awesome.

1773
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Yeah.

1774
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Alright, uh, it is running long.

1775
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
We gotta go to break.

1776
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Uh, but thank you Dark Soccer for taking us to a great music game from our past.

1777
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Uh, we're gonna be back with plenty more news.

1778
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
The Fugal Question of the Week, which should be exciting tonight, because I didn't even

1779
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
plan it this way on purpose, but we were talking haikus earlier.

1780
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
We're gonna get some haikus in the Fugal Question of the Week.

1781
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Haiku.

1782
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Haiku.

1783
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Not haikus.

1784
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Haikai.

1785
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Haiku.

1786
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Haiku.

1787
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Haikus.

1788
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Haiku.

1789
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Haiku.

1790
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Haiku.

1791
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Haiku.

1792
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Haiku.

1793
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Hike a lot.

1794
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Alright, Dark Soccer is gonna have a meltdown, but we'll be back after this with more of

1795
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1796
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Stay tuned.

1797
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Baka.

1798
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Hi everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1799
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:24,000
We are live here on January 19th, 2014, with the 536th episode of our program already in

1800
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
progress.

1801
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Thank you so much for joining us, be it that you're live here at the Voice Geeks Network,

1802
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:34,000
VOG Network.com, or perhaps you're listening to us on the podcast feed via one of the many

1803
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,000
iPhone apps that lets you listen to things like Stitcher Radio or TuneIn.

1804
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I just want to say a big thank you to checking out our show, no matter how you are choosing

1805
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
to listen to it.

1806
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
We've had a lot of pretty good debate on tonight's show.

1807
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
We'll see if it continues with some more news that we're gonna get into in this half of

1808
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
the show.

1809
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Loki, if you're back there on the Skype line, you're not gonna be here next week for sure,

1810
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
right?

1811
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
That's right.

1812
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Well, I hope, again, I know I said this a little bit last week, but since you are back

1813
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
this week, and I didn't think you would be, I will say it once again, all of us here at

1814
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Orange Lounge Radio wish you all the best with the new child.

1815
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,000
I know everything's gonna go great.

1816
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
We can't wait to hear the name, which somebody had hoped you were gonna name your baby Tingle,

1817
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
but it doesn't sound like that's gonna happen, right?

1818
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
That's definitely not gonna happen.

1819
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:20,000
We can't wait to hear all of that whenever you do come back, but, you know, take the

1820
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
time you need.

1821
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
We all understand.

1822
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Dark Soccer and I will somehow manage to continue on.

1823
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Jason will be here for at least a week or two, but after that, I don't know, we'll figure

1824
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,000
something out.

1825
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Hopefully, Alan can fill in for a show or some of our other loyal, go-to people can

1826
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
help us out if we need to.

1827
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
So, enjoy your time off with the new child.

1828
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Alright, I will.

1829
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Alright, start us off, if you wouldn't mind, with some rapid-fire news.

1830
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yes, so there was a teaser trailer, if you will, that was put out by Bossa Studios, who,

1831
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:58,000
you may remember, did a little game on Steam called Surgeon Simulator 2013, and the video

1832
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
is called Shh, I Dentist Now.

1833
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:07,000
And so, it's kind of teasing a little bit, like, they have Surgeon Simulator coming soon

1834
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:13,000
for the iPad, and hopefully we'll see some sort of, you know, add-on for Surgeon Simulator

1835
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:19,000
2013, but it sounds like the iPad version might revolve around Dentistry, which, you

1836
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
can only imagine how that'll go.

1837
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Yeah, I'm not excited about this game, because, you know, I'm not a big fan of the dentist,

1838
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,000
no offense to any who may be listening, but it's just, you know, I'm one of those people.

1839
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
So, yeah, I look at the idea, after seeing Surgeon Simulator, which, by the way, is a

1840
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
part of the, I don't think this ever came up on the show, but Humble Bundle 10 is out,

1841
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
and it's great, and it's to help charity, but Surgeon Simulator is one of the games

1842
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
in it, and, yeah, after seeing that, when I hear about, like, this idea is really funny,

1843
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
but I'll pass, thanks.

1844
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I'm, I am equal parts thrilled and horrified by it, because I don't mind dental work, I've

1845
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:05,000
had a fair amount in my life, including something that only hosts, I...

1846
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:09,000
They look fine to me. You don't gotta show me the back of your throat, Jason.

1847
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Ooh.

1848
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
It's very sexy.

1849
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I can see your uvula.

1850
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I am equal parts thrilled, horrified, and prepared to play this game, because, if it's

1851
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,000
any, if it's even remotely as impossible as Surgeon Simulator is, and it will be, it'll

1852
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
be a good time, but with lots of drills and noises and whirly bits and picks and spoke

1853
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,000
spiky things.

1854
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I think I'm, like, the only person I know that doesn't have dentist trauma. I always

1855
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,000
fall asleep because I'm bored.

1856
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Consider yourself lucky.

1857
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,000
It's just an awesome, I'm kind of curious to see how it's gonna work as far as, because,

1858
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
you know, the whole point of Surgeon Simulator is that the controls are really hard to, you

1859
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:58,000
know, use, and so, you know, with an iPad, I guess it would be a little bit easier, I

1860
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,000
think, with the touchscreen, maybe, I guess, they're gonna map it exactly the same, you

1861
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:08,000
know, one hand does the, you know, five keys, and the other hand moves the actual arm. I

1862
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
don't know.

1863
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
We'll see.

1864
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:18,000
All right. And then, moving on, Unity is coming to the Vita, and this is great if you are

1865
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:25,000
an up and coming game developer. Now you can actually port your Unity games that you make

1866
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:33,000
in, for the Vita, I guess, and I think now, man, I think Unity supports pretty much almost

1867
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:39,000
all console platforms now. It's, I know, at least the entire PlayStation suite. I'm not

1868
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:45,000
really sure. It's been a while since I actually looked at Unity, but, yeah, so support for,

1869
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:51,000
you know, all the sensors, the cameras, analog sticks, touchpad, all that fun stuff. And

1870
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:59,000
that's, I guess, with Unity 4.3. And, in fact, they're saying that there is a game, Stick

1871
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:06,000
It to the Man, that was developed, I guess, on PS3 and Vita, and that's with Unity as

1872
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:13,000
well, and that's, I think it's already out or coming out very soon. So that's kind of

1873
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,000
cool, I think. Especially since it's relatively, I mean, well, it's free to use non-commercially,

1874
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:23,000
and if you make, I think, over $10,000 in the year or something like that, then you

1875
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:29,000
have to pay the licensing fee, which isn't that expensive. And last but not least, Apple

1876
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:38,000
and Google have pulled a game, if you will, that was promoting plastic surgery for children.

1877
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
It was a game called Plastic Surgery for Barbie, which I'm sure probably could, you know, have

1878
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:49,000
been pulled just because, you know, the copyright infringement on the name itself. But basically,

1879
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:55,000
it was a game aimed at kids, you know, I guess it was marked suitable for kids 9 and over,

1880
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:02,000
and had you performing plastic surgery procedures on female characters, you know, such as liposuction

1881
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:08,000
and on the characteristics problem areas. And you compare the before and after shots,

1882
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,000
and they were saying, you know, some of the results, like, this unfortunate girl has so

1883
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
much extra weight that no diet can help her, you know. In our clinic, she can go through

1884
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:22,000
surgery called liposuction that will make her slim and beautiful. So apparently, people

1885
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,000
were offended, you know, that it's giving children the wrong idea.

1886
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Well, did they really think that people...

1887
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:30,000
It is giving the wrong idea.

1888
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
It is. It is a little offensive, actually.

1889
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Yeah, and I think Mattel was one of the ones also that kind of, you know, helped in pulling

1890
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:45,000
that since, you know, obviously they mentioned Barbie in there, and, you know, they want

1891
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,000
that associated with any of the Mattel stuff.

1892
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I mean, this picture doesn't look like any Barbie I've ever seen, but maybe that's just me.

1893
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Yeah.

1894
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:59,000
All right. Moving on to some other news that I have for you guys. Some eShop releases for

1895
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Nintendo, because they are still putting some classics out there as we go.

1896
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
UnEpic is now out on the Wii U. This game's been out for a couple of years, but it's that

1897
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:14,000
platformer that has some RPG elements, D&D, NES-style gameplay. Or as Nintendo puts it,

1898
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:18,000
UnEpic is a mixture of platform game, role game, I think it's a role play game, and joke

1899
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
that takes place in a huge castle of medieval fantasy. It is set in the 80s style, but

1900
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,000
completed with the most actual features. So, okay. That is available.

1901
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Wow.

1902
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I haven't checked that out on Steam. I haven't checked that out on Steam. I think it's in

1903
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
my wish list, but anyway. So that is now out. You can also check out F1 Race Stars

1904
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Powered Up Edition, which is kind of like a cutesy cart game. You can check that out.

1905
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And then as far as Virtual Console goes, this is pretty cool. Castlevania II, Simon's

1906
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Quest. I think this game kind of gets shit on unnecessarily, but I kind of think it is

1907
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:55,000
the reason we have things like Super Metroid and Metroidvania, meaning like, you know,

1908
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Symphony of the Night and so forth. It really kind of can be traced back to a game like

1909
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Castlevania II, which I love imperfections and all. And Badass Soundtrack, most importantly.

1910
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Absolutely Badass Soundtrack.

1911
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Speaking of classics, more PlayStation 1 or PS1 games are going to be out on the PlayStation

1912
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:18,000
network in January and February, thanks to Monkey Paw Games. The big release they're

1913
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
going to come out with on February 18th is Tomba 2, The Evil Swine Return. I remember

1914
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:31,000
the Tomba games. The original Tomba is already out. That came out in 2012. But some other

1915
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:37,000
games that will be coming out, Double Dragon, the Neo Geo Double Dragon. This is the one

1916
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,000
that's based on the film adaptation of Double Dragon. That's why they got that out of the

1917
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,000
way first, I'm thinking. But some other games that are coming out, let's see, Lucifer Ring,

1918
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:54,000
The Fireman 2, Pete and Danny, Hyper Crazy Climber, and Wolf Fang. So these are obviously

1919
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
very niche, kind of cult titles. But I think that's really cool because, you know, a whole

1920
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,000
new audience can kind of find these now thanks to PlayStation Network. So that's neat. And

1921
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:10,000
lastly, if you were looking forward to Star Wars 1313, you might be waiting a long time

1922
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
because unfortunately, Star Wars 1313, although we saw it at E3 2012, we knew it was going

1923
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:19,000
to have some issues once Disney bought LucasArts. Well, Disney let the trademark on Star Wars

1924
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
1313 lapse. And that's not a good sign. That means they probably aren't doing anything

1925
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:30,000
with it now unless maybe they could have took some of it and put it in a new game. And that's

1926
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,000
probably what's happened with this is that they are making it work for a different video

1927
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:40,000
game to come out in 2015 with the new movie. You basically said the same thing when the

1928
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:45,000
acquisition happened. But we basically knew that this happened when they shuttered LucasArts,

1929
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
at least as far as development, development such publisher is concerned. Right. But this

1930
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
was this was this. And I think some of us were explicitly called out as being I think

1931
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:58,000
some of us were holding out hope that maybe they would shuffle it around some didn't happen.

1932
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Didn't happen. They're saying all the rogue squad, rogue crap, not Rogue Squadron. That's

1933
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:12,000
the N64 and GameCube game. Attack Squadrons reached started sending out beta codes last

1934
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
week. I didn't get one, but I'm still holding out hope. Oh, all right. There is new Star

1935
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Wars content. So, yeah, it's still actually happening on over to dark soccer for the rest

1936
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:28,000
of our rapid fire news. Just a few things. Gabe Newell says he's fine with origin being

1937
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:33,000
on steam machines. He's not worried. In fact, he says we're trying to make it as open as

1938
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,000
possible. If he wants to put origin on it, that would be fine. Does origin even exist

1939
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:43,000
outside of Windows? Hmm. I don't think it does. He said, well, if he would have to make

1940
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:50,000
sure. Sure. But they're not they're not like if they want to, then they can. So, yay, that's

1941
01:57:50,000 --> 01:58:01,000
very kind of him. I don't think he has anything to worry about. And then there is a demo out

1942
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:12,000
for a He-Man playable side scroller and brawler. And it is available for PC on Gamejolt. And

1943
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
there's files for an Android version that's on a Dropbox. But you'd have to follow the

1944
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:23,000
link. And they're planning on making Shira as a playable character. Sweet. And then we

1945
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:28,000
have to find that little wizard guy hiding in the background somewhere. What's his name?

1946
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Orko. Orko. Yeah. And I think in for Shira, she had Madame Cal. So, no, no, not Madame

1947
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Cal. What am I saying? Cal was the owl thing. It was Madame Crap. Not Madame Crap, but I

1948
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,000
don't remember. Now I'm thinking about the He-Man movie from 1984. It was Dolph Lundgren.

1949
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And Courtney Cox was in that movie. I was one of our first roles. With her big hair.

1950
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
With her big hair. By the way, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. SEG is there

1951
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:04,000
to let us know. Origin is on the Mac. So there you go. And then last news. This is sad

1952
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:10,000
news. Is that the Doctor Who MMO is shutting down. As of February 28th, 2014, it will no

1953
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,000
longer be available. All the transactions have already been suspended. But we can still

1954
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:20,000
play Doctor Who Legacy. I didn't even know there was like a full on MMO out there. Yeah.

1955
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Because I keep seeing it turn up in what TV thing should be an MMO. Wasn't too interested.

1956
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Alright. Well, let's get into our coughing fits. Let's get into our FUGL question. Hey,

1957
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
I've been doing it all show. Let's get into our FUGL question of the week. You take Facebook

1958
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:47,000
and Google and slam them together, you get FUGL.

1959
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Every week we go to our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities. Available at facebook.com

1960
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
slash orange lounge radio and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio. And we ask a question

1961
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
and we read some of our favorite answers on air. Although I made it a little trickier

1962
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
tonight. So we've got less answers because of it and they're all short. But that's alright.

1963
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Because we love haikus. And sure enough. Haiku. Haikais. That's a completely different word.

1964
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Alright. Anyhow, the question we asked, so we're going to ask the obvious question, what

1965
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:25,000
would you do to boost sales of Nintendo products? But all answers must be written as a haiku.

1966
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Five syllables, seven syllables, five. Let's see how many people broke the rule. I will

1967
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:32,000
be the haiku enforcer. Will you be the syllable police tonight? I will be. Alright, let's

1968
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
go to Google Plus first because I always forget to start with Google Plus. So I'm going to

1969
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,000
start with them tonight. So let's start with act deft. I'm going to actually dim the music

1970
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:44,000
here to make it a little easier for you to be the syllable police. Alright, here we go.

1971
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Act deft. To avoid a flop. Nintendo needs games a lot. New marketing works. That pass?

1972
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:58,000
That passes. Alright, good. That's actually really well written. Yeah, that's good. That

1973
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:07,000
goes together very well. Retertainment. Create a better. Platform for online gameplay. Also

1974
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:14,000
boobs, boobs, boobs. That was awful. There was no artistry to that. You fail. But it

1975
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
passes. It passes. It passes five, seven, five and that's all I need to do. It passed

1976
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:22,000
five, seven, five and you worked boobs into it. So I'm okay with it. I give that a 10

1977
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:30,000
out of 10. No, no, no, no. It's a 17 out of 17. You need to stop. Total syllables. Five,

1978
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:39,000
seven. Just stop. Paul L. I'll see myself out. Paul L. Here we go with Paul L. on Google

1979
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:48,000
plus. Drop the price by half. Unique use of the touch pad. Pokemon Wii U. There you go.

1980
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Very good. These are awesome. See, I love haiku nights on Fugu question of the week.

1981
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:58,000
I should do haikus everywhere. Excuse me. Haiku. We should do this show in haiku. That's

1982
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,000
never going to happen with my big mouth, her big mouth, your big mouth. No, maybe five

1983
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:07,000
hours, seven hours, five hours. All right. And you definitely being the seven. Let's

1984
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:13,000
be real here. I have to work in the morning. All right. Travis H. Please give us more games.

1985
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Wii U smells kind of moldy. Do not do cell phones. But then in parentheses, he put mobile

1986
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
gaming rumor barf. I think you're not allowed to have four lines, sir. Not, not quite. Not

1987
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
quite. Last one. Oh, wait, no, do not do. Yeah, that's, that's, yeah, there's something

1988
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:35,000
at the seven. It was like a bonus. It was like the bonus scene on the DVD. It was like

1989
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:41,000
the extra line. All right. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Minus that extraneous sentence. Anyways,

1990
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:48,000
there you go. Facebook tech 2030 on Facebook. Pokemon is what Nintendo must use to save

1991
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:55,000
their failing console. It passes. I'm failing is a strong word, but I, again, it's, it's

1992
02:02:55,000 --> 02:03:01,000
hard to sugar coat the numbers. It needs to do better. A degenerate Johnny expand a first

1993
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:09,000
party. Nintendo must be Disney. Buy up third parties. That's what Nintendo should do. All

1994
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:12,000
right. You're not going to put games on the system. Fine. We'll just fucking buy you with

1995
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,000
all this cash we have on hand. I wonder if they have, I can buy and sell you bitch. Probably

1996
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
not. No. Realistically, they probably don't have enough to buy EA, but you never know.

1997
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Not EA, not EA, but their market caps are past Sony. So then maybe we should just buy

1998
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,000
some, no bloody bloody blah. It was a terrible. I understand how finances work. All right.

1999
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Renee in a, for our buddy from Koopa club responds with the following Nintendo only

2000
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:43,000
has to do one simple thing. HD retro games, NES remix. Anyone?

2001
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Eh, any S remix? I already told you my issues with that. Baseball is not a fucking retro

2002
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:55,000
classic. All right. Neither is wrecking crew. Other than the horror. No, nevermind.

2003
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Continue please. No need to do their own version of super Mario crossover. There's only. Yeah.

2004
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Right now. That would be awesome. Like honestly, just why don't just do super Mario crossover.

2005
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I mean, all respect to the guys who made it, but since they kind of took a bunch of that

2006
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Nintendo's characters, Nintendo stealing their game would only be fair play. All right.

2007
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Our buddy Flaco Jones responds and says, no more 3DS games,

2008
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:25,000
no more 2DS games, no more Wii U games. I don't think that's a haiku.

2009
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Someone missed the memo. You missed the memo. Just Nintendo games that play on all current

2010
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,000
Nintendo consoles. They're all dual screen anyway, so it's not a huge stretch. You didn't do a haiku.

2011
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Boo. Sort of. Boo. Sometimes. All right. KJ. Fatal frame Wii U.

2012
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Lots of ghosts and scares for you. Body not ready.

2013
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,000
That was four seven, four seven five. Unfortunately, no fatal frame Wii U.

2014
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
That's five. I just police the police. Well, all right. I'm going to say

2015
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,000
the next one I'm going to save for last because that's my favorite. So we're going to do that last.

2016
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,000
All right. Dark charger said frame Wii U though. I mean, I liked fours engine.

2017
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:11,000
And if they smooth out some of the rough edges and oh my God. OK. All right.

2018
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Dark charger says, understand online, focus on games, not gimmicks, cross platform support.

2019
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I'm not sure what else. What cross platform or maybe 3DS.

2020
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Eddie, who hasn't been on this show in forever. He really thinks that games should be not exclusive.

2021
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Nintendo to boost software. And that will be the first foot in the grave if that happens.

2022
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:37,000
All right. Our buddy Eddie, who used to go by the doctor on this show and I hope he comes back someday.

2023
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I miss I miss his face. Eddie says, Legend of Zelda. Be unapologetic.

2024
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Oh my God. That's a hard word. Rage against machine.

2025
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Critical Myth says, Abandon Wii U. Publish to competitors.

2026
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Focus on handheld. Again, I know that's what people want, but we'll focus on handheld.

2027
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
That's published on competitors over a Wada's dead body.

2028
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:08,000
All right. Awesome Unicorn. I love that name.

2029
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:16,000
So Awesome Unicorn says, To play is to love. Nintendo's strength and downfall.

2030
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Price drop. More titles. That was strangely poetic. I like that one.

2031
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:26,000
All right. Renee sent a couple more haikus, but one haiku per person.

2032
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Fifth Dream responds and says, Any games but these? Zelda, Mario, Metroid. Do something new, please.

2033
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Michael H wrote a response that definitely was not a haiku. Sorry, sir.

2034
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Rob H. Definitely not a haiku. Sorry, sir. But Fifth Dream responded, which I think is a haiku.

2035
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Fifth Dream says, One of the best games Nintendo needs to reboot. Hey, you, Pikachu.

2036
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Oh, yeah. That'll do wonders for them.

2037
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:04,000
All right. But here it is. This is the winner. You get a gold star, sir. This is my favorite out of all the responses. You ready?

2038
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Here you go. Gold star haiku, but I need it to be policed. From Red the Haze.

2039
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Sorry. I love this haiku. Okay, here we go. Ready?

2040
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Price drop. Price drop drop drop. Wub wub wub wub wub wub. M-rated games, please.

2041
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:33,000
It passes. Price drop. Price drop. Price drop drop drop. Wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub.

2042
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
No. You win, sir. You win an internet. Congratulations. No.

2043
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Red the Haze, your username has never been more appropriate considering that Rob's face is being red right now.

2044
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Price drop. Price drop drop drop wub wub wub wub wub. No.

2045
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I'm gonna be- I'm gonna be like walking to the mall tomorrow for some sale or something and I'm just gonna be in the middle of the mall.

2046
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Yeah. I'm gonna start strutting. Price drop. Price drop drop wub wub wub wub wub.

2047
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
All right. Well, I'm glad we could laugh on this episode for once.

2048
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:09,000
All right. Hey, we've been having a good time. We've been having a good time.

2049
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
We've been having quite the gay old time.

2050
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,000
All right. Actually, Black Wolf says I could give him loot. That's right. I could assign him specific loot. Maybe I will do that.

2051
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,000
I'll see if he has a VoG network account. I'll give him some type of- I'll give him a cherry blossom or something because he's such a haiku.

2052
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Give him the- Give him a dubstep gun. A dubstep gun. Yeah, I was gonna say a dubstep gun.

2053
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Well, I'm not- We can't give things that are copyright. Like, I can't give out Mickey Mouse ears.

2054
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Give him an extraneous bass EDM gun. All right.

2055
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Give him a golden 575. There you go. All right.

2056
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Hey, that's a good idea. There you go. All right.

2057
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:46,000
And to make like ripples for the bass. Like, 575 with a big button in it. Sorry.

2058
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
All right. We'll figure something out.

2059
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I'm sorry. Tigerclaws said haiku dubstep. Let's make it happen.

2060
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I only keep thinking about is there's a- You know what Enka is, right?

2061
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Yes, I do.

2062
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
There's an Enka singer who-

2063
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
In case the listeners don't, you might want to explain.

2064
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:12,000
It's really sad, sappy. It's done a really melancholy style and it's pretty much just for- just a Japanese style.

2065
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:22,000
But there's a singer out there who is a quarter Japanese named Jetero and he does Enka hip-hop style.

2066
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:28,000
And that's all I was thinking about is Jetero. He does nothing but Enka covers hip-hop style.

2067
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:34,000
So, anyway. I have like his last two albums. They're very good.

2068
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Well, for all the big audience looking for that. All right.

2069
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Yes, I like Enka. Shut up.

2070
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
All right. Let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

2071
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:50,000
All right. So, let's see. I was kind of distracted by it. I was actually looking at a further topic here.

2072
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Let's talk a little bit about baseball. And, you know, it's funny. We had a baseball series.

2073
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Well, the 2K series just kind of up and cancel itself.

2074
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Now, we have an old baseball series coming back. And RBI Baseball is that series.

2075
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:15,000
It's RBI Baseball 14. It's supposed to be coming out from Time Warner Interactive.

2076
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Or, yes, I'm sorry. The Time Warner Interactive did the original one.

2077
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:24,000
But this one's supposed to be coming out on consoles and mobile.

2078
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:31,000
And it doesn't really say on who's developing yet. But, I don't know.

2079
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:37,000
It's interesting to see that coming back. I don't know if it's actually going to be like a full-fledged game.

2080
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,000
You know, when they mention mobile, I always think something, you know, very quick being done.

2081
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:48,000
But it'd be interesting to see yet another series and hopefully something that's actually on the Xbox.

2082
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Because right now the only option for baseball is, you know, MLB 14 the show.

2083
02:10:54,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Yeah, something that finally gets baseball games back in the limelight considering the news we've been reporting on over the last month.

2084
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Yeah. I'm surprised they couldn't, like, have, you know, they just gave up on that.

2085
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
You know, maybe just 2K Sports, they've been doing pretty good stuff with NBA.

2086
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:16,000
I'm surprised that they couldn't do that same type of thing with MLB. I don't know.

2087
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,000
As much as I like the whole idea of like, ooh, retro with RBI baseball.

2088
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
You know, obviously I'm not a big sports gaming person anyway.

2089
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
But I don't remember RBI baseball really being a particular favorite of mine.

2090
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
So, when I kind of hear this is coming back, I'm like, eh.

2091
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Maybe it's just one of those things where it's like in name only. I don't know.

2092
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:36,000
Well, and also too, you know, not everything that comes back was necessarily great.

2093
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Because remember they did a redo of Tecmo Bowl and I don't think that was that great on the Wii either.

2094
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:46,000
It really wasn't, which was really unfortunate. It just wasn't the same as the original.

2095
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Or Blitz. You know, remember Blitz? They tried to make it all hardcore.

2096
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Or NBA Jam. Oh my God, the new NBA Jam was really not good.

2097
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Yeah.

2098
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:59,000
So, yeah, sometimes it's just not the same. But it could also end up being better. Who knows?

2099
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Speaking of reboots, here's a game that they rebooted and it came out way better.

2100
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Like, it was for the better for it. And it's Tomb Raider.

2101
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
And there is yet some more news coming out on Tomb Raider as we're heading into the, what is it?

2102
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:16,000
The definitive Lora's Hair edition. You know, the one that's coming out soon.

2103
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Definitive and game of the year.

2104
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
I was going to say, definitive game of the year edition or whatever.

2105
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:28,000
So, Tomb Raider is, the big kind of buzz quote about the story this week is that

2106
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Tomb Raider is finally in the black. Meaning it's finally been a profitable game.

2107
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:39,000
And this goes back to that story where they mentioned that Square Enix at one point had said,

2108
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:44,000
oh, very disappointed that the game didn't sell, you know, what it was supposed to.

2109
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And only 3.4 million. Well, they were expecting 5 to 6 million.

2110
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Well, a lot of that has to do with the cost to make the game. Because, you know, pretty games don't come cheap.

2111
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:05,000
So, the news got around and in an interview with Eurogamer, executive producer Scott Amos said that quote,

2112
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:13,000
by the end of last year, Tomb Raider is in the black. We've crossed the line of profitability for the last gen and PC versions.

2113
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:18,000
And so I imagine the definitive edition, I mean, I don't want to call it a cash in.

2114
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Because, you know, obviously it looks like they've done more than just port the game to the other system.

2115
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
So I want to give it a little more credit than that.

2116
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:29,000
But obviously it's kind of a way to put it even further in the black, let's say.

2117
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I imagine a game like this didn't cost nearly that same amount of money to end up making.

2118
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:38,000
So to try to get this out there for the people that might have missed Tomb Raider the first time,

2119
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:44,000
you know, now that they're getting PlayStation 4s in the house or what have you, or Xbox Ones is the case maybe.

2120
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I imagine, you know, it's going to push itself even further into the black and hopefully justify the continuation of the series.

2121
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Because I think all of us here at OLR, as well as you guys in chat and so forth,

2122
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
we'd like to see a sequel in this style of Tomb Raider. At least I know I would.

2123
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I hope that if they do do a sequel, however, though, that we get to start in Loras' mansion and commit suicide in hideous ways,

2124
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
just like in the original PC game.

2125
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
That was great. That was in the second one.

2126
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Or as Dark Sakura will call it, Girl 2.

2127
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I need to find that picture again and link it to everybody.

2128
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I have to thank Alan for the idea.

2129
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Other continued comments from that interview.

2130
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
As a franchise, Square Enix has clearly invested in us.

2131
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:34,000
They already let us get kickstarted on a sequel and they backed us with the game's upcoming definitive edition.

2132
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
That's right. We already knew it because that comic thing had spoiled and they had to come out and say,

2133
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
yes, we're doing something else. So there you go.

2134
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,000
They've always been behind us regardless of maybe what was said or how it was said in the press.

2135
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:50,000
And certainly at the end of the year, we've actually gone over expectations because we've managed to get profitability back.

2136
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:55,000
So great. Can't wait to see what's next in that franchise.

2137
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
It'll be a lot of fun.

2138
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:01,000
All right. Let's go on with some more stories. Dark Sakura.

2139
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Well, I have a story.

2140
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:09,000
As soon as my tablet stops choking. There we go.

2141
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:21,000
Basically, Valve has paid the community content creators four hundred thousand dollars collectively in the first week of January.

2142
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
They they did it during.

2143
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
They actually came up with a statement on Steam Day.

2144
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:34,000
And the content, you know, like we all know, is just regular people out there making content to resell.

2145
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:44,000
You know, whether it be Team Fortress 2 stuff or, you know, making gifts for other people, making.

2146
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,000
You know, there's all kinds of different games and items that have come out.

2147
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:54,000
So. Steam's paying for it. So they're like, thank you. Here, have money.

2148
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Which makes me kind of want to do hats now. Should I make hats, Rob?

2149
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Hats would be awesome, actually. So. Very cool. All right.

2150
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Well, let's move on with just a couple more stories for the mailbag. Loki.

2151
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Yes. So, you know, you may have heard that there's been some multiplayer alpha invites going out for Titanfall.

2152
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And of course, all of them are under NDA, which means we need to upload that shit to the Internet as fast as possible.

2153
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:35,000
And that's what's happened. So there's a lot of gameplay from Titanfall making it out to the Internet.

2154
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:41,000
And I don't know, I've actually checked out some of it. It looks better than I thought it would be.

2155
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:47,000
And looks actually quite fun. Although, you know, some of the stuff in there is very early.

2156
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Like the textures are only 25%. As detailed as they're going to be in the final version.

2157
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Which, that being said, they still look really good already, so I don't know.

2158
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:10,000
And then also the gameplay looks pretty fast. It just looks interesting. I don't know. Very fast paced.

2159
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:15,000
So I probably have to check that out on 360 when it comes out.

2160
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Yeah, if you're looking for some video, check out Dailymotion, because they seem to have a lot of gameplay feeds on there.

2161
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Yeah, I was checking out one of those bootleg feeds. It looks pretty cool.

2162
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Yeah, it does. And I mean, it looks like there's still a lot of people running around, even though it's only 6 on 6.

2163
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:42,000
There's a lot of AI players and stuff in there, and the mechs and everything is still pretty crazy.

2164
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:48,000
So I don't think the 6 on 6 now, after seeing all the people complain about it, is going to be that big of an issue.

2165
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
I always thought that discussion was way overhyped. I didn't think that was going to cripple the game at all.

2166
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I am a little concerned that the AI is as stupid as it is in the video that they're being shown me.

2167
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Because this game is only a couple months out, or not even, like pretty much a month and a half away.

2168
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:11,000
So hopefully they can fix that in time.

2169
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Alright. Well, let's go to the mailbag.

2170
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:20,000
You know, we encourage you to send your emails and feedback to the show at mailbag at orangelaundraider.com.

2171
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:25,000
And every week, usually DarkSakura will dive in the mailbag head first and pull out an email.

2172
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
There's that diving thing again.

2173
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Why can't I cannonball or belly flop?

2174
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Well, this week DarkSakura is pouting at the top of the diving board saying, I want to cannonball.

2175
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,000
So Jason will have to dive instead.

2176
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,000
She's the little kid throwing a hissy fit on the side of the pool.

2177
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,000
But it's wet! And it's cold! And it's water!

2178
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I think right now I have the perfect voice to do whiny three-year-old.

2179
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I don't want you in the mailbag!

2180
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Oh, you are correct in that assumption.

2181
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
So listeners, thank you for that one.

2182
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Woohoo!

2183
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Alright.

2184
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Woohoo!

2185
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Well, for those that are still connected and listening to the show after that.

2186
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Jason, if you wouldn't mind.

2187
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Rob-a-bub-a-bub-a-bub-a-bub-a says...

2188
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Oh, speaking of Rob.

2189
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Rob and Jason talked about how racy content is getting onto the PSN livestreams.

2190
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
PS4 livestreams.

2191
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:21,000
I looked on Tuesday and I can thankfully say I didn't find anything sexually charged.

2192
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
That must be mostly a weekend thing.

2193
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Yeah, weekend holidays.

2194
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:31,000
There was a guy drinking himself drunk and another getting high off camera.

2195
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
But there was also a guy jamming on his electric guitar to make things a bit better.

2196
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Then I read the chat and it was awful!

2197
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:44,000
They made fun of the way the people on camera looked, dressed, acted, and they also made the most disgusting situations.

2198
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
From what pit do these words come from?

2199
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I'm not one for censorship, but it tested my resolve.

2200
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I'm all about self-censorship, so I turned that crap off.

2201
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:58,000
The language being used by the broadcasters themselves wasn't too clean either, but that's another issue.

2202
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:15,000
So, yeah, even if the content on screen isn't rolling with it, the masses can say what they want to say, and it usually leans in a very particular direction.

2203
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:23,000
The chat is almost worse in many ways than what's being offered out there on PlayStation 4 because the stories we were telling last week,

2204
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:29,000
obviously those were some of the big horror stories, if you will, but that's not all the feeds.

2205
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:35,000
I mean, once again, I was trying to find a shocking feed to show Dark Sakura before the show tonight because she wasn't here last week to hear,

2206
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,000
well, I mean, she heard the discussion, but she wasn't here to participate in it.

2207
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,000
But when I looked at those feeds today, I was like, ah, there really isn't anything that scandalous.

2208
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:45,000
There was some girl there that was, she had an accent. She's like Australian maybe.

2209
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:49,000
She was sitting there and it was just, she was just sitting there reading the chat and responding to it.

2210
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:56,000
But then once again, looking at the chat, people would say things like, you know, it was just, you know, calling her names and stuff like that.

2211
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
It's just pretty disgusting.

2212
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I don't see why people think that that's okay.

2213
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:06,000
You know, they've got this layer of anonymity being on the internet, but I still don't think...

2214
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
That's enough.

2215
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
And sometimes it takes less than that.

2216
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:21,000
In the end, in the end, in the end, what I don't see is how people fundamentally think that it is okay to speak to another human being that way, even if they are hidden by anonymity.

2217
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:24,000
By no means am I defending it. I'm sure you know that.

2218
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:32,000
And if any of you listening to this have done it, I want you to go find whoever you've done it to and apologize before I spank you.

2219
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Because clearly you weren't taught to respect other people and I don't want that type of behavior associated with the show.

2220
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:47,000
I think the people that listen to this show and have made it this far in this show are too smart to do something like that. I really hope.

2221
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:52,000
And if you're going to be an ass to someone, at least have the decency to put your name on it.

2222
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:56,000
You know, have the vagina to do it.

2223
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Have the, have the uteral strength to do it because as we all know, balls are squishy.

2224
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:13,000
I, this conversation is kind of interesting. I've never really, I've never really said anything about it myself, but like, I don't think I've ever been anonymous asshole on the internet.

2225
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:23,000
And I've said shit in bad moods, you know, whether, whether, I don't want to say people deserve it, but whether argumentative or not, you know, I've, I can, I can get nasty.

2226
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I kind of realized that sometimes I do that myself. And when I get in that mood, now I have a filter to just get the hell off the computer and do something else slash sleep.

2227
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Because it's usually fucking three o'clock in the morning.

2228
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:47,000
But like there are some people that I'm not necessarily on bad terms with, but I just have snarky approaching snide reactions to.

2229
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:53,000
And when they do something that I expect, I'll, I'll call them out on it.

2230
02:22:53,000 --> 02:23:04,000
And I don't know, these are, these are very different things though, because these are, these are things that I've formed with people versus people that I don't know that that shirt makes you look stupid.

2231
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:07,000
That's what are you a lumberjack? I don't know.

2232
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Well, you know, this is actually why I actually became a moderator on DDR Freak back in the day is because just the way that people would talk to each other was absolutely horrible.

2233
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:21,000
You and me both, not to mention my form, my section didn't exactly have a lot of the time.

2234
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:32,000
That's actually how I got offered my position is because I was playing babysitter in my favorite forums, trying to get people to play nice because I wanted to see what people had to say and not see people just bitch at each other.

2235
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:52,000
And that also got me on Gorillaz Unofficial back in the day. You know, it was, I have this thing where the moment someone starts insulting or treating somebody else in a sexist or racist or anything ist manner, they instantly lose all manner of respect.

2236
02:23:52,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I don't treat them as an intelligent human being anymore. I don't deal with them. I cut them out. They are no longer existing to me.

2237
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I made a point last week when we were talking about this, that it's not even an ist. Maybe there's a word that ends in this that describes it, but it's just a nasty mentality.

2238
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:22,000
And it doesn't have to be born out of any sort of a prejudice. People will do these things because it satisfies a need.

2239
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:32,000
It's the bully mentality. It's the put down someone to make yourself feel better. It's using the internet as validation.

2240
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,000
To an extent. That among other things, no doubt.

2241
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
In and of itself is super unhealthy.

2242
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
It is.

2243
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:52,000
So first of all, if people want validation, they need to earn their damn validation. And secondly, they need to validate themselves, not look towards putting somebody else down or telling them to kill themselves or bullying somebody.

2244
02:24:52,000 --> 02:25:02,000
There was another article, too, that I was reading today about a guy in God for the Life of Me. I can't remember his first name, but his last name is Hassan Hassan or something like that.

2245
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:14,000
He's a writer that outed a transgendered inventor. And she said, you know, please don't say what my birth gender is because that's going to count as it's going to lead to a hate crime or something.

2246
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:25,000
And it turned out that I read his article and he did it in such an insensitive way and did out out this lady and she killed herself.

2247
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:36,000
And it's just that level of insensitivity that people have towards respecting other people. There is no respect when you don't see them face to face.

2248
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Everyone needs to realize that there is another human being on the other side of that monitor.

2249
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:51,000
This is actually something that I didn't think about the Bay Area is that I've met a lot of diverse people in a lot of very particular ways over the last year.

2250
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Any other comments? Any other comments?

2251
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Well, it's just a mindfulness that people should have.

2252
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:03,000
It is. People aren't naturally extroverted enough to understand that, though.

2253
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:10,000
And people will also say that, oh, you're just being too PC or you're being too strict.

2254
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Why don't you just let people say what you're going to say?

2255
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,000
God forbid you treat people like people.

2256
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Exactly. It's because and I also posted a link to another article earlier on my Tumblr about casual racism, how we have these phrases and sayings that are built into our language.

2257
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:32,000
But in the end, do we really know where they came from and do we know how, you know, the origins of them, how hurtful they are?

2258
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:36,000
And we just say things and don't think about how we treat other people.

2259
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:41,000
You know, every every one of you listeners, you are each an individual and special person.

2260
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:44,000
And certainly calling, you know, in calling things gay.

2261
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:49,000
The word retarded, retarded, which is really, you know, I've I've been bad and use that and I really shouldn't.

2262
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Or saying someone is autistic when they're just socially awkward.

2263
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Yeah. Which trust me, I know what autism is.

2264
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Anyway, in the interest of time, I got to ask for your next email.

2265
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:07,000
No, it's all right. It's just good discussion, but just as I have said at least two or three times before.

2266
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Be awesome to people. Those those people that they are people, too.

2267
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:14,000
They have their own lives in as much history as they've lived up to this point.

2268
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:20,000
And it's actually something phenomenal. And if you don't care, then don't bother.

2269
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:25,000
There are 60 million things that could kill you every day, including yourself.

2270
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And if you've lived this long, kudos to you. You're awesome.

2271
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Next email. I just found plans for next weekend.

2272
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:39,000
This is frauds in the intro. Hey, all our crew.

2273
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Hp here. This email is mostly for more as he's expressed the most interest in the speed runs from awesome games done quick.

2274
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:51,000
But I think other people might be interested as well. At the convention AOD.

2275
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:54,000
The convention AOD. I don't know what AOD stands for.

2276
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Maybe it'll make sense in a minute. At the convention AOD being held next Saturday, the 25th at the SFO Marriott near Berlin game.

2277
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:09,000
The speed runners from AGDQ Trihex, who formerly held the world record for Yoshi's Island 100 percent, now third.

2278
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Cosmo Wright, who formerly held who formerly held the world records for Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker and Commander King 4.

2279
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:26,000
And ROM Scout, who holds the world record for Castlevania Symphony of the Night, will be hosting a panel about speed running at 6 p.m.,

2280
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:31,000
followed by a panel hosted by Dasset Bro, an EVO commentator on fighting games and the community.

2281
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:39,000
It'll be a great chance to learn more about the art and ask questions you might not get answered as candidly if you are asking questions in their chat.

2282
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Run Mrs. AOD's anime overdose.

2283
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Oh. Oh, so con this weekend. OK. I tried Googling it a couple times and I wasn't getting anything.

2284
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:58,000
I was getting a Tomb Raider old something. I know it was mentioned on the show, but I'm so amazed, surprised and proud these gamers were able to raise over a million dollars for charity.

2285
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:02,000
And I'm excited to get the chance to tell them how great I think they are for doing it.

2286
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:06,000
So anyone who's free next Saturday and around the Bay Area, stop on by.

2287
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I'm freaking there. Hell, yes. Awesome.

2288
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:14,000
I would love to go, but that's not going to happen.

2289
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Not that I don't think this is great. Just, you know, the trip and everything. But please.

2290
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Oh, it's going to be big. Send our love.

2291
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Damn, that's going to be exciting. All right.

2292
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Suppolar. I'll try to be brief for anyone. There's a nasty canasta for anyone, including Mr. Black Wolf, if he's around, who's used or reads about the Oculus Rift.

2293
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Has there been any issues brought up with people who have vision problems?

2294
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I'd like to try the rift someday, but I am near sighted in my left eye, so I'm afraid I won't be able to enjoy it.

2295
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Unrelated, but because of my eye problem, I cannot see 3D images, not even on my 3DS.

2296
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:59,000
This is a principal article that Sir Black Wolf wrote up on the site in the start of December, mid-November, one of the two.

2297
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I'm laughing because I don't want to say it's the exact same thing, but Bobby has a vision impairment that's exactly what you're describing.

2298
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,000
And you know how much he talks about the rift.

2299
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:17,000
And keep in mind, the whole point of, and I've been sort of phrasing it incorrectly, that it's specifically lenticular 3D.

2300
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Well, it kind of is, but if you've ever ripped one of the little 3DS files on it, it's actually two images that are superimposed at different opacities.

2301
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:33,000
And it's meant for one eye to read one part of the image, and the other eye to read the other part of the image.

2302
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:38,000
And if you don't have that synchronization between your eyes, you're not going to see it. You're going to see a blur.

2303
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:44,000
SaganChat says, to answer the writer, wait till they develop their tech to solve these problems.

2304
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,000
It's true. It's not totally done yet either.

2305
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:51,000
But keep in mind, there's more to it than just the 3D imagery.

2306
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:55,000
That whole sensation of looking around and having the movement, that's a lot too.

2307
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:02,000
And I think, well, you know, like I said, Bobby, and he wrote an article on the site about it, so go dig through the things he's written on the rift.

2308
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Because he explains exactly what his vision thing is that's going on, and how he still enjoys the rift.

2309
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
So you might find that it's a very similar story to what you've got.

2310
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,000
If you're a PlayStation owner or PC owner, go check out DC Universe Online.

2311
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Yes, I know, DC, but it is more of like a beat-em-up style MMO, and it's a little more fast-paced.

2312
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,000
And I think is exactly the type of thing you're looking for there.

2313
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I honestly did find some enjoyment with Ragnarok Online too.

2314
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Because, I mean, it has a lot of that same repetitive beating over and over.

2315
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
But it was a little bit easier to control.

2316
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I think you're always going to find floatiness in an MMO.

2317
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:05,000
You know, just the nature of multiplayer, not to mention massively multiplayer, things are a hell of a lot more difficult.

2318
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:12,000
And so, for the foreseeable future, until internet and processing speeds and everything else improve dramatically,

2319
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:18,000
MMOs may not be your cup of tea, as I've resigned myself to think right now.

2320
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:25,000
In the chat, the individual I keep saying is 13x forever, but Jason pointed out to me it might actually be Lex forever, L-E-X forever.

2321
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:31,000
It says WildStar, it's awesome for an MMO. I've been hearing a lot of good stuff about WildStar too, I want to check that out.

2322
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Lastly, since I kind of broke Jason's brain because he had to rush through reading my last email, here's a link to a huge roguelike wiki, since he said he likes them so much.

2323
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:52,000
O-R-G-U-E-B-A-S-I-N dot com. I will definitely be partaking of this as soon as I get back.

2324
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Assuming I don't just get back, crawl in bed, and pass out like immediately.

2325
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Thank you, Nasty Canasta.

2326
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:02,000
That's a phrase I like to utter on this show. Thank you, Nasty Canasta.

2327
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:06,000
One more email from Brozime.

2328
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Hey O-L-R, I'm a relatively new listener since about episode 500 and normally can't listen live due to work. However, having just listened to your discussion about the good and bad of streaming from last week, I would like to know what you think about the mandatory stream delay of about a minute on Twitch.

2329
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I think it's a huge issue since most streams I watch, I do so because the host interacts with the chat. For me personally, I stream to my friends to record commentary for YouTube.

2330
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Since they imposed this new delay in lieu of the consoles getting streaming functionality, it's been impossible to do either of the things we had the possibility of doing before.

2331
02:33:53,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I really love listening to O-L-R to keep my brain working at work. Hope you guys stick around, and I'm sorry if my grammar isn't tip-top, dark sucker.

2332
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Well, thankfully you get the leeway of me, but unfortunately my own brain tiredness today packed everything.

2333
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I still got the sense of what was being said, and a funny little story that I wrote about the day before.

2334
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:25,000
My own brain tiredness today packed everything. I still got the sense of what was being said, and a funny little story that I want to relay to this listener is that, guess what?

2335
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:36,000
When we do this show here at Orange Lawn Radio and interact with our chat room, we're facing the same delay because of the fact that the setup we have here is actually slower than Twitch.

2336
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:48,000
When we used to broadcast the video for this show live on Justin TV, just to give you an idea how long ago it was, when we used to broadcast the video of the show here and we had a different setup because we had the space that could accommodate for it better,

2337
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:54,000
they would actually see things first on Justin before our listeners would hear it, which I always hated.

2338
02:34:54,000 --> 02:35:03,000
I mean, no disrespect, it's just the fact that I wanted the video to always be secondary to the audio because it is Orange Lawn Radio, but I'm digressing a little bit.

2339
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:13,000
My point is that you still can work with that delay. Don't let it ruin what you want to do. Just figure out how you can kind of adapt with that delay.

2340
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:25,000
But I'm not saying to you, oh, just suck it up, baby. I'm not saying that because, yeah, that sucks when you want to do that commenting and for the YouTube and you need to have that instant feedback.

2341
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I do run into that problem almost all the time. Shane and I will be live streaming things and he'll be on Skype and the way he sees the game is he's watching me on the feed.

2342
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:40,000
And I'll do something and he'll laugh or I'll laugh and he'll be like, what just happened? I have to describe it to him because he hasn't seen it yet.

2343
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:52,000
And it doesn't make for the best feed. But what makes for a better feed, and maybe this is something to think about, maybe it'll work for you, maybe it won't, is if Shane and I or whoever I happen to be gaming with, if we're playing the game together,

2344
02:35:52,000 --> 02:36:03,000
then if something funny happens, we both just saw it in the game. He's not having to rely on my feed. I realize that doesn't work for every scenario, but just think of it as a new barrier to work around.

2345
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Don't let it ruin what you're trying to do. But at the same time, it does kind of suck that people were used to it one way and then all of a sudden it changed.

2346
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:21,000
And if you did adapt to the old rules, it sucks to have the rules changed on you like that. But look at it as a challenge, not as something to end you.

2347
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:30,000
It's not a rule, it's literally a technical limitation. What would you rather have, a cap or low latency?

2348
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:35,000
And the answer is that two different people want two different things.

2349
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,000
I'm letting the e-mailer talk back to you right now.

2350
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:41,000
I'm letting the e-mailer speak for himself. Well, we're gonna be waiting here for a while.

2351
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
That's right, you wanna talk about delay.

2352
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:52,000
No, yeah, we covered that. And I don't think I ever realized that Twitch streams were near to live.

2353
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:56,000
I also have really no basis of comparison because it's people just doing their thing.

2354
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:03,000
And otherwise, you know, mostly popular people. And no, not even that.

2355
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I've watched fighting game streams of my friend who doesn't read the chat except in between matches because you don't fight and watch chat at the same time.

2356
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:22,000
So I've not seen the content like Rob's talking about where the delay is that impacting.

2357
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Because in most other cases, you can't keep up with chat that actively because you're playing a game.

2358
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:37,000
What game doesn't... I guess Playroom is actually a real fine answer to answer that argument.

2359
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Yeah, but Playroom needs a delay and they need moderators.

2360
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:48,000
Chat needs to be... I don't know. Chatting like commenting too just scourges of so much of the internet.

2361
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Bobby Blackwolf would like you to know that we actually did talk about this in the segment at the end of his show last week when he calls us.

2362
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:58,000
So a cheap plug for the Bobby Blackwolf show if you do wanna hear us talk about this a little more.

2363
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:03,000
I gotta ask, we keep things moving though. Sorry, new e-mailer and I'm saying let's move on.

2364
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:11,000
5.35, revisit our same arguments. It is unfortunate. Alternatives do exist. Do check out hitbox.tv.

2365
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Came out of the conversation last week. I looked at it today. It's gaming oriented but nothing in their terms say it has to be like literally a game.

2366
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:30,000
Alternatives exist. Find what works for you. Nico Nico, overseas. The Japan and now English site may also be feasible.

2367
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Maybe. Look for the tool that fits your needs. That's that.

2368
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Alright, thank you very much for reading those. Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

2369
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Hopefully next week we won't have an hour long Nintendo discussion at the top of the show and we can spend a little more time on those.

2370
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Nintendo bicker fight.

2371
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Alright, not really, not really. What I love about the show is that it's not really fighting, it's spirited debate.

2372
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:01,000
And yes, there is a big difference. There's a huge difference. Jason and I will hug it out later. Not in a sexual way. Get your head out of the gutter.

2373
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:07,000
But you know, I respect, just like Logie. Logie and I fight all the time on this stuff and it doesn't change anything.

2374
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:16,000
And we're still here. You three are here each and every. I've realized that this week. It's like, well yeah, we do this and we do this on the show.

2375
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I'm like, wow, this has become mildly second nature to me because I've been doing it so regularly.

2376
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
And that's how we've done it for 12 years now.

2377
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:30,000
And I mean, I literally don't know what the fuck else I do with myself. Like when I don't have a show on Sunday, I'm always kind of like in my mind.

2378
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I have so much time on Sunday nights. Where did this come from?

2379
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
And I'm like, oh, it's six o'clock. I should be on the air. Oh, I should be listening to Bobby. Right?

2380
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Well, I usually am listening to Bobby anyway, unless we're both off and then it's like, you know?

2381
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,000
All right. Anyway, focus. Let's get to the FUs of the week.

2382
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

2383
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
This is fucked up.

2384
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Um, FU to my voice not being able to lay back and the lingering cough that will not escape, even though I feel better.

2385
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,000
So, and then having to wake up at 6 a.m.

2386
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Mm-hmm. Uh, Jason.

2387
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
FU to Sunday drivers.

2388
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Frickin' Florian Perkins, Florian Perkins, whatever that road is down there.

2389
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Uh-huh.

2390
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I'm doing like frickin' 15, 20 miles an hour down it.

2391
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Hey, don't tell the listeners where I live, please.

2392
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:25,000
You don't live on Florian Perkins.

2393
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I know.

2394
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:27,000
They know it's in Sacramento.

2395
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Yeah.

2396
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I think.

2397
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Yeah, they do.

2398
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Somewhere in this great place.

2399
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
We're moving soon anyway, so it wouldn't even matter.

2400
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Peace out, y'all.

2401
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:39,000
No, I just, it was so weird. It was trying to turn and everybody was taking their dear sweet time.

2402
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Although at the same time, I was also rushing because I literally got the intro done 15 minutes before the show started.

2403
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:48,000
So I couldn't have possibly influenced it.

2404
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Um, there's probably another one, but whatever.

2405
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:59,000
My FU goes to these popcorn kernels because it's the worst addiction, but I'm totally that guy when I have microwave popcorn.

2406
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Like I've got to find those kernels that are like half popped and eat them because it's the best part.

2407
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Don't give me that look.

2408
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I'm not the only one that does it.

2409
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:07,000
I've just never heard of this before.

2410
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:11,000
You've never heard of it? You've got to try it because that's like the best part.

2411
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
I don't promise that I will.

2412
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:13,000
All right.

2413
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Anyhow, um, Loki.

2414
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Um, I guess FU being out of shape.

2415
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Maybe you need to get a Fitbit like me. We'll have Fitbit contests.

2416
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I don't know about that.

2417
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Me and Rob are friends on Fitbit now.

2418
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Yeah, we're friends on Fitbit.

2419
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Hopefully, hopefully each of us will inspire each other to walk and maintain step counts.

2420
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I am not getting one.

2421
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:36,000
That's all right.

2422
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,000
As like I said before the show, different strokes for different folks.

2423
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
All right.

2424
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:43,000
Let us do a couple more stories for you guys.

2425
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Then we'll get into the Skype line real quick tonight.

2426
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
I'm not going to leave it open forever.

2427
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
So if you want to get through, you're going to have to call pretty quick.

2428
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Two more stories first though.

2429
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
Starting with Loki.

2430
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:59,000
So hey, do you have an Oculus Rift and you happen to be a fan of Ready Player One?

2431
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Well, there's a tech demo for you.

2432
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:04,000
And that would be the Stax Rift demo.

2433
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:10,000
It allows you to walk through one of the locales of Ready Player One,

2434
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:16,000
which is stacks of mobile homes making these mobile home skyscrapers.

2435
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,000
So you can actually wander around those and check it out.

2436
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Looks kind of neat.

2437
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
All righty.

2438
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Too bad I don't have an Oculus Rift and I haven't read Ready Player One.

2439
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,000
But as a fan of the book, does this look interesting to you from what you're seeing?

2440
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

2441
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
All right.

2442
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Moving on, this looks great too.

2443
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
I need this game.

2444
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
This YouTube was all over Facebook and Twitter and stuff.

2445
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
If you haven't seen it, please look it up.

2446
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:45,000
It's a game called Cat Lateral Damage.

2447
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:48,000
It's Cat Lateral Damage.

2448
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
I saw this on a Tuesday.

2449
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
This is so good.

2450
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
I'm sorry, Jason.

2451
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
I'm going to have to play a video here.

2452
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Isn't that the game that Loki brought up for his game?

2453
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Oh, you had the name wrong?

2454
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
He might have mentioned it during his gaming week.

2455
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:09,000
But yes, you play a cat and what you do is you run around and you knock things off.

2456
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
Why? Because you're a cat.

2457
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Much like Loki's cat that he's complained about the last two weeks.

2458
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
So you run on these surfaces and that's all you do.

2459
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:21,000
And if you break enough valuables, you get combo points and so on and so on.

2460
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:24,000
It's a free download for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

2461
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Oh, I didn't even know it was already out.

2462
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
It needs maybe some work with sound effects a little bit.

2463
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
I mean, it is still in early alpha, but I love the concept.

2464
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:35,000
This could be like a Katamari Damacy style game.

2465
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I'm sure it was inspired by cats in general and any owner understands.

2466
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:48,000
But the particular inspiration in my mind from this game came from one very specific place.

2467
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
You know what that is?

2468
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
A little meme image that consists of a cat on a ledge with the words,

2469
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Fuck this thing, fuck that thing, fuck this thing in particular.

2470
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Fuck that, fuck that thing in particular.

2471
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Yes, I love that.

2472
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:04,000
I posted a picture, it was called CEO Kat.

2473
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Kat, person sitting at a desk.

2474
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
I should buy a boat.

2475
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Oh no, the one where he tips the coffee mug off the desk.

2476
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:14,000
I think I saw it recently, it was probably during the show, but yeah.

2477
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Sitting at a desk all nice.

2478
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Tip!

2479
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Perfect.

2480
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Exactly.

2481
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
So good.

2482
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Ah cats.

2483
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Alright.

2484
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
That's what the internet was really made for.

2485
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
We are going to open up the Skype line.

2486
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,000
It's open now.

2487
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:31,000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2488
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:34,000
If you have something you want to call in to the show to talk about tonight.

2489
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,000
Maybe, excuse me, something we talked about already or something we neglected to bring up.

2490
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Or a game you've been playing this week or maybe you have a thought on this whole Nintendo thing.

2491
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Go ahead and give us a call right now.

2492
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:46,000
The Skype line is open, but it will not be open very long.

2493
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Please hurry.

2494
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Meanwhile, while we wait for those calls to come in.

2495
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
Let's see if there's any last minute stories.

2496
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Loki, I always check in with you for last minute stories.

2497
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:02,000
Yeah, there's a pretty cool ENB mod that's for Skyrim that's supposed to fix some of the memory problems that the game has.

2498
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:08,000
And allows for draw distances which are really a lot bigger than they had more characters on screen.

2499
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:11,000
And apparently less crashes and takes up less memory.

2500
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
So, that's pretty cool.

2501
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Alrighty.

2502
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Oops, I'm sorry guys. I was hanging up on some of these calls accidentally because I'm on the iPad.

2503
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,000
And it's like when I get multiple calls at once, it goes crazy.

2504
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,000
So, go ahead and try to call again.

2505
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Orange Launch Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2506
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Geez, Rab.

2507
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Well, I wanted to take the first one because it's somebody that doesn't call into the show very often.

2508
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:41,000
But then as soon as I was about to hit the button, another one came up and I was like,

2509
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:46,000
Oh, I want to talk to the first one there because it probably has to do with the story we were just talking about.

2510
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
So, I'm hoping they call back.

2511
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:51,000
But if they don't, I'll go ahead and take another one.

2512
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:52,000
But we have a stream delay.

2513
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Alright, there we go. I think I got it.

2514
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
So, let us go to the phones.

2515
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2516
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
That cat GIF is the best GIF ever.

2517
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,000
It is the best GIF, isn't it?

2518
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
The best GIF ever.

2519
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
That's right. What's on your mind, buddy? How you doing?

2520
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Hey, so this is Bobby and I wanted to correct a little bit for the emailer who was talking about Twitch.

2521
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
Yes, please. Go for it.

2522
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:18,000
Because I remember, Plug Plug, you were talking about this on your show, were you not?

2523
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Yes, I was.

2524
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:27,000
And he said in the email that Twitch is imposing this delay and they're making it a mandatory delay.

2525
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
They're not.

2526
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:34,000
The actual technical side of it is basically Twitch got popular.

2527
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:39,000
And the way they were doing streaming the old way was not going to be sustainable.

2528
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:42,000
It was crashing. There were a lot of people having dropped streams.

2529
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
I was having dropped streams.

2530
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
It was getting unbearable to watch Twitch.

2531
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I'm already surprised that they can maintain what they've got.

2532
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Especially with the PlayStation 4 and now they want to get Xbox One in and on it too. It's crazy.

2533
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:02,000
But it's actually, and they did this before, they had decided to do this before they added the consoles.

2534
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:07,000
So they switched to a new streaming protocol but unfortunately it introduced latency.

2535
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:17,000
And they're apparently working to lower the latency but it was either have the latency or have more people leave Twitch because nobody could stay connected to the stream.

2536
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:23,000
And it was an unfortunate trade-off. And yes, Twitch has gotten so big and everybody's like, well I'm going to go to Hitbox and I'm going to go here.

2537
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:29,000
And that's great. You can go there and then when they get too big, they're going to have to switch to do, you know,

2538
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:35,000
they're going to have to do the same new streaming and they're going to introduce latency and everybody's going to leave there and go somewhere that's smaller.

2539
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:42,000
And it's going to be a cycle. Until they figure out how to lower the latency, it's unfortunately going to have to be there.

2540
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:47,000
It's not Twitch saying, oh it's the consoles, we have to have one minute of latency.

2541
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:54,000
No, it's just unfortunate reality of the internet right now and hopefully smart people are working on it to stop that.

2542
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:00,000
Yeah. I mean, I just, you know, again, maybe I'm spoiled because I've done this show for so long where we've always had that built in.

2543
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:07,000
So I've kind of had to think of a way to work around that. I just kind of like, you know, try to look at it as an opportunity where how can I repurpose what I'm doing?

2544
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:14,000
And, you know, to be fair, maybe I'm not, you know, because I don't rely on that two second delay or what have you.

2545
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:22,000
I'm a little more, you know, I don't get as upset about it, but I'm just kind of like, I'm like, well, you'll make it work. We all have, you know.

2546
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Or you could just, I mean, there's going to be competition, which is great.

2547
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:36,000
That's true. And that's true. Leaving Twitch and going somewhere else isn't necessarily, I don't want to say it's a bad idea, but I mean, the competition is, I've always said, I'm really surprised nobody's really competing with Twitch out there.

2548
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:44,000
After these numbers that came out this past week, though, were like, what is it, more people are watching Twitch than Hulu Plus and watching like Spike TV or something like that.

2549
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Like it's, it's because there's so many viewers consistently watching all this programming out there. It's, it's pretty crazy.

2550
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:55,000
So I'm really surprised that a lot of other companies don't want a piece of it.

2551
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:02,000
I'm really, really surprised that the Xbox streaming is not going to be done through some type of Skype thing. I'm really surprised at that.

2552
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Maybe they're rethinking that.

2553
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Maybe, maybe.

2554
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:10,000
So, yeah, so I just wanted to kind of correct that because I know there's a lot of misinformation that Twitch is being evil.

2555
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
They're not being evil. They're trying to stay afloat.

2556
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:18,000
And this is a very unfortunate and crappy side effect for some people.

2557
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Because I know people, they do speed runs or stuff like that, and they don't remember what happened 30 seconds ago that everybody's talking about.

2558
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:30,000
And they're so used to, for the past couple of years, having one or two second delays.

2559
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
They're not used to it.

2560
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:37,000
And, you know, for gaming, this is a problem that is mainly for gaming streams.

2561
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:42,000
It's a gaming stream problem. I don't think any other type of streaming really has this kind of problem.

2562
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:46,000
But this is a new problem that needs to be addressed.

2563
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Hopefully people are working on it to make it work with low latency and able to handle a whole bunch of viewers.

2564
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Alright, well Bobby, I appreciate the call as always to help us, help keep us adrift here on what's going on.

2565
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Quickly, everybody tune into the Bobby Black Wolf show who is on at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern here at VOG.

2566
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
But if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, as a lot of people do, such as that emailer.

2567
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Be sure to check out Bobby Black Wolf on Stitcher and iTunes and all the usual places, right?

2568
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:15,000
Yep, that's it.

2569
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Alright, there, I'm doing the plugs for you. It's all good.

2570
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
Also, audiblepodcast.com.

2571
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Alright, take care Bobby.

2572
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:22,000
See you Bobby.

2573
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Thanks.

2574
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Alright, we're going to go ahead and open it up.

2575
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Again, 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

2576
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
And we'll take that call.

2577
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Um, Loki, did you get all your last minute stories out? Was it just that one?

2578
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Yeah, it's a slow news week.

2579
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Yeah, I was going to see, I was in the middle of it.

2580
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
There wasn't really any tweets that I saw.

2581
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Was there no tweets?

2582
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Couple shoutouts, something out of context about dog style from last week.

2583
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:49,000
I don't remember if that was-

2584
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Oh, that was funny though.

2585
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
I don't remember if that was release dates or what we were talking about.

2586
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:56,000
My ego loves it when people quote, or when people tweet quotes from the show.

2587
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Like, my ego really, really loves that.

2588
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
But let's get into some more calls.

2589
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2590
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Hey, this is Act Deaf.

2591
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
There's a legendary attacking you!

2592
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Run!

2593
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:08,000
There's like a Pokemon thing on your head. I love it. What's up?

2594
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Yeah, it's a Pokeplus, a battle from the Pokemon Y legendary.

2595
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:23,000
Uh, well, first of all, the guacamelee, or guacamelee, that, uh, let's get that out of the way.

2596
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:26,000
In Spanish, it would be guacamelee.

2597
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Ah.

2598
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:36,000
So it's, uh, yeah, it's kind of like guacamelee, but yeah, well, it's similar in that spec.

2599
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Well, whatever.

2600
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:40,000
But whatever it's called, it's a great game, right?

2601
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Yeah, it's a really great game.

2602
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:46,000
I also tried it because of another podcast I listened to.

2603
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
They were talking about it.

2604
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:56,000
And how it's referential to a lot of Mexican, and also Dia de los Muertos, so Day of the Dead.

2605
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,000
And it's a reference to that, so it's a pretty cool game.

2606
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:04,000
And then, yeah, but it has a lot of references and all that.

2607
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,000
But aside of that, another thing.

2608
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:12,000
It's not Bobby, I love you and I respect you, but it's not Jeff.

2609
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
It's not Peanut Butter, it's Jeff.

2610
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:20,000
And I'm gonna start saying that in Spanish, like, heff.

2611
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:25,000
So, that's to trick off people, because, seriously.

2612
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Yeah, guys, I'm gonna go back to my Bay Area job and work for GitHub.

2613
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:32,000
This debate will never, ever end.

2614
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:36,000
We're just gonna have to live with it, and it's just what we'll have to do.

2615
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Yeah, definitely.

2616
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Well, my call was pretty much about the Nintendo thing.

2617
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:48,000
And basically it was, hey, Nintendo week.

2618
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Yeah, wasn't it a crazy week?

2619
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:55,000
I hated that headline, though, that said they admitted they flopped, because that's not true.

2620
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Those headlines have been here for...

2621
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:02,000
They've been ongoing for literally a year now, if not longer.

2622
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:05,000
And we weren't hating them in studio, to be honest.

2623
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Like I said, I am still going to buy the console, and I am still in support of Nintendo.

2624
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:18,000
I understand exactly what people are saying, and I think, without reiterating my points,

2625
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:22,000
I think my argument was the best I could possibly say on this matter.

2626
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:27,000
But, yeah, I see these articles a lot.

2627
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
I don't know if I've said it on this show.

2628
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:32,000
There's a quote that I thought of.

2629
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:35,000
I don't know if I heard it before, or if I truly made it up.

2630
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:40,000
But, in the case of punditry, in the case of news and this kind of stuff,

2631
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,000
death and failure are the easiest thing to predict, because both are inevitable.

2632
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:48,000
But that's all, like so many people talk about.

2633
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
It's disheartening, really.

2634
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Yeah, it's really hard to bear on this type of news,

2635
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:58,000
because all people are, oh, Nintendo's gonna go out of business,

2636
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:02,000
they're gonna start publishing for other people or other consoles,

2637
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:08,000
and a lot of stuff that there's really a lot to go through to get to that point.

2638
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:14,000
And right now, while Nintendo isn't doing that great, to be honest,

2639
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:19,000
but still, they're doing it decently.

2640
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:26,000
They over-expect it, or something I had said on another site,

2641
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:32,000
that they had a high expectancy of selling their console.

2642
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Absolutely.

2643
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:40,000
So it was really over-exploded, or, well, you get the idea in this case.

2644
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:43,000
Now, I have a feeling I know where you might be going with this,

2645
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
so I want to kind of prod you with this question here.

2646
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:49,000
What else is contributing to Nintendo's bad week?

2647
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Well, yesterday or, I don't remember if yesterday or Friday,

2648
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Polygon published an article on their site,

2649
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:08,000
and basically, it was about an Earthbound person that worked on the Earthbound localization team.

2650
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:12,000
He was going to publish a book, and he was going to promote it on Kickstarter and all that,

2651
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:19,000
and it looked like a really good project, an interesting one.

2652
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:28,000
But Nintendo said, no, cease and desist, and, well, the project is cancelled.

2653
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:34,000
And now people are calling Nintendo and saying that they're dicks because they cancelled the project,

2654
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:43,000
and it was going to be something that it was not going to even sell for a profit.

2655
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:47,000
So, oh, they're saying Nintendo are dicks and this and that.

2656
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:55,000
But basically, if you read the article, it says that the person did contact Nintendo beforehand.

2657
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Sorry if there's echo.

2658
02:55:58,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Is there?

2659
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
What's that? No, you're fine.

2660
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Okay.

2661
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:11,000
He basically contacted Nintendo, and he is under an NDA.

2662
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Yeah, I mean, as most people, when they sign up for a job or whatever, they're usually under NDA.

2663
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:20,000
They can't be talking about the process or so forth.

2664
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I would think, though, after so long, it's whatever.

2665
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:27,000
We always get expose books on politics and even movies and so forth,

2666
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
so video games, I wouldn't think would be any different.

2667
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:36,000
But I also get why Nintendo wants to shut it down because this guy would be making a profit off of a Nintendo IP.

2668
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Like, I get it.

2669
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:44,000
The fact that Nintendo is shutting it down doesn't surprise me, and I don't see it as them being dicks.

2670
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:48,000
It does make me go, well, what are you so afraid of, Nintendo?

2671
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
But at the same time, I kind of go, eh, I bet a lot of companies in their position would do that.

2672
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:56,000
If you don't, in the land of trademarks, if you don't protect it, you lose it.

2673
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:01,000
So they actually have a very significant reason to do this, unfortunately.

2674
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Yeah, but can't they give him, like, instead of not protecting it, can't they give him permission to do it?

2675
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Something that I was discussing with other people, especially on GameFAQs, it's mostly a copyright reason.

2676
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:22,000
It's basically they're protecting their IP, their product, because, yeah, even though he wasn't going to get a profit of it,

2677
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:27,000
he was going to still sell it. It was going to be a sold product.

2678
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Yeah, yeah.

2679
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:35,000
And I was saying something that probably would have been a, would have been, sorry, a great alternative.

2680
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:42,000
He would have published a blog or a PDF, an e-book, basically, online.

2681
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Do it for free.

2682
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:47,000
And I don't think Nintendo would have stopped that.

2683
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
I kind of think that's probably what's going to end up happening.

2684
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:54,000
If he really wants to tell the story, it'll probably get on the internet somehow. So, all right.

2685
02:57:54,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Yeah, basically. And I was, I was seeing the example of a Starman.net, the makers of the, of the Mother 3 translation.

2686
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Yeah.

2687
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:06,000
They didn't get stopped. So what's...

2688
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:16,000
But money, money was never, money was never, ever involved as opposed to, you know, funding investments up front and after the fact selling.

2689
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:23,000
The difference with the translation is that it, it was, it, you know, there was definitely a lot of groundswell and a lot of people knew about it,

2690
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:31,000
but money was never an object, at least not in large amounts from the, from, from everyday individuals.

2691
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:34,000
They weren't, they weren't selling the game. They weren't selling the patch.

2692
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:39,000
That's a fair point, though. It does seem weird that Nintendo never shut that down, but they'll shut this down real quick.

2693
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:42,000
But I, I get, I get what you're both saying. So, all right.

2694
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:45,000
All right. Akdeft, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much.

2695
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:49,000
And I appreciate you talking about the Earthbound thing, too, because that's a good story to share. So...

2696
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Well, thank you for having me.

2697
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,000
All right. Take care, my friend. And I hope that Pokémon doesn't eat you. All right. Bye.

2698
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Bye.

2699
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:02,000
All right. I am going to have to close up the Skype line. I am so sorry to those who didn't get through, but just, we got to end here, wrap up.

2700
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:06,000
I'm sorry we ran a little long. Those things happen. But please feel free to write your thoughts down and send them on over.

2701
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:16,000
mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send your emails, and you can also do tweets, twitter dot com slash o-l-r and all that good stuff.

2702
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Is there any other last minute story, excuse me, last minute stories, Loki? Sorry, I don't know if I...

2703
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I was going to say that I just saw this one real quick here.

2704
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Yep.

2705
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:38,000
We're using the Oculus Rift, and also a Wii remote that allows you to play Quidditch.

2706
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:41,000
That sounds really cool, actually.

2707
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:44,000
That's the game that people want to play, I think.

2708
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:45,000
That's very cool.

2709
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:46,000
That's pretty cool.

2710
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Yeah.

2711
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Alright. Loki, good luck with everything next week, and I didn't have any tweets to read.

2712
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:10,000
I guess I will say this real quick, though, because as I was going back through the twitter thing, I did notice a conversation that Bobby and I were having with one of our fellow indie podcasters, Godfrey over at Gamertag Radio, and he puts on a really great show.

2713
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:18,000
It's a very different vibe than what we do here, but that's the great thing about indie podcasting is that we all kind of do our own thing and use our own voices.

2714
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:28,000
He had a lot of good stuff to say about the experience of being nominated for a podcast award seven times and still not, unfortunately, winning and kind of seeing what's going on with all that stuff.

2715
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Does it make him Susan, what's your face?

2716
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:35,000
They kind of are the Susan Lucci, unfortunately, but what they do there is really great.

2717
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:40,000
So just kind of a handshake of support and a hug to those guys over there.

2718
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:44,000
I think what they do are great and what a lot of independent producers do are great.

2719
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:49,000
And I, for one, am getting a little sick of supporting these awards.

2720
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:55,000
I know we've asked a lot for people to support and vote for podcast awards and stitcher awards and so forth.

2721
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:59,000
But, you know, especially in the case of I'm just going to name names. Sorry about it.

2722
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:05,000
In the case of the Stitcher Awards, I didn't see a single indie in the gaming category or over the map at all.

2723
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:10,000
So I'm just kind of like, you know what, we could use our resources.

2724
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:20,000
You know, I know it's good exposure to get nominated for those things and so forth, but we could use our resources to better promote our show, better promote other indie shows and better promote this stuff.

2725
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:26,000
So I'm just going to say, as far as all this award show stuff goes, as far as getting our listeners to clickbait all this stuff.

2726
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:31,000
I mean, if a jury judge award thing comes around, then sure, we'd love to be considered.

2727
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:36,000
But as far as asking you guys to do this, no, we're done. We're done.

2728
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:39,000
No more clickbait award shows. We're done.

2729
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:45,000
So anyhow, hooray for indie podcasting, by the way.

2730
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:46,000
Yes.

2731
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
I just want to get that thought out there at some point.

2732
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Loki, good luck with everything this week and I can't wait to have you back on the show, but take all the time you need and we'll be thinking about you.

2733
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:01,000
And we expect regular updates on Twitter and so forth.

2734
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Alright, you got it.

2735
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,000
We want pictures of the small person.

2736
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:04,000
Yes, we do.

2737
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Okay, well.

2738
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:08,000
I'm sorry, the smaller person, because you already have a small person.

2739
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:09,000
That is true, yes.

2740
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Well, Loki, your final thought?

2741
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:22,000
My final thought is I need to go back and watch some more of the, what was it, the Skate 3 glitch videos I watched the other night and I literally got tired of laughing.

2742
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:37,000
It was just hilarious. I mean, and I've seen those videos numerous times before, but the guy, I really wish I remembered what his YouTube name was, but he seriously makes this into like an art form.

2743
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:42,000
I don't even know how he does half the stuff he does in that game, but it's amazing.

2744
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:48,000
DarkSoccer, you two are starting a new adventure tomorrow of a different sort, so best of luck with everything.

2745
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Thank you.

2746
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:52,000
We'll be thinking about you too. And your final thought tonight?

2747
03:02:52,000 --> 03:03:00,000
I've had to reset my sleep schedule, so I'm actually super tired and I have to be up at six in the morning, so I will be going right to bed as soon as I get home.

2748
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Thanks for the booze.

2749
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:03,000
You're welcome, enjoy it.

2750
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Jason, thank you as always for being here.

2751
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Absolutely.

2752
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Sounds like your next week might be the last week we have you here for a while.

2753
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Possibly, yeah, depends on the way everything shakes down.

2754
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:17,000
We'll see how that works out, but for now, any final thoughts for our listeners?

2755
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:24,000
There's a Twitter account, emergencyNSF, and I opened it up and the first thing I see is a structure fire.

2756
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Crews just entering garage on fire on Dolores at 25th Street.

2757
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
It's from two days ago, so I'm not actually that worried.

2758
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:44,000
Seems the Bay Bridge is still up, the new Bay Bridge is still up, so I'll be able to make it back in and settle down and sleep probably another four hours because last week was insane because there were a bunch of co-workers in for a particular purpose.

2759
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:57,000
This week, my team is in town. Literally my entire team except for one individual is in town. It's gonna be kind of insane and wonderful all at the same time. It's gonna be a good week.

2760
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:02,000
And that YouTuber, I just remembered his name, HelixSnake. Go look him up.

2761
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:07,000
My final thought as always, thank you guys for taking the time out to listen to the show. Support independent broadcasting.

2762
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:16,000
We appreciate you helping to spread the word about the show. Leave a nice review on iTunes or on Stitcher or anything like that.

2763
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:20,000
Unlike award show nominations, that stuff really does help, so we really appreciate that.

2764
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Help spread the word. Word of mouth is all we got because I don't got millions of dollars to advertise. I don't have a big website backing me up.

2765
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:38,000
It's independent and home grown, so help us continue to grow and bring more mature, intelligent voices to the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2766
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
And many different definitions of the word.

2767
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:46,000
Alright, have a great week everybody. We'll be back next week to do it all over again. See you next time. Bye bye.

2768
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:54,000
