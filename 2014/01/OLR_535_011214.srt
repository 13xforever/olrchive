00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, we're talking money. Money money money money money. Some surprising financial developments have taken place.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We've also joined this generation of gaming consoles. Our thoughts, your chat comments, calls, emails, and tweets on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 535 for January the 12th of 2014.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Unfortunately not here tonight. The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She unfortunately came down with a sinus infection today so she felt with her new job starting very soon she should probably take the night off.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Which I understand. She is however in our chat room so if you want to say hi to her she's commenting along with the show at live.vognetwork.com

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But that's of course only for the live listeners. Sorry for the podcast folks. But if you wanted to say hi to Jamie you could always send an email. Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But we do have on the skype line tonight say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hello.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hey Loki how are you doing?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm doing good. Still on baby watch.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's right. Still Loki baby watch 2013 slash 14 still in effect.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Although for those of you that have been tuned out for a little bit over the holidays Loki has been joining us for about the past month over skype.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because Mrs. Loki is in that last section of the baby making phase where the babies literally do any day now.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah pretty much. I mean she's at the point now where she's just waiting for labor to start.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So she's off work and you know if the baby doesn't come naturally next week they're going to induce her a week from Monday.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So one way or another we will have a baby by the 20th.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So you're going to have a Martin Luther King Jr. Day baby possibly. Quite possibly.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I guess.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Very interesting. Although it could be before too.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah it's on or before so anytime.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is very likely. Should we place bets on this? I'm going to bet before. I think the baby's going to come during OLR's time slot.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So it's going to make it cancel out on the show at like 4.30 next week.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So no I'm fully expecting you probably won't be here next week.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So this very well may be the last Loki show we have for a little bit.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But just in case I don't get an opportunity to say it again.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Best of luck and may everything go swimmingly and can't wait to see your new healthy baby in the coming weeks.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And tell Mrs. Loki we're all thinking about her here.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Will do.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com Blackwool says are we placing salty bets on Loki baby?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Quite possibly. Quite possibly.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
SSJ100Matt says I'm sure Nellie would love it if it happened during the show.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And DarkSakura is in our chat room still having her voice at live.vognetwork.com says guys this is Nellie.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That baby has stubborn genes.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well she's been, we've been trying everything you know all the like home remedies to get the baby out.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's like okay spicy food. Nope not really doing anything.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Pineapple juice. Nope.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So it's just, it's just not coming out. We just have to wait.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But you know he's bigger already than Josh was when he was born so they don't want him to go too much longer.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it's definitely the 20th or earlier.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sure makes sense.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Brad our buddy from PodCulture is in chat saying no it'll be tonight. We'll hear oh shit gotta go.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I doubt it. I mean she was not having any contractions a few hours ago so I doubt that it'll be tonight.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That would, that would really be something if I, cause DarkSakura I had to call out just a couple hours ago and then I lose Loki mid show.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I would be left here with nobody but the mighty fine VXJSnXVXYZ.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And what a terrible thing that would be.

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I mean I know then it would just be like alright I guess I'll have to just do the whole damn show between the two of us.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well you know.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It would be, that would be quite a bit of an experience.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It would be an experience.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hey my phone has Skype. What are you talking about?

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I could just see Loki trying to do the show on mobile Skype on the way to the hospital with Nelly like turn that god damn thing off.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In the background.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That would be hilarious.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or in the room with the rhythmic beep beep.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Right.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And then as he's starting to talk beep beep beep beep.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How are you doing, Jason?

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm doing good. It's another, another mighty fine week.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's new in your world? What are you up to? Enjoying, do you do any like tourist trap things while you're out here in San Francisco?

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, I'm not touristy in the least.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like my, my life is literally like a five to six block radius of the apartment that I'm staying at and the office.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And then it's a commute south to hang out with people or north up here to help out with the show.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh you gotta expand your horizons in SF a little bit.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Peer 39, come on, everybody's gotta go there.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I've been, no I've done this kind of stuff before. My dad used to live in Gilroy and I visited for a summer so I did Alcatraz, I did Treasure Island, I did Peer 39 Fisherman's Wharf.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Um, I've, I've been to these places whenever things are going on at work I'm um obviously I tag along so I can socialize with all my coworkers immediate or not.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And um, I've, I've been through this kind of stuff. Left to my own choices, eh, eh, eh.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Fair enough.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have other things I want to do.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
When I'm working away from town, like when I went to Phoenix last year was the big trip I took for work, I, I probably did the same thing where I didn't leave like a small little radius from where we were.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And I mean the big difference with this now is that since I'm coming up on two years at work and also two years of coming out to the Bay Area,

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
like I kind of have my groove and I've been having conversations with people about whether San Francisco slash anywhere California is going to be home or not at some point.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't think it is but I'm definitely seeing the feasibility if nothing else. I don't think I want to live here but I see the fact that I can if I'm so inclined.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And so I have my routines now. I have my, I have my office, I have my job that I go into. I come back and I'm starting to get into producing more and more content.

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Sure.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I'm, I'm taking advantage of, you know, being, being able to do things while still being around people while I'm out here.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Because as soon as I get back home, I'm 25 minutes. Yeah, I'm at least 25 minutes from any coworker and only their houses.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So it would be, you know, it'd be like a pretty personal person, socially personal thing that I would have to, I would have to make plans with to go do anything with them.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And it'll just be a lot different. So the life of a telecommuter. So soaking it up as much as I can right now is really the gist of it.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's fair. I understand. Talking about all the Pier 39 kind of, kind of made me think of back when orange Ontario was a station.

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And one of my favorite days was the day we broadcast from the DDR tournament that was at Pier 39. We actually were live like all day long.

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We used to, we haven't really done anything like that in a very, very long time. But I can't think of the last time we were like live for like an entire day outside of maybe the marathon episode and maybe like an E3 thing or something.

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But that would be, you know, back when we were with, you know, other, other, it wasn't just us, it was like other shows coming together to do that.

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I remember that Pier 39 DDR tournament was quite an experience. I had a good time.

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
How did you even do it back in the days of like shitty wireless leads and everything else?

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Isn't that funny? Like, yeah, like now you look back and you go, how the hell did we pull that off?

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, we have tethering, we have MiFis. Back then we had to plug our computers into things for internet.

93
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I guess the arcade was a really good sport about it. And they thought it was really cool exposure for them to be able to say that something like that was happening.

94
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And they had like a DSL was like all the rage.

95
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It was a really, really, really long Ethernet cable. I remember they had to run it.

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We had to go to Radio Shack and get like a 50 foot Ethernet cable. It was huge and ran it that way.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And keep in mind, Orange Launch Radio was running our big thing right when we first launched. We were a modem friendly.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We were a 28.8K friendly dial-up radio station. So that was the thing.

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's still some relevance of that. It's happening all over again because cell phone speeds, cellular connections are not always terribly fast in all parts of the US and outside of the US as well where we do have listeners.

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, that's true. That's true. But my how times have changed. My how times have changed.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Actually, that arcade is now a sports bar because I've been back to Pier 39.

102
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I went there. You actually suggested it the day before saying, oh, no, not the day before the day of St. Patrick's Day.

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I had a Saturday to myself the day after my interview and I was just kind of going around and I figured I'd go back to Pier 39 and kind of see what I remember.

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Like I said, I was out here for a summer when my dad lived in Gilroy. That was 2000 somewhere around there.

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And since I had done this before, talking to people that I know in the area that have been through San Francisco and just kind of solicited suggestions, you suggested Pier 39.

106
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So I hopped a ride, caught a ride to get down there. And it was pretty it was not a bad sports bar.

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There are still some pretty cool, good looking and well maintained arcade machines. No music games, not not even a little bit.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You've got to have your deer hunter game, your requisite deer hunter game.

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:43,000
They had one of the new Terminator, Rise of the Machines, whatever it is. And, you know, obviously the the obligatory basketball hoops, skee-ball type thing.

110
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But the takeaway is that they actually seemed to be taking care of the machines because they looked pretty good.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All the screens were fine. There was no signs taped up on the over the coin mix or on the screens or anything like that.

112
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Still a worthwhile place to go if you find yourself walking up and down the pier.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All right. Well, let's as much as fun is to talk about tourist traps and the fair the fair amount of arcade games you may find at them, we should probably go back to talking about gaming.

114
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff.

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So, hey, my kickoff topic tonight, I literally have it on the show roll.

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Tonight's kickoff topic is ass and titties, ass and titties, ass and titties, ass and titties.

117
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
OK, here's the thing, though. No, really. No, no, hold on. Don't change the station. Don't change the station. This does relate to gaming.

118
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No one's changing the station or the kickoff topic is ass and titties.

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They're turning it up.

120
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
We're going to talk about ass and titties, everybody.

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
They're trying to find the webcam stream.

122
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
OK, so here's the thing. Not my ass and titties. Hold on.

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
OK, here's the thing, in all seriousness, and yes, we are going to talk about ass and titties because last week I made a big deal on the show about,

124
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
OK, guys, I finally jumped the shark and I ordered my PlayStation 4 and my PlayStation 4 will be here on Tuesday.

125
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So sure enough, there's the new parallelogram is sitting on the TV stand.

126
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My PlayStation 4 is all hooked up and with all its gaming goodness and I've had a good old time on the PlayStation 4 this week.

127
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So which console did you end up removing?

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, yes, I was playing television stand Survivor on Twitter this week where one of the consoles got voted off the island.

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The Xbox 360 was voted off the island, actually.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
However, it is not out of the game. It's been exiled to Master Bedroom Island is what's happened.

131
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But now Sony has officially asserted its dominance over the living room.

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
For now, until I get the Xbox One, which I don't want the Microsoft fanboys to be all like, nah, but here's the reality.

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I haven't really touched the 360 in a while.

134
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The last big, big thing I remember playing on it was either Minecraft or the most likely the Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC was probably the last big thing I played on 360.

135
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And with PlayStation 3, there is still the Final Fantasy 10 remake coming and there's the Kingdom Hearts 2 package that's all coming out next year.

136
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So those I knew were things that I would want to still have on PlayStation 3.

137
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I couldn't think of anything on 360 that I would want to play next year that badly that isn't also on PC or something else.

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Am I missing something, Loki? Did I miss an obvious choice?

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, there's two. I mean, if you're not getting an Xbox One right away, there's Plants vs. Zombies, Garden Warfare, and Titanfall.

140
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Titanfall I do want to check out, but that is on PC eventually, right?

141
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's PC the same day, but I guess you probably want to play it on PC.

142
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, so either I'll check that out on PC or, again, the PlayStation 3 will have to be voted off the island when I can finally afford an Xbox One.

143
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I just think that'll be more like summer.

144
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And then by that point, I will have at least played the Final Fantasy 10 remakes.

145
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Kingdom Hearts 2 we'll have to see. I might unfortunately have to just play that in the bedroom or figure out something else.

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I had joked around that the Wii U was up for elimination, but not really because I still play enough Wii U.

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I had people over this week and we were having a good old time with Nintendo Land, of all things, but I'll get into that later.

148
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because Ass and Titties. You guys got me distracted from Ass and Titties.

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Here's the thing.

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Miracles do happen sometimes.

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
On the PlayStation 4. I'm sure you all know one of the big features on the PlayStation 4 is that you can livestream your games.

152
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We've even talked about this on the show, that it's not only the games that you can stream, but people have figured out that they can stream from Playroom,

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
which is just kind of the play space, if you will, the camera area where you have just silly little, like, make robots spawn and interact with.

154
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
They have silly little things like this with Kinect too.

155
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There was, on Xbox, they had something very similar to this. They even showed it off at 1E3 and I don't remember the name of it.

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Do you remember the name of the Kinect showroom that they had?

157
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, they have, like, a Kinect, I forget what it was, they have some sort of Kinect Party thing.

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah.

159
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
They've got, I don't know if it is Kinect Party.

160
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It was all download. They had something, somebody in chat will yell it out over at live.vognetwork.com soon enough.

161
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So, okay, so I'm screwing around and I'm looking at the PlayStation 4 livestreams and one thing I noticed right away, it is really easy to just, I mean,

162
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
you power up the PlayStation 4 and it's all integrated, like, you just, your little bar shows up that shows all the little games that you have downloaded

163
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and, you know, the PlayStation Store or the Netflix Amazon link and all that stuff and then PlayStation 4 Live.

164
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So you go in there and you will automatically see what the top channels are.

165
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And so I've been just kind of looking around and seeing what people are doing in the Playroom streams.

166
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I'll tell you what, it is a real toilet bowl of the internet, what's going on in those Playroom streams.

167
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Last night, I kid you not, I'm not making this up, I actually was playing around with the, because, you know, the Vita will livestream from your PlayStation 4.

168
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Like, it'll, you can actually do the whole second screen thing. It's, like, very similar to the Wii U and the Wii and it works very well.

169
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was very impressed with that.

170
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So I was lying in bed about to go to sleep and I'm playing around on the Vita and I'm doing the PlayStation 4 and I look at the livestreams

171
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and I tune into this channel that has 500 viewers that's just called, like, Party or something like that.

172
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And it's these three bros and one girl that are in a room and I can't really understand what they're making out because, you know,

173
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
they're all loud and boisterous and those microphones are pretty sensitive, so all I can hear is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

174
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You know, they're all kind of laughing.

175
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, suddenly, the girl gets up, walks over to the camera, pulls down her top, plays, like, does the whole little, like, you know, the ending of Elvira

176
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
where she, like, does her, spins her titties around a little bit, like, she does that.

177
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
She does, I don't mean to be, like, too explicit, y'all, but this is, like, this is unfolding in front of my eyes.

178
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was like, oh my God, this is really happening on PlayStation 4.

179
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
She picks up one of her boobs and starts licking it and that whole thing and does these very explicit types of things on the TV

180
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and then she laughs and goes back and sits down and I'm just thinking.

181
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But what were the robots doing at this time?

182
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Somehow the robots weren't there. I don't know how that happened.

183
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So then I changed chan- I was like, okay, so I changed the channel and I look at somebody, there's somebody else's stream and it's, it's, it's called,

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I was like, wow, there's all this, like, boobs and, and, and Alan and I were kind of joking, like, are there any dudes that are getting naked on there?

185
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So sure enough, we see a channel that's called, like, Workout Session or Workout With Me or something.

186
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So we go to the room and it's this dude that's sitting there and he's wearing nothing but gym shorts, right?

187
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And he's, like, he's doing sit-ups and he's talking to the camera about, like, how he's trying to get in shape and all this,

188
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
but he sounds, like, really out of it kind of to me, like, like, I don't want to say he was on drugs, but-

189
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But you might say that he's a resident of Colorado.

190
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, yes, he might be a resident of Colorado. It's, it struck me as he was very possibly in Colorado.

191
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No offense, Jason, it's just your state's a little infamous for something right now.

192
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm aware of these things.

193
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So here's the thing, I just, I just happened to notice that as he's doing sit-ups, I was like,

194
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I think he's very happy to be doing these sit-ups, if you know what I mean.

195
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So my point in telling these stories, I'm not just trying to, like, titillate you with all these stories about girls and boys

196
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and the things they're doing on camera, but I was just, like, this is a fucking Fox News story waiting to happen.

197
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is a ticking time bomb before somebody, I mean, that's how easy it was.

198
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I turned on the PlayStation, went to the PlayStation 4 live, like, it's, like, literally, like, three button presses before I'm there.

199
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Now, am I saying that, oh my gosh, this is gonna be a problem and all this stuff?

200
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well, I do think that parents should be monitoring what their kids do, and I think if parents turn on the parental controls,

201
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
they can probably block access to this and all this stuff, but you and I and everybody else knows that is not gonna happen.

202
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Real quick, so this is stuff, is this going out over Twitch, or is this just via their internal, like, streaming thing?

203
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I swear that the boob thing was on Twitch.

204
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Now, I know we reported on this show last week, or, sorry, not last week, but a couple weeks ago that Twitch had removed Playroom,

205
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but you can see when you're actually in the PlayStation 4 channel, there's a little icon that indicates if the stream is coming from Twitch or if it's coming from Ustream.

206
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You see the little logo, and you can also filter, and it actually looks like there's room that they could put more into it,

207
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
so if those two services were to get overwhelmed or a third one pops up, but I swear the boobs were on Twitch TV.

208
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Which I was like, how did they do that? Because I thought Playroom was banned.

209
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Maybe there was another trick or something, I don't know.

210
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's not that it's banned, it's that it's delisted from the directory on the website, is my understanding.

211
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So the PS4, you can still get everything that's being streamed from other PS4s, but if you were to get on your computer,

212
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
go to Twitch.tv and search for the game Playroom, it will not show up.

213
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That makes a lot more sense.

214
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can probably still, even if you know the name of the account, I assume that you can still watch the channel from your computer.

215
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But to browse to it and find it is too much of a liability that they delisted it.

216
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But yeah, most of them are going through Ustream, Loki, to be honest.

217
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Alright, I was curious.

218
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But here's the other thing, it wasn't just the livestreams that were appalling, it was the chat.

219
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It was the chat. The chat was just like, I was almost offended and appalled by what I was seeing in chat.

220
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like when that girl was showing her boobs and everything, all the chat was like,

221
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
show your pussy, was basically what they were saying in chat.

222
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And I'm sitting there going, and it wasn't just like show your pussy, it was like show your pussy you fucking whore,

223
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and show you fat slut and all this stuff, and I'm just like this is gross.

224
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is gross behavior. And it's like one of those train wrecks.

225
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Like I should not be watching this, I should not be supporting this, this is dirty, this is wrong.

226
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But it's like you can't look away.

227
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So I'm just thinking to myself, I'm like this is a Fox News nightmare waiting to happen.

228
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And it's all going to get blamed on PlayStation 4 and this is not going to end pretty.

229
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Because there's a part of me that's really excited about the potential of what this could do for broadcast.

230
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You know I'm a big champion of independent broadcasting and independent stuff.

231
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And earlier today I went in there again before the show, I was kind of showing Jason,

232
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,000
and there was two dudes on there doing a show in Playroom that was like our gaming show every Saturday at 7 or something like that.

233
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And they actually decorated their little kitchen to look like a studio and all this,

234
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
kind of like what we used to do with OLR back in the garage.

235
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And I was like okay that's a pretty good use of it.

236
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And the chatters there were relatively pretty respectful.

237
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But I'm thinking it's only a matter of time before Sony's going to have to moderate what they push to the front page.

238
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know what I mean?

239
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Like I just, yeah it's something else.

240
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

241
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I used the Twitch Xbox One app and they had the Playroom in the list of games but there were no games in there.

242
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I saw a Playroom stream two days ago with a woman and she was playing with her kid and she was responding to all the nasty comments.

243
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That is the vast majority of those streams.

244
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's just people sitting there in front of the TV while we're all staring back and saying the nastiest shit and they're just responding to it.

245
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And they just watch the chat go by and respond and this is like, is this what gaming has become?

246
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No, it's what the internet is when the situation arises.

247
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's that whole, you know we've joked about this on the show before, but it's time to penis, right?

248
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Whenever you put a new peripheral out there, how long before somebody puts their dick in it or on it or whatever?

249
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And sure enough, dick, tits, whatever, it doesn't matter, they're private parts, it doesn't take very long at all.

250
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is just that whole thing in reality.

251
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,000
How long does it take for somebody to whip their boobies out or for somebody to practically be running around with no pants on where it leaves nothing to the imagination?

252
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You know what I mean?

253
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I don't know, it's just fascinating, but is this going to end positively for gaming? I don't think so.

254
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think this is a ticking time bomb.

255
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And if Sony doesn't change this quickly, it's going to get real ugly.

256
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Real ugly when one of the big stations reports on this.

257
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Well at least if there's any benefit to this, it's that the local news won't pick up on this for at least another couple of years.

258
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So we're still okay.

259
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's true.

260
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Scottatron in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, awesome, so dude bros and a few morons are going to ruin it for everybody, typical.

261
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Alan Alchemy says, but it was just spools of sewage directed at any woman.

262
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Anyone who still thinks that being a woman on the internet, quote, isn't that bad, needs to see this shit.

263
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It is literally everywhere and instantaneous.

264
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I hate to say it, but absolutely. I mean, it's pretty appalling.

265
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll second that.

266
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's pretty appalling.

267
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now, are the men objectified too?

268
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
A little bit.

269
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Sure, especially the dude who is working out.

270
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You know, he was getting the gay thrown out, which is a whole nother, you know, stop saying that, you toilet bowl commenter or whatever.

271
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But I mean, they get a lot of that too.

272
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
But it is, it's really bad.

273
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You know, when somebody's got a stream where it's like, you know, OMG a girl and all the comments are just like the most misogynist of things you can imagine.

274
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's pretty gross.

275
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, what Sony needs to do is put on some sort of explicit tags on streams that are showing mature content.

276
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Kind of like how Twitch TV lets you change a setting on your account to warn people that you're showing mature rated content.

277
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I think Sony needs to, I think they need to moderate what playroom streams they push to the front page.

278
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I think what Sony needs to do in a firmware update is they need to filter out at least.

279
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Now granted, I think in any game what's going to eventually happen is that even in the little camera window people are going to go crazy.

280
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But I think for now to avert a real crisis, what Sony ought to do, they need to filter out the playroom streams.

281
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And maybe you can still search for them if you know the name or whatever.

282
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Or that Sony will only push playroom streams that they know are doing relevant content, let's just say.

283
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I think the way that Microsoft implemented this and Bobby talked about two or three weeks ago is actually really relevant.

284
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This doesn't disagree with your point, but that if anybody is reported and verified as having been doing something with this, they get delisted. Period.

285
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And not even allowing people to search for them if you're going to do this kind of thing.

286
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm kind of conflicted because ratings are a thing, parental controls are a thing, and you shouldn't outright punish someone for doing something.

287
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
But until an alternative exists, if anybody is caught doing something like this, just delist them.

288
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
They can still stream, they won't get any feedback, they're going to stop streaming.

289
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What they should do is just have, when they're reporting these people, instead of having these anonymous reports, have it capture five seconds of what they were watching.

290
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
That way they can say, okay, yeah, that's definitely not appropriate.

291
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll go a funny step further and say that when one user reports a second user, that the first user should not be able to see the second user anymore at all.

292
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Just to prevent, like, it's still on, I'm going to report them again even if nothing's going on.

293
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That's diving down a whole other rabbit hole.

294
00:25:49,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The only concern I have, and maybe I'm being a little too tinfoil-hattish with this, but I just kind of see the reality of this as it's as easy for me to see tits on my PlayStation 4 like I did last night.

295
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's as easy for me to do that as it is to turn on cable and go to, you know, CNN on the cable box.

296
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It's exactly as many button presses as it was.

297
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And my thought is that everything on the cable box is regulated by the FCC.

298
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I think some of it's a gray area, especially late at night, because I know Comedy Central used to show, like, the underrated movies and stuff.

299
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But all that dialogue aside, it's moderated and it's filtered and it's government-controlled.

300
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
But this stuff on PlayStation 4, and I don't think we want to see it necessarily government-controlled.

301
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
And, you know, the Internet is a worldwide thing.

302
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
How do you control with the government something that's worldwide?

303
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But my mind is just going, something's gonna give here.

304
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
And if Sony doesn't do it, somebody else is gonna step in and it's not gonna be good news anywhere.

305
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And if Xbox gets this streaming thing soon enough, considering every Xbox owner has a camera in their house,

306
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
the problem very well will only be worse for Microsoft if they unveil this whole thing.

307
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Because I'll tell you what, those PlayStation 4 cameras are harder to find than the fucking system.

308
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I don't know how these other guys are finding them. I can't find them anywhere here in a 100-mile radius.

309
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, they are very allocated by Sony. They're getting ready for their Japanese launch, so all their accessories are hard to get right now.

310
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yeah, so I'm just saying, it's gonna be very, very interesting.

311
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Alright, going to live.vognetwork.com.

312
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Alan's saying, the dudes get, let's see your dick, happy face.

313
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The woman's get, you're fucking fat, let's see her dirty bleep bleep, you ugly bleep bleep, this boring slut, show us beep beep beep.

314
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's kind of a false dichotomy. Yes, people ask the dudes to do dumb shit, but it's not soaked in gross insults.

315
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I will agree with that to an extent. I think there's still gross insults on either side, but is it unfortunately weighted way more towards the women?

316
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes, I would agree with that, and that's very unfortunate. But that is the reality of what we're seeing right now.

317
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Bobby Blackwell says, less Rob, the PlayStation 4 will push further to the left in the bar the stuff you used the most, or most recently.

318
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Live with PlayStation could realistically be the first thing you could click on if you use it enough. That's very true.

319
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And DarkSakura, of course, saying hello in our chat room, saying sorry, all the pussy talk reminded me to feed Midna.

320
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Glad we could help. Glad we could be of service there over at live.vognetwork.com.

321
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Alright, and Act F says, people will bitch if Playroom gets shut down or something.

322
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, there is quality stuff to be seen on Playroom. Unfortunately, it's just not the stuff that's at the top of the list or the most easiest to access.

323
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The two dudes that were doing the live show about video games was like about three pages down if you scroll down.

324
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:03,000
They only had like 20 viewers, whereas last night the girl with her cha-chas was at 500 and the dude wearing the gym shorts was like 250.

325
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
So, there you go.

326
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
DarkSakura says, it's built into society and it can be combated, but it has to start at home.

327
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Alright, anyway, so I just wanted to get that out because I was just like, it's going to be one of those things where you're going to see it on the news and we're all going to be like, that isn't gamers.

328
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That has nothing to do with gaming, but it's going to be the gaming community that takes the heat because I'll tell you what, it's going to be one of those ignorant local news people.

329
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And yet, I say ignorant because I bet you anybody, this reporter will not be a gamer themselves, so it will be somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about when it comes to video games.

330
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It will be an ignorant TV reporter that gets up there and says, well, you won't believe what gamers are using their PlayStation 4 for and it could shock you.

331
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
That's the story that's coming.

332
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And it's going to be like, you know, I bought my kid this console for his birthday and this is the filth he saw immediately when powering it up and he came calling back to me and saying, mommy, I don't know what's going on.

333
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's going to be like one of those, just like all those porn on the 3DS stories.

334
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Tall in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com with a very firm comment here that I think is important to address says, I would disagree. This is a part of gaming culture.

335
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You know, despite what I just said, unfortunately, I do think he's right a little bit.

336
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I think it's a part of human culture. This is by no means a specific thing whatsoever.

337
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
That's very true.

338
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
You will find it everywhere because it is human life.

339
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It is a very ugly pointing the mirror at ourselves, at a society in a way.

340
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's a very good point.

341
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But certainly you see a lot of that in the game, you know, just the way that women have been treated in the past and the insults that people hurl at each other on Xbox live.

342
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I mean, that all has been a part of gaming culture, but you're right.

343
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That's almost part of human culture as it is too, unfortunately.

344
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Cosplay circles, you know, anime in general, anime, unfortunately, kind of especially because of the subject of the show, anime and manga both.

345
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But also there's an argument to be made with gaming is that with the improvements and realism and everything else that technology is being used to benefit gaming is also making this thing more accessible, easier, for better or for worse.

346
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Heavy stuff.

347
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't know if there's an easy answer to this and I'm glad I'm not the guy that has to make these sorts of decisions.

348
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But it's going to be fascinating to see how this next year plays out with these consoles.

349
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
If you have further thoughts, please feel free to email us.

350
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Mailbag at OrangeOnTrader.com or you can also tweet us.

351
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Twitter.com slash OLR.

352
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You know, I'll tell you this.

353
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I had that before I even saw the guys doing their little gaming show, I had that idea where I was like, dude, if I got one of those PlayStation cameras, we could do OLR through the PlayStation.

354
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And we would get like, we would easily be able to be like in the top and it would get, be like a whole new audience.

355
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We get all these new listeners. Oh my gosh, it would be great.

356
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
But then I'm thinking in the back of my head after I'm watching some of these streams, honest to God, my reaction was, do I want some of these people listening to OLR?

357
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I don't think it's a bad idea to be honest.

358
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I mean, yeah, there's going to be idiots and stuff, but they won't stick around.

359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
They may show up for a little bit, but then they're like, oh, hey, someone's showing their ass on this one.

360
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And then there'd be guns.

361
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
True. True.

362
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And I would honestly, I would just hide the chat because you know, in PlayStation 4, you can either shrink your screen down so you can see the chat or you can just have the thing be full screen.

363
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And I would honestly probably just have it full screen with it written on the whiteboard or something to join chat, go to our moderated chat room.

364
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But I don't know.

365
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I mean, again, I'm just, I'm brainstorming aloud.

366
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
This is not nothing we're actually thinking of doing.

367
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But I'm sure there's a lot of other podcasters having the same thought.

368
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I don't think I'm some type of like genius who thought of this idea first or something.

369
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
No, absolutely not.

370
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I think a lot of people are weighing, how can I use this technology to do my thing?

371
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
One last little bit of this is that it doesn't even take anything particularly specific for this to happen.

372
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I was watching the wrap up of All Games Done Quick, Awesome Games Done Quick last night.

373
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And as they were finishing their official broadcast stream, there's a thing in the speedrunning community, probably maybe the game streaming community at large,

374
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
where they take a featured stream with a lot of viewers and they want to pay it forward, so to speak.

375
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They want to take the traffic and send it on somebody else that's worthy.

376
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Awesome Games Done Quick was wrapping up and so they wanted to send it to another guy that they recognized with good Super Metroid speedrunning talents.

377
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
And so there was a person transcribing stuff on the screen.

378
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
He accidentally linked to somebody else that was playing Legend of Zelda NES.

379
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And I pop over to the channel because I'm kind of curious, thinking it was going to be Super Metroid.

380
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And it's just dude sitting on his chair, full screen, you know, majority screen playing Legend of Zelda.

381
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
And first of all, the chat was scrolling 10 million miles a second.

382
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
But second, there was also like approachingly raunchy stuff.

383
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Mob mentality, I guess, sort of thing.

384
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Just kind of like the fact that they were trying to have their second to shine, they were trying to have their moment.

385
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And they were trying to one-up the other people that were saying specific things.

386
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And he was just, and the guy that was playing, when he noticed that his screen was scrolling by, he kind of walked up to the camera.

387
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Whoa! And then just kind of went back to playing the game and something probably happened like 10, 20, 30 minutes later whenever there was a lull in gameplay.

388
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
But literally nothing was happening except somebody was playing Legend of Zelda NES of all things.

389
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And people come in and just start going crazy, expressing themselves in a matter of speaking.

390
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You know, I'm glad you bring up though the whole awesome games done quick thing.

391
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Because obviously what they accomplished over the weekend, well over the week really, was a really cool feat.

392
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Because they ended up raising a million plus dollars for cancer research.

393
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
A million bucks, two times their target for the week.

394
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Thank you for bringing that up because I think that brings a very nice little bookend to the story about the cesspool of live streaming and the bad that comes from it.

395
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And then we have this really great like, but we can't throw it all away because there's these great things that come from it too.

396
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I mean that whole thing is a direct, you know, kind of reflection of the live streaming culture as well.

397
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Is that, you know, thanks to that, you know, you've raised all that money and that's the real good that can come out of this too.

398
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
So, you know, just things to think about. It's not all bad I guess is my point.

399
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
In fact there's some real, real, real good stuff coming out of it.

400
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
As with anything, people can take advantage of it for better and people can exploit it for worse.

401
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Very true, very true.

402
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.

403
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You want to finish off your week Rob?

404
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I guess I should start, huh, since Jamie's not here and I did bring up PlayStation 4, right?

405
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Okay, so going into our gaming weeks, my gaming week.

406
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So yes, I got a PlayStation 4 and besides all the stuff I just brought up, I have been playing some games on it.

407
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You know what's funny? I actually don't have any disc based games right now.

408
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I'm going to be getting some. A friend of mine is getting me a good deal on a couple games.

409
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But right now I'm just kind of enjoying what's able to be downloaded on the PlayStation Store and what's available through PlayStation Plus.

410
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So I played like a good seven or eight games on PlayStation.

411
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I mean I downloaded stuff that, excuse me, I already had on PlayStation 3 that was cross by like Flower.

412
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Which, yes I can tell the difference playing it on PlayStation 4.

413
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's just a lot crisper and even more vibrant.

414
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I mean generally it's the same game, especially a game like Sound Shapes.

415
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Really didn't look any different to me at all.

416
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But Flower you could see just a little bit more.

417
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
It was very subtle but it was just that much crisper and looked that much better on PlayStation 4.

418
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I will say a game that I really enjoyed on PlayStation 4 that I was really surprised because this game didn't really get that good of reviews.

419
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
But reviews aren't everything. It's sometimes about how you view a game.

420
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I actually played all the way through a game called Contrast that's available for free.

421
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Or at least it was. I don't think it is anymore.

422
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But it was available through PlayStation Plus for free.

423
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And I had that. And I actually played that from start to finish.

424
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
What's interesting about it though, the only reason I probably played that on PlayStation 4 is that it was free.

425
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Because the game is also out on 360, PC, PlayStation 3.

426
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And PlayStation 4, the graphics, it looks good but it doesn't really look that much better than what you would see on PlayStation 3.

427
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But I wasn't expecting it to be much better because it's available on those systems.

428
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But I liked it's setting a lot. I liked the style of the storytelling.

429
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I loved the mechanic about how your character can become a shadow.

430
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
And basically the shadow kind of blends into the wall.

431
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
And you solve these puzzles and move around in the shadow.

432
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And then you can phase out. And then you get later in the game you phase objects in with you.

433
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And that's how you move things around.

434
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's a really interesting little mechanic.

435
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The game's a bit buggy, unfortunately.

436
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You really see some graphical bugs as you're going through it.

437
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I have a really bad feeling this game was rushed.

438
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Probably to try to make the PlayStation 4 release.

439
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
But yeah, there are some bugs.

440
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But nothing that broke the game for me.

441
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Yes, I did see some graphical glitches.

442
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But it was nothing that broke the game or took me too far out of the environment and being able to see it.

443
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Which I really love the style of the French carnival sort of theme that the game had to it.

444
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It was really cool.

445
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And it's short. It's a short game.

446
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You could probably play the damn thing start to finish in about...

447
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You could speed run it probably in like 45 minutes if even that.

448
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But I think a normal person playing through it, it'll probably take them about 3 hours to play through it.

449
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Depending on how good at platformers you are.

450
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It wasn't anything too, too difficult.

451
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
But I thought the story was good enough.

452
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And the ending kind of made me go, oh, that's kind of neat.

453
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I was left feeling pretty good about the ending.

454
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Even though in the last section I was like, alright, they're trying to wrap things up pretty quick.

455
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So I think it was a little bit rushed, which is too bad.

456
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But for the most part I enjoyed the game, especially for the price of free.

457
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And I enjoyed my time with it.

458
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
So yeah, I did play through that start to finish.

459
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I also played Resogun, which I know a lot of people on PlayStation 4 are playing.

460
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And the only thing that kind of bugged me about Resogun is...

461
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I was almost overwhelmed by all the buttons there were for a little shooter.

462
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Because you have the overdrive and the bombs and everything.

463
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And I don't think the tutorial in the game is really that good.

464
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
But I figured it out eventually.

465
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And I guess through a little bit of trial and error I was able to figure out how it works.

466
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Like, oh, okay, you shoot the little green ships.

467
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And that's what breaks the guys out of the cage.

468
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
So when you see those, okay, now I've got to go pick up the guys.

469
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That took me a little bit to kind of get the hang of in some trial and error.

470
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But once I got the hang of it, Resogun's a pretty fun game too.

471
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And then one other game that I've been playing...

472
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Well, I've been playing the two pinball games, of course.

473
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But those I've already talked about on prior episodes of the show.

474
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I would say the one other game I've been playing a little bit of on PlayStation 4 is Don't Starve.

475
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Which is the free game right now for January, which of course is also available on Steam.

476
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
A lot of people playing that on the PC.

477
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Don't Starve is kind of neat because it's almost, in some ways it's kind of like Minecraft.

478
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Where you're trying to go around the world and collect things and craft.

479
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And you've got to do things so that the creepers don't get you in the middle of the night.

480
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's almost like that same type of thing.

481
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Except it's more in a 2D world.

482
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
But I don't want to make people think it's Terraria because it's not.

483
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,000
It plays a lot more like a overhead, kind of like Zelda-esque, if you will, type of game.

484
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But you're like gathering things and crafting and trying to survive through the night type of thing.

485
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The only thing that bugged me about Don't Starve, and some people are going to criticize me for this viewpoint.

486
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But I don't care because it's my viewpoint.

487
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And this bugs me about games.

488
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,000
The game had no tutorial, no explanation, nothing.

489
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Just throws you in and you've got to figure it out.

490
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Okay, I understand that that's the charm of some games and some games are better for that.

491
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
But I'm going to be honest with you guys.

492
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I didn't like Minecraft for the longest time because of that exact same thing.

493
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
When I first played Minecraft, I was like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

494
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What the hell is this?

495
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
What am I supposed to do in this game? What's the point?

496
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
It wasn't until I played it on the 360 that it had a short five minute tutorial thing where I was like,

497
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
oh, this isn't so bad. I get this now.

498
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Oh, Minecraft is actually kind of fun.

499
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I think Don't Starve, although I get that the whole joke is the object of the game, Rob, is don't starve.

500
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Okay, yeah, I get that.

501
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But I think even just a couple, a little short explanation about this is what the game, this is what you're supposed to be doing,

502
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
would have helped a little bit.

503
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But not everybody is going to agree with me there.

504
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Some will argue that that's the whole charm of the game is being able to see it unfold what the game really is as you're playing.

505
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But I'm going to tell you, in my mind, that was a little bit of a hindrance in the beginning.

506
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And sure enough, there's Bobby in the chat room saying, they said that that was by design, the lack of a tutorial.

507
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Well, I'm saying that was not a good design choice, in my opinion, and I'm entitled to my opinion.

508
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He's also saying that the PS4 counterparts of Contrast and Flower, both compared to the PS3,

509
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
and in the case of Contrast, the 360 version are both maintained framerate and smoothness much better.

510
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Oh, really?

511
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Which is interesting because I always seem to remember new consoles, especially new architectures,

512
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,000
kind of lagging in certain ways and not being able to keep up just because the optimizations and efficiencies haven't really been worked out.

513
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
But apparently that's not the case for these.

514
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Okay, at least somebody agrees with me in chat.

515
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Fifth Dream says, yeah, I can't get a hold on Don't Starve, and I don't feel like going to Game Facts to get a manual.

516
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That's how I feel.

517
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt says, I'm glad you enjoyed it though, Rob.

518
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Yeah, I had a hard time figuring it at first.

519
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
If it weren't for me playing it at PAX East and watching others play it, I wouldn't have gotten it either.

520
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So there you go.

521
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yeah, I did play a little more, and I was starting to get into it.

522
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I was like, okay, I get it a little more, but it's one of those games I need to go back and play more.

523
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Because honestly, I played Don't Starve for maybe an hour or so, but then I was like, I need to go back and finish contrast.

524
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So I did.

525
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Otherwise, PC, I've still been playing a lot on PC.

526
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I know I've been going on and on, but I've actually been doing a lot of gaming this week.

527
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I just want to give a shout-out to this game as well, because I was playing an awful lot of it this week.

528
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And I continue to play Path of Exile, which is the free-to-play game that's an awful lot like Diablo.

529
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Honestly, I think Path of Exile is a better game than Diablo 3.

530
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,000
And one of the things that they do, that Diablo doesn't do, is that they do these races, they do these league races.

531
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And I did my first race this week where it was a one-hour, it was called One Hour Endless Ledge,

532
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
where you would play the ledge levels of the game that were just over and over.

533
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
There was no caves or anything, you just play those levels over and over.

534
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And it was who could level the highest in an hour.

535
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And it was my first time, I didn't do that great.

536
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But I didn't die, it was all in hardcore mode, and I got to level 12 or 13 without dying.

537
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Now the people that were doing really well, they got all the way to level 26 and so forth,

538
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
so I ended up maybe in the middle of the pack above a bunch of dead characters.

539
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
But I was still pleased with my progress, and I had fun with it, which is the most important part.

540
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So yeah, if you like roguelikes, Diablo games, you really owe it to yourself to try Path of Exile.

541
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That game is great, and I can't believe it's free.

542
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
All of the microtransactions are either additional inventory space or cosmetic things,

543
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and they've been making it work, because people have been supporting them after playing a lot of the games.

544
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
That's great.

545
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Alright, over at live.vognetwork.com, Nate432 says,

546
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Is Killzone any good to get for PlayStation 4?

547
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Again, I don't have any disc-based games yet.

548
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
That's probably in the next week, I'll have some of those.

549
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I've been hearing good things about Killzone, but I have not checked it out myself yet,

550
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
so I really couldn't say anything about that game.

551
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
DarkSakura in our chat room reminding us, speaking of Diablo-like games,

552
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Torchlight 2 is on sale right now.

553
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Yeah, Torchlight 2 is also a really, really great game in that same family as Diablo 3 and Path of Exile and so forth,

554
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and that's really good.

555
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Okay, I've yammered on enough.

556
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
There was even more stuff I played, but I've yammered on plenty.

557
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Let's go to some more gaming weeks.

558
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

559
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Well, let's see, this week I played a little bit of Minecraft.

560
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
In fact, right now I'm spying on the people playing Minecraft right now on the VOG Network server,

561
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
thanks to the dynamic map that we have on there.

562
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I did play that too, and I'm glad to see more people are using it this time, it's great.

563
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah, we've got three people on there right now, so that's fantastic.

564
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So I've been doing that, I'm actually doing some planning and stuff,

565
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
just trying to fix the mob arena thing that we have in there,

566
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
doing new classes for that, and one of the things we kind of came across today is

567
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I may force upon everybody a resource pack, which will adjust some of the skins in the game

568
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
to maybe change some of the weapons they have, firing other objects,

569
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
instead of making them look like hoes, it'll look like a gun or something,

570
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
so I may put that into effect at some point.

571
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
So I have that, and then, what else did I play? I played a ton of different things actually.

572
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I played Grand Theft Auto 5 this week, I went back and played some of the online in there,

573
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and so far so good there, I leveled up to like 42 I think on Xbox,

574
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and so I played through that and then passed my first survival mode in there, so that was pretty cool.

575
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I played a little bit of Child of Eden, because I actually bought the digital version off eBay

576
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
for like 6 bucks a while back using some of my eBay points or whatever,

577
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
and so I actually played that a little bit because Josh wanted to see me play games,

578
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
and he wanted to see that game, so I'm like ok fine we'll play that,

579
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
and so I played that a little bit, it's still fun,

580
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
and let's see I also tried, there was a couple indie games I checked out,

581
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:56,000
I did play Time Viking and Space Raptor, which is, it's silly and cheap,

582
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
but great music in it, so fun little dollar indie game that you can buy.

583
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I noticed that like mostly indie games on Xbox Live, indie games as far as like the top ranked ones,

584
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
they're all Minecraft type games, or some sort of Deathmatch type games,

585
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
it's Avatar Deathmatches or Minecraft, that's everything.

586
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Minecraft games are the new hello world for game development.

587
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Pretty much, let's see, I was going to say also, what else did I play,

588
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
I played a little bit of Call of Duty, and actually went back this week also

589
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
and was working a little bit on Saints Row IV, so I played through that a bit.

590
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
What else, I was redeeming some more Steam codes that I've been sitting on for a while from some old Humble Bundles,

591
00:48:49,000 --> 00:49:01,000
so I'm now up to 197 games, and I thought I played some other Steam games that I had, maybe not,

592
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
but I'm going to try to get through this backlog of games I have maybe this year,

593
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and try to play at least everything once.

594
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Alright, well good luck in that goal, especially trying to get through that huge Steam library I know you've got going on there.

595
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh yeah.

596
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
A lot of discussion in our chat room over at live.voguenetwork.com around Torchlight 2,

597
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
there's a couple people interested in it while it's still on that Steam sale,

598
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
so I see a few people kind of jumping on that, so that's pretty good.

599
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Let's see, Fifth Dream says, I got Child of Eden physical copy for like $4, I haven't played much yet though.

600
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So, looks like you can find that on pretty good sales at some places.

601
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Before we get into Jason and what he's been playing this week,

602
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
well DarkSakura wanted me to pass along, because DarkSakura wanted to talk about her gaming week with y'all,

603
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
and so DarkSakura did not go into-

604
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
She obviously sent you a virus over IRC.

605
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
She has passed me her sinus infection somehow through the inner tubes.

606
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
DarkSakura says Animal Crossing and My Japanese Coach, she's been playing,

607
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
and Russian Dancing Men, aka WeebleStuff version of VibRibbon.

608
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I have no- is that-

609
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
She was talking about that last week.

610
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I've never heard of that, it's kind of neat.

611
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Well, it wasn't exactly a big topic, but she said it was coming out and she needed to play some of it this week.

612
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Gotcha.

613
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So she did.

614
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
And DarkSakura says, and Minecraft, my Normandy is amazing.

615
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Yeah, I know, when I logged into Minecraft, I went into the VoG server this week,

616
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
and I saw that Normandy that you guys built DarkSakura, that is damn impressive.

617
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It's huge.

618
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
There's a huge Normandy, that ship.

619
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
But the only problem with the Normandy is, there's no door on it.

620
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
So the only way to get in, somebody finally cut a hole in the ceiling,

621
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
so I noticed it when I was flying over, I was like, oh, somebody put a hole in the ceiling.

622
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So I went in and I was like, damn, this thing is huge.

623
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So that was very impressive.

624
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
In fact, I think somebody had left a sign that said, holy shit.

625
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
And so I left another sign that just pointed at it and said this.

626
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm with stupid?

627
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah, something like that, something like that.

628
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Well, listen, let me be honest.

629
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I didn't actually make that, it's a schematic file.

630
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I just was testing out one of the plugins I have,

631
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,000
which is like a little NPC character that goes around and builds stuff off a schematic.

632
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So I don't want to have like 50 Normities, though, on the map,

633
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
so that's why I'm not saying how to do it.

634
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But I will have different schematic files that people will be able to generate.

635
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
You can actually do it instantly with WorldEdit,

636
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
but it's more fun watching an NPC run back and forth and actually build it block by block.

637
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I don't know.

638
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
No, that is, I would like to see that in progress sometime.

639
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
That's pretty cool.

640
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
So there's Dark Soccer's gaming week.

641
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
All right, now we can go to Jason.

642
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Jason, how was your gaming week?

643
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Since it's been forever since I've played it

644
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and since I'm a little bit interested in a lot of the stuff that's been added in,

645
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I actually downloaded, went back to Minecraft.net and downloaded the client again,

646
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
and I didn't do anything else with it.

647
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
So I didn't play Minecraft this week.

648
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I actually jumped into this gaming, this generation of console gaming.

649
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
We, for a long time now, the office has a couple of Xbox 360s, a couple of PS3s,

650
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
and more often than not, the game that a bunch of my coworkers play is FIFA.

651
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Earlier in the week last week, or Friday the week before,

652
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
sometime very recently, I walked into our little gaming section of the office

653
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
and there was a whole bunch of green boxes stacked in one of the chairs.

654
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And I walked over to it wondering what it was,

655
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
because it seemed kind of familiar, and sure enough, it was an Xbox One and two controllers.

656
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
While I'm still in the office, we'll have all four,

657
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and I can actually put the controller that I bought for myself to use.

658
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
When the system by itself came in, there was only Forza.

659
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We're left to our own accounts, so if I want to buy any games

660
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
and be able to play them there, I can.

661
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I didn't.

662
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I downloaded Dead Rising, Killer Instinct, and what was the other demo?

663
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Lego Marvel, but I didn't actually get a chance to play that.

664
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So, since Forza was the only title there and I was interested in checking it out,

665
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I got the whole system set up, which was kind of a nightmare,

666
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
because when you turn on the system, you get a picture of the controller

667
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
and a little pulsating thing over the guide button,

668
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,000
or whatever they're calling it, this generation.

669
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It'll also start showing you the pair button on top if you have to pair it with the system.

670
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
So I did that, and it recognized that the controller connected,

671
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
and then the controller would zoom in and there would be a pulsating light over the A button.

672
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And I hit it, and it didn't do anything.

673
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
So I tried the other controllers.

674
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
They synced, but the A button didn't do anything.

675
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
TLDR, I reset that console probably six to seven times.

676
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Just restarted, not deleted everything and started all over.

677
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I restarted that console at least six times before I could actually get the controller to sync and start it to join the wireless.

678
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,000
To its credit, the entertainment center that we have in the room is basically like a gigantic shielded cage,

679
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
so we had to wind up setting the one on top of it so that it could get enough signal to play.

680
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But then there was the 500 meg firmware patch, initial firmware patch that took longer to download than it should have,

681
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
even after we resolved the wireless problems.

682
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
A couple strange connectivity issues that I'm, because we used the wireless at work,

683
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm pretty damn sure is a 360's fault and not ours, but I digress.

684
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It was a hassle. It took two to three hours process that was completely nonsensical.

685
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I don't expect it to happen again if and when I actually wind up buying that console this generation.

686
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Okay, Forza, really, really, really good looking.

687
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,000
BlackWolf made a comment when he was talking about this game a couple weeks ago that the outrage,

688
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the worst thing of Forza is the crowd and they look flat because I think they actually are,

689
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
or certainly they don't have body depth.

690
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And he said it wasn't a big deal because you don't focus on the crowd.

691
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I'm gonna disagree with that because when I was playing, whenever I play a driving game,

692
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I will either play over the shoulder Birdseye style or I will play in the car itself.

693
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
What other ways are there, Jason?

694
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
There's technically, so the difference is...

695
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Dog style, hanging out the side window.

696
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Ace Ventura, cracked windshield style.

697
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
That's the first time I've heard dog style used in a clean context.

698
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I was trying to quip that myself as well.

699
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So to be fair, there's two in-car views with car decoration without car decoration.

700
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,000
And there's various levels like, like, you know, Daytona had the four styles.

701
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It's basically, those really are the only two ways.

702
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
In the beginning, Jason, it just kind of sounded like some car out of the car.

703
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Sometimes I like to be inside and sometimes I like to be outside.

704
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
From space, RC style.

705
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Sometimes I like warm weather and sometimes I like cold weather.

706
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Sometimes I'm in the front seat, sometimes I'm in the back seat.

707
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's Sunday, it's Sunday.

708
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So I was playing in the driver's seat.

709
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And the track that I remember most vividly is the Top Gear test course.

710
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And the announcers, you know, they're all over that game.

711
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
And the people stick out like a sore thumb.

712
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Their colors are a little bit off.

713
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And when you're coming up like, you know, you're coming into a turn that's practically a U-turn.

714
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And so you come in on one side of the people, wrap around them and head off.

715
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:43,000
And when they don't rotate or when you should be able to see the depth of the people and they look off, it's distracting.

716
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Maybe that means I'm not paying enough attention to the road.

717
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Probably true, but I still picked up to it.

718
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
If it's obvious enough, though, that you kind of look at...

719
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And I've done this in games before where it's like, maybe it's not really a big deal.

720
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
But I'll kind of look at it and go, okay, that looks weird and out of place.

721
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I've definitely done that before.

722
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:08,000
When they're putting in the effort to model all of the raindrops on the car and all the different reflections and stuff.

723
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
But they can't spend a couple polygons extra on the people.

724
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
To be fair, there are probably thousands, but the comparison you're making is very relevant.

725
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Did it ruin the game, Joe?

726
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Oh, hell no. It absolutely did not.

727
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It stuck out and it was...

728
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
You just wanted to disagree with one of Bobby's points here on the show.

729
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I am totally okay with that, Jason.

730
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I... yeah.

731
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Love you, Bobby.

732
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And at the same time, I also knew about it leading in.

733
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
So, oh yeah, I did see that.

734
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Whatever.

735
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Confirmation bias. I don't know.

736
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
But it was still an absolutely gorgeous game.

737
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I had a whole bunch of fun with it.

738
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
To the extent that I can have fun with a simulation racer.

739
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I'm very much more of an arcade racer.

740
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I played around with a coworker where I turned all of the assists off.

741
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Ah, that game sucked.

742
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Without Anilock breaking and the guide arrow.

743
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
One little piece of disappointment that I learned is that I thought...

744
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So when I started playing the game, I knew there was a little bit of assistances in breaking, automatic transmission, all that kind of stuff.

745
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:18,000
But it wasn't until I raced a coworker that I found out that straight up breaking is assisted for you, too.

746
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:26,000
That kind of disappointed me because that's like half... well over half the challenge of racing is appropriate breaking for drifting and turns and all that kind of stuff.

747
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Can you turn it off bit by bit, though?

748
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yes, absolutely.

749
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Because I remember... I was like, in Forza Horizon, you could choose what assists you wanted.

750
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I'm also... and also, you know...

751
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
There's brakes in this game?

752
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
What was that?

753
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I've never used brakes, so I don't know.

754
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I thought those were the walls that we ran into.

755
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Brakes are for wusses.

756
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And also, to be fair, I have never played a Forza title before. Ever. This was my first one.

757
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Horizon is so good. I really hope they do Horizon 2 for Xbox One.

758
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Honestly, if they come out at E3 and they're like, Forza Horizon 2 this holiday, I'm gonna be like, I just bought an Xbox One.

759
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Well, you have six months to save up, so five months you can manage.

760
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Totally fair.

761
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But, yeah, I had a really fun time. I started racing on above average.

762
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I liked the fact that I could blow past Black Wolf's Drivatar within the first lap of the race.

763
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Not to keep hammering on Bobby's points, but it's my only frame of reference right now because I haven't played the Xbox One Forza myself.

764
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I know he talked a lot about how the Drivatar system was really... what's your thoughts on that?

765
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I think that's a very hard thing to judge because I just now played the game, I don't have the reference of knowledge of how much detail Bobby went into that game.

766
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So what he did or didn't use assist-wise, what difficulty level he raced on, I have no idea.

767
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I do remember him talking about consistently being about halfway up the field, like 7-6, something like that.

768
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
At least that's what I remember.

769
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I pretty consistently, on the 100% defaults with all assists and on average, could hit first or second without too much difficulty.

770
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I started playing around with some of the assists, then I also turned the difficulty to above average, which is just one step up.

771
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I think there's still two more ahead of it. Fourth, fifth.

772
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Don't be showing off your skill too much here.

773
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
My real question, I guess, in this is, is the Drivatar system a good thing or a bad thing in your opinion?

774
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I like it because of the bonuses and benefits that it provides to a particular account, to a particular player.

775
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And the driving felt... I read a lot into the fact that, oh, you're racing a real person instead of AI.

776
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
That's horseshit. It's learned AI.

777
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But it still felt right because there were still the right kind of challenges and the differences between the tracks that people would take.

778
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It wasn't just 12 competing cards on the perfect guideline, and they would actually take insides and outsides when they shouldn't necessarily do that.

779
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:19,000
So it kept the same sort of variety that I've learned from simulation games, and it still felt like a good, challenging race.

780
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I guess that's what it boils down to.

781
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And as those cars can continue to race, they provide credits, in-game credits, back to the player, which seems fun. A benefit for everybody.

782
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Any other Xbox One titles you were just checking, like Killer Instinct?

783
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
A little bit of Killer Instinct, and I am also completely terrible at that game too.

784
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I went through, I played a couple training matches. Yeah, whatever, I'm okay. I remember a little bit from the SNES days.

785
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I started grinding through the dojo, and I got 15 or 16 stages in, and I was starting to understand the mechanic.

786
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
But I was literally just pouring through, this is how you low punch, this is how you low kick.

787
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I've heard that Killer Instinct has a really good tutorial though.

788
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's incredibly granular, it is incredibly comprehensive.

789
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:14,000
But it was the last thing I played before I left, so I was kind of running through it as quickly as possible, maybe not reading as much of the detail and getting into it.

790
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
But I want to revisit that, obviously I still have a chance to.

791
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Played a little bit of Dead Rising 3.

792
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
It's Dead Rising?

793
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Oh god, Dead Rising demo has a 30 minute limit, or 20 minute limit, one of the two, and two execution limits.

794
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You can only start the demo two times.

795
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I don't get it.

796
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
This seems like, like, I...

797
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,000
They don't want people to just play the demo over and over.

798
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
You can't even play, like, give us more than two executions so we can understand if we're gonna play the game differently, let us play the game differently.

799
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
But a two execution limit with a time limit is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

800
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,000
I mean the DS demos have what, 30? But it's the full game.

801
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Any demo with a limit of how many times you can execute it is fucking stupid.

802
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Yeah, I've played, I've played Sonic, Mario and Sonic at the Summer Olympics, one of the two.

803
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:22,000
And I knocked down, like, six or seven rounds of that while I was trying to decide if I wanted to pick up the game or not.

804
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:30,000
That's, that's liberal that if you play the demo 30 times, I don't know, I don't see a situation where that's bad.

805
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
But the DS games aren't the full, wait, is the Xbox One demo the full game, or is it just like the first 20 minutes?

806
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I doubt it.

807
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Okay, I was gonna say.

808
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
It drops you in the action and there's no story to speak of.

809
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Okay, because the DS demos, like the ones that I've played, like Kingdom Hearts, Dream Drop Distance, and The Resident Evil, you know, that's just a small section of the game.

810
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Especially the Kingdom Hearts one was not really that in depth, and it still has a 30 play limit.

811
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And it's like, I would maybe need two, but I honestly got a feel for this off one.

812
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I don't know who the, what the character's name is, I don't know why he's doing what he's doing, I don't know where it's taking place, because I don't think it was Willamette or, or, uh...

813
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
No, it's a whole separate story.

814
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah, and I kind of gleaned a little bit just from the communication that's happening and whatnot, but there are no details of the game.

815
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:22,000
They just start you, which is great, but the two execution limit is still gonna bug me, because I can only play it in theory one more time before I leave.

816
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And I, because I didn't have enough time to play it the first time, that means I have to really make the most of the second time, and then I'm screwed.

817
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Which is very strange to me.

818
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Um...

819
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Anything else quickly before we get into, I wanna, we've been running for about an hour, so I just wanna make sure we get to news.

820
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Well, if somebody didn't have to talk about so many lewd acts, no, no, no.

821
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Look, the viewers want ass and titties, I'm sorry.

822
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We gave it to them.

823
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I think that that's certainly the most important. That was the notable parts of my week.

824
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Although I would, I would like to hear more about Xbox One, I just, I'm gonna have to come visit and see it in action.

825
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Do it.

826
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I really did not get a feel for PlayStation 4 until I really got to see it in action, which honestly wasn't until I really got one myself.

827
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And just got to really see how the interface has just, and I imagine it's gotta be the same on Xbox One.

828
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's the same for everything. How can you take something in when you're not in your own, like, comfort zone to sit down there and take it all in?

829
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Exactly, but one thing I noticed about PlayStation 4, and I'm sure you noticed this about Xbox One, is that there was a lot that I was doing on PlayStation 4,

830
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
where I was like, oh, this is what PlayStation 3 needed to do.

831
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Like, queuing up a game to download, and it downloads the game and the patches while you're in standby mode,

832
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
it just does it, and then it's installed, ready to go the next time you turn on your PlayStation 4.

833
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
That's what we all expected the PS3 to do.

834
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Two quick other anecdotes.

835
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,000
A coworker of mine was talking about how slow the installation process is on the Xbox One.

836
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And I agreed with him at the time, but I forgot that Forza is a 6 gig install, and it was gonna take a long time.

837
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
The fact that I was playing after half of it got installed, pretty damn nice.

838
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I was playing in less than 10 to 15 minutes, if I recall correctly.

839
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And, hey, Weiland, Xbox, turn off. Sorry.

840
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Related to this, another coworker of mine, we were...

841
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Did you see the video? I don't know if this is where you go with it. Did you see the video on YouTube of the guy who's...

842
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:28,000
He actually went into Call of Duty, and his name, his gamertag, was Xbox shut down.

843
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
And so he did this...

844
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Hey, it's Xbox, sign off.

845
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Oh, that's it, thank you. Xbox, sign off.

846
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Sorry to anybody who's listening on Xbox One, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

847
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
And you thought what I did was bad.

848
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
I know, unplug your Kinect for a minute, because I gotta tell this story.

849
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
So his name is Xbox, sign off.

850
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
And, like, all these people, while he's playing Call of Duty, because you know how people will tend to call people out.

851
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Hey, Xbox, sign off. Off.

852
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Okay. No, but he would be jumping up and down in front of players, and people would be like,

853
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
What the hell are you doing, Xbox, sign off?

854
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

855
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,000
The reactions were pretty fucking funny, I gotta say. Anyway, sorry, tangent.

856
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So we were, again, crowded around our gaming room, and me and coworkers were just kind of socializing.

857
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,000
And we started talking about something that I wanted to show a video of.

858
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And so I'm, you know, I'm facing my coworkers away from the Kinect, and I just kind of turn my head over to the left.

859
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Xbox, launch YouTube.

860
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
One of my coworkers looks at me and busts out in laughter.

861
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And then the TV starts doing things, he's like,

862
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Whoa! How'd you do that?

863
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I was like, I just told you, dude. I just told you and the Xbox.

864
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And then he busted up in laughter again, because he didn't realize it was actually gonna work that way.

865
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Kind of fun, relatively natural voice.

866
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
The fact that there's no dictation, speech to text, is obnoxious.

867
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
There is for being searching, there is not for anything else.

868
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
So far as I could tell, so far as I could figure out.

869
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
A couple of other weird nitpicky things, but I've used my Kinect with the 360 quite a bit.

870
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I enjoyed it. There's better integration on the Xbox One.

871
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm gonna take advantage of it.

872
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Hopefully they fix these rough edges for the shitty troll commands.

873
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Alright, let's get into, since we've talked about our gaming weeks,

874
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
and quite extensively gone over some of the new consoles,

875
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
I'm curious, those of you guys that have been getting your PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones,

876
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
what are your guys' thoughts on everything?

877
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Certainly would open up the email bag for that.

878
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

879
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Other housekeeping I want to mention, don't forget to follow us on Twitter.

880
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We also have a Facebook page.

881
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

882
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
We will be here next week.

883
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
The roadshow we've been talking about doing this month

884
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
is gonna have to be put on the back burner for a little while.

885
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm hoping we can reschedule that for the summer at some point,

886
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
but it's not gonna work out.

887
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
With all the personal stuff people are going through on the show right now,

888
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
it's just not gonna be able to be happening.

889
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
But I'm hoping something like that can be rescheduled for the summer.

890
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
We'll see. That would be exciting.

891
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into gaming news.

892
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

893
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Yes, so this week at CES, there were some announcements from Sony.

894
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And during their press conference, they announced a few things,

895
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:19,000
including PlayStation Now, which is what they're calling their brand new Gaikai service.

896
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It's gonna be launching this summer,

897
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
and it's basically meant to bring streaming of PlayStation 3,

898
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
PlayStation 2, and PlayStation games to the PlayStation 4, PS3, Vita,

899
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and other devices, including tablets, TVs, and I'm not sure about phones,

900
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
but definitely other devices, Android and iOS and stuff like that.

901
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So very cool.

902
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
And they were even showing off a demo at the convention

903
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
where people were playing The Last of Us on a Vita.

904
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And apparently it worked pretty well.

905
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
But it's hard to say right now how it's actually gonna work in a real-world environment

906
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
since they had the server basically down the hall,

907
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
but it looks pretty cool and something that I'm looking forward to,

908
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
especially since I have a big library of PlayStation Plus games.

909
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It'll be interesting to see how well those will stream.

910
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Yeah, it's one of those things where you really don't know how it's gonna go

911
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
until you are able to get your hands on it.

912
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
And I just think there's so much potential for variables.

913
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
And even though PlayStation might be able to get this thing working flawlessly in their bubble,

914
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
how's it gonna work in the real world?

915
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:37,000
For people that live out maybe not in a major city, is it really gonna be that good?

916
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
How's it gonna work?

917
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Well, they said it's basically that you only need five gigabits down,

918
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I think is what the minimum was for it to work.

919
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
That's still high for some people.

920
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
For a lot of people it's not bad.

921
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
For some people that's still high.

922
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
True, but networks are improving and speeds are getting faster.

923
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Yes, that's true.

924
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So maybe by the summer it'll be rolled out in more locations,

925
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
and it's not necessarily something that everybody wants to do.

926
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I don't know, I think it's a neat idea.

927
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah, I'm curious to see too what pricing looks like.

928
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I love the idea of possibly a Netflix-style library for PS1 and PS2 games.

929
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
That would be freaking awesome.

930
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Yeah, that's true.

931
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
The other thing is they mentioned that there may be some sort of rental program built into there,

932
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,000
as well as some sort of subscription program that would be separate from PlayStation Plus.

933
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I'd be wondering too if I bought games on, let's say on PlayStation 3,

934
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I actually bought PlayStation 1 games in the store,

935
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
because there was a couple of those I bought.

936
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I think about Castlevania Chronicles and City Code and One.

937
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
If I bought those games in the store, would I get access to those on PlayStation 4?

938
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I would think that you probably would.

939
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
You would think, but maybe not.

940
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I don't think it should be a given.

941
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I mean, look at Virtual Console.

942
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
You have to pay a dollar to upgrade on Wii U.

943
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Yeah, but look at a lot of the stuff that Sony's done.

944
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Most of their stuff is cross-buy anyway,

945
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,000
so they were kind of the people that brought that to the forefront as far as,

946
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
hey, you buy it on one console, you get it on all of the consoles.

947
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Nintendo hasn't really picked up on that yet.

948
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
They figured, hey, we can charge you a few extra bucks for this Virtual Console title,

949
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
because one, we overcharge you from the get-go in the first place,

950
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
and two, we did things to it this time, so you need to pay us more money.

951
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
I was going to say the same thing with the cross-buy initiative.

952
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I think it's a pretty safe thing to say that Sony will be as loose with it

953
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
in terms of compatibility that they can with regard to things like compatibility.

954
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Well, we'll see. More details probably on this in the coming months.

955
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Did they say that this was coming out sooner rather than later,

956
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,000
or is it the type of thing where we won't see more until E3?

957
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Summer.

958
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So E3, you'll see a lot more on this.

959
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Maybe they'll unveil it, or they'll roll it out at E3. Who knows?

960
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
All right. Well, meanwhile, in the world of Xbox One,

961
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Xbox One, you can view Twitch streams on Xbox One,

962
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
but you can't broadcast ass and titties yet on Xbox One.

963
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And a lot of people are asking, well, when is that going to happen?

964
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Well, a tweet from Twitch TV themselves indicates that it might be a little while.

965
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
A tweet that went out earlier this week said,

966
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Xbox One direct broadcasting. There is no ETA at this time for Microsoft.

967
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Expect a few more months. If we know sooner, we'll update.

968
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:40,000
And there's no reason for this. We don't know what the real holdup is or what's going on.

969
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
We don't know if maybe Microsoft might actually be seeing what's going on on Sony's system

970
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
and some of the things we talked about at the beginning of the show.

971
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Maybe they're getting some cold feet about some of it. I don't know.

972
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Or it could just simply be a programming. I mean, we don't know.

973
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
We could make things up until the cows come home.

974
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
But it doesn't seem like it's going to be happening anytime soon.

975
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I want to say I saw a related story where an executive said,

976
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:08,000
We promised it before E3. So this thing could not be out until April or May or even early June at this point.

977
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Or maybe I think they could still get away with putting it out at E3 and still come out looking good.

978
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I think maybe it's just more complicated because the way they have their systems set up.

979
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The fact that it's like three operating systems running on top of each other.

980
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,000
That they may not know how. It may be hard to. What exactly do we show on this?

981
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Is it just going to show everything or is it going to show just the game?

982
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Or we can also have this stuff that's snapped in there because remember it has an HDMI in on it.

983
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
That could be maybe there's some sort of abuse to that.

984
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
They're just trying to make sure they can filter all that stuff out maybe.

985
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Maybe. We'll see. So I'm very curious to see how different it looks when it comes out.

986
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Or if it's going to be very similar to what you see on PlayStation 4.

987
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Well it's going to look like Metro I'll tell you that much.

988
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Which is a whole bunch of squares so maybe it's not too terribly different from what the PS4 did.

989
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Is everything a table of blocks and tables and squares and maybe not so squares? It's just the easy thing to do.

990
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Even the PlayStation one is kind of blocks and squares though.

991
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,000
It could be worse. It could be like the Vita where everything circles.

992
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You mean Google Plus style?

993
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Alright.

994
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:30,000
State of Decays developer Undead Labs has signed a multi-year, multi-title agreement with Microsoft Studios.

995
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,000
A lot of the speculation of what this means is that Undead Labs can start proceeding.

996
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:43,000
That they got the green light for an MMO that is still going under the name Class 4 right now.

997
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:48,000
But that doesn't really suffice the multi-title agreement.

998
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:53,000
But that's the odds on favorite to take place.

999
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
New contract which is a nice antithesis to everything that was happening last week with everything just kind of disappearing.

1000
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
So at least we're getting a positive outlook continuing into the year.

1001
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I would just like to see an actual, I guess we will see an MMO on the Xbox One once the Elder Scrolls Online launches.

1002
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,000
But maybe something else on there?

1003
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
It'll happen.

1004
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
I mean online is prevalent and powerful enough now that if they're not doing it they're missing out.

1005
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Well I don't know how it is on Xbox One because I know Killer Instinct is their big free to play thing that's out.

1006
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And I don't know what else is there but I did notice there is a pretty big push on PlayStation 4.

1007
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
There's several free to play things, like I knew there was DC Universe but I didn't realize there was Warframe.

1008
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
There's one other one that's like a free to play first person shooter on there.

1009
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
There's already like a handful of free to play things on PlayStation 4 so I don't know.

1010
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Anything that you may have picked up from PlayStation Plus is only sweetening the deal.

1011
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yeah really.

1012
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Well I don't know, to be honest these free to play games that are available on PlayStation 4 I don't know if they're system sellers.

1013
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,000
They're all available on PC.

1014
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Well maybe not system sellers but let's compare your experience of starting to mine.

1015
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I played one, two retail titles now with FIFA.

1016
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I've played two retail titles now and everything else was a demo.

1017
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:23,000
The marketplace on Xbox One didn't rub me the right way just in available titles and especially arcade titles in general.

1018
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Yeah they were out there but they weren't particularly prevalent and it felt like I would look through, I would thumb through the catalog in ten seconds and I had seen everything and I was done with it.

1019
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
I think, I don't think PlayStation 4 is as much better as you might think.

1020
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:46,000
There's still, I mean the good news is a lot of the stuff that's there, there's a lot of free to play stuff with the pinball and so forth and the PlayStation Plus stuff since they didn't have Drive Club.

1021
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Remember, Contrast and Resogun weren't supposed to be free but they ended up pushing those through as free because they weren't able to get Drive Club out for the launch.

1022
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:04,000
And these are new consoles, they haven't had a chance for the catalog to come up or new titles and not just classic whatever backwards compatibility system they do have.

1023
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Yeah, still to come.

1024
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Alright, let's go to Loki.

1025
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Alright, so of course the MPD numbers have finally come out and before that there were some pre-end of the year announcements of sales and for 2013 the Nintendo 3DS software sales of course increased and they've sold 11.5 million units in the US.

1026
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And I guess they're planning to announce their third quarter earnings later this month but right now they're saying that's a 45% increase in software sales from 2012.

1027
01:18:50,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Which, yeah, there's a lot of good titles that came out this year and even I would think a lot of stuff that was coming out at the end of the last, well 2012, like Mario Kart 7 and Super Mario 3D Land or whatever it was.

1028
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Those are some good titles so they've had a pretty good year I'd say.

1029
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Moving on from that, let's get our first look at next gen sales.

1030
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
The 3DS had a good year but did they say anything on the Wii U at all?

1031
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Oh no, Wii U what?

1032
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Yeah exactly, that's what worries me a little bit is when Nintendo doesn't really say anything about the Wii U then you kind of go, hmm.

1033
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I think we've all known this though that 2013 was a rough year for them.

1034
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Well, but then there was that wank that came out last week about how VG Charts had said that they outsold the Xbox One in the last week.

1035
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Wasn't that like literally like two days of the end of the year though? Plus it was an end of the year story.

1036
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Just saying.

1037
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Colin, 2012, 2012 was a wash, 2013 was a year.

1038
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Let's put it this way, they outsold the Xbox One for the entire year but the Xbox One has been out for a month and a half versus the Wii U that was out for the entire year.

1039
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Oh, I didn't even realize that the time, that's just plain silly.

1040
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:20,000
That's what they were talking about. Not in that same time frame as when, you know, not in that six week time frame, they're talking about the entire year.

1041
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
So yeah, that's not that impressive.

1042
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Alright.

1043
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Speaking of the Xbox One though, the Xbox One hit 3 million sales before the end of the year.

1044
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
And that's actually sold through and not just sold to stores.

1045
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:45,000
They of course, they passed the 1 million mark on the first day of retail across 13 markets because they launched globally.

1046
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And it only took them 18 days to make 2 million.

1047
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And of course, to go along with that, Sony announced during their press conference at CES that they've sold 4.2 million units of consoles worldwide as of the 28th of December.

1048
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And I guess they were saying that they were meaning to ASL another, they sold 2.1 million units across December.

1049
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
So that's pretty good. I'm not sure what they're forecasting though for 2014 but they definitely hit their number.

1050
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:38,000
I think they were originally saying they wanted to hit 3 million by the end of the year so not bad.

1051
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Yeah, they're still pretty hard to find so 15 million units! Pinky's up. Anyone knows.

1052
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Well it's going to be interesting because I think, like I mentioned before, I think we're running into a similar situation where there's not a whole ton of content coming out.

1053
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I mean they've got actually a little bit more for Playstation 4 and Xbox One versus the Wii U.

1054
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,000
The Wii U I actually posted on Twitter. The Wii U is running into the same damn problem it had before with last year where there's nothing coming out.

1055
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:21,000
There's literally 4 titles, 4 retail releases between now and April. And they're not big titles either.

1056
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I mean there's Donkey Kong so that's going to be coming out but the rest of them are really small third party titles that have been delayed.

1057
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I mean Hello Kitty I guess you want to save the game of the year for that but there's 4 titles coming out in 3 months.

1058
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
That's kind of the same problem we had last year. That's not going to move systems.

1059
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Yeah that's not good. That's not good news. But I mean that's unfortunately a direct result of the third party abandonment of Wii U.

1060
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Yeah.

1061
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Alright well let's move on to... I don't know if this is better news but Jason what do you have for us?

1062
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I was reading an article over the course of the week, an op-ed posted on Polygon by Ben Kucera.

1063
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And basically what it boils down to is that we've made a big deal about how these super crazy 3 fourths, 80%, 90% sales, we live for this kind of stuff on Steam, Desura, GOG and anything else.

1064
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:39,000
And that a couple of people have expressed how they feel like it's unfair to the original authors, to the original developers, designers, the publishers and everything else of a video game.

1065
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And basically this article struck me as really interesting because it reminded us, it reminded me of a really specific point.

1066
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:56,000
There were some games that were less than 6 months old that went on sale, usually not more than 50% at most and usually much less.

1067
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Probably from what I recall of looking at the catalog definitely closer to like 25, 30, 15% those kinds of things.

1068
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:18,000
And what it boils down to is that when you release a game, unless you have a crazy resurgence cult smash, when you release a game you make up, you recoup any sales you're going to in the first month or two.

1069
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Because after that people have probably forgotten about it.

1070
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:29,000
That's changing with MMO and other long living kinds of games but you know the rush to get the game is going to happen in the first month or two.

1071
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And immediately after every other additional sale is as good as it's going to get.

1072
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
If it's full price, great.

1073
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:51,000
But if the long tail is made up of a ton of people paying less than that, it's still worth it because it will be more exposure because more people will be willing to pick it up when it's at a discounted rate.

1074
01:24:52,000 --> 01:25:06,000
So any, at least some individuals feel that if you feel that these sales are an outrage to popular games that would otherwise make a lot more money, probably not.

1075
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Because they've already made what they're going to make in large part.

1076
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Everything's reported as the first week, the opening week, the opening month.

1077
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:23,000
After that, it's not exactly as defined and it's really just up to the long lasting nature of the game for them to be able to continue raking in any additional income.

1078
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
That's very true, is that most games are judged within its first month of sales.

1079
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:36,000
You get very, very, very few games where it's like, oh this game was a slow burn but it ended up doing okay.

1080
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Or you know, oh this game made a big revival later on.

1081
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Like maybe a game like Katamari Damacy did that, but how long ago was that game, you know?

1082
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And Mario is going to be in a pretty similar situation. We were talking about how 3D World was not doing particularly well.

1083
01:25:51,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It was the lowest selling game in its launch window in its first week or first month than any other previous Mario game and there's been a steady decline of that.

1084
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:11,000
But as more people pick up the Wii U and this kind of stuff becomes available, it will have, it should have a good, you know, resounding success over the long term.

1085
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And Nintendo stuff doesn't get discounted that much. Like I don't know that I've ever seen a Mario game in the bargain bin.

1086
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
That's true.

1087
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,000
So those games more than anything else have a chance of riding out good two, three year.

1088
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Although they might have to discount the system again.

1089
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I think they're going to have to.

1090
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Give away the razor to sell the blades.

1091
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah.

1092
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Why can't they just have like Steam sale type sale on virtual console games? I mean, that would be fantastic.

1093
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:47,000
They were for a hot minute. Like they were doing that 30 cent promotion. Like, you know, where the games, which is, you know, practically free.

1094
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Because 30 cents is nothing. But yeah, they didn't, they didn't, that went for just like last year and they haven't really done anything like that since.

1095
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I know Wii U does do sales once in a while, but it's, you know, so does, so does the Xbox marketplace and so does PlayStation four, you know, it's, it's really nothing different than what you see there.

1096
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
So, all right, Jason, I think you have something else for us.

1097
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Yeah. Double header.

1098
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Double header.

1099
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Continuing financial news and results and everything else. Basically, as of the conclusion of the year, due to many other non-gaming facets of Sony, Sony's stock fell to a rate that Nintendo had a wider market cap than them.

1100
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:41,000
This is also in the, oh, what's the Japanese stock exchange called, the Nikkei, I think.

1101
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Sony, Sony's market cap dropped to 1.86 trillion yen, which is about 17 and three quarters billion.

1102
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:59,000
And Nintendo's market cap was still above 1.93 trillion yen, about 18 and a half billion, 18,500 billion.

1103
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
If that number actually makes sense in your brain, it barely does in mine.

1104
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:18,000
But the, and this is, this is, this is in large part, conceded as the fact that Sony is a huge company that has stakes in not only gaming, but also in media, both music and movies.

1105
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Publishing as well as development, as well as licensing and everything else that the, you know, that the Sony conglomerate covers, where Nintendo has largely shrunk down to a single purpose.

1106
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:44,000
So it's kind of spectacular to see that somebody that does less is able to withstand a company that reaches all of digital entertainment in the modern era.

1107
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:52,000
And going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, poor Sony.

1108
01:28:52,000 --> 01:29:03,000
You know, I don't think anybody's really crying for Sony in this case, because, you know, Sony's still selling a shit ton of PlayStation 4s, and it's probably a better story right now than what the Wii U's got.

1109
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
And everything that is successful can be spun off.

1110
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:19,000
You know, these are all subsidiary companies and everything else that can be sold off selectively, so that other places post better gains, and the hemorrhaging wounds are skirted out.

1111
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Sony has survivability one way or another, and by no means does this spell bad for Sony. They'll survive.

1112
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Yeah, and they will. But this also goes a long way for the people that are like, oh Nintendo should just throw in the towel and make mobile phone games.

1113
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,000
It's like, did you forget about the 3DS? You must have just forgot about the 3DS. You must have just forgot that it's there.

1114
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:50,000
There's even some companies like EA that have, you know, not only have they cut off Wii and Wii U, they're also done with the 3DS.

1115
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:57,000
You know what, though? The news isn't that great for EA. Two words, Loki. Battlefield 4.

1116
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
And no NCAA, so that's even less money coming in.

1117
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I have a really, really, really quick comment about that.

1118
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Sure.

1119
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:16,000
A new coworker just started last week. You wanna guess, in the context of EA and Battlefield, you wanna guess what his username on Twitter is?

1120
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Fuck EA?

1121
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,000
DICE. Who's the company that develops...

1122
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Oh no.

1123
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
You'll never guess the kind of tweets he's been getting in the past month in large part.

1124
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
They make for good stories, though.

1125
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Oh my gosh.

1126
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Pretty hilarious.

1127
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
He must have in his bio line, I did not make Battlefield.

1128
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
There's actually three different kinds. There's a rapper in Texas or something like that.

1129
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
And then EA, DICE. And then reality TV show somebody's cousin or something? I don't know.

1130
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:53,000
But he also starts to retweet some of this stuff so the people that actually know what's going on...

1131
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
It makes for great stories. I've been laughing so hard.

1132
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Is this him here?

1133
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
That's him.

1134
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Blaming me for Battlefield 4 will get everything fixed.

1135
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I love that he has a sense of humor about it.

1136
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
He's taking it in stride. He's a wonderful guy.

1137
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
It's great.

1138
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Zones Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, ball.

1139
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1140
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,000
And let's see what unfinished games are coming out to a store near you very soon, if anything. Loki.

1141
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Nothing this week.

1142
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Thankfully though, after this week, once we get into the 28th, we'll actually get some games coming out.

1143
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I was going to say, the end of this month, the Tomb Raider HD edition, whatever they're calling it, is out, right?

1144
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And then February, you get the Rayman.

1145
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Definitive Edition.

1146
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Yeah, Definitive Edition. You get the Rayman ones too.

1147
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
My mistake. Nothing for two weeks. I forgot. There is still another week in there, so wow.

1148
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Yeah, it's still a drought. But once we hit the 28th, then there will actually be game releases every week, so that's good.

1149
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Alright, we're starting to get back into it.

1150
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Alright, speaking of getting back into it, Japan finally seeing some releases after a couple, a little bit of a drought for them.

1151
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
So Japan does have a few things right now.

1152
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:11,000
A lot of it though is price reductions, although there is some new stuff, but you do have price reductions on Borderlands 2, the Game of the Year edition.

1153
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Musou Orochi 2 and Shinsekoku Musou 6 Empires, all kind of going into their best hits.

1154
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
The only new game I see on PlayStation 3 is Short Piece.

1155
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Tsukugime Ranko no Ichiban Nagai He comes out this week.

1156
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Like a miniature version of One Piece?

1157
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Bandai Namco. What, Short Piece?

1158
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
That was a dumb joke.

1159
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Yeah, it sure was.

1160
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Well, I'm trying to look at screenshots of this game to see kind of what it is, because I don't know, is this like an anime?

1161
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:44,000
It kind of looks like it might be based on an anime. I'm just not as familiar with those, but I see a lot of anime-looking cutscenes here.

1162
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,000
What the hell game is this? Oh, Bullet. It's got to be a shooter. I see a bullet meter.

1163
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
And a...

1164
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
What?

1165
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Is that a giant dog game?

1166
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
It is. It is a giant dog.

1167
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:58,000
It's here to wreck your day.

1168
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,000
The things when you can't put screenshots together, my god.

1169
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Can you put that on the YouTube for people or something?

1170
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I certainly can.

1171
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Such destruction. Many shooting. Wow.

1172
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Very bullets.

1173
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Very bullets.

1174
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Much dodge.

1175
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
There you go. Bullet dodge.

1176
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Bullet dodge.

1177
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:25,000
All right. On the Xbox 360 in Japan, the only thing of note there is that Borderlands 2 goes to the Game of the Year edition there as well.

1178
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
On the PlayStation Vita, nothing this week.

1179
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:37,000
On the Wii U, nothing this week. In fact, they don't have anything until February when Puyo Puyo Tetris comes out in February on Wii U.

1180
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Let's see. On the 3DS, Vitamin X Evolution Plus.

1181
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I don't think that's a drug-dealing game. I think that's just something else there.

1182
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
On the 3DS, and lastly...

1183
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
They don't have drugs in Japan.

1184
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Classic game, like Dr. Mario.

1185
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:58,000
On the PSP, Chō no Dokuhana no Kusari Taisho Iroki Ibun comes out from Prototype.

1186
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Yes, they are still a steady stream of PSP games in Japan.

1187
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:06,000
So, go figure. This looks like kind of like a... I don't know if it's like a romance game.

1188
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Definitely a dating or visual novel game.

1189
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Yeah, but that looks like objection.

1190
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Objection!

1191
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:17,000
I love that Phoenix Wright in that scene there. It's love and lawyers or something. I don't know. There you go.

1192
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
How about the UK, Jason?

1193
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Kind of a light week continuing. It'll be a nice time whenever these releases start to really ramp up later this year.

1194
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
But tomorrow, possibly today already with the time zones.

1195
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:35,000
On the 13th, Nidhogg on the PC. On the 14th, The Banner Saga reaches PC.

1196
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:44,000
On the 15th, they finally will be getting Assassin's Creed Liberation HD on the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Dr. Luigi on the Wii U.

1197
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Lastly, on the 17th of January, Mario Party Island Tour comes to the 3DS.

1198
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
And that's that.

1199
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

1200
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Alright, so Nintendo, they've won a patent lawsuit.

1201
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:12,000
This was actually one of the companies that was suing them based off of the, I want to say a patent that had to do with the Wii Balance Board and the censors in that.

1202
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And as part of it, not only did they win against IA Labs, but IA Labs was forced to pay them compensation for their legal fees and stuff and had no money to do so.

1203
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
What did they do instead? They went ahead and bought up all of IA Labs' patents.

1204
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,000
So, they're not going to be doing that again.

1205
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
That is a shockingly good turn of events.

1206
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Well, judgments aside about whether or not their patents were or weren't deserved in the first place, the fact that they couldn't pay is something I've not really heard of.

1207
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,000
And for Nintendo to just kind of bring in all of those and not have them sold off to somebody else that turns around and does the same damn thing.

1208
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Good news for Nintendo.

1209
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Yeah.

1210
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Very good news.

1211
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Alright, one more story for you guys about arcade games.

1212
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Ironically, after we kind of reminisced a little bit on last week's show about some of the big pompous things, like prop cycle and things like that.

1213
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:17,000
There was an interesting article that was ran on USgamer.net this week that talked about what the 10 biggest grossing arcade games of all time were.

1214
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Actually, no, I take that back. It wasn't this week, it was actually last week.

1215
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,000
It kind of slipped under the radar though, so it was called to our attention this week.

1216
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
But I wanted to go over it because, hey, arcade games.

1217
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And I also thought it was interesting because not a lot of the games were modern.

1218
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I don't know if you've peaked at this story at all, but Jason, if you were to guess, and Loki, I don't know if you've peaked either, but if you guys were to guess, what would you say would be some of the biggest arcade grossing games of all time?

1219
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I would easily put those for any of the tabletop and various format games from the late 80s, early 90s.

1220
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:55,000
At least a couple of these would be owned by the Donkey Kongs and DigDogs and Jousts and Rally-X.

1221
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:04,000
More recently than that, oh god, I would assume that at least one of them has to be, like, some kind of game.

1222
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
But that's about all I could really guess.

1223
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I would have said for sure Pac-Man, because that game was so huge in the 80s, don't underestimate it.

1224
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
And Street Fighter II, for sure, because that game...

1225
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
That's what came to mind as a classic fighting game that probably made it.

1226
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I would have also guessed newer games like Capcom vs. SNK 2, I would have guessed Soul Calibur, I would have guessed Driving Games, I would have thought Initial D.

1227
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I would have guessed Dance Dance Revolution, to be honest, would be on this list.

1228
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I would sooner say Daytona USA than Initial D.

1229
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
But maybe it's because games like that have several incarnations.

1230
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
There's the original Pac-Man, yes, there's Ms. Pac-Man, but there really wasn't much beyond that.

1231
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Whereas, you know what, there's like 17 Dance Dance Revolution games, and Driving Games and so forth.

1232
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Well, here it is. Here's what the top games are of all time, time, time, time.

1233
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Now, keep in mind, this is also with adjusted revenue.

1234
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And that's a big factor too, because when I tell you number 10 is Space Ace, you might go, huh?

1235
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:11,000
That's for a game that was critically acclaimed, but not exactly the highest success, because it's very strange nature.

1236
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
It also took two or three quarters to play the game.

1237
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Which, you know, back in 1984, whenever this game was out, yet now two or three quarters is kind of commonplace.

1238
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Back in 84 it was very rare, so, you know.

1239
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Number 10 was Space Ace, number 9 was Time Traveler, and by name alone, I was like, what the fuck game was that?

1240
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,000
And then I was like, oh god, it's the hologram game that Sega put out.

1241
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
This game was awful. I would have never guessed it was in the top 10.

1242
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,000
But because it was the hologram game, and that part of it was pretty cool, you know, it eats up quarters.

1243
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Because people are like, OMG, it's magic.

1244
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Number 8 was Tron, which I would say is a pleasant surprise.

1245
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I would not have guessed that that would have been in the top 10, but it was, so I go, okay, cool.

1246
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Number 7, Dragon's Lair, for the same reason as Space Ace.

1247
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Number 6, Defender, which I think sometimes we forget how big this game was.

1248
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
A game like Resogun? Heavily inspired by Defender.

1249
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
So, you know, how does...

1250
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Number 5, Donkey Kong, as you would have guessed, which, you know, I'm sure.

1251
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Number 4, Street Fighter II.

1252
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Number 3, Street Fighter II Championship Edition.

1253
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,000
So they are counting them as separate games, and that's kind of interesting that, you know,

1254
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,000
but if you were to put those two together, it would probably be damn near number 1.

1255
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Number 2, Space Invaders, which, as you remember, is probably bigger in Japan than it was here,

1256
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
but it was still a big deal here.

1257
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And then, of course, number 1, Pac-Man, which I'm sure is a surprise to nobody.

1258
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I'm surprised Daytona's not on there, because there's Daytona machines everywhere.

1259
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Number 1, Pac-Man.

1260
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
If you adjust the inflation on how much this game has made since its launch in 2013...

1261
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Keep in mind, these machines still make money. Still.

1262
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
You know, because every barcade's got a Pac-Man machine, and people go,

1263
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
LOL Pac-Man. I even do. I play Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man if I see a machine.

1264
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
I'm like, oh, what the hell? For old times' sake, right?

1265
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Let's see if I can get to board 256 today.

1266
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Paperboy, Marble Madness, and Punch-Out pretty much, and Tapper at the drop of a hat if I see it.

1267
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,000
3.4 billion dollars. Billion.

1268
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:23,000
Avatar is like the highest-grossing movie ever made, and it's only made about 1 billion. 1.1 and change.

1269
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Pac-Man's made 3 billion plus.

1270
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
That's also in a much smaller window. As soon as Avatar's gone, it's gone.

1271
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Home video, yeah, whatever, but same kind of argument as retail games.

1272
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Outside of a certain window, they're done, and then you just pick up the onesie-twosies afterwards.

1273
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Alright, let's do a little bit of reminiscing since we're talking about arcade games.

1274
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Let's do a little more reminiscing in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1275
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,

1276
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
hey, you kids should be playing this game this week, dammit.

1277
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
But this week, she missed.

1278
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:03,000
But this week, she got sick. She OD'd on playing too much of the game she was going to pick for you guys,

1279
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
which I admit was a really cool game, so I almost said, oh, I'll just do her game for her,

1280
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
but then I'm like, ah, but she might want to talk about it.

1281
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
So we're going to shift her game to a future week when she's back,

1282
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:21,000
and I'm going to take over, mwahahaha, with a game that I have chosen for this week's Classic Game of the Week.

1283
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And the Classic Game of the Week that I have picked this week is a game called Arkon.

1284
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Alright, Arkon, the light and the dark.

1285
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Arkon was probably best known on the Nintendo.

1286
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
It was an NES game, so a lot of people know it from the Nintendo,

1287
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
and the video that you guys are going to see on YouTube comes from the Nintendo version as well.

1288
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
But I also remember this as what?

1289
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
A Commodore 64 game.

1290
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:54,000
This is a Commodore 64 game that a lot of people mistake as a chess game when they first look at it,

1291
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
because it does look an awful lot like chess.

1292
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
You have a lot of, like, pawn style pieces that are in the front,

1293
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:02,000
and you have stronger pieces that are in the back and so on,

1294
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
but, you know, Arkon is the type of game that could really only be done in the digital era,

1295
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
because the game board shifts and changes colors,

1296
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:14,000
and your pieces have spells and all this crazy stuff in the game.

1297
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:20,000
This game you probably also would know as the game that has the battle arena,

1298
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
not to be confused with battle chess,

1299
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,000
but when two pieces meet up, they actually do battle with each other.

1300
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
They actually go into an arena, and you use the controller to move them around,

1301
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
and, you know, if you just have one of the little pawns, like one of the little goblins,

1302
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
and when you hit the button, he's just going to go with a sword.

1303
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Oh, we're going to see a battle taking place right now, actually,

1304
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
with a unicorn and a little goblin guy, and that goblin guy is hosed,

1305
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
because he just has a little club, but you can beat the unicorn over the head with it,

1306
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
but the unicorn can, like, fire projectiles.

1307
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Of course, the unicorn is going to win in that particular case.

1308
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
So that's kind of how the battles work there.

1309
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
So, I mean, it's very much unlike chess in that regard.

1310
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Just because you move on to a square doesn't mean you're necessarily going to capture it.

1311
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So, the original development of this game was for Atari 8-bit computers in 83,

1312
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
but it was ported, of course, to the NES, the Commodore 64.

1313
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:14,000
It was also on the ZX Spectrum, the Amiga, IBM PC, Macintosh, PC-88, Amstrad CPC.

1314
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Whoo, it was on a lot, a lot of different systems.

1315
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
How is it possible to port to that many different systems back in the day?

1316
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
In the 80s, that was common.

1317
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I mean, yeah, games were simpler, but, I mean, come on.

1318
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Today, we at least have, like, modern technologies to make that kind of thing easier.

1319
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
One or two dudes did it.

1320
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
In fact, the designers of Arkon, three guys,

1322
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I'm sorry, actually not, I shouldn't say three guys,

1323
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
because there was actually a woman as well.

1324
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Ann Westfall was one of the designers of this game.

1325
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
John Freeman and Paul Reich III all did this game, so that's pretty cool.

1326
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
So, you might think the game is chess, but of course it's not.

1327
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
The pieces are, you know, moved around by the player,

1328
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
and some have different moves than others,

1329
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
but of course getting rid of a piece is not automatic,

1330
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
because sometimes they will do battle.

1331
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
The squares on the board actually can affect the battle,

1332
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
because if a dark player is on a dark square,

1333
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
then they're going to get a bonus,

1334
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:14,000
but if they're on a light square, they're going to have a hindrance.

1335
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And some of the squares on the board actually change color,

1336
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
so that's kind of interesting.

1337
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And then you also have some really cool pieces,

1338
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:25,000
like the shape shifter will actually just become whatever piece it's fighting.

1339
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,000
And then like the phoenix was exploded,

1340
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
it didn't have projectiles at all,

1341
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
it actually just turned into a ball of fire and slash a shield.

1342
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Each side also has a spell caster that kind of serves as the king or the queen,

1343
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,000
depending on what side you're on.

1344
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
The light side gets the wizard, the dark side has the sorceress.

1345
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And they have different spells that can be used,

1346
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:48,000
such as like teleport and heal and things like that.

1347
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Either to win, you either destroy all of the pieces on the opposing side,

1348
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
or you occupy all five power points.

1349
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
But that wizard I mentioned a minute ago, or sorceress,

1350
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
is in one of those power points,

1351
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
so you really are going to have to take that piece out if you really want to win the game.

1352
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
So, there you go.

1353
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:10,000
The game was very well received when it came out and got pretty high reviews.

1354
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:15,000
In 1996, Computer Gaming World said it was the 20th best game of all time.

1355
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
IGN named it the 50th best in 2003,

1356
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
so a lot of people remember this game pretty fondly.

1357
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
There were sequels that came out to the game as well.

1358
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
There was Arkon 2 Adept,

1359
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:32,000
there was Exciter was the third game, although people don't know those as well.

1360
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
However, people might know some of the remakes.

1361
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:40,000
1994 had Arkon Ultra, which was big because it had modem play.

1362
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I wanted this game so bad when I was a kid, but my parents wouldn't buy it for me.

1363
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I was so mad.

1364
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Real teenage problems, right?

1365
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Thanks, ma'am.

1366
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
But now that I'm a big kid and pay my own bills,

1367
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
I can actually go and buy Arkon myself,

1368
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
because there's actually a version of it on Steam that's available.

1369
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
And that is, I think, Arkon...

1370
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
There's different rewrites of the game.

1371
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
There's Arkon Evolution that was in 2008.

1372
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Everything on Steam is all Arkon Classic.

1373
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
But I think it's Arkon Conquest was the game that they actually put out.

1374
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
There's a version on iPhone as well.

1375
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
And then, yeah, there's Arkon Classic.

1376
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:24,000
But no, there's a version that's actually on Steam right now

1377
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
that's like a newer version. I have it in my library.

1378
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
It's still called Arkon Classic.

1379
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
No, there's a different one. I know there is.

1380
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Is there Arkon Ultra, maybe?

1381
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I searched for Arkon, and there was the trailer, the demo, and the full title

1382
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
all called Arkon Classic.

1383
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Maybe you still haven't got delisted, something like that?

1384
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Yeah, I doubt that.

1385
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
And Tigerclaw in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1386
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Do you think this game needs a next-gen remake?

1387
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Well, it's kind of already had one.

1388
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Well, there's one on Steam right now.

1389
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
So let me see if I can actually find it.

1390
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Maybe it is Arkon Classic, but I thought...

1391
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:03,000
By Classic, it does not look like the classic Spectrum NES C64 version.

1392
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
It is Arkon Classic. I thought it had a different name to it.

1393
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
It's just a graphically improved version of the classic gameplay, by the looks of it.

1394
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
That's still really cool, though. Yeah, I've played a little bit of this.

1395
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's pretty cool.

1396
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And yeah, the boards can take different shapes,

1397
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
and you can do some different things with that, so...

1398
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Very cool.

1399
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Did you ever play this game, Loki?

1400
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
No, I never played Arkon.

1401
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Oh, I love this game. Did you play it, Jason?

1402
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
It was a fun game.

1403
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I've seen it. I think this is one of those games

1404
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
that I didn't understand how to get started of it, so it didn't last very long.

1405
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
But I've definitely poked at it.

1406
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Again, here's my whole thing where it's like,

1407
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
there's no tutorial.

1408
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Was there ever in the 90s?

1409
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Yeah, in the 80s. I guess there really wasn't.

1410
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So, there you go.

1411
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Tigerkongchat says,

1412
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Has there ever been a speedrun of Arkon?

1413
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I wonder how long it would take to beat.

1414
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Yes, there are on YouTube, and I think the answer is a minute and a half.

1415
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I mean, especially with long-moving, diagonal-moving characters,

1416
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
you can make a little bit of room and get there in a hurry.

1417
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,000
SSJ100Matt noted that the company founded by one of these developers

1418
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
went on to do some of the Skylanders games.

1419
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
So, these guys are still involved with gaming in some way or another.

1420
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Anyway, one of my favorites.

1421
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I played a shit ton of this on the Commodore 64,

1422
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
and then when it came out on the NES, I was like,

1423
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
there's music, and the graphics are so good.

1424
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
This is next-gen, baby.

1425
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
On the NES.

1426
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
So, yeah, this is a game I remember fondly,

1427
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
so that's why I picked it, Arkon.

1428
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I guess for the NES, since that's the version I played there,

1429
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
because it had the Commodore 64 version,

1430
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
that didn't have the background music,

1431
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
but I remember the Commodore 64 version fondly,

1432
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
although the original original version,

1433
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
of course, on a completely different system altogether.

1434
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
So, there you go.

1435
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
There's your classic game of the week.

1436
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
We're going to take a break, but when we come back,

1437
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
there is plenty more OLR to come, including rapid-fire news,

1438
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,000
the FUGL question of the week,

1439
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
and, of course, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1440
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

1441
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
when we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio,

1442
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
right after this.

1443
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio,

1444
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
live on this Sunday evening, January the 12th of 2014,

1445
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
with the 535th episode of our show already in progress.

1446
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Again, we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network

1447
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
voggenetwork.com, Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern,

1448
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,

1449
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
and a lot of you guys in our chat room,

1450
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:31,000
over at live.voggenetwork.com,

1451
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
participating with tonight's show.

1452
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
We've been reading a lot of fun little comments.

1453
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Some of our topics we were talking about earlier in the show,

1454
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
generating a lot of chat.

1455
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Well, they appeal to a lot of people.

1456
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Some good discussion there.

1457
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
DarkSakura, not here tonight, but she is in chat,

1458
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
so the live listeners can at least interact with her.

1459
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Podcasters, you can always send an email

1460
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
if you're listening on the podcast,

1461
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
be it either on the podcast feed,

1462
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
or through Stitcher, or what have you.

1463
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Now, some things to look forward to on upcoming episodes

1464
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
of the show of Orange Lounge Radio.

1465
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Next weekend is a three-day weekend,

1466
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
so I'm hoping that means maybe a little bit...

1467
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
The road show may not have happened,

1468
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
but maybe a little bit of liquor will happen next week.

1469
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,000
A safe, of course.

1470
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,000
We're not going to get crazy like the people on PlayStation 4,

1471
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
but it might be a little bit of liquor on next week's show.

1472
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Dunk show.

1473
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That should be fun.

1474
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,000
In a couple weeks, coming up on February 2nd,

1475
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I think it is, if I got the date right,

1476
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
February 2nd, he may have just left Hoard House,

1477
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
but he's going to be here in person on Orange Lounge Radio.

1478
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Shane Olinko is going to be here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1479
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:30,000
He has not been on OLR outside of a call.

1480
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
It's been a very long time.

1481
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
It's probably been about five years,

1482
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
so we're going to get caught up a little bit there

1483
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:37,000
and give him crap for leaving Hoard House and all that stuff.

1484
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
No, I'm kidding.

1485
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,000
What games are you going to try to push on you guys now?

1486
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
I don't know. Oh, no, I do know.

1487
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
He is bringing his PlayStation 4 copy of Skylanders

1488
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
because he's convinced he can get me addicted to that stuff,

1489
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,000
and I'm like, no!

1490
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Don't do it.

1491
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
That'll be the first week that everybody gets a reprieve from my voice.

1492
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
If you're going to get hooked on something,

1493
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
at least make it Disney Infinity.

1494
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I thought that was your last show, was that same night?

1495
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
No, a week before.

1496
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,000
My current plan, and of course this can still change

1497
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:09,000
because work's going to determine how long I stay here,

1498
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:13,000
but I'm currently planning on being back on the road on the 1st,

1499
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,000
so this time that weekend I should either be listening to everybody's wonderful voice

1500
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,000
as I coast down the mountain back home or not.

1501
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
We'll find out then, of course, when it happens.

1502
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So that's going to be a fun show in a couple weeks when Shane's here.

1503
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
I'm sorry you're not going to be here.

1504
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Maybe the work situation will change. We'll see.

1505
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Miss you, Shane.

1506
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Yeah, it's no secret that Shane and I are really close friends.

1507
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
We talk every day and so forth,

1508
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,000
and despite everything that happened with Hoard House and so forth,

1509
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I'm glad that he can still kind of have his voice heard and so forth and be on the show,

1510
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
and I just know it's going to be a really awesome time.

1511
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
So it'll be good.

1512
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
This is the first time I've seen him in person in probably like three years.

1513
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:54,000
That'll be fun.

1514
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,000
So already thinking of all the places he's got to do in California when he's here.

1515
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Where do all the out-of-town people want to go when they come to California?

1516
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
RVGL.

1517
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
No, we're past that.

1518
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Now when you go back to golf land, you're like, this is sad.

1519
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,000
What are all the places you have to do in California, Jason?

1520
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Disneyland.

1521
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Unfortunately, we're not going to have enough time or money to go to Disneyland.

1522
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Alcatraz.

1523
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
No, no. You're thinking too big.

1524
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Think of like restaurants and stores.

1525
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
They don't have other places.

1526
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
In-N-Out.

1527
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
In-N-Out is the big one.

1528
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
In my defense, I'm not used to that being...

1529
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:35,000
It's not exactly California exclusive because when I was in Arizona, I went as well.

1530
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
There certainly are none in Colorado that I know of.

1531
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:44,000
The other thing, this is the other big thing that Shane really loves in California.

1532
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
And I'm like, really?

1533
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Out of all the restaurants, you missed that?

1534
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Chevy's.

1535
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Like Chevy's is kind of bad.

1536
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Like I don't...

1537
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
That's...

1538
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Is that a chain in California?

1539
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
It is a chain.

1540
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
They might be in other states, but I know it best with California.

1541
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,000
For those who don't know Chevy's, it's a Mexican restaurant basically.

1542
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
But it's kind of whitewashed.

1543
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
And when I say kinda, I mean like really?

1544
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
But I know what it is.

1545
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
It's that fucking corn substance they serve with every meal that some people go apeshit bananas over.

1546
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
And I think it's gross.

1547
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
That's just me.

1548
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
How do you describe Chevy's to an out-of-towner, Loki?

1549
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Um...

1550
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
No idea.

1551
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I mean, with the franchise...

1552
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I don't know. I don't really eat there.

1553
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:30,000
We live in California. You can get better Mexican food at thousands of other places.

1554
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
It's a round table instead.

1555
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
They have decent wings.

1556
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:39,000
All I know is that Chevy's is right across the street from a hotel that I stay at pretty often when I'm around San Francisco.

1557
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Oh nice.

1558
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Things change from location to location and franchisee to franchisee, but I was not impressed.

1559
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Oh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, they're in Times Square. I didn't even know that.

1560
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
I didn't know they were nationwide. Alright.

1561
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I'd like to think I have a pretty discerning palate and taste buds for Mexican and Mexican.

1562
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
They don't have them in Kansas.

1563
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
The margarita wasn't half bad.

1564
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
The drinks are never gonna be that bad. Alright, look.

1565
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
We can talk about food and restaurants.

1566
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Oh, well, foodie-o.

1567
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:12,000
One more. I gotta mention this though, because you know Shane's making a big deal out of he's gotta go to Espituse.

1568
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
You know what that is?

1569
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I've never heard of this before.

1570
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
That is the Brazilian Grill.

1571
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Where they bring the big hunks of meat on the swords to your table and slice it off on your plate.

1572
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,000
And Shane goes crazy about, like, the gross disgusting raw meat and the chicken hearts.

1573
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Yes.

1574
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Oh my god, yes.

1575
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,000
I've eaten, I've eaten, I tried it.

1576
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Chicken hearts are so good.

1577
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I tried it. And then I, you know what?

1578
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
The week after I tried them, they ate them on Survivor.

1579
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
And I was like, I just ate that for real.

1580
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
That's not particularly surprising.

1581
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Like, non-ironically.

1582
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:50,000
I have asked my coworkers about two types of foods in the Bay Area, in San Francisco specifically.

1583
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Brazilian, and I want to say I didn't get any positive answers.

1584
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
And Mongolian, which I still don't have any answers for.

1585
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
But there is a place in the Bay Area.

1586
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I am totally inviting coworkers to do that.

1587
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Good Mongolian is hard to find.

1588
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Yeah, but that's great.

1589
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
But I've just never heard of any place's existence at all.

1590
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Alright.

1591
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'm hungry.

1592
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Food, food, food, food.

1593
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:14,000
There's another Brazilian place down in, uh, Fair Oaks or Citrus Heights, actually.

1594
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
It's, like, off Madison.

1595
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Yeah.

1596
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:17,000
No, it's not there anymore.

1597
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Touch of Brazil.

1598
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Oh, really?

1599
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
No, not there anymore.

1600
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
Now they've reopened so many times, though.

1601
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Alright, let's move on.

1602
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,000
We gotta get back into games.

1603
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I could talk food all night, but we gotta work up an appetite by talking about games.

1604
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
3 hour show, Rob.

1605
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Rapid fire, I know.

1606
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
We've got, like, 45 minutes left because we've got a late start tonight.

1607
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Alright, Loki, go ahead.

1608
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Alright, so there's a new mod for Bully that kind of changes the game entirely.

1609
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Remember, Bully may have been the Rockstar Games kind of, you know, watered down version of, like, almost like a Sandbox Grand Theft Auto type game.

1610
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Well, now it's Bully Zombie Edition where you can add guns to the game that didn't have guns to begin with and zombies into it.

1611
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Because, you know, every game's better with zombies.

1612
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
So, um, you can actually check it out.

1613
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,000
They have a ModDB page.

1614
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:10,000
If you go to moddb.com slash mods slash bully dash zombie dash edition.

1615
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
And you can find the information on that as well.

1616
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Kind of tucked away in the announcement that we were talking about a little bit earlier for the 3DS numbers and what they sold in 2013.

1617
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:35,000
There's actually an announcement that they're localizing Disney's Magic World, which is a game that came out in Japan called Disney Magic Castle by Magical Life.

1618
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
And it's by Namco Bandai.

1619
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:43,000
And what it basically is is kind of like Animal Crossing crossed with the Disney characters.

1620
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
There's, like, farming in the game and you can customize all sorts of things.

1621
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,000
But, uh, I'm sure Rob and Jamie will probably be all over it because it's Disney and Animal Crossing kind of mixed together.

1622
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Hey! Hey! That assessment is completely accurate.

1623
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:03,000
It's supposed to be coming out March 11th on the eShop and in retail.

1624
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And then, last but not least, also another 3DS story.

1625
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Apparently some hackers have found a way to get past the region locking on 3DS systems.

1626
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Although this exploit is only available in firmwares 4.1 to 4.5, which are about 9 months old at this time.

1627
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:30,000
So, if you do have that and have, like, a cartridge loader that you can load different things in there, you can actually bypass the firmware.

1628
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:40,000
And if I remember correctly, and now I'm not entirely positive because I read up on this a couple times, I think if you update your firmware it still stays unlocked.

1629
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
I'm reading conflicting things about it, though.

1630
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,000
But, um, it's interesting, though, that you can be able to do that.

1631
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:54,000
And this doesn't in, you know, any way enable piracy. It just enables you to play games from other regions.

1632
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
So, that was pretty cool.

1633
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I figured it was only a matter of time before somebody would hack that to get what they wanted, you know?

1634
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Going back a few topics, one may say they made a mod with zombies in it.

1635
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Alright, traveling around for some other news.

1636
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Starting off with Super Smash Brothers, the next game in that series, which we still don't know the exact name.

1637
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,000
But we do get little details on that each and every day.

1638
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:27,000
And director Mashihiro Sakurai has confirmed that trophies will be returning for the Wii U and 3DS game.

1639
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
But here's the little twist, because of course this next game is on both the Wii U and the 3DS.

1640
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:35,000
The trophies will be version exclusive.

1641
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:40,000
And handheld games and characters will be mostly seen on the 3DS version.

1642
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:44,000
And the Wii U will see more console and Wii-related versions.

1643
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
So that's kind of a neat little twist on it.

1644
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And a way to get people to buy both, which I'm sure they're looking for as many reasons as they can for that.

1645
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Or because they can't figure out a way to make them actually interact with each other. It's more like it.

1646
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Could be, could be.

1647
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:04,000
We'll see. I think this is going to be the big, big thing that Nintendo's got a show at E3 this year, so we'll see.

1648
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Majesco has announced that they will be bringing WayForward's Double Dragon Neon and Slender the Arrival by Blue Isle Studios to new platforms under the Midnight City Indie label.

1649
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Double Dragon Neon will be hitting Steam with a new online co-op mode.

1650
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I guess this was not on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, which surprises me.

1651
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I thought it did have those, but maybe it was only local, like a Wii U game or something.

1652
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Slender the Arrival will have post-game flashback levels, and it will be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1653
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Oh, that's really exciting. I hope that comes out soon.

1654
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Midnight City will also be putting out a game called Krautscape, which is a tactical racing game.

1655
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:56,000
So, pretty cool there. When you hear about all these labels going under, it's nice to hear new ones sprout up, especially with, you know, Slender the Arrival's a really fun little game.

1656
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
It's, you know, indie and lots of fun livestreams with that, so.

1657
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Also, lastly, here in Rapid Fire News for me, love this.

1658
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Super 3D Noah's Ark is being reprinted for the Super Nintendo.

1659
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:22,000
It was a Wolfenstein remake, reimagining type of thing that was done with, like, you know, Noah, as in, like, the biblical Noah.

1660
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Where, yes, it was a first-person shooter, but you pelt animals with fruit to put them to sleep.

1661
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Apparently, the game was actually based off the Wolfenstein 3D source code. That's pretty amazing.

1662
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:43,000
It's, looking at the screenshot, it's a funny way, because bodies persisted back then, it's a funny way to rewrite what's really going on in that.

1663
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:59,000
So, anyway, originally this game had to go through a crazy little pass-through system to get against Nintendo's lockout, but now it's going to be on a real cart for only $69.99, if you want to own Super 3D Noah's Ark, which, let's be real, it really wasn't a good game anyway.

1664
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:09,000
But, you know, it gets a lot of lulz. There's also stuff that you can buy on the PC if you're curious in Wisdom Tree and the types of biblical-based video games that they do.

1665
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Spiritual Warfare is one of the games that you can buy there. It's a Christian-based Zelda game, I guess. I don't know. I got nothing.

1666
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Oh my god. That is a blatant ROM hack right there.

1667
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
That's the stuff I want to see on Twitch. Alright, Jason.

1668
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Jpop lovers, idol lovers, rejoice. There is a new game featuring AKB48 coming out, at least in Japan, probably unlikely in America, who knows who AKB48 are.

1669
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:52,000
It's going to be a shooting game, and AKB48 are going to be zombies. Or at least that's the understanding of it so far.

1670
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Based off of other shooting games and arcades right now, and it's the style of shooter where you have...

1671
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
It's a sit-in shooter where you're enclosed with curtains and all that kind of stuff.

1672
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I'm sure there's a lot of crossovers like this in Japan. I really wish there were more things like this in America.

1673
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Because being able to take a pop culture icon, for good or for bad, to be able to be put into this situation seems hilariously good.

1674
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Mega Touch is throwing in the towel. If you've ever been at an arcade that has a bar in it, or any other kind of a place where games are just kind of relegated to countertops and whatnot,

1675
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:42,000
you've probably seen in Mega Touch, those tiny little touch screens. Well, they're actually like 15 to 20 inches usually.

1676
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Touch screens that have the little games like you would see on Facebook nowadays.

1677
02:02:48,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Photo Hunt, where you have two pictures and you spot the differences. Various number solitaire, not like window solitaire, but the classic pyramid solitaire kind of games.

1678
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Mega Touch was just a quick action series of arcade games.

1679
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
It was a bunch of shitty little games, but you just, you know, you're at the bar...

1680
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:09,000
I haven't had a lot of fun with them.

1681
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
You're at the bar, you're drunk, you want to put a quarter in the machine and smack the penguin.

1682
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:19,000
One of the games where you try to get him as far as possible with detrimental, not an obstacle course.

1683
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
My favorite Mega Touch game was, can you tell the difference between the two pictures?

1684
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Photo Hunt.

1685
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
That's it, Photo Hunt.

1686
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:32,000
But Mega Touch is done. They're calling in the towel, despite the fact that their TVs and their technology have gotten better and better as the years go on.

1687
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:39,000
And their screens and their systems really have looked better and better as I've seen them every once in a while over the past couple of years.

1688
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:49,000
But they're done, they're throwing in the towel, the system's touch-based do start to have problems with gunk and various other bad things like that.

1689
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:54,000
And they're kind of pricey, $3,000 for just a little set-top box.

1690
02:03:54,000 --> 02:04:04,000
If that could come down a little bit, it would be a pretty interesting thing to see in homes or non-fully public kind of places.

1691
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Because there's a lot of fun to just sit down and kind of start poking with that kind of thing.

1692
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:14,000
I want to say that I've even heard some of them have internet connectivity and long-range leaderboards and that kind of stuff.

1693
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
They had a profile system and everything, I was always very adamant to use it.

1694
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:21,000
But alas, for them as it stands, no more.

1695
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Now bring out Photo Hunt on the PlayStation 4.

1696
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:30,000
I already have Photo Hunt on my iPhone and iPad and that's good enough for me.

1697
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
I'm pretty sure it's in MAME and stuff already too.

1698
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Yeah, I guess I could get it on an iPad.

1699
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Yeah, there's actually a lot of really fun versions of it.

1700
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Metal Gear Re-Vengeance. As most games of this generation are, the quality settings let you go up to 1080p, 1920x1080.

1701
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
But there is a coder.

1702
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Did you hear that too?

1703
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
Is everything okay, Loki?

1704
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
The cat knocked over water.

1705
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
Well, at least there's only water.

1706
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
She's kind of a jerk.

1707
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
This is like the third time she's done it today.

1708
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Cats usually are.

1709
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
That picture we were looking at in the break is suddenly a lot more relevant.

1710
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:12,000
My wife wants to announce that the cat is free for any takers.

1711
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
I'm not joking, don't laugh.

1712
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
OLR Adoption. What did she say?

1713
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
She says, I'm not joking, don't laugh.

1714
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
We're laughing with you, not at you.

1715
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Very important. Go ahead.

1716
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Most games of this generation have a max of 1080p and that is still considered the high end.

1717
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:39,000
4K displays are coming out, but that's bleeding edge if you actually have them for at least a little bit longer.

1718
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:52,000
But there is a coder by the name of Durante that has been fixing the available resolution of visually high quality games like Dark Souls, Deadly Premonition, and now Metal Gear Rising Re-Vengeance

1719
02:05:52,000 --> 02:06:01,000
that works around the 1080p resolution cap and actually allows you to start experiencing these games in 4K.

1720
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I assume this is all in upres because I don't think any company would include 4K assets in a game and literally never let you use them

1721
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
because that would balloon the size of the game in a heartbeat.

1722
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:19,000
But it is still pretty damn nice as these games are looking better and better and these impressive displays are coming out in huge swaths.

1723
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:29,000
The one for Revengance is not necessarily going to be released because apparently there's some rumors going around that Konami may be doing this themselves.

1724
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Well, not as of the conclusion of CES, we know that much now, but in the next couple of months in the lead up to E3 and that kind of stuff as 4K displays start to become more prominent.

1725
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Whether it's released officially or released unofficially, that will be seen in the not too distant future ultimately.

1726
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Alrighty. Let's take this opportunity to visit our Facebook and Google pages in a segment we call the FUGL Question of the Week.

1727
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Every week we ask a question of our communities over at Facebook and Google Plus and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.

1728
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Let's get to it. This week's question is about that article we talked about in part A with the top 10 grossing arcade games of all time.

1729
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:24,000
So we decided to simply ask, what game in the arcade do you think you've dropped the most quarters or tokens into over the years and why?

1730
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:32,000
And here's the thing, when I originally posted that question, about five minutes later I was like, oh god, everybody's going to say DDR.

1731
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
DDR, DDR, DDR, DDR, pop it, DDR.

1732
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:39,000
That isn't the case. That's not the case at all. So I'm very happy with the way this turned out.

1733
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Let's go to our first answer. Funny enough, it's from Shane over on Facebook saying, with no question I'd say the game I dropped the most quarters or tokens in would be DDR.

1734
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:52,000
However, I think the more interesting answer would be my number two game, which would be Time Crisis.

1735
02:07:52,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I spent all my time playing and beating those games in the arcade. They were one series I felt never translated well to the home consoles, so I had to play them in the arcade.

1736
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:03,000
That's a really good answer and I also think I've never beaten a Time Crisis.

1737
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Elliot B says, being a youngin, I haven't been around many arcade cabinets, plus I think they may have dried up in the UK faster than the US, but as a kid I would never pass up the opportunity to play any version of Metal Slug.

1738
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Clover Nikon responds and says TMNT Arcade. Oh god, so many quarters on that.

1739
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Joe G responds, or sorry, it's Haseo Sumerugawa, put that at the beginning if you want me to read that first, says Street Fighter versus X-Men or probably various pinball tables.

1740
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Fifth Dream says, I spent a lot of times in arcades in the 80s and 90s, so Centipede, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Final Fight, Double Dragon, but the toss up would be between Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Street Fighter II.

1741
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Delvin B, our buddy from video game Realness, love that show, responded and said, very surprised that Mortal Kombat was not in the top 10.

1742
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:04,000
You know, I was surprised by that too, because I always thought it gave Street Fighter II a pretty good competition, but I guess not.

1743
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:12,000
But there were a ton of fighting game clones around that same time because of Street Fighter's success, just like there were a ton of Pac-Man clones at the time too.

1744
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Do you remember Primal Rage?

1745
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I do remember Primal Rage, absolutely. I remember when that came out for the Atari Jaguar.

1746
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I think they were a bit worse on consoles, I'm thinking like Clay Fighter and that kind of stuff. The ones that actually made it into the arcade were good.

1747
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
There's Fighting Street and that whole lawsuit.

1748
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Alright, anyway.

1749
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Delvin responds and says, number one, Killer Instinct. My best friend and I would go to arcades and beat anyone that was already playing and then take over, which led to people lying to us and trying to beat us.

1750
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Ultra combo, and number two says, would be the original X-Men arcade game with six players. So much fun playing through with six friends when we were kids.

1751
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Eddie K replies and says, Street Fighter II Championship Edition or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

1752
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Degenerate Johnny says, I have to admit I was more of a console gamer than an arcade gamer, but I put the most quarters in Mortal Kombat 2.

1753
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:10,000
But if you asked me what game I put the most money into play, I would say Michael Jackson's Scramble Training. It was a rare Starfighter game that was available in Sega World.

1754
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Each game session cost 10 pounds, which was equivalent to $15 at the time, and I went through three game sessions.

1755
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I've never heard of this before.

1756
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Me neither, me neither.

1757
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Giavadea says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Simpsons, and any game that had a gun I could point and shoot with. Didn't matter what the game was about, I could play with a gun and that's all I cared about.

1758
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Anthony C replies and says, I don't want to know how much I've spent on DDR.

1759
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Andy R replies and says, Technica, no contest. When Technica 3 came out, I just moved closer to an arcade that had it.

1760
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Thanks to the crew race and bi-weekly updates, I was putting in at least $10 a week for several months. RIP DJ Maxx series.

1761
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Because they shut down the platinum crew.

1762
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Yep, just over the new year, right?

1763
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,000
DJ Rama S says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, hands down. It was so much fun to play with four peoples.

1764
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
And in my old neighborhood, each machine has a different amount of lives per quarter you put in.

1765
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Our buddy Rene from Koopa Club also says there's a lot, just to name a few.

1766
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Gauntlet, Quartet, Dragon's Lair, DDR, Beatmania, and so on and so on.

1767
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Most of these games were the recipient of my money, surely because they were quick and fun and offered a fair amount of replayability.

1768
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:25,000
The largest recipient was the Addams Family pinball game, because I love the Addams Family and I love pinball.

1769
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Pinball is the foundation of my gaming experience, so there you go.

1770
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
That is one of the best pinball tables. So, so, so good.

1771
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I think that's supposed to come out for the pinball arcade. It's one of the big, big things we're waiting for.

1772
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Tiger Claw says Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Turtles in Time.

1773
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Terminator 2 was a huge quarter muncher as well.

1774
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Raginator says, I've had a number of arcade games, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Do you see a pattern here?

1775
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Smash TV, Final Fight, and so on and so on. My list could easily go on for quite some time, but in the interest of time, I shortened it.

1776
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Burr says, I was never a huge arcade fanatic, but I could never say no to a Bubble Bobble machine.

1777
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Something about that game just makes me happy to feed it quarters. Probably the music.

1778
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Codeman says, what did he say? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Oh, he said Turtles in Time specifically, though.

1779
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:18,000
There was something about playing it with my friends in the arcade that was wasting all my parents' money. It felt gratifying.

1780
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Lawrence Z said, I know it's not the same, but Xbox Live Arcade has taken a ton of cash from me.

1781
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:29,000
It is not the same, and many would blame that on the reason why arcades have been struggling.

1782
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:35,000
But, you know, like somebody else has said before, you know, if you're younger, you may not have that same frame of reference.

1783
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Or where you are in the world.

1784
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Xbox Live has been around for ten years now. You know, some of the, you know, if you're sixteen, then Xbox Live has been around since you were six. Something to think about.

1785
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Critical Myth says, Galaga. Without question.

1786
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Austin replies, Dance Dance Revolution. Otherwise, Soul Edge.

1787
02:12:52,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Thomas C says, I never had access to a legit arcade as a kid. One of the games I played the most was Mortal Kombat. Hundreds of dollars spent in that cabinet.

1788
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Dark Tetsuya says, DDR. I also one night sunk several dollars of quarters into Golden Axe.

1789
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Veronica Isabel replies and says, Does Ski Ball count? I used to play that all the time when I was a kid.

1790
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Hell yeah, it does.

1791
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Yeah, sure. Sure it counts. Why not? Ski Ball is still fun as an adult.

1792
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Michael H says, I love playing NFL Blitz at Dave and Busters. It was always a quarter muncher back in the day. Even I liked NFL Blitz. And I don't play a lot of the sports games, but that one was fun.

1793
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
You know which one I love though is NBA Jam.

1794
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Yes.

1795
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I remember when that came out on Super Nintendo too.

1796
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,000
The arcade, arcade sports were amazing.

1797
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:44,000
And lastly on Facebook, S2100Matt says, DDR. But I did play the heck out of TMNT, Turtles in Time, Stun Runner, and Tapper when I was a kid.

1798
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Let's look at Google Plus. So TMNT definitely dominated the conversation there. We have a few answers on Google Plus.

1799
02:13:51,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Robba replies and says, If I take DDR and laserdisc games off my list, Crazy Climber was the quarter muncher for me.

1800
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:08,000
The dreaded falling I-beams after completing the first building were that one chaotic element that could end my game quickly. I remember that game. Those were good times.

1801
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Retertainment says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So Google Plus thinking the same way, right?

1802
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I was a kid when the turtles were popular, so I wanted to play that game whenever I saw it as a kid. It was the hardest game to play and I'm a stubborn person, so I kept on pumping quarters in the machine until I ate out of money or my mom got done shopping.

1803
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Act Dev says, DDR and I still play on occasion. There's also a ton of SNK games like Metal Slug and The King of Fighters.

1804
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Sam H says, Moon Patrol and Sinistar ate a ton of my quarters.

1805
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Beware, I live.

1806
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
The game was awesome.

1807
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
And lastly, Black Dynamite says, Time Crisis 3. We're ending where we started. Time Crisis 3.

1808
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:50,000
If you're playing someone else, it takes a lot of skill and coordination. Totally worth sinking the several dollars and quarters to conquer.

1809
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,000
You know, those are all great answers and I love doing the reminiscing, which is why I read them all.

1810
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I have to admit though, shocked that the game I probably would have named next to DDR and music games, if you throw those out for a minute, because obviously the game I would have named, nobody mentioned.

1811
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Super Iron Man Ivan Stewart's Off-Road.

1812
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
You know what's really scary is I was going to say exactly the same thing.

1813
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Get out.

1814
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Dead serious.

1815
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Absolutely.

1816
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I have dropped, I was on a cruise in 94, I don't even remember for sure.

1817
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:30,000
And there was a $5 bill behind the off-road machine that was chilling there.

1818
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:36,000
So I picked it up, I cashed it out and I put every single quarter into off-road.

1819
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
That game was so much fun.

1820
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:42,000
You cannot replicate that free rolling wheel, the pedal.

1821
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:46,000
That was a big fucking deal when that came out on the NES too.

1822
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
That four player multi-tap.

1823
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Because finally there was no more fucking grey car that would always beat you.

1824
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:58,000
So that was very, you know, funny enough you mentioned one of the places you like to eat when you're here in California, Round Table Pizza.

1825
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
That's where I, because all those pizza parlors have little arcades, right?

1826
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I spent an unhealthily amount of money on Iron Man Super Off-Road.

1827
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Last July a bunch of coworkers of mine were out in Denver for a conference and we went out to the 1UP, our local barcade in Denver.

1828
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,000
And a coworker of mine, I don't remember if he had or hadn't played it at all before.

1829
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:26,000
But I taught him the credit tricks to be able to max out your car in Super Off-Road real quick.

1830
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
And he loved it.

1831
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:31,000
And you know, there's something about that wheel, the pedal and everything else that just makes that game unique.

1832
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
And nobody else has done it.

1833
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
But to be fair, I also spent a shit ton on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1834
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Yeah, same answer.

1835
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
I had to be hipster and not say that.

1836
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Loki, you have a quick answer before we move on?

1837
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
What did you drop all your quarters in?

1838
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Besides DDR. No fair saying DDR.

1839
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Maybe... well I did play a lot of Gunblade back when QZAR had it.

1840
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Good call.

1841
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:57,000
So maybe that.

1842
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Good call.

1843
02:16:58,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Alright.

1844
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Now I'm thinking about some of those arcade games we used to play at Golf Land besides just DDR.

1845
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Like the grid. I remember when a bunch of us would get on the grid and play that with a shooter.

1846
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,000
The joysticks are of maybe iffy caliber.

1847
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,000
But MGL in Arizona has the grid and I was playing a couple rounds of that too.

1848
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
So good.

1849
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:21,000
When arcades have the right games, arcades are still alright.

1850
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Good times.

1851
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Alright, let's get back into some news.

1852
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
We're going to try to move through this a little bit quickly guys.

1853
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Yeah, because we're running a little late in the show and I want to be able to take some calls.

1854
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
So let's try to move through this a little bit quickly. Loki.

1855
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Alright, so EA has now changed their stance on SimCity mods.

1856
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:45,000
And they're now gracefully allowing you to mod their files if you ever so feel like doing that.

1857
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
But there's some restrictions.

1858
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:59,000
And basically the mods that you can create, that they are allowing you to create, are stuff like skins and skins.

1859
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:06,000
So pretty much mods that do not affect multiplayer simulation or jeopardize gameplay.

1860
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
How generous.

1861
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Yeah, to which I say, if you're modding the game in the first place, why do you need their permission to do that?

1862
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I don't know, why?

1863
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:20,000
You should. Just do what you want.

1864
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Yep.

1865
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I wonder when they're going to really discount this game. Is it already down to 20 bucks?

1866
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I don't think it's dropped in price really.

1867
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Wow.

1868
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
I mean, I'm sure, I think it's maybe been on sales.

1869
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Yeah, I think it's been on sales, but I'm just kind of surprised.

1870
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
It's interesting they're still trying to breathe life into this.

1871
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:46,000
They really don't want that game to kind of have the black marks on it that its launch kind of gave it.

1872
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
But they never really recovered from that.

1873
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Diablo 3 to some extent never did either. Well, a little bit.

1874
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,000
And the new expansion I think is really going to be a reboot for that game.

1875
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Yeah, it's down to $39.99.

1876
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Or, I mean, on sale $33.28 I guess right now is what it is on Amazon.

1877
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Wake me up when it's $10 or $15.

1878
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Well, yeah, it's just, yeah.

1879
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Maybe this holiday it'll finally be down that low.

1880
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
You know, a lot of people give shit to Nintendo, including me, and I have in the past,

1881
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:21,000
and I think we all have a little bit about their lack of online support.

1882
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:27,000
But, you know, the producer of Super Mario 3D World, Yoshiaki Koizumi,

1883
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,000
recently made a comment about Nintendo and the fact that they have experimented with online

1884
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:35,000
because some people are saying, why isn't Super Mario 3D World online?

1885
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:41,000
You know, yes, and I left this out of my gaming week just because I was talking too much about ass and titties at the beginning of the show.

1886
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:46,000
But actually I had, you guys who remember OLR, like way back in the day,

1887
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Princess Irene was here with her now husband, Nathan, we're here this Friday.

1888
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:58,000
We were just getting together for sushi, and then we came back and played Mario 3D World on Wii U and Nintendo Land.

1889
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
We had a lot of fun, good times.

1890
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
But, you know, you can have good times with some of that stuff online too,

1891
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
and Nintendo's always kind of resisted that in favor of the living room experience.

1892
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:09,000
Well, producer of Super Mario 3D World said, quote,

1893
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
we've been testing online multiplayer since the days of Super Mario Galaxy.

1894
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:18,000
But with this title, we really wanted to deliver an experience that you can share with family, friends,

1895
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:23,000
or your boyfriend or girlfriend in the same place, like you did with the original NES.

1896
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:30,000
We really want players to have fun in front of the TV, talking while they help each other out, or get in each other's way.

1897
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:33,000
I don't see why they couldn't have both.

1898
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I'm kind of with you, I'm with you a little bit, Loki,

1899
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:44,000
and I'm even okay with the extent that they stick to their guns, that, you know, it's a living room experience.

1900
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
But here's the problem.

1901
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Nintendo hasn't proven that they're capable of any online excellent experience.

1902
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:58,000
What is a made-by-Nintendo game that is a must-play online?

1903
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:02,000
Maybe Mario Kart Wii? I don't know.

1904
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Maybe. That's probably the best they've done, to be honest.

1905
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Mario Kart 7?

1906
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
So, yeah, I mean, there's not a whole lot.

1907
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,000
I think they're trying a little more with the Dr. Luigi and so forth,

1908
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,000
but, you know, I think that's another reason why a lot of people kind of give Nintendo shit when it comes to online.

1909
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
And there was a very interesting story that was on, was it, U.S. Gamer or Eurogamer?

1910
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,000
One of those sites where one of those people that was like,

1911
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I worked for a third-party developer when the Wii U was introduced or whatever,

1912
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:34,000
kind of throwing some shade at Nintendo and talking about how it was.

1913
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,000
And apparently, when somebody had asked Nintendo about Xbox Live or PlayStation Network,

1914
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:43,000
their comment was, well, we don't know what those systems are. We don't use them.

1915
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:47,000
And it's like, know your fucking competition, you guys.

1916
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Like, you have to. Come on.

1917
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,000
And the perfect experience I can think of is Final Fantasy XIV.

1918
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,000
The first version was so awful, but when the guy came in that said, you know what?

1919
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Yeah, I've played World of Warcraft. I've played EverQuest. I've played all that stuff.

1920
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,000
And this is what the people really want. That game came out so much better for it.

1921
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
You have to know your competition a little bit.

1922
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Look at, that's Microsoft's business, is taking the competition and making it better.

1923
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
We're trying.

1924
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Trying.

1925
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Most of the time, to be fair, most of the times they're pretty successful with it.

1926
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Anyhow, over at live.vognetwork.com, still some people mostly reminiscing on the games

1927
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:31,000
we were talking about earlier with the arcade games, but we do have some comments on this.

1928
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Tigerclaw says there are a couple of Nintendo games that have online multiplayer on Wii.

1929
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Just a couple, though. Tigerclaw says Excitebike World Rally had online multiplayer,

1930
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:46,000
but Excitebike World Rally was no Halo.

1931
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Or excuse me, Halo 2, to be fair.

1932
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Well, that's the bar.

1933
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
You know what I mean? Well, yes, it is the bar.

1934
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
No, I'm agreeing with you. That's quite a leap, because I'm trying to think.

1935
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:02,000
I don't think I have ever put the Wii to use for multiplayer.

1936
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:06,000
I don't have a Wii U yet.

1937
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Man, I missed out on Mario Kart, but I know a lot of friends that were doing that routinely,

1938
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,000
and that's probably one of the only answers that I can really come up with.

1939
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Not the least, the frickin' friend code system.

1940
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I agree with this much that Nintendo does not have the same caliber of online components in gaming.

1941
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
All right, well, you never know.

1942
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:36,000
That could be the thing that Nintendo's gonna come out at E3 and say,

1943
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:40,000
we're rebooting the Nintendo Network, and this is how it's gonna blow your mind.

1944
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Yeah, don't make bets on it.

1945
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Don't hold your breath.

1946
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Yeah, exactly.

1947
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Jason, what do you have for us?

1948
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:54,000
A little bit of news on the Steam Controller, and that Valve wants the controller to be more capable

1949
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
than just a gamepad with its mental math.

1950
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,000
12 buttons and however many sticks slash D-pads.

1951
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:08,000
And they're interested in being able to make a controller with the flexibility

1952
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
like the Steam Machine Controller that has touchpads and not D-pads

1953
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
that are multipurpose with movement and action buttons and everything else.

1954
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:22,000
And they're very interested in finding a way to be able to take a complex game like Dota 2

1955
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,000
and be able to have it controlled with just purely the Steam Controller.

1956
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
That's pretty difficult to do because you have to use damn near half of the keyboard

1957
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:38,000
and then the mouse independently, and there's just purely not enough buttons.

1958
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
But if some can be relegated to gestures, combinations, or other sorts of things

1959
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,000
that would make sense with this controller design,

1960
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,000
they're interested in finding out exactly what that is.

1961
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Yeah, the trailer that we got was just classic mouse compatibility mode

1962
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:59,000
for Papers, Please and Civ 5, and then a little bit of keyboard.

1963
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
It technically wasn't even really keyboard integration for Portal

1964
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
because you'd need a left button and a right button.

1965
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Whoo, that's hard.

1966
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,000
So it's an obvious answer that the controller will be heavily mouse

1967
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
and also traditional controller-centric,

1968
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:18,000
but they are looking for ways of scaling it and being able to have it take on

1969
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:23,000
larger tasks for more complex input games.

1970
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:28,000
I'm curious to get my hands on one of those, but it's going to be very interesting.

1971
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I want to see how a game like Civ 5 or something really transfers over to that

1972
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
that's really, really, really with the keyboard and mouse.

1973
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Or even Dota is still a game that I can't imagine not playing that with keyboard and mouse.

1974
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
That would be a hindrance.

1975
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
But they seem convinced they can make it work, and maybe they can.

1976
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
They sure as hell are going to try it.

1977
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I don't mind first-person shooters on controllers, so it works okay enough for me.

1978
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:52,000
I know some people really hate it, but it's all right. I don't mind it.

1979
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,000
All right, Loki.

1980
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:03,000
All right, so actually as I saw this article here, it reminded me to go ahead and do that online.

1981
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:09,000
The Steam family options have come out of beta, so now you can actually share your library

1982
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:17,000
with up to ten people, and you can actually go enable that under settings and stuff,

1983
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
and go check that out.

1984
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,000
So that allows you, of course, if you're not familiar with it, to basically have somebody

1985
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:30,000
play any game that you own on your account, and they can actually download the full game

1986
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:35,000
and try it, as long as you're not playing anything else in your account at the time.

1987
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:38,000
So that's pretty cool.

1988
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:45,000
You kind of seem to have landed with little fanfare.

1989
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:50,000
I had no idea that this had gone live until somebody had posted it for tonight's show.

1990
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
I would have thought that Steam might have done a big announcement, but I guess not.

1991
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,000
It made a splash when it was a beta, and now it's here, hooray.

1992
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:00,000
But it's also, as Bobby covered before, it also has kind of limited domain,

1993
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:03,000
where if you're multiple people under the same household,

1994
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,000
have it better than the people that wanted to exploit it for free games.

1995
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Yeah, but what were people really expecting?

1996
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,000
And that's why the fanfare isn't any bigger than it is.

1997
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:14,000
I guess so. All right, moving on.

1998
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:18,000
And the last story before the mailbag.

1999
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Konami is looking to jump into the 3D dome screen game

2000
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:28,000
with a game they're calling Steel Chronicle Ganesh.

2001
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Basically, they're trying to bring back the huge sit-down cabin...

2002
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I completely forgot the word that I was going to look for.

2003
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,000
The huge pods that you sit down, much like Battletech,

2004
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:49,000
if you ever played that at a nice big warehouse, arcade, bar, everything entertaining place.

2005
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
DragonCon.

2006
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I've never been to a con that has this kind of stuff.

2007
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
They have a DragonCon room, but never that specific.

2008
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Bobby made it a point to walk me down there to say,

2009
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
look at this, look at what they bring in for this.

2010
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Good man. Because those things are so much fun.

2011
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:08,000
So, of course, these games come at a premium price tag.

2012
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,000
The article quotes $40,000.

2013
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Because not only is it a sit-down pod with multiple displays,

2014
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:20,000
tailored controls for a flight sim,

2015
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
or maybe it is a mech battle game.

2016
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Hard to tell. The screenshot is pretty small.

2017
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:29,000
But it's also a, instead of just a 30-inch CRT,

2018
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:32,000
excuse me, that the classic Battletech machines use,

2019
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:38,000
these are modern, curved, 3D tall displays,

2020
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
so you have greater field of view.

2021
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:43,000
It looks amazing. I would love to play a game like this.

2022
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:47,000
When you get the right control mechanism to be able to put management

2023
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:50,000
into this game alongside just the rest of the action,

2024
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
these games come out so well.

2025
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Find your cash money arcade and suggest it to them.

2026
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
It's really funny that in last week's show,

2027
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:01,000
we were kind of mourning the loss of the pompous arcade game

2028
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:04,000
with all its big peripheral, a story like this comes out where it's like,

2029
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,000
we're not dead yet.

2030
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I don't think anybody said that it's gone or that they wouldn't play it again.

2031
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
It's just less often.

2032
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Well, I kind of said they were dying, but I didn't want them to go.

2033
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Plus, we're on the heels of CES,

2034
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
where this kind of stuff would have been shown off,

2035
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
which is where most of these articles are coming from.

2036
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:23,000
There's a big arcade coin-op show that happens later in a couple months,

2037
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
isn't there? There's like a Vegas coin-op show, too.

2038
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:28,000
A coin-op expo sounds somewhat familiar, maybe.

2039
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Something along those lines.

2040
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Looking forward to Konami. Make it happen.

2041
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Make it happen. All right.

2042
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:37,000
And Konami has made a bunch of pompous arcade games with big peripherals.

2043
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
As we are well aware.

2044
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
As we are well aware. All right.

2045
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
When are we going to see the Silent Hill arcade game come anywhere near us?

2046
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:45,000
The Castlevania one.

2047
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I want to shoot Pyramid Head in the face.

2048
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
It'll be fun. I don't know. I guess never.

2049
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
All right. Let's get to the mailbag.

2050
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

2051
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go.

2052
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
And every week you send emails,

2053
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,000
and Dark Sakura dives in the email bag head first

2054
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
and puts on her hazmat suit and tries to find an email

2055
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:08,000
that looks safe for the air or two or five to read.

2056
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Dark Sakura is not here this week,

2057
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
so we've decided to make Jason jump in the mailbag head first

2058
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
and swim in there.

2059
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Oh, it's tough to wade through all of this.

2060
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Yeah, all those mountains and mountains of email we received last week, right?

2061
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:26,000
All the spam that's junking up the bag.

2062
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
All the delivery sports.

2063
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:30,000
All right.

2064
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Nasty Canasta writes in to back up Mr. Sky

2065
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
and says, hi, Olar.

2066
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I'm here to back up Sky.

2067
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Maybe, sort of, probably.

2068
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
On the last episode, Sky got a Twitter sass from Cuoco Jones

2069
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
along the lines of, you bought a PS4 to play Don't Starve?

2070
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,000
To which I say, girl.

2071
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
But seriously, what's wrong with buying a console or a computer

2072
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:55,000
to play something that one considers to give them lots of...

2073
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
that can...

2074
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Sorry.

2075
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I think a word or two is missing.

2076
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Just short-circuited my brain.

2077
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
What's wrong with buying a console or a computer to play something

2078
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:10,000
that one considers will give them lots of replayability

2079
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
and a unique experience for such a small cost?

2080
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:17,000
$400 plus a small cost, but I digress.

2081
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:21,000
While Don't Starve is not a Call of Duty or an Assassin's Creed,

2082
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Don't Starve could entertain you way longer than either of those.

2083
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
I will tell you all right now that if I were to own a PS4

2084
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
in the very near future,

2085
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,000
the one game I'd plunk my nerdy fanny down to play the most

2086
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,000
is Binding of Isaac Rebirth, which happens to look like an SNES game.

2087
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I've played the current version of Isaac for over 800 hours.

2088
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:41,000
And also isn't out, to be fair.

2089
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
I'd al...

2090
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Uh... lost my place.

2091
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:49,000
I've played the current version of Isaac on the PC, of course.

2092
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
That's the only place it's at right now.

2093
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I've played the current version of Isaac for over 800 hours

2094
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:57,000
and look forward to Rebirth over Diablo 3,

2095
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Infamous Second Son, and many other high-profile titles coming soon.

2096
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I guess what I'm saying is, don't shoo away these seemingly smaller games

2097
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
with lower budgets mainstream or indie.

2098
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:09,000
You can get a lot out of them depending on how well they're made.

2099
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:12,000
And a quick question for Loki.

2100
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Will there be any Left 4 Dead 2 PC vog...

2101
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Will... wow, man, I'm doing a really good job at reading this.

2102
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:21,000
It's not an easy job she does, is it?

2103
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Especially... plus the rush and also looking at the clock

2104
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
and I need to stop looking at the clock.

2105
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Quick question for Loki.

2106
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Will there be a Left 4 Dead 2 PC vog game night soon?

2107
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
Since that was given away for free over the holidays,

2108
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
lots of folks should have it,

2109
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:38,000
but getting into the group you want will be a bit of an issue in online campaigns

2110
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:43,000
since they only allow four players for normal style

2111
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:46,000
and then, of course, versus with zombie control maxes out at eight.

2112
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
Also, get Rob and Jamie to play.

2113
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Rob! Rob! Zombies, Rob!

2114
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I did download it, so yeah.

2115
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I'm horrible at those games, though.

2116
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I had Left 4 Dead 1 and I was so bad at it.

2117
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
You just gotta have fun with it.

2118
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Probably not. That's what my guess would be, probably not.

2119
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
We can set something up.

2120
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Talk in the vog group on Steam, we'll see what we can set up.

2121
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I like the idea.

2122
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Pitch it on the forums, let's make it happen.

2123
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:14,000
I'd rather play with cool people that email the show than strangers.

2124
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Yeah.

2125
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
By the way, just responding to the part earlier there,

2126
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
I think when Flaco was sending me that Twitter,

2127
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
he really was just trying to be sassy

2128
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,000
and I think it just came from a place of sarcastic Twitter tongue in cheek.

2129
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
I don't think he was totally serious with it.

2130
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
It was also coming from a place of girl.

2131
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Yeah, I think it was a little bit.

2132
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Just to say, I don't think it was as pointed as you might have thought it was

2133
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:39,000
or I may have made it seem last week.

2134
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:42,000
But I think we all know now, thanks to earlier in the show,

2135
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,000
that I bought my PlayStation 4 clearly for what?

2136
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Ass and titties.

2137
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

2138
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
It's the time of the show where we get angsty.

2139
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
And why do we get angsty?

2140
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Because we're people and people are mean.

2141
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
Well, since Dark Sakura isn't here, I'll let Jason start.

2142
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Jason, do you have any FUs of the week?

2143
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,000
I want to say I have one on the drive up here and I don't remember it.

2144
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
It's been a pretty good week.

2145
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:27,000
FU to forgetfulness.

2146
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:32,000
FU to forgetfulness, FU to routine in some ways at the same time too.

2147
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Eh.

2148
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,000
My FU goes after this cough that I've been slowly developing throughout the weekend.

2149
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
I better not be getting sick.

2150
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
I better not be getting sick.

2151
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
This is the second time you've said that in like four weeks.

2152
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
I know, maybe I'm just always sick.

2153
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
It's funny because my throat is feeling kind of weird too.

2154
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
We're still going to curse Al and he's leaving his germs behind.

2155
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:53,000
FU to the fact that you do those YouTubes so you remember what I say on this show way better than even I do.

2156
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Loki, what about you?

2157
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:59,000
FU to the cap because she's an asshole.

2158
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:05,000
And FU to the new chunks they're generating on our Minecraft map because they kind of suck.

2159
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
They do kind of suck, I'm sorry to say.

2160
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:10,000
It's like all I got was ocean the other day.

2161
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Well, that's the thing is they tweaked the whole generation so that it's supposed to make less ocean.

2162
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
And that's all we're getting is ocean.

2163
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Lame.

2164
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Alright, DarkSakura has passed along her FU.

2165
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
It is two sinus infections.

2166
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Seems obvious enough.

2167
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Let's keep it up for being here tonight so fair enough.

2168
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Alright, let's go on.

2169
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then guess what?

2170
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Guess what?

2171
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
It's Skype line time at 1877 Game OLR.

2172
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2173
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
But first, Loki.

2174
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Well, this is kind of shocking but I guess people that do follow the MLB 2K games have kind of seen this coming.

2175
02:35:53,000 --> 02:36:00,000
They have, or 2K Sports has decided to go ahead and discontinue the MLB 2K franchise.

2176
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Just I guess the last game didn't do very well and actually the last few games haven't done very well.

2177
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:10,000
So, it is done.

2178
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:16,000
So, if you want to play baseball, you've got to get a Sony console.

2179
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:20,000
So, wait, it's only on that particular console?

2180
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Well, no. MLB 2K was the only baseball game that was on the Xbox 360.

2181
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Because Sony's game is only on the Sony platforms.

2182
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:33,000
So, those were literally the only two baseball games to come out each year.

2183
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
I didn't realize they were the only two that were coming out.

2184
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I guess so.

2185
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
In my mind, I was thinking of others.

2186
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:45,000
But, you know, my mind goes back to a much more classic gaming time when you had things like Baseball Stars and all this other crazy stuff that was coming out too.

2187
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
So, wow, that's too bad.

2188
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Yeah.

2189
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:53,000
What about like, don't they have like, isn't there like foreign baseball leagues that get video games too?

2190
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Well, they used to have, was it the Power Pros baseball game that was from Konami?

2191
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:05,000
But, you know, Konami cut out pretty much all of their, you know, non-Super AAA franchises.

2192
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
So, their lineup is really slim.

2193
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
But, yeah, we don't see any more of that stuff anymore.

2194
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
And, you know, the thought is maybe EA will pick it up.

2195
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I don't know, they could use another franchise to be honest.

2196
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
But, it's hard to say.

2197
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Alright.

2198
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Well, who says that big news in video gaming doesn't come out of CES?

2199
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Because at Consumer Electronics Show this past week, some big news on a big game was dropped this week.

2200
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
About a big guy.

2201
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,000
About a big guy.

2202
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Mama Shaq, Shaquille O'Neal, actually came out and said Shaq, Shaq-Fu 2 is happening.

2203
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:48,000
It's coming soon and the graphics look crazy.

2204
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:53,000
That is the, and actually, I guess some of the estimate is a joke if there be a sequel to Shaq-Fu.

2205
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
And Shaq said, yes, it is coming and the graphics look crazy.

2206
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Now, don't forget, there were trademarks filed in mid-2013.

2207
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:05,000
This is not the first time we have fantasized about a new Shaq-Fu because there was a trademark for Shaq Fighter.

2208
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:12,000
So, those of you that were hoping for Shaq-Fu 2, Electric Boogaloo, you might get your wish.

2209
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Awesome.

2210
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,000
The gaming world needed Shaq-Fu 2, I think.

2211
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I don't think they realized how badly they needed it.

2212
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Alright, that pretty much does it for the news.

2213
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:27,000
But we're going to go to the Skype line.

2214
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Going to, well, first I'll go to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2215
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Dungeon Buster says, Shaq-Fu 2, the game that no one asked for.

2216
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,000
And Rama in our chat room says, no, no, no, fuck no.

2217
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
And SSJ100Matt says, why do I feel he's trolling?

2218
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I don't know, but we're going to go to the phones right now over at 1877 Game OLR.

2219
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2220
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2221
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
You have some explaining to do.

2222
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Hi, Shane, how are you?

2223
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Fine.

2224
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Fine.

2225
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:02,000
What's up?

2226
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:03,000
You're explaining.

2227
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Go quell the thought that, you know, some drama unfolded.

2228
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Okay, so I knew the minute that I said that.

2229
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Okay, so here's the thing.

2230
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,000
Shane is mad at me.

2231
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Are you mad at me, Shane?

2232
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,000
So mad.

2233
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Shane is mad at me because when I was talking about Hoard House,

2234
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:24,000
I said something like all the things that happened at Hoard House.

2235
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,000
And the minute those words left my mouth, I was like, God,

2236
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
that made it sound a lot worse than it really is.

2237
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:32,000
And so here you are to clear the air.

2238
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Yes, nothing bad happened.

2239
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
I left because I left.

2240
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Nothing bad happened.

2241
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,000
The end.

2242
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Nothing bad happened.

2243
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
I agree.

2244
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,000
No, and I'm agreeing with you.

2245
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Nothing bad happened.

2246
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:42,000
It's just, you know.

2247
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,000
Hi, Jason.

2248
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:44,000
I can see Jason.

2249
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I know.

2250
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,000
We have the whole webcam thing on Skype now.

2251
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
So, but yeah, no, nothing.

2252
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I mean, you just weren't into it anymore, and that happens, right?

2253
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Yep, that does happen.

2254
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,000
And it did happen.

2255
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
You shouldn't do things that aren't fun.

2256
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Exactly.

2257
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
That's my entire life.

2258
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
That's why I don't always go to work.

2259
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Well, what, okay, for real though, what's on your mind?

2260
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:10,000
What have you been up to besides quitting podcasts?

2261
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Playing Final Fantasy XIV, a whole bunch.

2262
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
But that's not why I called.

2263
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:20,000
I wanted to take a moment of silence to honor the memory of DJ Max

2264
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:24,000
because it is, with the exception of the mobile game that they put out,

2265
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:28,000
that's like Technica, the entire franchise is dead.

2266
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
It's not just Technica that's dead.

2267
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
It's the portable games.

2268
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
It's DJ Max Ray on the iPhone.

2269
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:34,000
That's gone now too.

2270
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Aww.

2271
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Yes.

2272
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
And that was my favorite music series.

2273
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Absolute favorite.

2274
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
100 percent.

2275
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Well, I don't know.

2276
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,000
How would you send off a game like DJ Max?

2277
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Lots of drinking and crying.

2278
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Yeah, lots of drinking and crying.

2279
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Did you do some drinking and crying on New Year's when they shut it down?

2280
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:01,000
I was drinking and not crying, but not for anything to do with DJ Max.

2281
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Fair enough, fair enough.

2282
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Yes.

2283
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:07,000
All right, anything else on your mind, Shane?

2284
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
No.

2285
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Oh, you missed Santa Ramen.

2286
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:14,000
That's another reason I'm going to come out so I can eat ramen.

2287
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Because I've never been there.

2288
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Oh, well, we're going to all go and have really, really good ramen.

2289
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,000
If I can be off work when you want to go, that'd be great.

2290
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:26,000
Every day that I'm there, I should have put in more requests for time off.

2291
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:27,000
All right.

2292
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:31,000
And my deepest apologies, Shane, if what I said earlier in the show offended you.

2293
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
It was super offensive.

2294
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,000
It was like something I would see on TMZ or something.

2295
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Oh, whatever.

2296
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:41,000
I don't read TMZ, but if I read TMZ, that's where it would be at.

2297
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
You read Perez Hilton.

2298
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,000
That's worse.

2299
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Nope.

2300
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I don't read that anymore.

2301
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
Because it's super dumb.

2302
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Good.

2303
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Because it is super dumb.

2304
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I read Kotaku.

2305
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
That is super dumb, too.

2306
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
That's even worse.

2307
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I'd rather you read TMZ and Perez Hilton together than read Kotaku.

2308
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:56,000
All right.

2309
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Ouch.

2310
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:58,000
All right.

2311
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Let's see.

2312
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,000
SD100MattChat, let me read this comment real quick before I let you in.

2313
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Yeah, because I can't see chat because I'm playing Final Fantasy.

2314
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Okay.

2315
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:11,000
SD100Matt says, the Technica people I know are very begrudgingly going to re-rave.

2316
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Not a fan?

2317
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:21,000
I don't want to say bad things about re-rave, but it's not a good game, and it sucks.

2318
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Well, there's always Neon FM.

2319
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:28,000
And he criticizes me about being too dramatic and saying shit on this show, and then he

2320
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:29,000
goes and says something like that.

2321
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:34,000
There's a couple good songs that I've played, and I don't think the note charts are good.

2322
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:37,000
I'm sorry, because I know people that work on that game, but I don't think the note charts

2323
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
are good whatsoever.

2324
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:42,000
But they have a few good songs on the stupid iPhone game.

2325
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
I'm sure it's in the arcade or whatever.

2326
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
But, no, that game is crap.

2327
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:50,000
I do want to play Neon FM, though, because it still has a lot of good music, it looks

2328
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:53,000
like, and that's good enough for me to want to play it.

2329
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:58,000
I don't care if the game sucks, because it doesn't look that great, but it still has,

2330
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,000
I think, The Nine and Alien 6 on there, so I'm happy.

2331
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I don't think it'll really come out either, though.

2332
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:04,000
We'll see.

2333
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
All right, Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

2334
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
That's fine.

2335
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:08,000
All right, bye.

2336
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:13,000
All right, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us

2337
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
a call, and the phone lines are open again.

2338
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Let me go to Twitter topics in the meantime, or I don't know, Loki, do you have any last

2339
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
minute news while I pull up the Twitters?

2340
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Uh, yeah, I think I had something here.

2341
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Oh, I was going to say, Tony Hawk Underground 2 is getting a massive mod that they're building

2342
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:36,000
for the PC version that not only is going to add a ton of new features to it, but it's

2343
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:40,000
going to upscale it to 1080p, which I think is kind of cool.

2344
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,000
The only problem is, where the hell do you get that game now, because they don't sell

2345
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,000
it on Steam or anything.

2346
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:50,000
I guess for those rare people that were able to pick it up, or pirates.

2347
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I guess, yeah, but it looks pretty cool.

2348
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:56,000
All right, let me go to some tweets, and I'll check in with you again, Loki.

2349
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Again, 1877 Game OLR, whoa, oops.

2350
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
That's what I get for getting to mute Skype.

2351
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Sorry about that, guys.

2352
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,000
This is all-

2353
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Movie magic.

2354
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:08,000
All right, this is all still a brand new setup here, so let's go to the phones and see who's

2355
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,000
there.

2356
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2357
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
It's the one and only DJ Ron Mass.

2358
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Hi, Rama, how you doing?

2359
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:15,000
I'm doing good.

2360
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
Now, since you got your video camera on-

2361
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
We do.

2362
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
I'm going to turn mine on.

2363
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Oh, my gosh.

2364
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
It's an actual video conversation.

2365
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I can actually reach out and touch him.

2366
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:32,000
All right, but this makes for excellent radio, Rama, excellent radio.

2367
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2368
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I want you to know that I upgraded my PlayStation 3 to a 500 gig hard drive.

2369
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
How did you do that?

2370
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Say what?

2371
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:44,000
How did you do that?

2372
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I went out and bought one.

2373
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:49,000
I pulled the old one out of the fat one, put the new one in.

2374
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:53,000
I didn't know you could do it that easy, because I need to get a new hard drive in my PlayStation 3,

2375
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:54,000
because I'm out of room.

2376
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Yeah, it's that easy.

2377
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
We'll talk later, and I'll tell you how I did it, because I was able to do it in about an hour.

2378
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Or I'll just make Loki do it for me, because he just said it's easy, too.

2379
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:06,000
I put a 500 in mine, and I had a 20.

2380
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Nice, nice.

2381
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:13,000
So you modded your PlayStation 3, and what all games are you playing on it?

2382
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
I signed up for PlayStation Plus.

2383
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:18,000
I'm like, okay, let's see what the big thing is about.

2384
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I sign in, I look at all the free games.

2385
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:27,000
It's like the pearly gates have opened, and I'm looking at all these games.

2386
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
I'm like, Devil May Cry, download.

2387
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Borderlands 2, download.

2388
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Something domain game, download.

2389
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:39,000
I'm looking at this one game where I think I have it on Xbox Live, but it's free, download.

2390
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:47,000
I just have a shit ton of games sitting on my console waiting for me to play at least a little bit of after the show.

2391
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,000
PlayStation Plus is a great deal.

2392
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
It's really a great deal.

2393
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,000
I know that some people are not happy about the whole online multiplayer pay-to-go thing that they instituted with PlayStation 4,

2394
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:01,000
but it's still a better deal than Xbox Live, in my opinion.

2395
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Xbox has a way to go to catch up with that.

2396
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:10,000
When you say it like that, I'm reminded of that one meme of the Red Wedding from Game of Thrones,

2397
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:15,000
where you see three people didn't read the book, didn't read the book, read the book.

2398
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
It's like this. You got the same three people.

2399
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:22,000
You got one person played Xbox Live, played Xbox Live, didn't play Xbox Live.

2400
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:27,000
So those who are on Xbox Live, it's like, well, we kind of knew this shit, so what the fuck?

2401
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:32,000
Bob Coffee in the chat room wants your PSN account.

2402
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
I don't know if you want to give that out over the air,

2403
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:37,000
but just know that there are people that would like to play games with you online.

2404
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Well, it's the same screen name I've always had when I called in here on my podcast and wherever.

2405
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:47,000
It's DJ Ronma S. I'll even type it in the chat room later.

2406
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I'll even throw it up on the forums if need be, too.

2407
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:57,000
But I realized that after my trial is up, which I will renew, all the free games are gone,

2408
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:01,000
and I'm like, it's not free! These are rentals, dammit!

2409
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:07,000
That's right. That's right. You got to keep paying the Sony people or they're going to take them right away.

2410
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:11,000
So look out. Good times.

2411
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:14,000
All right, Ronma, anything else on your mind tonight?

2412
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:18,000
My top three games for 2013. No special order.

2413
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Number one, Project Cross Zone.

2414
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:27,000
This was the only game that stopped me from playing Candy Crush Saga for months.

2415
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Why? I didn't hear a lot of good things about that game. Why that game?

2416
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Haters. They're probably mad because it plays like tactics, but the battle is different.

2417
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
When you're battling, you're actually doing punchier commands where you're fighting the opponents,

2418
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:50,000
whereas normal tactical games, you don't do that. It's like, they fight, and that's it.

2419
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Project Cross Zone, you're going in, you're comboing, and you're doing attacks left and right.

2420
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
I love that shit.

2421
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:00,000
All right, you're in your second game?

2422
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
DuckTales Remastered.

2423
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
And why DuckTales Remastered?

2424
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:14,000
I felt like a kid playing it again. I have a personal challenge for myself to hit $30 million in the game,

2425
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:21,000
because when I had it for NES, I could sit there, go through every single level, and crack $30 million without breaking a sweat.

2426
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Fuck that Vesuvius level, though.

2427
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
I love the Vesuvius level.

2428
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:29,000
No, it's great, but I just say fuck it because it's so fucking hard.

2429
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:34,000
The only hard part was when I was trying to get to the end, and I'm playing through the game,

2430
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:39,000
I'm like, I know where everything is, and I realized, oh, they added this, they added, ooh, they added this stuff here,

2431
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,000
and then when you're dragging a duck, and I'm like, I'm thinking, oh, they got Transylvania,

2432
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I'm hopping around, trying to get my ass up the damn screen, and I'm like,

2433
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:53,000
let me switch to the analog controls so I can make my way up there.

2434
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:56,000
Took me two tries, and I finally made it to the end.

2435
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Took me a couple tries, too. And lastly...

2436
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:03,000
The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Worlds.

2437
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Thumbs up for you, good sir. That's a great choice.

2438
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Yes, I just have one thing to say about that.

2439
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:12,000
The ice level, sliding back and forth, playing this while you're riding the subway.

2440
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Fuck you, Nintendo. Fuck you.

2441
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Alright, on that note, Rama, we gotta let you go to get more calls.

2442
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Alright, cool.

2443
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Take care, buddy. Always good to see you. Take care.

2444
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,000
You got it.

2445
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Bye.

2446
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Bye.

2447
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.

2448
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
We will probably try to sneak in one more call.

2449
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,000
Let me quickly run through some tweets.

2450
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:38,000
We got a few tweets here. Tigerclaw tweeting us at OLR.

2451
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Last of Us and Assassin's Creed nominated for WGA Awards, Writers Guild of America.

2452
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:47,000
You know, we've seen more and more video games show up in those awards.

2453
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
So that's great.

2454
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Last of Us getting a lot of accolades, a lot of Game of the Year awards.

2455
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
No surprises there whatsoever, and I know Assassin's Creed...

2456
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
The story of GLAAD last week.

2457
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

2458
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:03,000
ActDeft tweets us, Kirby Triple Deluxe is sold out on Amazon Japan and is topping the charts in Japan.

2459
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:06,000
So, you know, ActDeft is a Kirby fanboy.

2460
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:10,000
So it's probably nice to have that validation that Japan is literally eating him up.

2461
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:11,000
So that's great.

2462
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
No, I hope the game is successful here as well.

2463
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:19,000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, we can probably fit in one more call.

2464
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:23,000
BobbyBlackWolf, our buddy who tapes before us, had to tweet us a picture.

2465
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
He said, yeah, I had to. Why not?

2466
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:28,000
He is playing in his Super Nintendo on the Oculus Rift.

2467
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:31,000
He's playing what? Super Noah's Ark 3D.

2468
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:36,000
He got that through, I'm sure, perfectly legal means to play on his Oculus Rift.

2469
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:39,000
That Super Nintendo emulator is pretty fun, though, because you can actually look around.

2470
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Like, you see in the little screenshot he sent us on Twitter, and you can see this, too, if you look at the OLR account.

2471
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Let me do a retweet there so you can see that on the OLR account.

2472
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:51,000
He actually, if you look down, you see yourself holding the Super Nintendo controller, which is kind of funny.

2473
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:56,000
I realize that I didn't understand the picture because you can see your hands on the controller,

2474
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:01,000
and I thought it was a picture that was split in two, and it didn't occur to me until just when you were talking about it.

2475
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:04,000
It's a living room simulator emulator.

2476
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Yep, that's exactly what it is. He let me play a Mario Kart on it, which was a lot of fun. Good stuff.

2477
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Let's see, 13xForever actually tweeted us in response to the FUGL question from last week.

2478
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Here's my response to the Create Your Own Fighting constructor, and he gives us a link.

2479
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Let me open that link, but right now we gotta go to the phones because we do have another phone call coming in, so I want to get to it.

2480
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:30,000
So, hi there, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2481
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2482
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Hey there, it's VidPower.

2483
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Hey, there you are. Now I can hear you. Hey, VidPower. My God, I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you?

2484
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:41,000
Good, good.

2485
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?

2486
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
I want to talk about CES again this year.

2487
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:48,000
You went to CES this year, right? Because that's right in your backyard, right?

2488
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Totally.

2489
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:51,000
How was it?

2490
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Awesome, awesome. I got to check out the PlayStation Now service from Sony.

2491
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Oh, even though they were streaming it from, you know, just down the hall, but that's okay.

2492
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Yeah, exactly. Well, you know, it worked, you know, seeing as it was down the hall. So, you know, it worked, and it was kind of cool.

2493
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I was playing The Last of Us, and you could see the video quality, like, you know, it's like depending on the network.

2494
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:24,000
So, you know, it like degrades in quality depending on your network. But, you know, it worked. No lag, which was the most important thing, I thought.

2495
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:29,000
That was the most important thing I was going to ask is, is there that kind of lag that you would expect?

2496
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Because that seems like the all-important thing. Like, is there lag?

2497
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:39,000
There, I did not feel any lag. That was like the first thing I wanted to try out was, well, you know, seeing as that's down the hall.

2498
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:43,000
But yeah, yeah, it was, I was impressed. I was very impressed.

2499
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Now the question is, is that going to work from here to Alaska? Or is it only going to work when it's down the hall? That's the crazy question, so.

2500
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:58,000
It was, it was kind of cool because they had it running on a new Bravia model, and there was no PlayStation 4 connected whatsoever.

2501
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:04,000
So, it was, it was completely streamed to their TV, and they also had a Vita set up, so, you know.

2502
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Nice.

2503
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Pretty cool, and it worked.

2504
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:13,000
But there wasn't like a whole lot of gaming stuff at CES, right? There was just kind of that, or did you get, did you get to catch some other stuff while you were there as well?

2505
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:20,000
In terms of, like, new, like, games, the only new game they had there was Infamous Second Son.

2506
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:28,000
And, you know, that was fun, that was fun. I had never played too many Infamous games before, but yeah, it was pretty fun.

2507
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,000
And that only comes out in like two months from now, so it was a nice little preview.

2508
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Everything else is just like old, older games that have already been out, you know, like Knack, or NBA Live, or games that are already out right now, so nothing new.

2509
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Okay, I gotcha. Now, did you get to see Michael Bay fucking up on stage, or was that invite only?

2510
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:59,000
I did not get to see that, no. I saw the video, though, but that was, I totally missed out on that whole shebang.

2511
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Was he walking through the show floor with his head hung low, and all that?

2512
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Maybe, maybe. Maybe.

2513
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I'm sure he was hiding out backstage for the whole rest of the competition.

2514
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:16,000
That was the most, that was so crazy, and, you know, not to be a bitch, but my immediate tweet, because if you're gonna be a bitch, do it on Twitter, that's where everybody's a bitch.

2515
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:22,000
So, my first thing, I went and I wrote a tweet, and I said, I said, Live ain't easy, is it, Michael Bay?

2516
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:26,000
So, anyway. Alright, I had to say something about that.

2517
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Yeah, that was good.

2518
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Now, okay, since you're in Vegas, surely you know the answer to this question. Is there some type of coin-op show that happens in Vegas every year?

2519
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
It's like an amusement expo or something, right?

2520
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Uh, I think you might be referring to AOU, uh, is it the amusement operators?

2521
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Yes, yes it is. That is it. Thank you. I knew there was something like that.

2522
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:53,000
See, I just have to ask the guy that's in convention, Convention City, there.

2523
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:57,000
TigerClan, our chatroom, saying that the teleprompter broke, that's why.

2524
02:54:57,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Well, you shouldn't have to have the teleprompter to make or break you, my gosh.

2525
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:08,000
You know what, though, it isn't easy. To be fair, when I did that, it was the UmLoud thing a couple years ago,

2526
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:13,000
when they asked me to be, like, the man on the street thing for the livestream, I was kind of scared shitless.

2527
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Like, it is really hard when it's a video, and you know that people are watching you and stuff.

2528
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Like, this is easy, because I can't see you.

2529
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:23,000
But when it's in video, it's like, I don't know, it's so much different, it's weird.

2530
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:28,000
So, I can't give Michael Bay too much shit, but...

2531
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Anyway, well what else? Tell us one more funny CES story before we let you go.

2532
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:43,000
Um, they had a DDR setup for this, like, health, it was like a health company.

2533
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Oh, like the DDR in school thing?

2534
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a DDR in school, like, setup, which I was surprised to see. That was kind of funny.

2535
02:55:52,000 --> 02:56:00,000
That is pretty awesome. See, kids today, you know, when I was your age, kids, playing your DDR in school,

2536
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:05,000
when I was your age, in the wintertime, we did square dancing. That was our DDR.

2537
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:10,000
And instead of arrows scrolling up the screen, it would be the female PE teacher out there going,

2538
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:15,000
All right, everybody, now do-si-do. And yes, she sounded like that.

2539
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:19,000
All right, anybody. Anyway, VidPower, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show,

2540
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:22,000
but it sounds like you had a great time at CES, and I appreciate hearing from you.

2541
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:27,000
So, your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go to the adult expo that's taking place,

2542
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:30,000
I think, right now, and report on that too, okay?

2543
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
All right, I'll see what I can do.

2544
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:35,000
All right, appreciate it. All right, take care, buddy.

2545
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Bye.

2546
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
All right, that again is VidPower there on the Skype line,

2547
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
and that is actually going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

2548
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:44,000
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're running a little bit behind tonight,

2549
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
so I want to make sure we can go ahead and wrap things up.

2550
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Quickly, Loki, I'm going to check in with you. Are there any other last-minute stories?

2551
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Because I've got to finish these tweets. I didn't finish that one guy's tweet, unfortunately.

2552
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
No, there's nothing really.

2553
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:04,000
All right, let's see. This is a tweet that, again, 13X Forever sent, saying the Create Your Own Fighting constructor.

2554
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:10,000
I guess this is actually a link to a game that will let you actually create your own 3D.

2555
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:14,000
This is better, though. This looks better a little bit than Moog. What is it, Moogan is the name of that or whatever?

2556
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:18,000
This is different. This is EF12. It's a playable 3D fighting game,

2557
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:25,000
and I guess with the engine built in it, you can actually mod the hell out of it and make your own, like, 3D fighters.

2558
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:29,000
You could put yourself in it if you want. So that seems like a more advanced type of game.

2559
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:39,000
They had something similar on PlayStation 2, I want to say. It was by the same guys that did the RPG Maker as Fighter Maker.

2560
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,000
But there's some really terrible games they made out of that.

2561
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Playism-Games.com, if you want to check that out. Thanks for that tweet. Appreciate it.

2562
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
I'm trying to see if there's any other tweets.

2563
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
Apparently it's on Greenlight as well.

2564
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Oh, is it?

2565
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
So says the tweet. I haven't seen the actual listing yet.

2566
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:59,000
I heard they Greenlit a bunch more games there.

2567
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Let's see, I'm going to do one more here from Redertainment, saying,

2568
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Is tweeting about a post on Tumblr which is about a tweet meta meta?

2569
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Yes, probably.

2570
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:15,000
Oh god, that was in reference to last week's show. That's really funny.

2571
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:19,000
He linked to the tweet with the guy. He actually ended up following me on Twitter, which is pretty cool.

2572
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
The guy who did the Metroid thing.

2573
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Cyanic.

2574
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Don't put me on the spot.

2575
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:30,000
There, cymaticbruce.

2576
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
Alright, that's going to do it.

2577
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
I literally just put it in the video like 24 hours ago.

2578
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:39,000
Don't forget.

2579
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
That's going to do it for the Twitters tonight.

2580
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:44,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.

2581
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,000
That's it. It's 9.20 here at O-L-R central.

2582
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:51,000
So we got to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.

2583
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Jason, I want to thank you once again for being here and appreciate you really.

2584
02:58:55,000 --> 02:59:02,000
You guys don't know this, but Jason had to step up with about five minutes notice to take over Jamie's stories tonight.

2585
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
So I really appreciate that.

2586
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
I'm here. I manage.

2587
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:12,000
It's nice being able to get out there and opinionate and pundit it up a little bit more.

2588
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
It's fun. Good times. You did a good job.

2589
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
So thank you for being here. Your final thought tonight, sir?

2590
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:21,000
My thought tonight is as much as I'm not looking forward to driving back home, I want to be back home.

2591
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Three three little weeks.

2592
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Well, Loki, as much as I'd hope to see you next week, I have this funny feeling we're probably not going to see you next week, although I suppose we might.

2593
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:37,000
So let me just say in advance, good luck with everything and wishing you and Mrs. Loki all the best in this next journey.

2594
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
And yeah, we'll be thinking of you.

2595
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
We want to know the name as soon as the kids here.

2596
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:42,000
All right. Of course.

2597
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:45,000
I already know the name, but I can't say anything until he's born.

2598
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
I understand. I completely understand.

2599
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Your final thought, Loki?

2600
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:53,000
His name's Rob Brower.

2601
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:57,000
I wish. That'd be cute. That's a good name.

2602
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:00,000
I ate free coffee this week, so that's good.

2603
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Free coffee! Yay!

2604
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
And I have a coffee truck parked out in front of our work.

2605
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,000
Nice. I want a coffee truck outside of my work. No fair.

2606
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:11,000
And my final thought tonight. I'll say what I always say at the end of every show.

2607
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:15,000
If you like what you hear here at Orange Laundry Radio, don't forget to tell a friend or five about the program.

2608
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:18,000
Help us spread the word. You know, word of mouth is all we've got.

2609
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Independents have to support each other.

2610
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:29,000
And as long as you're not whipping your titties out on PlayStation 4, chances are, or your wiener.

2611
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:30,000
I'm equal opportunity here.

2612
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:37,000
As long as you're not whipping that stuff out on PlayStation 4, I probably will support your independent broadcast because I'm all about getting the voices out there.

2613
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
So remember, just support any broadcast.

2614
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Even if you didn't like this show, there's tons of other people doing a similar type of thing with just as much passion.

2615
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:47,000
So please support all those hardworking independent broadcasters out there.

2616
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:51,000
If you like what we do, the best way you can support us, tell a friend or five about the show.

2617
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:59,000
If you seriously can't think of anybody to tell, a nice review goes a long way on a site like iTunes, a site like Stitcher.

2618
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Those reviews, especially the Stitcher ones, really do go a long way.

2619
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:07,000
And we've been having really good success on Stitcher lately thanks to those reviews, so I really, really appreciate it.

2620
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
And Jamie would like to say blah.

2621
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Is that her final thought?

2622
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:11,000
That is her final thought.

2623
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:17,000
Feel better, DarkSakura. We missed you tonight. We hope to see you real soon, okay?

2624
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Really appreciate that.

2625
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:24,000
That's it. We're done. We'll be back next week and we'll do it all over again.

2626
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:27,000
So until then, take care everybody.

2627
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Don't be a jerk online. Keep it in your pants, please. Please.

2628
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,000
And that's it. Good night everybody.

2629
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:40,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2630
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:44,000
