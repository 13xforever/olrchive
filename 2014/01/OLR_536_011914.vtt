00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
It's a new year of growth, despite what the pundits are saying all about Nintendo.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
New games are being created by the people we love, and new services are expanding their horizons,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
and new updates are available to amuse and entertain us.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
Join us for all the details on this episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January the 19th of 2014, episode number 536 of our show.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
Our program, about three hours or so, give or take like an hour,

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
dedicated to all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week, and welcome back to the show this week.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hello.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
How are you doing?

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
As I said, Husky.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Husky, yes.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm about to take a cough drop for my Husky cough.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
As she was telling me before the show tonight, not during the first take,

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
where maybe her mic wasn't on that I had to cut out.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I would never make a big mistake like that. I'm a professional.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Rob is a flawless goddess.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
That's right, don't you forget it.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Anyway, so yes, you have a bit of the Kathleen Turner thing going on with your voice tonight.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, I was telling my friend, who I'm Tumblr pals with,

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
that I either sound like a 13-year-old boy or like a sex phone worker.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
So, I can say, you know, what are you wearing?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
And have it sound hot.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
Other than like, bitch, I don't care what you're wearing.

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
Can we get you to say just once for the listeners, I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Great, now I have a clip for the next intro.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Alright, also say hello.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
By the way, what you told the chatroom, all that sucking that they can do, join in.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
They were, every single one of them was yelling at me after the mistake of not having your mic on for a little bit.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Alright, anyway, let's go over to the Skype line where, believe it or not, he is here this week.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
I didn't think he'd be here tonight, but he is. He persevered. Here he is.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Say hello, everybody, to Techmaster Loki.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
He just doesn't want to come out. I don't know. He likes it in there.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Well, you better be careful, Loki. I didn't want to come out until I was about 20 years old.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
So, just saying.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
How you doing, Loki?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Tired.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Tired, I bet.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.000
So, what's going on? We have a baby delay, so it's no longer going to be Martin Luther King Jr. Day baby.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
It's going to be Tuesday baby, right?

02:39.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, we, Josh caught a cold on Thursday or Friday, and so we're just giving him an extra day to not be sick so that the baby's not sick.

02:49.000 --> 02:53.000
Makes sense. Makes sense. Completely understandable. Makes fair.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
That was like, I just totally did that thing from Mean Girls where the guy goes, gruel.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
I meant to say great, and I thought cool, and it came out as gruel.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I did that whole sounds fair and makes sense. It makes fair. It makes fair.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm broken tonight. You know what I blame? Dark Sakura comes back to the show tonight.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Don't blame me.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
You know, she was off last week. No, I'm going to blame you for this.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
And she brings with her, what does she bring? She brings a flask because that's how she rolls.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
And in that flask, she's like, I made my own liquor. Check that out.

03:23.000 --> 03:32.000
To elaborate, I have this hobby lately that's infusing vodkas with different flavors.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And what a hobby.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
And I did.

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
You know, some people crochet. I do that too.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I'm totally into hooking.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
You've seen what I've made. Anyway.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
You should totally infuse vodka with the flavor of vodka. You can call it yo dog.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
That's a good one. That's a good one. No.

03:54.000 --> 04:00.000
I did two batches. One was infusing a dark chocolate bar, and the other one was infusing coffee.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Right. Because you know me and coffee.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
And I finally ended up mixing the two together, and it's so good.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
It is pretty good. It's like mochas.

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
It is. It's mocha vodka. And I only use potato vodka because I hate grain vodka.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
It just tastes not like vodka to me, you know? So I use potato vodka.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
And also with the extra filtering, it comes out a little bit higher grade than when it started.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Right.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
So I brought a flask over to share with some of my favorite dudes.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, always drink responsibly, kids. It's very important.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Unless you're me, you put it in your coffee, and then you drive for the show.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
An hour later, an hour later.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
Here with us tonight, who is drinking Mountain Dew Code Red,

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
because he's got to drive back to San Francisco a little later on.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
So that's his hard course he's going to get tonight.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Say hello, everybody, to Jason.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Have to drive back to San Francisco on about two to three hours of sleep.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Did they win that game? Alan told me they were winning that game.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Broncos won. I haven't revisited 49ers game yet.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
So as much as I don't really always bring up sports ball on the show,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
and to be fair, I don't like to talk about award shows either,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
because every single one of them gets in the way on Sunday nights.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Not that you're scorned or anything.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
If they won the game, we may have to get out the inflatable bed.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Ooh. Yeah, I may not be able to make it back over that bridge back into San Francisco tonight.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
They may have actually burned it down, Jason. You might be.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I will be checking the news legitimately before I go back tonight,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
because if we win, we riot. If we lose, we riot.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
So, you know, something's going down tonight.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
I do have a spare bed. Just saying.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Wait, wait, wait. You're talking the Raiders or the Niners?

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
Niners. Raiders didn't make playoffs. This is a playoff championship.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, they'll still riot anyways. You know, they'll riot by proxy.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Loki, there doesn't need to be a contingency plan, because the Raiders never win anything.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
We all understand that.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
I understand that, but, you know, they want to get in on the rioting.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
Not to mention I don't technically drive into Oakland, so I just skirt the danger zone.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
You just clip by. You just clip by.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
All right, Alan says right now it's 20 to 17 Seattle.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
It is 20 to 17 Seahawks. Ten minutes to go in the fourth.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
He might get a losing riot. You're right, that would actually be worse,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
because a winning riot, people still have to save their energy for Super Bowl Sunday,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
but a losing riot, they're going to get it all out tonight.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
You know what kind of riot I'm having? A laugh riot.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Cough riot, actually.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
You know, if only a certain game company would just let all their assets ride on the Seahawks.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
You're doing okay.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Look, look, look. Bonds006 in the chat says,

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
The reason I am here is to avoid football. All right, look, I understand.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Except for Tecmo Super Bowl. That's the one exception we grant.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Yes, Tecmo Super Bowl. Super High Impact would be an exception as well.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
NFL Blitz.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, NFL Blitz is acceptable too. All that would be just fine.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
So, getting things back on course, if her voice drops anymore,

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
she's going to be rivaling my job all of a sudden.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I know, right? She'll have to do the intro.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
You're listening to Orange On's radio.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
Too bad I just did that intro for Hoard House a week ago.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
You would have been perfect for that. Oh well.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Anyway.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Except a week ago I had no voice.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I thought you said you liked mine.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
I do, I do. But you do all the intros.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
I don't have a problem with that. You used to do all the intros.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
To register participation for Orange On's radio.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
Wait, wait, don't throw them off. I should plug that real quick while I have a chance.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Then we'll get into our kickoff topic.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
But, you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
And that's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, which is another great show about gaming here on the network.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
And lots of great geek programming throughout the week at vognetwork.com.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
But one thing that makes us kind of unique is that you can actually check into the shows.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
So if you're actually listening live tonight, head over to vognetwork.com.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
You can actually click the little link, check in, you get five VoG points for checking into the site.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
But if you are listening in the podcast, you still get a chance to get those points.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
Because somewhere during the show, we're going to have a little, you'll hear a little noise.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
It goes doo doo doo doo doo doo. And then it says to register participation, you get a keyword.

07:59.000 --> 08:04.000
So you take that word, you go put it in the front page of vognetwork.com and it's just like you were listening live.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
So for example, what if the keyword was vagina?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yes, if the keyword was vagina.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
You would type in vagina on the check-in site.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Yes, that's exactly how it works.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
But it's never anything as sexy as vagina.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
It isn't.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
We did have ball last week.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
We did have ball one week. Yes, we did.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Which we can say now because if you use that word now, it ain't going to do shit.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
It has indeed expired.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
I just want to know the day we get dongle because I want to record that shit.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Okay, but here's the good news. Here's the good news.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
If you check into the shows, whether it be live, whether it be on tape or whatever it is,

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
if you check into the shows, then you are eligible for the raffle.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Now, it's an opt-in raffle.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
You're not automatically entered because we don't believe in, unlike Google, we don't automatically opt people into things.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
You have to elect.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Yes, so if you go to vognetwork.com, you can actually enter the raffle.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
This month, we're actually giving away a three-month subscription to either Netflix Instant Streaming or Hulu Plus.

09:00.000 --> 09:05.000
What a great little way to enhance your game console by catching up on whatever TV show you want to watch.

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
You can watch Scandal on Hulu Plus, you can watch Doctor Who on Netflix, whatever you want to do.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Orange is the New Black or any other myriad of entertaining original shows.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
You choose, but it's got to be one of the two.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Last month, things got crazy because we gave away a gift card and everybody was like,

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
well, can we get a gift card for Google Play?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Okay, okay, look.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
I want a gift card for Macy's.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Maybe next month. Here's the catch.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Sadly, it's U.S. residents only and I'm very sorry to the folks overseas.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
We're not purposely trying to screw you guys.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
The problem is that we're not allowed to buy here in the U.S. the codes for you guys overseas.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
It's ridiculous, but it is what it is.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Hopefully, in future months, we will have more inclusive raffles.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Last month, I think we tried to do one all-inclusive.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I am not making the moon noise from Sherlock.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
So I can't get a three-month subscription for like browsers or something like that?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
No, you get Netflix or you get Hulu Plus.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
You get A or B.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
But the other good news is that you might be like, I already have both of them or I already have one.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
You can actually use the code to just...

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
It's on us for three months.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
It'll be on us for three months. That'll be really cool.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
So that's one less thing out of your pocket.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
You can use the money to buy, I don't know, like a $20 download game or something.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Here you go.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And if you don't win the raffle, you lose!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You get nothing! Good day, sir!

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
No, you get loot at vognetwork.com.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
And what does the loot do?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
It increases your EP.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
What does the loot say?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
One little bit.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Shut up.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Nothing. It's loot.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Let's move on.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
We got to get into tonight's kickoff topic because some people are here wanting to hear...

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Bonz006 tuned in because he wanted to hear video game chat.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
He didn't want to hear football.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
He didn't want to hear me talking about Netflix and Hulu Plus.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
Live.vognetwork.com where you can have a voice as we talk about video games.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Jamie going to start us off tonight with quite the whopper of a story that's making its way around the internet tonight.

10:57.000 --> 11:06.000
Yeah, and there is talk about the particular situation that Nintendo is in.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
Especially in regards to their big leading console, the Wii U.

11:12.000 --> 11:22.000
And it seems that the Wii U has underperformed by how they had anticipated it would.

11:22.000 --> 11:29.000
And they have cut their sales forecast by about 70%.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Is it a flop?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Some say yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Nintendo doesn't think so.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
They're not going to say, oh no, we flopped.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
Nintendo is fine and making money.

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
We've even said they have pulled up with the 3DS.

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
They're still holding treading water.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
So Nintendo has not flopped.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
But what about the system?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Also, and very important to say, I'm so glad you bring that up.

12:03.000 --> 12:08.000
Because one of the particular articles that was going around, because it was right on the front page of Yahoo and so forth.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I think the site was TechCrunch or something said.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
The headline was Nintendo admits Wii U has flopped.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
They said nothing of the sort.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, TechCrunch did, but Nintendo said nothing of the sort.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I take a big issue with that.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
You can't sugar coat these sales numbers, that's not what I'm trying to do.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
Has the Wii U flopped from an opinion perspective?

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
It's not doing as well as it should be, that's for darn sure.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
But to say that Nintendo said it flopped?

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
No.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Nintendo is a stubborn motherfucker.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
They are not going to admit that their system flopped.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
They're going to spin these numbers.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
They're going to talk about new strategy.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
They're going to do whatever they can.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Can you imagine Reggie Fils-Aime getting out there and saying, well, we flopped.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
No, it's not going to happen.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
That we fucked up.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Sorry guys, we fucked up.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
No, it's not going to happen at all.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Sound the click whore alarm.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
I would like to disagree with Alan saying the Wii U is the new Saturn.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Because Saturn was a lot fucking cooler.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Just saying.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
And I got something to say as well about everybody that's saying,

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
Welp, it's time for Nintendo to jump ship and make a Mario game on mobile phone.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Nope.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Or Nintendo is going the way of Sega.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Nope.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
It took Sega a good three consoles before they were finally throwing the towel.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
One is not going to ruin Nintendo.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Oh yeah?

13:36.000 --> 13:43.000
Iwata is saying that they are looking into smart devices to grow, as he says, the game player business.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
His quote is, it's not as simple as enabling Mario to move on a smart phone.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Of course, Microsoft and Sony already did look into the game player business.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
Because they both have second screen and that's the big hoopla this year.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Tablet and phone second screen to the console.

13:59.000 --> 14:06.000
Honestly, in my opinion, Nintendo's biggest problem right now is they just need to get out of their bunker that they're in.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
I mean, that bunker served them very well in the era of the Wii, but it's not working out so well.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
And I think back to the story on Eurogamer, whether you want to take it or leave it, about the development of the Wii U.

14:16.000 --> 14:21.000
Where the executive said, oh we've never tried Xbox Live. Really?

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
Nothing served Nintendo well with the Wii except for Circumstance.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
Nintendo did not make the Wii a good console.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
Honestly. Like, am I wrong in saying that the Wii was not exactly like you think of your favorite gaming console?

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
With the one single exception of a unique control method, the Wii was not exactly outstanding when it came out.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
I got really bored with my Wii after a week.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Performance, titles, and everything else.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
Well, no, because Super Mario Galaxy would like to say hello.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
It was not a launch title.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
No, it wasn't a launch title.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
It was two years into the system.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Yes.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Zelda was.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And it was something that buoyed up the system all those years later.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
But, I think I've made this point a couple of times on the show.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Wii Fit, Jason. Wii Fit.

15:08.000 --> 15:14.000
I'll do, I'll, no, no, no, I completely agree with that, but I know I've made this point a number of times.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
The Wii was not a successful gaming device. It was not.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
It was a exciting entertainment device.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
It was what you lend to your in-laws so they can play bowling.

15:26.000 --> 15:34.000
I, I, I kind of can't with, I can't with that comment, Jason, because it is the highest selling system of all time period.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
That is a fact you cannot dispute.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
Because, because people that have never bought any other console now had a reason to do so.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
Which is where the bunker served Nintendo well.

15:45.000 --> 15:51.000
No. No, that was circumstance. That was not, like, Nintendo, Nintendo makes fun, easy, accessible games.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
That is the truth of them in their entire history.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Going back to card games and everything else, pre, pre-digital games.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
The Wii was not designed to find the success that it did.

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
It's just that Wii Sports using their mantra in style was exciting and benefited so many people because of,

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
you grab a remote, you push a button, you figure out how to play and you go to it.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
Wii Sports, especially considering that Wii Sports was the top selling game of all time, was never sold.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
That is the very definition of a system seller, but not to the regular purchasers of consoles.

16:25.000 --> 16:36.000
Like, my, my, my biggest problem, tablets for all of their excitement are not exactly the things that, that people go to because they're tablets.

16:36.000 --> 16:42.000
They go for them because they're low maintenance and you just open it up, press a button and start tapping on the screen.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
People don't give a shit that the Wii U has a, has a, has a gamepad. It's worthless.

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
The Wii found attraction, not gaming. That's why it took off.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
And if they're going to map, if they're going to chart their course, their outlook for the Wii U based off the Wii,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
they're going to fail miserably and that's where we are.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.000
But I feel like you're trying to say that we did not have great gaming experiences on it.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh, of course it did.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
It did, yeah.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
And it was unable to do so because of the runaway response it got at the start of the generation.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
But Zelda was a launch title.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
If, if I may interject.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Yeah, sure.

17:16.000 --> 17:24.000
There, there is something to say though for both Microsoft and Sony biting off the concept of the Wii.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
LOL move.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Yeah, with the move, which was I guess okay.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
The move wasn't that bad, honestly. I think it worked a lot better than the Wii and Wii remote did.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Which technically I would say bolsters my argument a little bit more.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
Sony tried the same thing and they never reached critical acclaim with it because they had nothing to attract people to use it.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Because Sony didn't know how to make a game for it.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
And the Kinect I think is more of an expansion of the same thing.

17:50.000 --> 17:58.000
It's like how, you know, people sort of reversed the, uh, the Wiimote to do like the head tracking devices and similar things.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
I think that sort of, you know, and Microsoft I think has had a history of being good at taking an okay idea that's out there.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
And turning it around into something that's been a little bit better.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Um, so they did what they do best.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
They, they bit and made it better.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
Um, as honestly as what I think the Kinect in its true essence is.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
It's sort of a reverse Wiimote where you're bringing the events of the outside world in instead of just affecting what's on the inside world.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
Absolutely.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
I don't know. So far the, like, Kinect enabled games that are coming out at launch for the Xbox One.

18:32.000 --> 18:40.000
So far the only ones that are actually any good were Just Dance and, you know, the exercise stuff that's on Xbox Fitness.

18:40.000 --> 18:47.000
So once again they're stuck in that rut where those are the only games that end up working out for the Kinect.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
It's just basically a big old gimmick again.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Which coincidentally were the best games on the Kinect for the 360 as well.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
And I also think that the selling point of the Wii is watching Rob play Just Dance Abba.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
Okay. Our chat room is blowing up as you can imagine over at live.vognetwork.com.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
I've got to get some of these other voices out there with some of the feedback.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
WhatupG says Nintendo went after a different audience with Wii.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Agree with that for sure.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
Alan Alchemy says as awful as mandatory Kinect. Jason's shaking his head over there.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
Alan Alchemy says as awful as mandatory Kinect is and Microsoft refusing to let it go, I must commend them for working hard on making the technology be something gamers want.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Not that they're doing a good job.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
Sony put out the move as an obvious the Wii but hardcore accessory and then immediately forgot about it.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
Let's see.

19:28.000 --> 19:36.000
WhatupG says Zelda on Wii was made for GameCube and Tech 2030 follows it up saying I feel like Zelda was a tacked on launch title.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
The game was much better on the GameCube.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Yeah it was totally a GameCube port.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Sorry Logi.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
Rama says the Wii was a successful console with one hell of a gimmick that Microsoft and Sony jumped on.

19:48.000 --> 19:55.000
Akuma JP says I'm sorry but I have to say this since I never interested in the Wii, I was born with a Wii and I still use it.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
Oh I see what you did there. It's still that damn name isn't it?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It's still that damn name.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Anyhow sorry Logi go ahead and get your thought out.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
Oh I was going to say even though I still don't think people want the Kinect.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
To be honest I think a lot of people just don't give a shit about it.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
And at least Sony kind of tried something with the move.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
They supported it with a lot of their first person shooters and stuff.

20:16.000 --> 20:23.000
The only way that they supported Kinect with anything that Microsoft did was voice commands for Halo or something like that.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Or crappy head tracking of Forza.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
It just doesn't work.

20:27.000 --> 20:35.000
That being said I've been very very polite about the fact that this article came out.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.000
I know it's very easy for me to make all sorts of jokes.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
But honestly it's not that big of a surprise that their sales numbers are down.

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Because one there's just no games coming out for the system.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
I mean yeah there are some first party games but third parties have pretty much jumped ship for the system.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
And it's not getting any better in 2014 I can tell you that much.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
So it's going to be a big struggle for them to regain some of that console market.

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000
My opinion was I say they just stick with the handhelds because they're rocking on the 3DS.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
I mean there's tons of stuff coming out there and that's a great platform.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
And hey why not play both fields. You can have the first party and third party.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
I'd love to see some Mario games come to other platforms.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I think that would be pretty cool.

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Just a couple more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetware.com.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
Bonds006 says we got the big numbers because it was sold to people who were not regular system buyers.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
I agree with that.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
100% that is my only point.

21:29.000 --> 21:36.000
And the very first comment you read about Nintendo targeting a different audience for the Wii is 100% incorrect.

21:37.000 --> 21:46.000
But Jason the only problem with that idea that it was only sold to people that didn't buy consoles in the first place is that their software tie ratio.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Because that was going to be my argument.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
It's like well only people bought it for Wii Sports or something.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
Their software tie ratio was not that different than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for example.

21:56.000 --> 22:05.000
The Wii software tie ratio kind of globally was 9% or I guess 9.05 maybe not 9%.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
So 9 games per system were sold on average versus the Xbox 360 which is 10 and 3 quarters.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
And the PlayStation 3 was about 9 and 3 quarters.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
So it's not that different.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
Let me shift gears here a little bit because it's only a 3 hour show and we could have this debate all night.

22:23.000 --> 22:27.000
But I want to get this story out because I had a little bit of a moment of clarity today.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Because I think when a lot of people talk about oh Nintendo should go mobile, Nintendo should go online.

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
I think there's a lot of people thinking oh Nintendo should copy Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and have something that robust.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Or Nintendo should put Mario on the iPhone and so forth.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
I think that's where people's heads go.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
But I don't think that's necessarily true.

22:44.000 --> 22:51.000
And you know especially tonight I'm usually the one that will defend Nintendo in these situations and so forth.

22:51.000 --> 22:59.000
Because I do still I think it says a lot that yes Nintendo only put out a handful of games last year for the Wii U.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
But at least one of them showed up on every single person's top 10 list and usually it was multiple games that showed up there.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
So you can't deny Nintendo makes the games that hardcore gamers and soccer moms alike want to play.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.000
So that's you know something big.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
But they need to get out of this bubble is the biggest problem.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And here's the moment of clarity I had today.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
It's not necessarily that they need to copy Xbox Live.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
It's not that they need to copy mobile phones.

23:23.000 --> 23:30.000
Here's an example where Nintendo not going online and going mobile phones I think did them bad.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
And it's not the obvious thing but these are the types of things that Nintendo has to do.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Okay out with it already.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
I spent $60 on a new device today.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
And it's a very hip little thing and a lot of people have them.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
And it's kind of the craze right now.

23:45.000 --> 23:52.000
And when I bought it there was a part of me that said I feel like I've bought one of these before.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
Like I feel like I've had something like this before that's supposed to do the exact same thing but yet here I am buying it again.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
What is it Jason?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
I have three of these in my pockets on me right now.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
I have a different model. I have a Fitbit.

24:06.000 --> 24:13.000
The new iPhone 5S has a motion coprocessor so it can act as a pedometer as well with the appropriate software.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
And our 3DS's.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
Right so okay.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Pedometers.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Exactly they're all pedometers but here's the thing in particular about Fitbit.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
And even before the 3DS integrated that whole thing as well which is another great example where Nintendo could have had this.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
They could have bottled it and they didn't and that's where they failed.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
It's a little too large but make your point.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Okay remember back on the Game Boy Advance.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
They sold this game and it was called something like Everybody Walks or something like that.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
It was on the Game Boy.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
No it might have been the regular DS.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
It was either the Advance or the DS.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
I apologize I can't remember which off the top of my head because there wasn't exactly really a game there.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
All it was was a little pedometer that you carried around.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
It was the DS.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
It was the DS thank you.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
It was a little pedometer that you carried around in your pocket.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
And at the end of the day you turn on this game and transmit the data from the pedometer into the little system.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
And you can track the number of steps you took in a day.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
And the game is looking at this little chart.

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
You could connect online to see how much has America walked to the moon.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Oooh ahh.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Okay.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
It's like Noby Noby Boy but with an actual return.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
It was this thing that was like in and out in like a couple months.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
But this all came at the height of Wii Fit Mania.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
This was, everybody was crazy about Wii Fit.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
And this was kind of like, this was Nintendo's attempt to bottle some of that on the DS.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Was to put out this everybody walks game.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
My point is, Nintendo was sitting on Fitbit.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
They could have had this.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
If they would embrace online.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
If they would embrace smart phones.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Because where did Fitbit succeed?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Fitbit tapped into Facebook.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
It turned it into a game.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
It turned it into something you want to motivate your friends to do.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It was more of a robust experience.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
Where you have this website where you track your calories and get plans.

25:59.000 --> 26:05.000
If Nintendo would get out of their bunker and open up their eyes to online and the things you could do.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
They could have made everybody walks Fitbit.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
That's my point.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Was everybody walks third party?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I don't believe so.

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
Somebody can feel, can correct me.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
You're getting two games confused.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
There was one that was actually a fitness game that was, or fitness application that was on the DS.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
That was by Nintendo.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
Then there was this really shitty game that came out from Konami that was on the Wii.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Where you walked in place.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
I am not talking about the Konami game.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I am talking about the advanced game.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Do you remember what the name of that was?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
I can look it up. I don't remember.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
Nintendo Personal Trainer Walking.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Thank you.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
Personal Trainer Walking or whatever it was.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
You guys got the point of what I was talking about.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
Now the 3DS, they liked this idea so much they built it into the 3DS.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
I didn't know that on the original DS it actually came with an accessory to track that.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
I had no idea.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
See?

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
And the 3DS has this built in.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
But can you go, why do you carry the 3DS in your pocket?

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
You get coins because you want to get higher kiddies and find me, right?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Which is okay.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
That's a little bit of innovation.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
But it's still within the Nintendo bubble.

27:16.000 --> 27:22.000
Online leaderboards, motivation, cheering people on that can be pushed to people's 3DSs.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Just like it is with the Fitbit and the iPhone.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Nintendo could have that.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
They don't.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Now that the 3DS actually has the Nintendo network and that's a little bit more flexible.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
The horizon is broadening.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Nintendo seems more cooperative than competitive though.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Wow.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
You know what would be even better with Fitbit?

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
Is if you could mine Bitcoins by exercise.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
People have probably hacked the Fitbit to do that so I wouldn't put that out of the question.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
But anyway, I guess that was kind of the point I was trying to make.

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
Is that this isn't necessarily about Nintendo has to put Mario on the iPhone.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
But this is about Nintendo needs to be more aware with how they can work with some of these other technologies that are already out there.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
I don't know if somebody wants, maybe somebody wants to refute my point which is fine.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
Or add to something similar.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
I don't know, Jason?

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
I, obviously they attempted to do so.

28:14.000 --> 28:21.000
I keep glancing around Jamie's head and I'm staring at the lovely little Wii U gamepad chilling on your setup over there.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
They obviously tried to.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Oh, tablets are the next big thing.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
Let's give you a 4 inch screen that you can do, to their credit, very interesting things on.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
You have been playing, my recollection of it is that you have been playing NES Remix purely on the gamepad.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
And you had to switch it back to the TV only for the fact of me being able to actually see it.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
They're doing interesting things.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
All of them, no, not even by a long shot.

28:47.000 --> 28:53.000
But they're doing interesting things, they have new technology, they are working on improving it.

28:53.000 --> 29:00.000
The 3DS was improved to the point that it can access a reasonably modern network service.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
You know, something new was backported to an old system.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
They try.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Do they miss the mark?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Yes.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
Is that rooted in Japanese culture versus American culture?

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
I want to say yes, but I don't actually know, so maybe I shouldn't say that.

29:13.000 --> 29:24.000
But it's, it's not necessarily just a straight up gold mine because people have to know about it and understand it and be willing to make the investment to do it.

29:24.000 --> 29:31.000
I really, I really feel, I don't mean to bring the conversation back to me, but I really feel that my point still applies.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Nintendo has been doing the same thing all along.

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
They just had a nearly viral runaway hit, and they're trying to continue that forward, but it doesn't work that way.

29:40.000 --> 29:47.000
I want to point out, before we get the email saying, Rob, you forgot to talk about XYZ because I'm getting messages in chat and so forth,

29:47.000 --> 29:54.000
is that Wii Fit U actually does have this pedometer thing with it as well, and it's the big thing where you can actually go in and do that.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
I kind of think they're doing...

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
You mean syncing a 3DS to a Wii U and...

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
No, there's actually a little Wii Fit U pedometer.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Yet another accessory.

30:01.000 --> 30:09.000
That's the whole little thing, is that now Nintendo's, excuse me, but I feel Nintendo is trying to copy something they should have had in the first place.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
I feel like Nintendo's trying to copy the whole Fitbit thing, although that should have been theirs to own in the first place.

30:13.000 --> 30:20.000
But I kind of feel like, A, they're not doing a very good job selling it that way because I plain forgot until you guys started sending me messages about it,

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
which says a lot that I do a gaming enthusiast show, and I didn't, I totally forgot that that thing came with a pedometer.

30:26.000 --> 30:33.000
And B, I bet 10 to 1, the online experience with your Wii Fit U pedometer ain't anything like it is on Fitbit.

30:33.000 --> 30:41.000
Not to mention the fact that you have to boot up a console and boot up a game to be able to do anything with it, where the Fitbit phone plus computer just happens.

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
Bingo. What was the first big problem with Wii U as a whole that they had to fix? It was too fucking slow.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
And has that actually changed?

30:50.000 --> 30:57.000
Well, it's not as fast as it should be, but to be fair, PlayStation 4 isn't instant either, but it's a lot quicker.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
This is the same argument that we had with the handoff with Bobby about Netflix and Hulu versus On Demand in cable boxes.

31:04.000 --> 31:10.000
The interface and the implementation are just completely different and serve the same goal in two very different ways.

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
One of them is terrible, some people put up with it anyways, one of them, in our opinion, is not.

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
More comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Akuma JP says,

31:18.000 --> 31:25.000
Sky, big companies don't usually innovate. It's not that they didn't think about it, but it is the way big companies work.

31:25.000 --> 31:33.000
I have to tell you also, my friend, I have a friend that works in Nagoya, who was actually just complaining on Facebook today,

31:33.000 --> 31:46.000
that as much as companies need to innovate to grow, she's really disillusioned by the stagnant corporate cultures in Japan.

31:47.000 --> 31:59.000
That there is such an adverse, this is what I'm trying to think of, that generally change is looked upon as dangerous and will damage the business,

31:59.000 --> 32:09.000
when we've seen in practice that more companies that innovate tend to either be highly successful or suffer really badly for it.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
It's that level of risk.

32:12.000 --> 32:19.000
This is actually a very complimentary point. You cannot trust something new to maintain the level.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
Companies have to grow. If they want more, if they want to do more, they have to grow.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
They have to get more money, hire more staff, make more investments.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
And a big company cannot rest on redoing everything.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
So big companies cannot make these landslide changes to say,

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
well, we're done with this product because it's completely tapped out, let's come up with a new one.

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
It's not necessarily going to be successful. And then you're going to have to shutter 80% of your workforce and start all over again.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
But great things in gaming do come from risks. I mean, let's look at Guitar Hero.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Tell that to Halo 4.

32:51.000 --> 32:57.000
Well, here's the thing. With Guitar Hero, obviously part of our big history as music gamers, Konami should have had Guitar Hero.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
Konami was sitting on Guitar Hero. They didn't want to take the risk to put out in the US and get the license that they needed to make it successful.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
For the last six years, they've still barely done anything.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
They literally have made their game look better.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
Discounting Rock Revolution, as far as Guitar Freaks itself, they've had six years to do something with it.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
And as far as I've been able to tell, they literally haven't.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Activision ruined music games for a good long while.

33:18.000 --> 33:24.000
Activision pooped in the pool, and so it's going to take a while before music games.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
Like, where's Disney Fantasia evolved?

33:28.000 --> 33:34.000
Harmonix is waiting on it a little longer. It'll be out later this year when it can be distanced a little more from all the other music games.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Because Harmonix does make good stuff.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
Well, it seems to me that this is a danger in letting a company get too big.

33:40.000 --> 33:50.000
And having them become these all-encompassing giants where it stops being about the consumer market and becomes more about the bottom line.

33:50.000 --> 34:00.000
So that's why I think it goes back to why we're seeing a bigger surge in independent developers that are making the games that people actually want to play.

34:00.000 --> 34:08.000
You know, instead of, yeah, maybe they want to pool in enough revenue so that they can make the next big game or stay ahead of water or, you know, pay their bills.

34:08.000 --> 34:16.000
But when it becomes all about greed, then I think that it's time to cut them in half.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
I do want to get to our chat room for just a couple more comments.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
And I do want to try to wrap this conversation up because, again, we can spend all three hours on this point.

34:23.000 --> 34:29.000
I do invite, I know some of you are very passionate on this topic. Maybe you disagree with what we're saying and you want to send feedback.

34:29.000 --> 34:35.000
Please do. It is the show where every gamer has a voice. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

34:35.000 --> 34:40.000
I want to also get into a few chat comments here because there's one in particular I really want to respond to.

34:40.000 --> 34:50.000
Oh, here it is. Tiger Claw on chat says, Rob, what if Nintendo were to put out an app on the iPhone and Android that allows you to access the Miiverse like you do on your desktop browser?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.000
Exists.

34:51.000 --> 34:55.000
Well, it's coming. The Miiverse app, so to speak, is being made.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Miiverse is accessible on the web.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
It is accessible on the web and it does have a mobile-friendly site, so you can bring it up in the mobile phone.

35:03.000 --> 35:11.000
It's not all of the features of Miiverse by far, like the ability of the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, two. I bought this. Start downloading remotely.

35:11.000 --> 35:19.000
Here's the thing. Miiverse ain't going to fucking fix Nintendo. We need to get, I mean, Miiverse does do some neat things. It's neat.

35:19.000 --> 35:25.000
But it's not like, you know, I don't think that's the answer to Nintendo's problems.

35:26.000 --> 35:32.000
Here's the iPhone-Android app Nintendo should make. I'm going to throw a crazy idea out there. Take it or leave it.

35:32.000 --> 35:46.000
What's Nintendo big on? Nintendo's big on, you know, they resist online play because they want everybody to be in the same room and do the parties in the room and do, you know, playing with your friends in the same place.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Mario Party epitomized.

35:48.000 --> 36:01.000
Something like that. I think Nintendo should do an app that helps you organize Nintendo parties, which could include maybe unlock things that work in the Wii U games or, you know, some type of interaction there to make people really want to download it and check it out.

36:01.000 --> 36:17.000
But the real true functionality of the app is to like, oh, let me pull up my Facebook friends list and I'm going to have a Mario Party, Mario Kart 8 party on Friday at 8 o'clock and I want to invite these friends and it's going to send them a reminder, don't forget to bring your gamepad and all this stuff.

36:17.000 --> 36:31.000
Like, you know, you guys might think I'm crazy or whatever, but that, I kind of think that's the thing where Nintendo needs to go is new ideas that interact with the technology that's out there, not just Miiverse on your fucking phone.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
That invitation could include pictures of penises.

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
I was going to say two words. Pictochat pedophiles. Pictochat predators.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
I agree with you.

36:42.000 --> 36:51.000
Okay, but as my mobile phone as it is, Jason, I could open up my pants right now, take a picture of my penis and send it to you. I don't need an app to do that.

36:51.000 --> 37:03.000
People don't care. And that's not the point. The point is that something that is largely targeted towards kids or families that have kids is unfortunately a common factor of attack.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
I think if Snapchat can exist, Nintendo Party Planner can exist.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Parents don't open up Snapchat and give it to their kids.

37:10.000 --> 37:18.000
No, I think that's the problem right there. Is this console, once again, remember with the Wii and, well, I don't know so much the Wii but like the GameCube.

37:18.000 --> 37:25.000
At some point they decided, hey, you know what, we're getting the stigma of being like only a kid's console and that's it.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
We need to really broaden out and have some more hardcore games and stuff like that to get people interested.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
And that's what they promised, I think, with the Wii that ended up not happening. The Wii U.

37:34.000 --> 37:40.000
And I just don't see that. And that's the problem. There's still a stigma that this is a very kid-safe console.

37:40.000 --> 37:46.000
And they keep promoting that. But let's be honest. There's people that are dicks everywhere.

37:46.000 --> 37:53.000
And honestly, it comes with the territory that when you're playing online games with people, they're gonna be dicks.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
And guess what? Those dicks are kids.

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
Couple more comments here. Rama in chat says, what will fix the Wii U's sales? Decent fucking video games.

38:05.000 --> 38:12.000
Mario 3D World would like to say hello. As would Zelda Twilight Princess HD. As would Pikmin 3.

38:12.000 --> 38:18.000
That's awesome that they have first-party games. Where are the third-party games?

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
That's the problem with that comment. Nintendo doesn't need decent fucking video games. They have amazing fucking video games.

38:23.000 --> 38:30.000
They need more fucking video games. That's the real problem. They gotta figure out how to get those third parties back.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
And I really don't know what that is. I sorta think the online thing did a min.

38:37.000 --> 38:45.000
I really truly think EA jumped ship because Wii U could not whore online the way they needed it to be hoarded.

38:45.000 --> 38:52.000
I think that's 100% what it boils down to. Give me my tinfoil hat, please.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Numerous new titles that didn't have DLC on the Wii.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
Well, that and I think that they switched over to running their games all pretty much on the same engine and that engine just doesn't run on the Wii U.

39:01.000 --> 39:08.000
I mean, I think there's more politics involved with it, but it's not just EA that's not putting games on that system.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
There's plenty of other publishers who are just like, eh, nah.

39:11.000 --> 39:19.000
EA is still putting out pop-cap games like Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare on the Xbox 360. There's no reason that can't be on Wii U.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Kegel 2 is on Xbox One, guys!

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
There's no reason that can't be on Wii U.

39:23.000 --> 39:30.000
Can Battlefield 4 be on Wii U? No, but is EA withholding things intentionally from Wii U? Yes.

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
Alright, I think that's about it for now. We could go on and on with this forever.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
But I'm sure you guys have feedback.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. This is a very contentious topic.

39:45.000 --> 39:50.000
Quickly, before we get into our gaming ways and the types of things that we've been playing, let's go around the table real quick.

39:50.000 --> 39:55.000
What do you think, quickly, Nintendo can do to turn these numbers around?

39:55.000 --> 40:01.000
Because even the most hardcore Nintendo fanboy, it's really hard to sugarcoat what's happening with the Wii U.

40:01.000 --> 40:11.000
So, what do you think Nintendo can do to, I don't necessarily want to say to make Wii U's, but what can Nintendo do to have a more favorable report next year?

40:11.000 --> 40:22.000
I don't know. I really don't know. I can't see them doing anything new. So, I really don't have an idea.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
Jason?

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
Don't gauge Wii U expectations based off the Wii.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Loki?

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
They're going to need to drop the price of that big time. Big time.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
Because they just don't have the games to support it right now, so they can't promise more.

40:39.000 --> 40:48.000
Like, for example, I looked at, you know, the IGN ran a thing, I think it was IGN, that had like, you know, the games of 2014.

40:48.000 --> 40:58.000
And I gotta say, 90% of those games are TBA date games. Like, okay, Bayonetta 2, that should come out this year.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
Does it have a date yet? Nope. Does that mean it's going to come out this year?

41:04.000 --> 41:16.000
I hate to sound fanboy, but I honestly think this is the only way to save the Wii U, and I really think this is a cliche thing to say, but I really do think it's the answer.

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
Nintendo needs to drop the price of the Wii U to $149, and the way they're going to do it is they're going to cut the tablet.

41:23.000 --> 41:30.000
The tablet is now an accessory and not a mandatory device. You don't need that tablet to play Mario 3D World, which is still a great gaming experience.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
And a lot of people I talk to do.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.000
I still think that, I'm the exception, unfortunately, and these numbers prove it.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
I can agree with that.

41:39.000 --> 41:46.000
So, I mean, it would be great that the tablet is optional for those that want it. I think Nintendo should still push a bundle that has it all included.

41:46.000 --> 41:56.000
But they're going to, if they want to save the Wii U in particular, they're going to need to cut the tablet and really emphasize the, you know, $149 to really get these things moving.

41:56.000 --> 42:04.000
Throw in Mario 3D World if you have to for free. I know that might be a huge hit for Nintendo, but they don't have a lot of options right now.

42:04.000 --> 42:14.000
And the console could still flourish via Mario Kart 8, via Bayonetta 2, via Super Smash Brothers, via New Zelda.

42:14.000 --> 42:20.000
All these games, I kind of have a feeling, aren't going to need the tablet that much either, and will still work.

42:20.000 --> 42:25.000
Let the 3DS be a second screen if need be, you know, or whatever it takes.

42:25.000 --> 42:36.000
Here's the thing too, also with that, like you mentioned Smash Brothers, that's another problem with them too, is these games that are coming out, they're not necessarily just on the Wii U.

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
Like Smash Brothers, I don't need to buy a Wii U to have that game, I could get a 3DS.

42:41.000 --> 42:45.000
And I don't think that's helping.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Yeah, Jason, final thought on this.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
I'm still going to buy a Wii U this year.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
I've always meant to. I've always wanted to.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
I think it's an important thing to note, despite what you said earlier.

42:57.000 --> 43:03.000
I wasn't, nothing I said was deriding Nintendo. Not a single thing was anti-Nintendo.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
This is how I see what they've done with their console.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
I 100% plan on buying a Wii U, money permitting.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
That's the only reason I don't have one already.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
I wouldn't say I come from a place of anti-Nintendo either.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Neither of us were.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
But I get fucking frustrated with them sometimes.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
I get real fucking frustrated with them sometimes.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'll buy a Wii U.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
Rob, to go back to how you were saying there's games that EA could be putting on the Wii U

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
and one of those being Plants vs. Zombies.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
As I figured, Frost sprite 3 is what it uses.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That can't run on the Wii U.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
That's the same engine that runs Battlefield 4.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
But it's on the Xbox 360?

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
And it's on the Xbox 360.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Those engines can run on the Xbox 360, same with Ignite.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
But they can't run on the Wii U.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
It's so underpowered, it can't run those.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
And that's why you're going to see a lot of these games not coming.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
It could be that they're totally fine with porting it over,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
but they just don't have an engine that that game can run on

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
because it doesn't run on the system.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
It's not enough power.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
Even though they said that that thing was more powerful than the Xbox 360.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Get my tinfoil hat ready.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Get my tinfoil hat ready because, Loki, I'm going to be honest,

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
my reaction to that is that this is coming from EA.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
And I'm sure that Frostbite engine won't run on Wii U,

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
just like SimCity won't be an offline game.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Done and done.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
Very good.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
Let's get into our gaming weeks.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And we're going to talk about the types of video games

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
that we've been playing this week, no matter what engine they use.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
Since I spent most of this week ridiculously sick,

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
I haven't done a lot of gaming.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
I played Animal Crossing, which I even skipped.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
I skipped my first day of Animal Crossing, Rob,

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
when I was doing nothing but sleeping.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
And then I played a little Fractal.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
That's about it.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Oh, and I started Bioshock Infinite.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
Oh, what do you think of the Bioshock Infinite so far?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
It's so...

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
It's per day.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah, I love the environments.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
It's so great.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
Yeah.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Great little...

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
I'm pretty pleased so far.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
I just have to play in small increments

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
because I get emotion sick.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
So that's all I've done, mostly, like I said,

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
is just being sick and not, you know,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
having a lot of energy to sit up and play.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
I'm the opposite, because when I'm sick

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
is when I get my most gaming done.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
Well, usually if I'm sick, I'm fine to sit up and do stuff.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
You know, I'm really a push-through-it kind of person.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
But whatever it is that I have, or got over, I should say,

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Dan's got it now, has just been exhausting.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I'll sit up for a couple hours.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
I'll sleep four.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I'll be up another couple hours.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
I'll sleep another four.

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
And apparently other people who've had the same thing

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
have felt the same way I have.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
You know, I think Victoria and Bobby both have it.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Not Bobby Blackwell.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Other from Bobby.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
Yeah, Barbara.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Yeah.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
They were Disneyland sick.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
That was...

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
I hope they don't have an H1N1,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
which they say is that the flu strain

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
is going around right now.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
Is it?

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
Well, they talk about how they have the flu

46:13.000 --> 46:14.000
and how crappy they feel.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
I'm like, they probably have H1N1.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I didn't know that was going around again.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah, oh yeah.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Well, whatever it was that I had,

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I mean, well, keep in mind, when I had swine flu,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I only felt mildly sick too.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And sorry I gave it to you.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Yeah, I know, I know.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
But I mean, I just, you know,

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
didn't really feel much like playing anything.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
So I played my few things.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
I can understand.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Sleep is good when you're sick.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
All right.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.000
Let's go over...

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Sleep is good all the time.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.000
What are you talking about?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Let's go over to Jason.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
I want to check in with you again.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Which by the way, Jason,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
even though we promised we wouldn't talk a lot about football,

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
I think I do owe Jason the PSA of saying that,

46:50.000 --> 46:53.000
prepare for sad riots tonight because...

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
So says Bobby Blackwell.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Let's see what SSG100 Matt said.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
SSG100 Matt says,

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
so it's the Seattle Betty Whites versus the Denver Betty Whites

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
and the Betty White Bowl in two weeks.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Yes.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
And what's also very important is that...

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Featuring puppies.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
You have...

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
And lingerie.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
You have the Washington team and the Colorado team.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
The two states that legalized marijuana this season.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Going to the marijuana bowl.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
They're going to smoke the Super Bowl.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
They're going to smoke the Super Bowl.

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
In New Jersey where they're probably going to cause it to burn down.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
I sent a message to my coworker and said,

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
let me know if the bridge burns down and I won't be able to make it back in, please.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
Oh, that wouldn't happen in New Jersey because they'd just close it.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
So I checked out this game this week that...

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
It's kind of a godsim where you play a single character,

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
so maybe not so much a godsim,

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
where you're able to make goals at any point in time,

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
but then energy level and various other resources can determine

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
whether or not you'll actually be able to fulfill those goals.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
This is, by the way, a 100% lie.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Games like this don't exist.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
That was just my week.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Oh, yeah, I'm going to work on the video tonight.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.000
Oh, wait, it's 3 a.m. and I'm still at the office socializing with coworkers

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
that I don't usually see, oops, Tuesday, same thing.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Wednesday, same thing.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
Thursday, same thing.

48:09.000 --> 48:13.000
Needless to say, I literally played nothing this week.

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
You don't play anything to pass the time when things get really crazy?

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I don't have downtime.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
There were 15 people in from out of town this week,

48:21.000 --> 48:24.000
plus the fact that things are ramping up like normal,

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
like truly everybody's back from holidays and all that kind of stuff,

48:28.000 --> 48:34.000
and there is enough going on as part of my mission to do as much as possible

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
while I'm in the area in Cannes.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
I'm usually literally out with people constantly

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
and don't really know what they're doing.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
All right, all right, all I hear are excuses.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
I'm important and busy and I'm having fun.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
No, I killed like eight hours last night finishing off a video and uploading it.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
It's rather fun.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
All right, all right, they're here to hear about video games.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
Maybe Loki won't disappoint them with gaming week chat.

48:57.000 --> 49:00.000
No, I guess.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
So I played a lot of Minecraft this week

49:03.000 --> 49:06.000
because I've been tweaking stuff on our server

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
and setting up plug-ins and that kind of thing.

49:09.000 --> 49:14.000
So mainly I've been focusing on some of the Crackshot plug-ins,

49:14.000 --> 49:17.000
which Crackshot allows you to add guns to Minecraft

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
and make some really interesting ones.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
So I've been playing around with those. That's been kind of fun.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
And then, let's see, I played a little bit of,

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
it was some Flash game.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
I should say, not Flash, a Unity game called,

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
I want to say it was Catastrophe or something like that.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
It's a first-person cat game

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
where you're supposed to knock things off shelves onto the floor.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I heard of that. That sounds awesome.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome and the guy has,

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
it's kind of like a little demo for that and stuff.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
It's hilarious because all the graphics,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
it reminds me a lot of Katamari.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
They're very simple like that.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
And just the whole premise seems kind of silly

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
because that's what my cat does.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
And then I decided,

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
today I took Josh to Golfland

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
to go play some mini golf and stuff because he's never done that.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
And I saw DDR there and of course he wouldn't let me play DDR

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
because he got scared of the Terminator gun game that was there.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
Because he saw the Terminator on top of it

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
and I don't know, he got scared.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
So I ended up, right before the show,

50:25.000 --> 50:29.000
I drove down there and decided to play some DDR

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
on Max 2 and put in,

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
slipped on a card twice because hey,

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
I thought I was going to play a game of doubles

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
and you need to do that.

50:38.000 --> 50:41.000
But then they had the mode where

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
it only takes one credit to play two player or doubles.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
So I went ahead and did that and I found out it's four songs each.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
So I started off like, yeah, I can do this.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I'm going to pick something a little easier

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
because I know I'm a little out of shape.

50:53.000 --> 50:57.000
And then in the middle of my fourth song or whatever,

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
I swear my body was just pulling a Danny Glover saying,

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
you're getting too old for this.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
I'm like, shut up, I'm going to play another set of songs.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
About song three, I'm like, fuck this,

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
I don't want to play this anymore.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
And then so the last one,

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
the last song, I was like,

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
oh yeah, I'm still going to play the last song.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
I was like, I can't do this, my feet won't move.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
So I had to hobble back out to my car afterwards.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
It's funny though because I was like,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
oh, I totally want to play DDR and after I was done,

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
I was like, I don't want to play DDR anymore.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
But I don't know.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
So that was that.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Did the state of the arcade

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
lead you to great sadness outside of DDR?

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Honestly, the machine is working.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
It's super loud.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
I mean, holy crap, it's loud.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
I wanted to have Josh try it

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
and he was afraid of it because it was too loud.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It was just like screaming ear.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
There was a Disney rave there,

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
but it's turned off.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
So I guess it's broken.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
It didn't seem like it was in that bad of shape.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
The pads seem to be working just fine.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
It's amazing that those games

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
still make money all these years later.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Well, they have it marked down.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
It's four songs, three doubles,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
for 50 cents.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
Still, I mean, it's a great moneymaker for the arcade.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Those machines have paid for themselves

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
five times over by now, I'm sure.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Probably, yeah.

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
All right. Well, if that's it for your gaming week,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I will quickly touch on my gaming week,

52:25.000 --> 52:28.000
which I don't actually have a whole lot of new stuff to share,

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
just a couple games.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
Of course, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
way too much of it,

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
and continuing to play some stuff on the PlayStation 4,

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
like Don't Starve,

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
which I continue to actually play a little bit on the PC this week

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
because Loki gifted me that copy some time ago,

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
which that version is...

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
It's pretty much the same thing on PlayStation 4,

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
but I was finding some slightly different stuff in it,

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
and it just has the different feel with the controller,

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
or with the keyboard,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
as opposed to the controller and mouse and so forth.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
But I will say this,

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
because I was a little harsh on Don't Starve last week

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
because of the fact that it doesn't have a tutorial mode,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
and it doesn't really give you much...

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
It doesn't really tell you, like,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
how to go about playing the game at all,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
which I understand was a design choice,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
but I just get really frustrated with games like that.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
But I will say this,

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
after kind of figuring it out,

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
and watching more YouTubes,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
and reading some FAQs on it and so forth,

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I kind of went back now that I understand the game a little more,

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
and I'm actually having a lot more fun with it,

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
now that I kind of understand,

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
oh, okay, you gotta gather all this stuff

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
so you can try to start to make a little base,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
and this is how you can get your food and so forth.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
So it just...

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It actually enhanced it a little bit,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
of hand-holding you just a little bit,

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
because I think it did make it more fun and exciting,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
although some will disagree with me there, and that's fine,

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
I just feel like I almost missed out on this game.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
If I hadn't really gone to the PlayStation 4 live channel

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
and watched some other people play,

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
I don't think I would have kept going with it.

53:54.000 --> 53:57.000
But now I'm glad I did, because I'm enjoying the game.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
One other new game that I checked out this week,

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
because I decided to catch up on my Steam backlog a little bit,

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
so I bought a game during the sale,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I hadn't checked out, but I decided to check it out this week,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
and that game is Guacamelee,

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
which is a game that's...

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Melee.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
I like Guacamelee, but fine, Guacamelee.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
You can...

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
This game is kind of like a Super Metroid-esque type of game,

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
where you have the exploration and so forth,

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
but it has more beat-em-up style mechanics in it,

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
like I don't want to say it's like Double Dragon or something like that,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
but I don't exactly remember Samus

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
kind of doing combos on people and uppercuts and all this stuff either,

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
so it's a very different type of feel, a game, when you're playing it.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
But I gotta say, it's fucking great.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
It is a fucking great game.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I am really, really enjoying the game.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Obviously, I love me some Super Metroid,

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
but it's not even just that.

54:47.000 --> 54:52.000
I mean, yeah, that's a great skeleton for your game or whatever,

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
but I just love doing the combos

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
and actually being able to throw guys and other guys and all this.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Some of the puzzle mechanics get very interesting, too,

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
with the whole light world and the dark world

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
and constantly flipping back and forth between the two.

55:06.000 --> 55:11.000
And I love the references, constant funny references,

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
to internet memes and other video games.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
They are all over the place, and they're really funny,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
and there's been so many that I've had to go,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
oh, my God, Alan, look at this, look at this.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
This is a riff on the oh, really, yeah, really, owl

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
from like ten years ago.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Or a walrus.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
A walrus in his bucket.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
No, I have not seen a walrus in his bucket yet,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
but I wasn't really looking out for it either.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
But I did see the Super Hermanos

55:37.000 --> 55:40.000
with the red suit and the green suit,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
kind of a riff on that.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And then in one of the backgrounds,

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
you can just very faintly see a Mega Man

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
cut out in the bricks.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
There's just little references like that.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
And they're not shy about it either

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
because you get your power-ups from,

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
I think they call them chorizo statues.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
They call them a different name,

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
and it's just really funny.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
But they look like they do in Metroid.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
They don't even try.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
But I love that. I love it.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
And I know the game is really big

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
with speedrunners right now,

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
and I know it's going to come to PlayStation 4

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
at some point, and I'm really excited

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
because I love how the game is loud and vibrant,

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
the music's great, it's fast-paced,

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
and it's a Super Metroid clone on top of all that.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
Honest to God, this is a great example

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
of why I can't ever, at the end of 2013,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
say, here's the best video games that came out in 2013

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
because I just don't have time to play them all,

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
because if I had played this before December,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
I would have put this in my top ten for sure.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
This says PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Spring this year.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Yes, it is going to come out in some way.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
Should you do a music game called Guaka Yooka-Laylee?

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
You never know.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I don't know if there's going to be DLC expansion,

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
but supposedly these other versions on PlayStation 4

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
and Xbox One are supposed to be expanded.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
So yeah, the game is an awful lot of fun.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
I really...

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Rageinator, your joke completely fails

56:56.000 --> 56:59.000
because Melee is fighting.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
Um, 13 cross forever in our chat says,

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Rob, you should try Mutant Blobs Attack.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
I'll just have to put that on the list.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Tech2030 says, some intense platforming in that game.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Let's see.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
That's actually an L.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Oh, ActDeft. Ooh, I love this.

57:16.000 --> 57:19.000
ActDeft says, if we're saying it in Spanish, Rob is correct.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Guaka Mealy.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Melee isn't the...

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
Really?

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
I will trust what the Mexican listener of OLR says.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
But it's a play on...

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
It's a portmanteau of Guaka Mealy and Melee.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
What is the etymology of Melee?

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
What is that language rooted in?

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
I'll find out. I think it's Latin.

57:37.000 --> 57:41.000
And Tigerclaw says, of course, since the game is inspired by Mexican culture.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
And I gotta say, it's great.

57:44.000 --> 57:50.000
Like, I love the environment and the way...

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
It's played off so well.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
Just between the amazing soundtrack and the characters.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
And the way they taught...

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
And you can see a lot of the inspiration from the culture as well.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
It's great.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
I mean, it's... Yeah.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
I know I'm speaking very highly of this game, but it's for good reason.

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
It was old French, actually.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
The word was melee.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
But it was French.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Also, it does have a co-op mode, apparently.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Haven't even touched it yet.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
But that just even kind of enhances the game.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Stream it! Stream it!

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
I probably will at some point.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
I was going to, but another program was on when I was playing it.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
So I didn't want to...

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
I don't like to broadcast at the same time as other bog shows.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Alright.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I lied. I did play stuff this week.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
What did you play?

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
I don't remember...

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
I knew it.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
I don't remember if I covered this when I was talking about the Xbox One last week.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
I was showing a coworker that only has a PS4, the Xbox One.

58:44.000 --> 58:53.000
I tried playing Forza and some very strange bugs started happening where we played one race and then could literally never play another one.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
Because whenever they pressed start, it would take us back to the main menu screen.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
And I played a four-person match of FIFA with other coworkers.

59:01.000 --> 59:08.000
And it was fine, if not ridiculously confusing, because the camera cannot adjust for four people that well.

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
But yeah, more Xbox One stuff, being able to introduce more people to it and see their reactions to it.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
More hilarity with testing out the Kinect and that kind of stuff.

59:18.000 --> 59:29.000
More equivalent frustration when I realized that you cannot create an account on the Xbox One without binding it to a Microsoft account.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
A Windows Live account, whatever the principle one is nowadays.

59:32.000 --> 59:38.000
You cannot have... I assume you can have essentially silver accounts, whatever they're calling it now.

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
But it has to be signed on, authenticated, registered via Microsoft's authentication service.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.000
Or a guest of another profile that is on the system.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
But no local system accounts.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
But yeah, just those two.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
Gaming-wise, nothing new. Just a couple rounds with new people.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Also, being reminded of one other game I did play a little bit this week.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Code Man just joined our chatroom at live.fognetwork.com saying,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Rob, someone killed someone in your Minecraft sex dungeon.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Y'all need to stay the fuck out of my house on Minecraft.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Can I get an alarm installed in my house? Get out of my house!

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
That'd be a pretty cool mod, actually.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Unless I consensually invite you into the sex dungeon.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Stay out!

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
You can do that, actually.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Can I? I'm gonna put a...

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
We have World Guard on there.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
You can block people from entering.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I need to think about that.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
No, I don't mind the little jokes and things like that.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
But let me have some creativity, too, people.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
But actually, I will say this.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Here's what I've loved on the Minecraft vog server.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I've actually gone in and I've played.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
So not only did they build that giant Normandy in front of your house, which is hilarious.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Somebody put, and I think this is Loki, put a giant penguin near my house.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I don't mind if you build stuff near my house, because the penguin actually cracked me up.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Because I was like, what the hell is this thing inside the penguin?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
And Loki says, you put something on there and you pull the lever and it shoots it at its butt.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Yeah.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
And I'm like, that's fucking amazing!

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I gotta check that out.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And then I think it was Codeman or somebody built a giant moogle riding a chocobo behind my house.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
So that's great, too.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Lots of awesome creativity on the Minecraft server.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I do have an odd question, though.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Can you incorporate other maps people have built into an existing map?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I don't think so, unless there's like a third-party copy-paste type of thing.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
There is a third-party copy-paste thing.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You can load schematic files, which is how I created the Normandy and also the penguin.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Because I found a complete ocarina of time that someone built with all the buildings and the rooms and everything perfect.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I think that would be just really large.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000
A lot of times what they do with other maps and stuff is they'll have a hub part in a server,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000
and then they'll be running multiverse, but they'll have multiple servers with rooms that go to different things.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
They'll have a pixel art room and all sorts of stuff like that.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So we could do that. I just don't know how much the server could really run.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I mean, it's meant to run up to 20 people at a time. We never get close to that, so maybe.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Right.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
But I will say this. The creativity on the Minecraft server is pretty amazing.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
That roller coaster, I don't know if that was you that built that, Loki.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
That was awesome.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Yeah.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I sat in that and took a ride in that.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Except I had to put some extra minecarts on the track because they all got stuck in one part, but whatever.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, I fixed that earlier.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:37.000
There was a plugin that had, it's called Craftbook, that had some stuff messed up where different blocks do different things to minecarts.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And so I had to disable all that.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Because I remember when I built the coaster the first time, I ran that same problem.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And I'm like, why is it not working?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
I'm like, I know it's a plugin that's doing this.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
And so I went into Craftbook and I'm like, oh, there it is.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
So yeah, it should work now.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Awesome.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Is there a way to switch the perspective?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Because one time I was riding in the coaster and all I could see, like half of my screen was the cart.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Is there a way to?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's a glitch, but yeah, you can change the perspective of your character.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I don't remember what it's set to.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Check that out.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Because I do mine through a gamepad.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
I don't remember.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I'll look it up. I'll figure it out.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
I do want to give props though, because I believe the Netherworld, I was very impressed with that as well.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And the whole transportation hub that's built under there.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
And I think a lot of that was hitstun, right?

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Yeah, that's pretty much all of him.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Dude, I'm pretty impressed with that little elaborate system that you built there.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That was something else to go in there and see that too.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
So at some point I'll do a livestream from the VoG server for those of you that don't own Minecraft.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Just so you can see the creativity of the people on there.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
But that was a lot of fun.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
If you want to join the Minecraft server at VoG network, check that out in the forums over at VoGnetwork.com.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
It's almost always in the five recent posts thing on the very front page.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
So just check that out.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It is a whitelist server, because we don't want jerks coming in and ruining things.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
We want people that we kind of know who they are in case they try to destroy things.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Or fuck with my house.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
You can find that all at VoGnetwork.com in the forums.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
But we're welcoming of any VoG participant who wants to check that out.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Alright, we gotta move on to some news.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
We're running a little behind, but that's okay because we had some good discussions so far.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Someone starts her first day of work tomorrow.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I know, right?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So let's quickly do housekeeping.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Twitter.com slash OLRs where you can follow us on Twitter.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
We're also on Facebook.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
We will still be here next week and so on.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I can't think of any shows we have off coming up.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
So I think everything is still on track.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
We'll let you know though if something comes up.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Sure.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
YouTube.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
The YouTube is definitely worth plugging.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Tell the listeners what they can see in last week's episode.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
You can see epic dog editing when we were talking about release dates last week.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:01.000
There was some kind of a shoot-em-up looking game with a big Shiba Inu like dog meme.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And we were imitating dog meme and I had a hell of a fun time doing that in video.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Oh, I got to check that out.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Very well.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Much edit.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Such editing.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Much learning.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Now I can do it all over again.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Wow.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
All right.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Whatupgnchat says, OLR doing the Super Bowl.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Yeah.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Why wouldn't we?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I don't remember the last time I watched the Super Bowl.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Ooh.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Oh, Jesus.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Is that next week?

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
No, that's the second.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
February 2nd.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Oh, great.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I...

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Oh, damn.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
You may end up missing your last show.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
I might.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Because I was just talking to my coworkers today saying, Super Bowl party!

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Hey, I completely understand, you know, taking time off, you know, for a Puppy Bowl.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Yeah, I was going to say, I'll watch the Puppy Bowl in the morning.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Did you know that they posted the lineup for the Puppy Bowl in the Kitty Halftime?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Yes, I'm so excited.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
No, there's penguin cheerleaders now.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Oh, what?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yes.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Oh, this year they're sparing no expense at the Puppy Bowl this year.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I'm excited about the Puppy Bowl.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
By the way, did you do...

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Okay, I have to say this.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Did you see the labra husky?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
There is a dog, and for me, okay, keep in mind, I'm super allergic to labs and huskies.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
However, I would have this dog in an instant and live on Benadryl.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Imagine a cute little lab, but the shape of a lab with pure white, you know, like a husky,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
and the little black markings, and those eyes.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000
A labra husky.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Did you hear who they got for the Halftime Music Show?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Who?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Keyboard Cat.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Keyboard motherfucking Cat is on that show.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Yes, I heard that.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Yeah, Keyboard Cat's doing the Halftime Show.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
The reincarnation?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Yeah, because original Keyboard Cat's kind of dead, because that video was from the 80s.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Yeah.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But, um...

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Seriously?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Is it Pistachio Keyboard Cat?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It's like a new Keyboard Cat or something.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Oh my god, I didn't know that.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I knew that Cat wasn't alive.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
That video was from the 80s, yeah.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Oh my god.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
It's like America's Funniest Home Videos or something.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
News!

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Yes, please.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
I could talk about Keyboard Cat all night, but let's get into it.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Alright, so Valve, of course, they had their Dev Days this week, and no one was allowed

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
to talk about Dev Days.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
But people did talk about Dev Days, and some of the things that came out from tweets and

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
all sorts of stuff.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:19.000
That, of course, and this is kind of a big duh, that Valve wants to offer digital music

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
video and TV as part of SteamOS.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
In other words, I'm guessing they want to implement music streaming services and movie

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
streaming services, Netflix, Hulu, that kind of stuff.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It makes sense.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I mean, most game consoles nowadays have something like that, if not all of those services.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:46.000
So, I would be fine with that on SteamBox as well, even if it's not necessarily part

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
of SteamOS, just on Steam.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
That would be fantastic, because then I would be able to get rid of our crappy boxy.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
This is kind of interesting, because it's not a surprise, especially considering Steam

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:01.000
already sells desktop apps, this is not one bit of a surprise that this exists.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And Canonical, the company, the for-profit company behind Ubuntu, has done much the same

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
thing.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Cloud storage and music and videos and any other licensing deals that they can get their

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
hands on, I'm assuming in addition to also promoting copyleft things like Jamendo and

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:29.000
other non-all rights reserved copyrighted materials.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000
It is interesting to me, as far as I know, Steam is a couple hundred employees, maybe,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:41.000
but when you scale to this size, when you support an OS and sign deals and post this

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
kind of stuff, their company size is going to triple.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
If SteamOS goes somewhere, their company is going to grow by at least three to four

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
times.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Just the sheer volume of dealing with publishers and anybody else that they start doing business

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
deals with.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Great, another system for me to have Netflix on.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Yeah, tell me about it.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Well, at least we wouldn't get, at least on Hulu, we wouldn't get those messages saying,

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
sir, you can only watch this on the web.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Fuckers, I wanted to watch the end of fucking 30 Rock.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:25.000
That's very true, Steam is intending to be, I assume, very much the antithesis of that.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
We'll see.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundromatia with fognetwork.com,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
use the pass phrase, beast.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
One of the things that maybe I'll be able to watch on my new Netflix Steam box will

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
be the Magic the Gathering movie.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
That's right, Magic the Gathering is apparently going to be adapted into a movie.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I thought this was supposed to happen some time ago, but I guess, I don't know, I guess

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
this has got some motion with it.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
20th Century Fox has acquired the screen rights to Magic the Gathering.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.000
The film studio wants the 20-year-old series of Magic the Gathering to become a mega franchise,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.000
you know, like Lord of the Rings, which took one book and made it three movies, or three

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
books and three movies, or Harry Potter, which turned seven books into eight movies.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
If you can adapt, you know, Battleship into a movie.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Well, I thought that's where I had heard this before, because I want to say, when they licensed,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
like, didn't they license Battleship and, like, Clue?

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Oh god, Candyland with motherfucking Adam Sandler.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Oh, that's gonna be fucking terrible.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Ew.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
And, like, the Monopoly and, like, a bunch of other stupid shit.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Clue?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Clue, but not to be confused with the greatest movie of all time, The Clue from the 1980s.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
It was not a remake of that, it was something, it would have been worse.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
You can't get better than Clue from the 1980s.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm not even, we're not even pretend that they're even remotely related to that.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
The math is simple. The math is simple. One plus one plus two plus one.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Flames, the side of my face.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I can't do it because I can't do the voice.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Heaving, heaving breaths, heaving.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
I can do it.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I miss you, Madeline Kahn.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I know, I miss her so much. Alright, anyway, and Eileen Brennan, let us not forget you.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
But, you know, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Alright, moving on.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Different movie, but still.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Sorry, Magic the Gathering.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So, we don't know much, I mean, there's no director attached or anything like that.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
This is just something that they are working on.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
It's going to be made into a movie at some point.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
But, you know, video game movies don't always exactly have the greatest track records.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
We'll see how that Warcraft movie turns out.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
It's time to rip off.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
What?

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Because it was a card game turned into a multimedia Digimon.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
I don't know. I mean, the good news is it's not like the movie is going to be about people busting out cards.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Like, that's not how it's going to work.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
That's what you think.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Maybe it will.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.000
The Battleship the movie incorporated a huge gigantic feature that pushed on a certain square of water and then a torpedo...

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Did it have Liam Neeson saying, you suck my battleship?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Maybe.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Because if it didn't have that, then fuck that movie.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
It didn't fucking see that movie.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000
It had the pegs. The pegs were in the movie. That was the best part about it.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Are you serious?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Seriously, it's in the trailer.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I'm now equally motivated to see this movie and stay far, far away.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
There's no interest in Battleship unless it has Liam Neeson saying, you suck my battleship.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You know what the advantage now of having rough voices as I can make my favorite complaint about everything.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Her dismissive voice.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
All right then, Dar Sacher, if you have some better news for us, why don't you go right ahead?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
For the record, Xanadu is a better movie.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
If you want to talk about good, bad movies.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Well, at the start of the show, we talked about how the Nintendo was said to have flopped and they lied.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Or I should say Nintendo, the Wii U had flopped.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And it's a very big thing usually in light of fiscal underperformance that a CEO will be pushed into resigning.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Or may resign on his own.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000
However, Satoru Iwata said that he's not going to resign.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.000
The direct quote says there will be no major management shake up in the short term.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.000
He does say that he feels responsible and that it is important to get business going back again.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And another thing too that people aren't seeming to mention is that Nintendo went from having a 200 plus billion yen projection.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.000
To operating at a 35 billion yen loss for the upcoming year.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I think they honestly can make it back.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
But he says he's not going to step down.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Good thing they're sitting on piles of money.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
I know, right?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But I mean, they've still got the 3DS. It's still performing incredibly strongly in Japan.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
It's still performing decently in America and around the world.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
It's still printing money.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
So I don't think that they're going to be...

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
He has no reason to step down.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000
He hasn't ruined Nintendo, you know, with the release of the Wii U.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Yeah, all those damn pundits have ruined the Wii U.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Well, now that you go there, I go, see, this is why Nintendo is not going to come out and say that a console of theirs flopped.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Because their president isn't going anywhere and he's very stubborn.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000
And that's okay. I don't necessarily blame Iwata for this.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
But I do think, and I'm a little hopeful in what I'm hearing here, that they talk about a management shakeup.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I don't think that means that Reggie's going to get fired or something stupid like that.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
The crap did Reggie have to do with any of it? He's been the big cheerleader.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Well, because you know in an internet comment section somewhere, that's what they're saying on NeoGaf or some shit.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:15:01.000
But anyway, what I really want to say about that is that maybe the good news that comes out of this as they talk management shakeup is that they'll hire someone from the outside.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:09.000
And now that's how the bubble gets broken. If somebody comes in with some fresh perspectives, that could be a very, very good thing.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:17.000
It does seem that Nintendo is very insular and that usually if they bring somebody in, they have to eventually, you know, tow the Nintendo line.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
It's like their own special form of cultism, you know.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Can you imagine, sorry to add to the wank, but I can't resist.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Wait, I have to do it.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It's a gaming fan podcast. I have to.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I'm doing the wank motion.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
All right, here we go.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Can you imagine if Nintendo had hired Don Mattrick?

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Fuck.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I mean, but I could see a type of Nintendo coup along those lines, not necessarily him, but along those lines.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I could see them trying to lure over a big executive from some other company to...

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
That's just not the...

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Tigerclaw, I don't think Iwata is going to be replaced by Miyamoto.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
I mean, I don't think that it would happen and I don't think Miyamoto is...

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I don't think Miyamoto wants to be that guy.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
I think Miyamoto is more of a creative type than a business type.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Miyamoto wants to make games.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Exactly. He's living his dream.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000
He does that very well being that face of creativity.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Like when you see Miyamoto, like genuinely excited about one of his games, you can't help but be excited too.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:32.000
No matter what you think about Nintendo, I think it's hard to argue that Miyamoto's enthusiasm is fucking infectious and Microsoft and Sony don't have that.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
They don't have Miyamoto.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.000
That's the thing that I think keeps Nintendo strong is the fact that they have people who are passionate about what they do.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Who love their jobs and want to keep doing the best that they can.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I really do like that they adhere to an ideal.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Because you don't really see a whole lot of that.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
I mean, you certainly don't see it so much with...

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You really don't see it at all with Microsoft.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Unless, you know, you're counting individual developers or a few people here and there.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
For the most part, it's just towing their corporate line.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Sony is a lot the same way too.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Nintendo, you've got people who are enthusiastic about what they're doing and love what they do.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:21.000
And I honestly would even think that the underperformance of the Wii U would be taken as a personal disappointment.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I mean, certainly the fiscal standpoint is going to have something to do with it.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000
But I think just from, oh, we love this thing and no one else loves it.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Like, when you have the ugliest baby in the world and you love it, but everyone else thinks you just have an ugly baby.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I hate to use that.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
What a strange analogy, but okay.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But you get what I mean.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I do.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I mean, the system's only been out for a year.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
I don't really think it's a failure yet.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
And it could grow out of being ugly.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Babies grow.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Did I just hear Loki defend the Wii U?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
He does it once in a while.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Nintendo was the prettiest girl at the whole ball last console generation.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Let's not forget.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Well, and here's the other thing.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:09.000
And I want to put people, you know, this just goes back to bringing up what if Iwata was replaced by Miyamoto.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Imagine that you were living your dream job.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
You got to make games.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
This is what your passion was.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Or, okay, it would go the same thing if they said, what if they made Koji Kondo CEO.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
He's a musician.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
What he does is make music.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000
He develops the music and controls that part of whatever game environment he's working in.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.000
I think we need to get the guy that was doing the drumming as part of that stage demonstration for Wii music.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
That guy, he has a good future at Nintendo.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Well, my point is, if you try to offer that job to any of those guys, they'd probably turn it down right away and say, get someone who's a businessman to run the business.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Let's see, Fifth Dream says Nintendo's ugly baby is Mario.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Mario's not ugly. He's just plain.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Let's see, Rama in chat says, Loki defends the Wii U. Take a shot.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And then, of course, there's some wank in our chat about who they should hire and so forth.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Thank you for posting my favorite Mario fan art ever.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Uh oh, who posted it? Akuma JP?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I love you, Akuma-san.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It's a radio show. You're not supposed to be sending the artwork.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
No, it's one of the super buff Mario with the giant shroom.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It's Super Mario Bear, if you know what I mean. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Yeah.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
I did it.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Well, you've been in San Francisco for how long now?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
I'll do it. I'll just bring the Wii U around.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
He doesn't look Italian with expression.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I can do it.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It looks like Zangief costs playing Mario.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Here you go.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Alright, let's move on. Loki, what do you have?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Like I said, I'll take care of this. I can bring the Wii U back.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It's all up to me.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
What would you do, Loki?

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
What would I do? Well, what wouldn't I do?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
First off, you know, I put out some really kick-ass games on that system.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
You know, we need a new Metroid and fuck, we're getting F-Zero this year.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I would just lower the price and actually make online decent.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:18.000
All the OLR dream games, such as things like President Cat, Puzzle Sluts, all of them would be a reality.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
What, they play Snap? Definitely.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Awesome. Alright.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:36.000
So Apple has to settle with the Federal Trade Commission and now they have to pay out millions of dollars, 32 million dollars to be exact.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:48.000
And that whole in-app purchase suit where people, you know, apparently were unlocking their system for like 15 minutes or something and their kids were racking up tons of charges.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Which basically, I don't know. I mean, I think it's a little ridiculous because people need to be a little bit more responsible.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:09.000
But I understand at the same time, app developers are kind of making it very easy for people to rack up those huge numbers in in-app purchases.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:18.000
And I know that they've kind of tweaked that now where it fixes that, but it's still kind of annoying that it kind of turned out that way.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:30.000
But yeah, so apparently they're saying there's some people that spent thousands of dollars of, you know, their parents' money on games. Free to play games.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
All those damn Smurf Berries.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I do like that they make it very clear now though.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And the Angry Bird Eagles.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Loki's right though. The changes are for the better.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Well, I think at one point, you know, they probably were making it so it's easy for you to make in-app purchases and they didn't really intend for people to do that.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:58.000
But then they probably heard about all these stories about people racking up those things and then they made it even easier for kids to make those purchases.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:06.000
But at the same time, I think there's a little bit of, you know, the parents not taking responsibility for their kids using their account and stuff.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I have to blame the parents a little bit, but apparently no one wants to blame the parents, so.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Going to the chatroom, because this is a really good point from our pal Segg over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Segg says, the problem with in-app is that once you sign in for one purchase, you're not asked for a password for 15 minutes after.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000
And on Google Play Android, it's 30 minutes.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So it's honest for a parent to go, oh, okay, I'll pay 99 cent for my kid and then $2,000 later, dot, dot, dot.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Yeah, that's a really good point. I didn't realize it did that.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
I like to prevent me. I'm the big kid I've got to prevent.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
So I like to be asked, like, are you sure you want to spend this money?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:54.000
So I don't like accidentally do something that's going to, you know, spend money or something if I, you know, have a moment where I forget to read something or whatever it is.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
You know, I just I like having that extra safeguard in there.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
So I didn't even realize it shuts off after 15 minutes.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000
That's not or doesn't shut off until 15 minutes. That's not good. That's not good.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000
All right. Let's move on anyhow with some more news. Jason.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Going back to episodes to Miss Dark Soccer's classic game of the week trend of featuring games that you may never have seen, whose characters have cameos in Namco High.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
She taught us about a little game called Wonder Momo.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I had indeed never heard of this before. We sat around watching the video available at YouTube dot com slash Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:42.000
But Namco Bandai has launched a Wonder Momo teaser site at Wonder Momo dot JP.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
It is literally a site with a silhouette of Momo in her Wonder Momo outfit.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And I really don't want to use a culturally incorrect picture.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
It's a silhouette. So you just see, like, her helmet and whatnot. That's all you get.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
There are other accents in the silhouette, of course, but nothing quite that detailed.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And then characters at the bottom, which represent the audience, I believe, unless it's the creature she was fighting.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000
No, it's pretty much similar to the audience heads.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Yes. The site literally features, as of this moment, features a splash that says Momo is back.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:29.000
There has been a Wonder Momo comic that Jamie also talked about during that classic game of the week segment.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
And we have no and this game never made it to America.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So, and again, it is also Wonder Momo dot JP, which announces some pretty specific intentions.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:53.000
We don't know when it's going to come out, if it's going to be a port revival, new game, new media, as seems to be the case between Namco High and, again, this webcomic for Wonder Momo specifically.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Speculation is hugely up in the air, but a series from the 80s is on its way back in a prominent form, and it seems to be gathering a lot of attention and buzz.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
And that can't possibly be a bad thing. Seriously.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Wonder Momo is a cute game.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
It is. It was very fun watching that.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Even with gratuitous panty shots.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
All of like six pixels, though? Let's be honest here.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
You know they'll look for the fan service wherever they can get it.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Yes. And back in those days, well, maybe not so much in Japan.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Aren't there other games, not counting Namco High itself, aren't there other games that have had other characters whose games have had similar reboots in the last couple of months?

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Or am I just making stuff up?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
I'm probably just making stuff up and thinking of Namco High itself.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000
There's plenty I'd like to see.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Yeah.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Well, and what I didn't realize that the whole Namco High thing is that all the characters that they've brought in are, they have in their webcomic series from Shifty Look.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Which is also where this Wonder Momo webcomic is from.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Exactly.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
So it's very much two-part.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And it will be nice to see how this continues and what prominence they decide to feature with Wonder Momo and many other characters.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Well, I would definitely, I would like to see either a remake or like an actual sequel or something.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
It was a fun little game. I've played it.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Even Viewtiful Joe had the kind of implied with an audience motif and certainly there were some possibilities for Wonder Momo as well.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000
You can even say that Super Mario World was set on the stage.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
That just short-circuited my brain.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Super Mario Brothers 3 had that literal stage where they had the curtain that raised in the very beginning of the game. Remember that?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Exactly. But there's actually a whole, I think, the first thing is, I kind of thought about it before and it had been mentioned before, but Game Theory, which is one of the YouTubes that I like,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:03.000
even went into detail about how they're all set on the stage, how everything is done up like, not Mario World, it was Mario 3, thank you Rob, I'm sorry.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And how they're all on a platform and you can go behind the scenes to walk behind the scenery and then when you get to the end of the level, you're going backstage.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yeah, they're all kind of curtain-y, transition-y, exit, exit, stage left, stage right, technically stage left because it's one stage, but yeah.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I never really gave that design a lot of consideration.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.000
And it was 3 I was thinking of, but World had some of the same things incorporated in it.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Interesting. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that will be coming a little sooner than any other remake that we're talking about tonight.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Loki, is there anything for the US yet?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Not this week. 28th is the first step we get this month and then we'll be getting regular releases each week.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Alright, then give me a minute here, we'll travel to Japan and check out the releases there. Still no PlayStation 4 or Xbox One out in Japan, so there's no releases to read there.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:07.000
What is it, February 22nd I believe is the big day for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Do we have a date for Xbox One in Japan? I don't think we do.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Yeah, I don't think they've announced anything.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:22.000
It's still TBA. Well, meanwhile, you have some other things to look forward to, such as on the 24th we have, I'm sorry, the 23rd of this month we have on the PlayStation 3 Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel gets a price reduction.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Saints Row 4 also gets a Ultra Super Ultimate Deluxe Edition out in Japan. As far as new games go, you get Sengoku Basara 4 comes out from Capcom this week, that is finally out.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:42.000
And I believe there is some special bundles and things that go with that as well, because, you know, who doesn't love bundles? Like limited editions and things like that.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:51.000
On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, just that same Saints Row 4 and then also Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z, which I believe is also on the PlayStation 3 as well.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:54.000
You love your Dragon Ball games, don't you?

01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I've been getting a little nostalgic lately just because, yeah, I really am nostalgic for some Dragon Ball Z.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Well, you could get it on the PlayStation Vita as well. It's also out there this week as well as the Sega game named Utagumi 575 comes out in regular and limited edition this week on the Vita.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And I'm kind of like, what is this? It says it's a new genre ground. It takes literary sensibilities and mixes it with popular Japanese music.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:26.000
The haiku, a Japanese poetic form that follows the strict rule of three lines following 575 syllables.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
I know, it's like they read my mind tonight. Per line, a new style of gameplay is invented.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Instead of the formulaic approach of only matching button presses to various tempo-based patterns, Utagumi 575 incorporates this with a hiragana guessing game.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:45.000
The result for players is that after filling the correct cadence requirements, a prompt for missing Japanese characters appears.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And these are filled by paying attention to the phrase that's displayed, the context of the song, and the rules of a haiku.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:55.000
This sounds hard.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I was just thinking because I haven't said anything on air, but I'm planning on taking the JLPT N5 this year.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I was just thinking something like that would actually be really helpful for my studies.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:15.000
It's a SEGA rhythm game. I gotta say, as quirky as that sounds, I love that it's something kind of different.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
SEGA's made rhythm games more recently too, like that Rhythm Thief that was on 3DS. That was only last year.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to take a tangent, but I thought that was pretty cool.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Like a rhythm game that's haiku-based. It's kind of neat.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:31.000
On the Wii U this week? Nothing in Japan.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:38.000
On the 3DS though, you do get Carlos, the Beast of Re-Eden comes out this week.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I'm trying to see what kind of game this is. Oh, it's a shooter.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
It's a pew-pew shooting game.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It's more that isometric shooter though, not just above. It's more of using 3D shapes and stuff.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
You were exactly correct, by the way, that February 22nd is the PlayStation 4 Japanese release date.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And no date outside of this year for Xbox One in Japan.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Alright. I like hearing that I'm right. You should say it more often.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I can fact-check everything.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
You may be right about that, but you're so wrong in other ways.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Alright, let's see what the UK has to say for releases.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:18.000
On January 20th, which I guess is technically today now for them, is Kick Beat for PC.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
On the 21st is Chess 2, the sequel on Android. Whatevs.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
It's chess. Again.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:33.000
On the 22nd we have Insurgency for Mac and PC and OlliOlli for Vita.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
On the 23rd there is Might & Magic X Legacy for PC.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Ninja Gaiden 3, the Ancient Ship of Doom for 3DS.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
That be it. Arr.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Alright, there it is. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But first, Loki.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Alright, so let's see.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:59.000
We've got a little bit of interesting rumor here.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
And I don't know. It would be nice to get some new blood kind of in the series.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:12.000
But there's a rumor that Silent Hill 9 is being, I guess, resurrected by Hideo Kojima.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000
That he is going to be working on the game series now.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000
And I don't know if that's actually going to be true now.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I know he's very busy with all the Metal Gear Solid 5 stuff.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:35.000
But it would be kind of neat if he took it over because he does really good directing in his games.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
But I don't know.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000
They need another solid series though. Pun intended.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Haha. A Kojima Silent Hill game.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I don't know. It sounds a little fan wankish to me.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
But if it is true, it could be very interesting.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I think Silent Hill needs a nice kick in the butt to kind of get it back to where it was in its heyday.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:03.000
I thought I saw another fan wank rumor not that long ago that they were trying to get Team Silent back together.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
And I was like, good luck.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I mean, Akira Yamagata works for...

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Well, they were saying that they were supposed to be resurrecting Team Silent as well.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
And here's the other thing too.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:20.000
The information that right now that they're kind of going off of is based off of a listing on IMDB which anybody can make.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
So I don't know.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Oh, that's nothing. Yeah.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
That's a huge rumor. That's for sure.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Alright. Well, let's talk about...

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
We are about to get into the Classic Game of the Week.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:33.000
But let's talk about one of the great classics right now. Tetris.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Tetris always comes back.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
It's like a rite of passage for any generation of gaming consoles.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Where's the Tetris game?

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Well, the next-gen Tetris game for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming from Ubisoft.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
They'll be the ones publishing this Tetris game.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
We don't know more details than that.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.000
It's just that the Tetris game will be on the digital channels.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
So I guess they're going to focus on a download title, which is fine.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Because paying $60 for a Tetris game would be a little bit ridiculous.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
So I think the networks are the place to go.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
I don't know what next generation is going to entail.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But I would imagine that probably more online, competitive-based elements.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:19.000
You know, I gotta say though, since it's been a very Nintendo talking about what they've done right and wrong over the years.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Tetris on the DS was so freaking good.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
It's going to be really hard to top that one.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Remember Tetris on the DS? That was a great port of that game.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Probably the best since the original NES version.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Just with all its different modes and the retro Nintendo stuff they brought into that.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Obviously Ubisoft can't do that.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.000
But it'll be interesting to see what they decide to add to this as well.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
So there you go.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
No word on when it's coming out.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Maybe a year from now? A holiday?

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Yeah, whenever it's done. So you can just wait.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000
While you're waiting for that Tetris game, maybe you want to take a moment out to experience a classic.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Well, Dark Soccer is here to help you out.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Because every week she dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Hey, you should be playing this game.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
In my case it's blowing dust off of it.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
She really likes diving.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
She does.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
I'm not a good diver. I'm more just like...

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Dives into the vault.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
She just plays Scrooge McDuck style.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000
I do a cannonball into it.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Dives into the mailbag. Scrooge McDuck style.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
She plays one on TV.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
She dives into the UK. Scrooge McDuck style.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000
I wish I could just dive to the UK. That would be awesome.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
She's actually just singing Dive by B4U the whole time.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I just started humming that, but I have no voice, so stop it.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Dark Sakura.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Stop it.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
What is the classic game of the week?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
The classic game of the week is Taiko no Tatsujin.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
That's actually from the Wii version.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.000
I was trying to find older stuff and it only felt like the Evangelion.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
But the Wii version had the cutest accessory.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
That little inflatable drum.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:36:02.000
And since I'm sticking with my Namco high theme, Donko is a character that showed up in Namco High who is a character in this.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
And don't make me anything to look at while I'm doing classic game guys.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Taiko no Tatsujin came out in the US as Taiko Drum Master, but there were a bunch of different versions out in Japan.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
We've seen an arcade version.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:24.000
It came out on TBS, TBS, PST, PSP, Wii, Wii U, iOS, the Advanced Pico Bina, and other mobile versions.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I'm just watching this little video you got going.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
This is insanity. Listen to the drum beat in this.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Wow.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Wow.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Yeah.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
That one, I was like...

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
No, it's not Donkey Konga. Shut up, Bobby.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I mean, hearts, hearts, hearts.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:37:00.000
But like I said, there were Chinese versions that came out to be used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
And we've seen other versions.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
I've seen knockoffs of the game too.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Remember the one, the big single Taiko that was at John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza, Rob?

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
We've seen stuff like that.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Yeah.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:26.000
So anyway, basically you have two Taiko, and you have your sticks to play with it, and your notes are called ompu.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:36.000
And as they move across the screen, you either have to hit the center, or you hit the end to make a certain type of sound.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And you have your Tamashi Geiji, which is your spirit gauge to show how well you're doing.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:51.000
You have a red marker, which is your don, and your blue marker, which is your kato.

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:58.000
And it's exactly, you make the, to describe the noises that you're making.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
So the don is in the face, the kato is the side.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:13.000
And then you have the large ones that are basically, you know, large don and large kato that are double notes.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So you hit with, basically you hit both buttons on both sides of the drum, and the console releases, or in the drum you have to hit just really, really freaking hard.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.000
And the drum just punched that thing in the face. That was adorable.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Oh Rob.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
You actually gave me several videos to take a look at here.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
I did. I think the third one is the Evangel, or the second one might be the Evangelion one.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000
No, this is Hatsune Miku.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Oh yeah.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
We're gonna look at here in this video.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
So I guess, is this one of her songs in the game?

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
I believe so.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
That's, I love the little chibi Hatsune Miku at the bottom. Anyway, sorry.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
And you see the little Miku running in the background?

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Oh yeah.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:39:00.000
So, and for the record I do have a little Taiko plushie.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:09.000
So you also have a yellow bar called Renda where you hit either don or kato as many times as possible across it.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
It doesn't build up your spirit gauge but gives you bonus points.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.000
You have a balloon, which is called Husen Ompu.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:28.000
You also have, it also goes with the Genki Renda, where if you hit don for a certain number of times within the time limit, then you get bonus points too.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:39.000
You have all kinds of different, I'm not gonna go into all of them because there's a Kusudama, there's a Suzudon, there's all kinds of stuff that pops up.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:48.000
And you get different kinds of power ups and health bonuses and different things to attack your enemy if you're doing boss battles.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Like on the DS ones like Dororo no Kai Daikessen and a lot of the different versions.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:11.000
There's also a wrestling version, it's called Dual Note, which is based on wrestling, where you have to hit the Taiko repeatedly, more than your opponent does, so that you win.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Like I said, it's almost more like a tug of war, you know, whoever hits more wins.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:23.000
And unfortunately this was only in the boss battles on Wii, Dodon, To, Todame.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So there's different versions, you have Easy, which is Kanton, Normal, Hutsu, and Hard, which is Musukashi, which is really hard.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And then you have a fourth difficulty that's in later games called Donderful, which is a combination of Don and Wonderful.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:54.000
And you've got basically all your different note charts for how difficult, how easy they are, and it goes all over the board for how easy it is, or how hard it can be.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:10.000
In your different options, and they've changed from different types, you have different Taiko sounds that will be working on different types of songs, I think, that play.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:17.000
And they change them around, you can hit the different rim in your difficulty selection to change what your Taiko sounds like.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Oh gosh.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Pretty customizable.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I bet that's pretty funny.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
This was one I wanted to play because we were talking about Dragon Ball Z earlier.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I was going to say, we want to switch up the video here a little bit because that last one just ran out.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
So this is from the portable version of the game we're about to look at right now?

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Yes.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.000
This is actually the intro song to Dragon Ball Z, the original intro.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
The audio is a little distorted.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:43.000
That's exactly what it sounds like in the anime too, so don't worry about it.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Okay.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
That one's actually a fun one to play.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
So you've got different modifiers.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
You have auto, which plays automatically, and you can look at the song, and you get full combo.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:59.000
You get hidden, or as it's called, doron, which it's like it says.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:09.000
You have speed modifiers, you have double speed, you have triple speed, quadruple speed, and then you can go up to eight.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I'm sorry.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:18.000
It looks like it's just the symbols that move faster, like the modifiers we have in BeatMania.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
And these have been eight since eight and why why happy roku daime.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000
You have perfect, where the song will end if a note is missed.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
So if you're playing in perfect mode, you have to finish the whole song perfectly.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:37.000
You have reverse, abekobe, which is backwards.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Different modifiers.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:46.000
You have one called whimsical and haphazard, where it changes your notes from red to blue or vice versa, so you have to look at them differently.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Just all kinds of different stuff.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:58.000
It's really, really just a complex little game for as much as it seems you're just hitting on a drum, or hitting on the rim of the drum.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
So all kinds of different versions.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:07.000
As far as what has come out, for the Japanese versions, there are plenty of them.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:19.000
We've had arcade versions starting with Taiko no Tatsujin through Taiko no Tatsujin 14, then an overhaul in September 2010.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
The first one came out February 2001.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:35.000
And then the revamp, which is Taiko no Tatsujin from November 2011, and Taiko no Tatsujin Katsudon, and the Sorayo version that came out in March 2013.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:39.000
For home versions, we've had three different on the DS, a bunch on 3DS.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:46.000
The last one coming out November 29, 2012 called Taiko no Tatsujin Wii Chogokaban.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
And there's been a Wii U version, Taiko no Tatsujin Wii U.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Tons on PS2, three on PSP, four on iOS, three on Android, one on Advanced Pikobina, and different mobile versions, two in Japan, which were Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Monthly and Taiko no Tatsujin Mobile, and then one that came out in South Korea.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000
We have had different guest appearances within the games.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Like I said, Hatsune Miku showed up in Portable DX, and I sent you that link.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.000
And you can also play the same song in Project Diva.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
A little crossover.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
There's Puzzle and Dragons crossovers as well.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
So tracks that were for Puzzle and Dragons.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But yet, I'm not going to be able to find any of this in America except for that one release they had, the Drum Master.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Nope. Sorry.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
I remember one of my Balani friends had that, who I haven't seen him in forever. I miss him.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Well, there's been spin-offs.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Yeah?

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
There was a Taiko no Tatsujin character thing done in clay anime.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:54.000
And it was in, it was for Kid Station, it was in Comic Bum Bum.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Then...

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:57.000
My bum is on my bum.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:04.000
We had many versions, it was in Tales of the World, NariKiri Dungeon 3, which is, you know, another Amco game.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000
And in the DS game, Nodame Kontabile.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:15.000
And then in Mario Kart Arcade GPDX, you have a theme. A Taiko no Tatsujin theme.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Alright.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
And so I was just doing Taiko no Tatsujin. I didn't even touch Taiko Drum Master.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
As we got it over here.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Yeah.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Which, I mean, basically it's the same game, we've just got different music, you know, licensing.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:35.000
And I have that. I actually have a legit drum for it, and I have one of the knockoffs.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And it's fun, I love it. You know, like I said, I had to dust it off.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Yeah.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
You know, so, uh, it's, oh wow, I'm totally lucky.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
A good music game memory.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I mean, I'm totally jealous of Ikuma JP.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Why?

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I used to own a three foot don and katsu saiyan doll.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Adorable.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.000
What?

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Taiko no Tatsujin, or Taiko Drum Master, if you will.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Uh, for, well, hell, there's fourteen of them, so it's pretty much on everything.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
In the arcades.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.000
In the arcades.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
In the many, many, many, many more versions.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Well, you remember, um, Loki downloaded Taiko no Tatsujin for his PSP back in the day.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yeah, I remember that.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
He was talking about how to get all the important stuff.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Well, I just remember our friend Garrett had the big drum peripheral that he got.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
And, yeah, I know.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I heard from Garrett.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I don't know what happened to him.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Yeah.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Hmm.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Oh well.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Get him back on the show at some point would be awesome.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Yeah.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Alright, uh, it is running long.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
We gotta go to break.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Uh, but thank you Dark Soccer for taking us to a great music game from our past.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Uh, we're gonna be back with plenty more news.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
The Fugal Question of the Week, which should be exciting tonight, because I didn't even

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
plan it this way on purpose, but we were talking haikus earlier.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
We're gonna get some haikus in the Fugal Question of the Week.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Haiku.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Haiku.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000
Not haikus.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Haikai.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Haiku.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Haiku.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Haikus.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Haiku.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Haiku.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Haiku.

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Haiku.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Haiku.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Hike a lot.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Alright, Dark Soccer is gonna have a meltdown, but we'll be back after this with more of

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Stay tuned.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Baka.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Hi everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.000
We are live here on January 19th, 2014, with the 536th episode of our program already in

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.000
progress.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Thank you so much for joining us, be it that you're live here at the Voice Geeks Network,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
VOG Network.com, or perhaps you're listening to us on the podcast feed via one of the many

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.000
iPhone apps that lets you listen to things like Stitcher Radio or TuneIn.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I just want to say a big thank you to checking out our show, no matter how you are choosing

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
to listen to it.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
We've had a lot of pretty good debate on tonight's show.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000
We'll see if it continues with some more news that we're gonna get into in this half of

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
the show.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Loki, if you're back there on the Skype line, you're not gonna be here next week for sure,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
right?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
That's right.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Well, I hope, again, I know I said this a little bit last week, but since you are back

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
this week, and I didn't think you would be, I will say it once again, all of us here at

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Orange Lounge Radio wish you all the best with the new child.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I know everything's gonna go great.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
We can't wait to hear the name, which somebody had hoped you were gonna name your baby Tingle,

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
but it doesn't sound like that's gonna happen, right?

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
That's definitely not gonna happen.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
We can't wait to hear all of that whenever you do come back, but, you know, take the

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.000
time you need.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
We all understand.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
Dark Soccer and I will somehow manage to continue on.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Jason will be here for at least a week or two, but after that, I don't know, we'll figure

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:30.000
something out.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Hopefully, Alan can fill in for a show or some of our other loyal, go-to people can

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
help us out if we need to.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000
So, enjoy your time off with the new child.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Alright, I will.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Alright, start us off, if you wouldn't mind, with some rapid-fire news.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Yes, so there was a teaser trailer, if you will, that was put out by Bossa Studios, who,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:58.000
you may remember, did a little game on Steam called Surgeon Simulator 2013, and the video

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
is called Shh, I Dentist Now.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:07.000
And so, it's kind of teasing a little bit, like, they have Surgeon Simulator coming soon

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:13.000
for the iPad, and hopefully we'll see some sort of, you know, add-on for Surgeon Simulator

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.000
2013, but it sounds like the iPad version might revolve around Dentistry, which, you

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000
can only imagine how that'll go.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Yeah, I'm not excited about this game, because, you know, I'm not a big fan of the dentist,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
no offense to any who may be listening, but it's just, you know, I'm one of those people.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
So, yeah, I look at the idea, after seeing Surgeon Simulator, which, by the way, is a

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
part of the, I don't think this ever came up on the show, but Humble Bundle 10 is out,

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000
and it's great, and it's to help charity, but Surgeon Simulator is one of the games

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.000
in it, and, yeah, after seeing that, when I hear about, like, this idea is really funny,

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
but I'll pass, thanks.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I'm, I am equal parts thrilled and horrified by it, because I don't mind dental work, I've

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:05.000
had a fair amount in my life, including something that only hosts, I...

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000
They look fine to me. You don't gotta show me the back of your throat, Jason.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Ooh.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
It's very sexy.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I can see your uvula.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:23.000
I am equal parts thrilled, horrified, and prepared to play this game, because, if it's

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.000
any, if it's even remotely as impossible as Surgeon Simulator is, and it will be, it'll

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.000
be a good time, but with lots of drills and noises and whirly bits and picks and spoke

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000
spiky things.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
I think I'm, like, the only person I know that doesn't have dentist trauma. I always

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
fall asleep because I'm bored.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Consider yourself lucky.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000
It's just an awesome, I'm kind of curious to see how it's gonna work as far as, because,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000
you know, the whole point of Surgeon Simulator is that the controls are really hard to, you

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:58.000
know, use, and so, you know, with an iPad, I guess it would be a little bit easier, I

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000
think, with the touchscreen, maybe, I guess, they're gonna map it exactly the same, you

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.000
know, one hand does the, you know, five keys, and the other hand moves the actual arm. I

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
don't know.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
We'll see.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:18.000
All right. And then, moving on, Unity is coming to the Vita, and this is great if you are

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:25.000
an up and coming game developer. Now you can actually port your Unity games that you make

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:33.000
in, for the Vita, I guess, and I think now, man, I think Unity supports pretty much almost

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:39.000
all console platforms now. It's, I know, at least the entire PlayStation suite. I'm not

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.000
really sure. It's been a while since I actually looked at Unity, but, yeah, so support for,

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.000
you know, all the sensors, the cameras, analog sticks, touchpad, all that fun stuff. And

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:59.000
that's, I guess, with Unity 4.3. And, in fact, they're saying that there is a game, Stick

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:06.000
It to the Man, that was developed, I guess, on PS3 and Vita, and that's with Unity as

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:13.000
well, and that's, I think it's already out or coming out very soon. So that's kind of

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:19.000
cool, I think. Especially since it's relatively, I mean, well, it's free to use non-commercially,

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:23.000
and if you make, I think, over $10,000 in the year or something like that, then you

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:29.000
have to pay the licensing fee, which isn't that expensive. And last but not least, Apple

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:38.000
and Google have pulled a game, if you will, that was promoting plastic surgery for children.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:43.000
It was a game called Plastic Surgery for Barbie, which I'm sure probably could, you know, have

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.000
been pulled just because, you know, the copyright infringement on the name itself. But basically,

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:55.000
it was a game aimed at kids, you know, I guess it was marked suitable for kids 9 and over,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:02.000
and had you performing plastic surgery procedures on female characters, you know, such as liposuction

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:08.000
and on the characteristics problem areas. And you compare the before and after shots,

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000
and they were saying, you know, some of the results, like, this unfortunate girl has so

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
much extra weight that no diet can help her, you know. In our clinic, she can go through

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.000
surgery called liposuction that will make her slim and beautiful. So apparently, people

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000
were offended, you know, that it's giving children the wrong idea.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Well, did they really think that people...

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.000
It is giving the wrong idea.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.000
It is. It is a little offensive, actually.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Yeah, and I think Mattel was one of the ones also that kind of, you know, helped in pulling

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000
that since, you know, obviously they mentioned Barbie in there, and, you know, they want

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:48.000
that associated with any of the Mattel stuff.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I mean, this picture doesn't look like any Barbie I've ever seen, but maybe that's just me.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Yeah.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:59.000
All right. Moving on to some other news that I have for you guys. Some eShop releases for

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Nintendo, because they are still putting some classics out there as we go.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
UnEpic is now out on the Wii U. This game's been out for a couple of years, but it's that

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:14.000
platformer that has some RPG elements, D&D, NES-style gameplay. Or as Nintendo puts it,

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:18.000
UnEpic is a mixture of platform game, role game, I think it's a role play game, and joke

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
that takes place in a huge castle of medieval fantasy. It is set in the 80s style, but

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.000
completed with the most actual features. So, okay. That is available.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Wow.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I haven't checked that out on Steam. I haven't checked that out on Steam. I think it's in

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:36.000
my wish list, but anyway. So that is now out. You can also check out F1 Race Stars

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Powered Up Edition, which is kind of like a cutesy cart game. You can check that out.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
And then as far as Virtual Console goes, this is pretty cool. Castlevania II, Simon's

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Quest. I think this game kind of gets shit on unnecessarily, but I kind of think it is

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:55.000
the reason we have things like Super Metroid and Metroidvania, meaning like, you know,

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Symphony of the Night and so forth. It really kind of can be traced back to a game like

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Castlevania II, which I love imperfections and all. And Badass Soundtrack, most importantly.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Absolutely Badass Soundtrack.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Speaking of classics, more PlayStation 1 or PS1 games are going to be out on the PlayStation

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:18.000
network in January and February, thanks to Monkey Paw Games. The big release they're

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000
going to come out with on February 18th is Tomba 2, The Evil Swine Return. I remember

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:31.000
the Tomba games. The original Tomba is already out. That came out in 2012. But some other

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:37.000
games that will be coming out, Double Dragon, the Neo Geo Double Dragon. This is the one

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:42.000
that's based on the film adaptation of Double Dragon. That's why they got that out of the

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
way first, I'm thinking. But some other games that are coming out, let's see, Lucifer Ring,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000
The Fireman 2, Pete and Danny, Hyper Crazy Climber, and Wolf Fang. So these are obviously

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
very niche, kind of cult titles. But I think that's really cool because, you know, a whole

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000
new audience can kind of find these now thanks to PlayStation Network. So that's neat. And

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:10.000
lastly, if you were looking forward to Star Wars 1313, you might be waiting a long time

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
because unfortunately, Star Wars 1313, although we saw it at E3 2012, we knew it was going

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.000
to have some issues once Disney bought LucasArts. Well, Disney let the trademark on Star Wars

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
1313 lapse. And that's not a good sign. That means they probably aren't doing anything

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.000
with it now unless maybe they could have took some of it and put it in a new game. And that's

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000
probably what's happened with this is that they are making it work for a different video

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.000
game to come out in 2015 with the new movie. You basically said the same thing when the

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:45.000
acquisition happened. But we basically knew that this happened when they shuttered LucasArts,

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000
at least as far as development, development such publisher is concerned. Right. But this

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
was this was this. And I think some of us were explicitly called out as being I think

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.000
some of us were holding out hope that maybe they would shuffle it around some didn't happen.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Didn't happen. They're saying all the rogue squad, rogue crap, not Rogue Squadron. That's

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:12.000
the N64 and GameCube game. Attack Squadrons reached started sending out beta codes last

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
week. I didn't get one, but I'm still holding out hope. Oh, all right. There is new Star

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Wars content. So, yeah, it's still actually happening on over to dark soccer for the rest

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:28.000
of our rapid fire news. Just a few things. Gabe Newell says he's fine with origin being

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000
on steam machines. He's not worried. In fact, he says we're trying to make it as open as

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
possible. If he wants to put origin on it, that would be fine. Does origin even exist

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.000
outside of Windows? Hmm. I don't think it does. He said, well, if he would have to make

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:50.000
sure. Sure. But they're not they're not like if they want to, then they can. So, yay, that's

01:57:50.000 --> 01:58:01.000
very kind of him. I don't think he has anything to worry about. And then there is a demo out

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:12.000
for a He-Man playable side scroller and brawler. And it is available for PC on Gamejolt. And

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000
there's files for an Android version that's on a Dropbox. But you'd have to follow the

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:23.000
link. And they're planning on making Shira as a playable character. Sweet. And then we

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
have to find that little wizard guy hiding in the background somewhere. What's his name?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:36.000
Orko. Orko. Yeah. And I think in for Shira, she had Madame Cal. So, no, no, not Madame

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Cal. What am I saying? Cal was the owl thing. It was Madame Crap. Not Madame Crap, but I

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:47.000
don't remember. Now I'm thinking about the He-Man movie from 1984. It was Dolph Lundgren.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:52.000
And Courtney Cox was in that movie. I was one of our first roles. With her big hair.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
With her big hair. By the way, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. SEG is there

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:04.000
to let us know. Origin is on the Mac. So there you go. And then last news. This is sad

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:10.000
news. Is that the Doctor Who MMO is shutting down. As of February 28th, 2014, it will no

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.000
longer be available. All the transactions have already been suspended. But we can still

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:20.000
play Doctor Who Legacy. I didn't even know there was like a full on MMO out there. Yeah.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:28.000
Because I keep seeing it turn up in what TV thing should be an MMO. Wasn't too interested.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Alright. Well, let's get into our coughing fits. Let's get into our FUGL question. Hey,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
I've been doing it all show. Let's get into our FUGL question of the week. You take Facebook

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:47.000
and Google and slam them together, you get FUGL.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Every week we go to our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities. Available at facebook.com

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:57.000
slash orange lounge radio and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio. And we ask a question

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
and we read some of our favorite answers on air. Although I made it a little trickier

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.000
tonight. So we've got less answers because of it and they're all short. But that's alright.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Because we love haikus. And sure enough. Haiku. Haikais. That's a completely different word.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Alright. Anyhow, the question we asked, so we're going to ask the obvious question, what

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:25.000
would you do to boost sales of Nintendo products? But all answers must be written as a haiku.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Five syllables, seven syllables, five. Let's see how many people broke the rule. I will

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:32.000
be the haiku enforcer. Will you be the syllable police tonight? I will be. Alright, let's

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000
go to Google Plus first because I always forget to start with Google Plus. So I'm going to

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000
start with them tonight. So let's start with act deft. I'm going to actually dim the music

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
here to make it a little easier for you to be the syllable police. Alright, here we go.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Act deft. To avoid a flop. Nintendo needs games a lot. New marketing works. That pass?

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000
That passes. Alright, good. That's actually really well written. Yeah, that's good. That

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:07.000
goes together very well. Retertainment. Create a better. Platform for online gameplay. Also

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:14.000
boobs, boobs, boobs. That was awful. There was no artistry to that. You fail. But it

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:18.000
passes. It passes. It passes five, seven, five and that's all I need to do. It passed

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
five, seven, five and you worked boobs into it. So I'm okay with it. I give that a 10

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:30.000
out of 10. No, no, no, no. It's a 17 out of 17. You need to stop. Total syllables. Five,

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:39.000
seven. Just stop. Paul L. I'll see myself out. Paul L. Here we go with Paul L. on Google

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:48.000
plus. Drop the price by half. Unique use of the touch pad. Pokemon Wii U. There you go.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Very good. These are awesome. See, I love haiku nights on Fugu question of the week.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:58.000
I should do haikus everywhere. Excuse me. Haiku. We should do this show in haiku. That's

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.000
never going to happen with my big mouth, her big mouth, your big mouth. No, maybe five

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:07.000
hours, seven hours, five hours. All right. And you definitely being the seven. Let's

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:13.000
be real here. I have to work in the morning. All right. Travis H. Please give us more games.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Wii U smells kind of moldy. Do not do cell phones. But then in parentheses, he put mobile

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
gaming rumor barf. I think you're not allowed to have four lines, sir. Not, not quite. Not

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
quite. Last one. Oh, wait, no, do not do. Yeah, that's, that's, yeah, there's something

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
at the seven. It was like a bonus. It was like the bonus scene on the DVD. It was like

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:41.000
the extra line. All right. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Minus that extraneous sentence. Anyways,

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:48.000
there you go. Facebook tech 2030 on Facebook. Pokemon is what Nintendo must use to save

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:55.000
their failing console. It passes. I'm failing is a strong word, but I, again, it's, it's

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:01.000
hard to sugar coat the numbers. It needs to do better. A degenerate Johnny expand a first

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:09.000
party. Nintendo must be Disney. Buy up third parties. That's what Nintendo should do. All

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.000
right. You're not going to put games on the system. Fine. We'll just fucking buy you with

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:16.000
all this cash we have on hand. I wonder if they have, I can buy and sell you bitch. Probably

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.000
not. No. Realistically, they probably don't have enough to buy EA, but you never know.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Not EA, not EA, but their market caps are past Sony. So then maybe we should just buy

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
some, no bloody bloody blah. It was a terrible. I understand how finances work. All right.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Renee in a, for our buddy from Koopa club responds with the following Nintendo only

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:43.000
has to do one simple thing. HD retro games, NES remix. Anyone?

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Eh, any S remix? I already told you my issues with that. Baseball is not a fucking retro

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:55.000
classic. All right. Neither is wrecking crew. Other than the horror. No, nevermind.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:01.000
Continue please. No need to do their own version of super Mario crossover. There's only. Yeah.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Right now. That would be awesome. Like honestly, just why don't just do super Mario crossover.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
I mean, all respect to the guys who made it, but since they kind of took a bunch of that

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Nintendo's characters, Nintendo stealing their game would only be fair play. All right.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Our buddy Flaco Jones responds and says, no more 3DS games,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.000
no more 2DS games, no more Wii U games. I don't think that's a haiku.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Someone missed the memo. You missed the memo. Just Nintendo games that play on all current

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.000
Nintendo consoles. They're all dual screen anyway, so it's not a huge stretch. You didn't do a haiku.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Boo. Sort of. Boo. Sometimes. All right. KJ. Fatal frame Wii U.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Lots of ghosts and scares for you. Body not ready.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.000
That was four seven, four seven five. Unfortunately, no fatal frame Wii U.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.000
That's five. I just police the police. Well, all right. I'm going to say

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:02.000
the next one I'm going to save for last because that's my favorite. So we're going to do that last.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
All right. Dark charger said frame Wii U though. I mean, I liked fours engine.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:11.000
And if they smooth out some of the rough edges and oh my God. OK. All right.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Dark charger says, understand online, focus on games, not gimmicks, cross platform support.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I'm not sure what else. What cross platform or maybe 3DS.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Eddie, who hasn't been on this show in forever. He really thinks that games should be not exclusive.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Nintendo to boost software. And that will be the first foot in the grave if that happens.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:37.000
All right. Our buddy Eddie, who used to go by the doctor on this show and I hope he comes back someday.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I miss I miss his face. Eddie says, Legend of Zelda. Be unapologetic.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Oh my God. That's a hard word. Rage against machine.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Critical Myth says, Abandon Wii U. Publish to competitors.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Focus on handheld. Again, I know that's what people want, but we'll focus on handheld.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:03.000
That's published on competitors over a Wada's dead body.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:08.000
All right. Awesome Unicorn. I love that name.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:16.000
So Awesome Unicorn says, To play is to love. Nintendo's strength and downfall.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Price drop. More titles. That was strangely poetic. I like that one.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000
All right. Renee sent a couple more haikus, but one haiku per person.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Fifth Dream responds and says, Any games but these? Zelda, Mario, Metroid. Do something new, please.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Michael H wrote a response that definitely was not a haiku. Sorry, sir.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Rob H. Definitely not a haiku. Sorry, sir. But Fifth Dream responded, which I think is a haiku.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Fifth Dream says, One of the best games Nintendo needs to reboot. Hey, you, Pikachu.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Oh, yeah. That'll do wonders for them.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:04.000
All right. But here it is. This is the winner. You get a gold star, sir. This is my favorite out of all the responses. You ready?

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Here you go. Gold star haiku, but I need it to be policed. From Red the Haze.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Sorry. I love this haiku. Okay, here we go. Ready?

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Price drop. Price drop drop drop. Wub wub wub wub wub wub. M-rated games, please.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:33.000
It passes. Price drop. Price drop. Price drop drop drop. Wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:38.000
No. You win, sir. You win an internet. Congratulations. No.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Red the Haze, your username has never been more appropriate considering that Rob's face is being red right now.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Price drop. Price drop drop drop wub wub wub wub wub. No.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I'm gonna be- I'm gonna be like walking to the mall tomorrow for some sale or something and I'm just gonna be in the middle of the mall.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Yeah. I'm gonna start strutting. Price drop. Price drop drop wub wub wub wub wub.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
All right. Well, I'm glad we could laugh on this episode for once.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:09.000
All right. Hey, we've been having a good time. We've been having a good time.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
We've been having quite the gay old time.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:17.000
All right. Actually, Black Wolf says I could give him loot. That's right. I could assign him specific loot. Maybe I will do that.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:23.000
I'll see if he has a VoG network account. I'll give him some type of- I'll give him a cherry blossom or something because he's such a haiku.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Give him the- Give him a dubstep gun. A dubstep gun. Yeah, I was gonna say a dubstep gun.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Well, I'm not- We can't give things that are copyright. Like, I can't give out Mickey Mouse ears.

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Give him an extraneous bass EDM gun. All right.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Give him a golden 575. There you go. All right.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Hey, that's a good idea. There you go. All right.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:46.000
And to make like ripples for the bass. Like, 575 with a big button in it. Sorry.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
All right. We'll figure something out.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.000
I'm sorry. Tigerclaws said haiku dubstep. Let's make it happen.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.000
I only keep thinking about is there's a- You know what Enka is, right?

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Yes, I do.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
There's an Enka singer who-

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
In case the listeners don't, you might want to explain.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:12.000
It's really sad, sappy. It's done a really melancholy style and it's pretty much just for- just a Japanese style.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:22.000
But there's a singer out there who is a quarter Japanese named Jetero and he does Enka hip-hop style.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:28.000
And that's all I was thinking about is Jetero. He does nothing but Enka covers hip-hop style.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:34.000
So, anyway. I have like his last two albums. They're very good.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Well, for all the big audience looking for that. All right.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Yes, I like Enka. Shut up.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000
All right. Let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:50.000
All right. So, let's see. I was kind of distracted by it. I was actually looking at a further topic here.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:58.000
Let's talk a little bit about baseball. And, you know, it's funny. We had a baseball series.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Well, the 2K series just kind of up and cancel itself.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:09.000
Now, we have an old baseball series coming back. And RBI Baseball is that series.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:15.000
It's RBI Baseball 14. It's supposed to be coming out from Time Warner Interactive.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Or, yes, I'm sorry. The Time Warner Interactive did the original one.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:24.000
But this one's supposed to be coming out on consoles and mobile.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.000
And it doesn't really say on who's developing yet. But, I don't know.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:37.000
It's interesting to see that coming back. I don't know if it's actually going to be like a full-fledged game.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000
You know, when they mention mobile, I always think something, you know, very quick being done.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.000
But it'd be interesting to see yet another series and hopefully something that's actually on the Xbox.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Because right now the only option for baseball is, you know, MLB 14 the show.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Yeah, something that finally gets baseball games back in the limelight considering the news we've been reporting on over the last month.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Yeah. I'm surprised they couldn't, like, have, you know, they just gave up on that.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.000
You know, maybe just 2K Sports, they've been doing pretty good stuff with NBA.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:16.000
I'm surprised that they couldn't do that same type of thing with MLB. I don't know.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
As much as I like the whole idea of like, ooh, retro with RBI baseball.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
You know, obviously I'm not a big sports gaming person anyway.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
But I don't remember RBI baseball really being a particular favorite of mine.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
So, when I kind of hear this is coming back, I'm like, eh.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Maybe it's just one of those things where it's like in name only. I don't know.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Well, and also too, you know, not everything that comes back was necessarily great.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Because remember they did a redo of Tecmo Bowl and I don't think that was that great on the Wii either.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.000
It really wasn't, which was really unfortunate. It just wasn't the same as the original.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Or Blitz. You know, remember Blitz? They tried to make it all hardcore.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Or NBA Jam. Oh my God, the new NBA Jam was really not good.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Yeah.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:59.000
So, yeah, sometimes it's just not the same. But it could also end up being better. Who knows?

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Speaking of reboots, here's a game that they rebooted and it came out way better.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Like, it was for the better for it. And it's Tomb Raider.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.000
And there is yet some more news coming out on Tomb Raider as we're heading into the, what is it?

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:16.000
The definitive Lora's Hair edition. You know, the one that's coming out soon.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Definitive and game of the year.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
I was going to say, definitive game of the year edition or whatever.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:28.000
So, Tomb Raider is, the big kind of buzz quote about the story this week is that

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Tomb Raider is finally in the black. Meaning it's finally been a profitable game.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000
And this goes back to that story where they mentioned that Square Enix at one point had said,

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:44.000
oh, very disappointed that the game didn't sell, you know, what it was supposed to.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:49.000
And only 3.4 million. Well, they were expecting 5 to 6 million.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Well, a lot of that has to do with the cost to make the game. Because, you know, pretty games don't come cheap.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:05.000
So, the news got around and in an interview with Eurogamer, executive producer Scott Amos said that quote,

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:13.000
by the end of last year, Tomb Raider is in the black. We've crossed the line of profitability for the last gen and PC versions.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.000
And so I imagine the definitive edition, I mean, I don't want to call it a cash in.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Because, you know, obviously it looks like they've done more than just port the game to the other system.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
So I want to give it a little more credit than that.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.000
But obviously it's kind of a way to put it even further in the black, let's say.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I imagine a game like this didn't cost nearly that same amount of money to end up making.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:38.000
So to try to get this out there for the people that might have missed Tomb Raider the first time,

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:44.000
you know, now that they're getting PlayStation 4s in the house or what have you, or Xbox Ones is the case maybe.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I imagine, you know, it's going to push itself even further into the black and hopefully justify the continuation of the series.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Because I think all of us here at OLR, as well as you guys in chat and so forth,

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
we'd like to see a sequel in this style of Tomb Raider. At least I know I would.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I hope that if they do do a sequel, however, though, that we get to start in Loras' mansion and commit suicide in hideous ways,

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
just like in the original PC game.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
That was great. That was in the second one.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Or as Dark Sakura will call it, Girl 2.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I need to find that picture again and link it to everybody.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I have to thank Alan for the idea.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Other continued comments from that interview.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.000
As a franchise, Square Enix has clearly invested in us.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:34.000
They already let us get kickstarted on a sequel and they backed us with the game's upcoming definitive edition.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:38.000
That's right. We already knew it because that comic thing had spoiled and they had to come out and say,

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
yes, we're doing something else. So there you go.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.000
They've always been behind us regardless of maybe what was said or how it was said in the press.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.000
And certainly at the end of the year, we've actually gone over expectations because we've managed to get profitability back.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:55.000
So great. Can't wait to see what's next in that franchise.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
It'll be a lot of fun.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000
All right. Let's go on with some more stories. Dark Sakura.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Well, I have a story.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000
As soon as my tablet stops choking. There we go.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:21.000
Basically, Valve has paid the community content creators four hundred thousand dollars collectively in the first week of January.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.000
They they did it during.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.000
They actually came up with a statement on Steam Day.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:34.000
And the content, you know, like we all know, is just regular people out there making content to resell.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:44.000
You know, whether it be Team Fortress 2 stuff or, you know, making gifts for other people, making.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.000
You know, there's all kinds of different games and items that have come out.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:54.000
So. Steam's paying for it. So they're like, thank you. Here, have money.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Which makes me kind of want to do hats now. Should I make hats, Rob?

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Hats would be awesome, actually. So. Very cool. All right.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Well, let's move on with just a couple more stories for the mailbag. Loki.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Yes. So, you know, you may have heard that there's been some multiplayer alpha invites going out for Titanfall.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:28.000
And of course, all of them are under NDA, which means we need to upload that shit to the Internet as fast as possible.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:35.000
And that's what's happened. So there's a lot of gameplay from Titanfall making it out to the Internet.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:41.000
And I don't know, I've actually checked out some of it. It looks better than I thought it would be.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:47.000
And looks actually quite fun. Although, you know, some of the stuff in there is very early.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Like the textures are only 25%. As detailed as they're going to be in the final version.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Which, that being said, they still look really good already, so I don't know.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:10.000
And then also the gameplay looks pretty fast. It just looks interesting. I don't know. Very fast paced.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:15.000
So I probably have to check that out on 360 when it comes out.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Yeah, if you're looking for some video, check out Dailymotion, because they seem to have a lot of gameplay feeds on there.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Yeah, I was checking out one of those bootleg feeds. It looks pretty cool.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Yeah, it does. And I mean, it looks like there's still a lot of people running around, even though it's only 6 on 6.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:42.000
There's a lot of AI players and stuff in there, and the mechs and everything is still pretty crazy.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:48.000
So I don't think the 6 on 6 now, after seeing all the people complain about it, is going to be that big of an issue.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000
I always thought that discussion was way overhyped. I didn't think that was going to cripple the game at all.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:59.000
I am a little concerned that the AI is as stupid as it is in the video that they're being shown me.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Because this game is only a couple months out, or not even, like pretty much a month and a half away.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
So hopefully they can fix that in time.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Alright. Well, let's go to the mailbag.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:20.000
You know, we encourage you to send your emails and feedback to the show at mailbag at orangelaundraider.com.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.000
And every week, usually DarkSakura will dive in the mailbag head first and pull out an email.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
There's that diving thing again.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Why can't I cannonball or belly flop?

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Well, this week DarkSakura is pouting at the top of the diving board saying, I want to cannonball.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.000
So Jason will have to dive instead.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:41.000
She's the little kid throwing a hissy fit on the side of the pool.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.000
But it's wet! And it's cold! And it's water!

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:48.000
I think right now I have the perfect voice to do whiny three-year-old.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000
I don't want you in the mailbag!

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Oh, you are correct in that assumption.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
So listeners, thank you for that one.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Woohoo!

02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Alright.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Woohoo!

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Well, for those that are still connected and listening to the show after that.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Jason, if you wouldn't mind.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Rob-a-bub-a-bub-a-bub-a-bub-a says...

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Oh, speaking of Rob.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Rob and Jason talked about how racy content is getting onto the PSN livestreams.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
PS4 livestreams.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.000
I looked on Tuesday and I can thankfully say I didn't find anything sexually charged.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
That must be mostly a weekend thing.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Yeah, weekend holidays.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:31.000
There was a guy drinking himself drunk and another getting high off camera.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
But there was also a guy jamming on his electric guitar to make things a bit better.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Then I read the chat and it was awful!

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:44.000
They made fun of the way the people on camera looked, dressed, acted, and they also made the most disgusting situations.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
From what pit do these words come from?

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
I'm not one for censorship, but it tested my resolve.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I'm all about self-censorship, so I turned that crap off.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.000
The language being used by the broadcasters themselves wasn't too clean either, but that's another issue.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:15.000
So, yeah, even if the content on screen isn't rolling with it, the masses can say what they want to say, and it usually leans in a very particular direction.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:23.000
The chat is almost worse in many ways than what's being offered out there on PlayStation 4 because the stories we were telling last week,

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:29.000
obviously those were some of the big horror stories, if you will, but that's not all the feeds.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:35.000
I mean, once again, I was trying to find a shocking feed to show Dark Sakura before the show tonight because she wasn't here last week to hear,

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.000
well, I mean, she heard the discussion, but she wasn't here to participate in it.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000
But when I looked at those feeds today, I was like, ah, there really isn't anything that scandalous.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:45.000
There was some girl there that was, she had an accent. She's like Australian maybe.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.000
She was sitting there and it was just, she was just sitting there reading the chat and responding to it.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:56.000
But then once again, looking at the chat, people would say things like, you know, it was just, you know, calling her names and stuff like that.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
It's just pretty disgusting.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
I don't see why people think that that's okay.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:06.000
You know, they've got this layer of anonymity being on the internet, but I still don't think...

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:07.000
That's enough.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
And sometimes it takes less than that.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:21.000
In the end, in the end, in the end, what I don't see is how people fundamentally think that it is okay to speak to another human being that way, even if they are hidden by anonymity.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:24.000
By no means am I defending it. I'm sure you know that.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:32.000
And if any of you listening to this have done it, I want you to go find whoever you've done it to and apologize before I spank you.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Because clearly you weren't taught to respect other people and I don't want that type of behavior associated with the show.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:47.000
I think the people that listen to this show and have made it this far in this show are too smart to do something like that. I really hope.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:52.000
And if you're going to be an ass to someone, at least have the decency to put your name on it.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:56.000
You know, have the vagina to do it.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Have the, have the uteral strength to do it because as we all know, balls are squishy.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:13.000
I, this conversation is kind of interesting. I've never really, I've never really said anything about it myself, but like, I don't think I've ever been anonymous asshole on the internet.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:23.000
And I've said shit in bad moods, you know, whether, whether, I don't want to say people deserve it, but whether argumentative or not, you know, I've, I can, I can get nasty.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I kind of realized that sometimes I do that myself. And when I get in that mood, now I have a filter to just get the hell off the computer and do something else slash sleep.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Because it's usually fucking three o'clock in the morning.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:47.000
But like there are some people that I'm not necessarily on bad terms with, but I just have snarky approaching snide reactions to.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:53.000
And when they do something that I expect, I'll, I'll call them out on it.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:23:04.000
And I don't know, these are, these are very different things though, because these are, these are things that I've formed with people versus people that I don't know that that shirt makes you look stupid.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:07.000
That's what are you a lumberjack? I don't know.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Well, you know, this is actually why I actually became a moderator on DDR Freak back in the day is because just the way that people would talk to each other was absolutely horrible.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:21.000
You and me both, not to mention my form, my section didn't exactly have a lot of the time.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:32.000
That's actually how I got offered my position is because I was playing babysitter in my favorite forums, trying to get people to play nice because I wanted to see what people had to say and not see people just bitch at each other.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:52.000
And that also got me on Gorillaz Unofficial back in the day. You know, it was, I have this thing where the moment someone starts insulting or treating somebody else in a sexist or racist or anything ist manner, they instantly lose all manner of respect.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:24:00.000
I don't treat them as an intelligent human being anymore. I don't deal with them. I cut them out. They are no longer existing to me.

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I made a point last week when we were talking about this, that it's not even an ist. Maybe there's a word that ends in this that describes it, but it's just a nasty mentality.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And it doesn't have to be born out of any sort of a prejudice. People will do these things because it satisfies a need.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:32.000
It's the bully mentality. It's the put down someone to make yourself feel better. It's using the internet as validation.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:36.000
To an extent. That among other things, no doubt.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
In and of itself is super unhealthy.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
It is.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:52.000
So first of all, if people want validation, they need to earn their damn validation. And secondly, they need to validate themselves, not look towards putting somebody else down or telling them to kill themselves or bullying somebody.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:25:02.000
There was another article, too, that I was reading today about a guy in God for the Life of Me. I can't remember his first name, but his last name is Hassan Hassan or something like that.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:14.000
He's a writer that outed a transgendered inventor. And she said, you know, please don't say what my birth gender is because that's going to count as it's going to lead to a hate crime or something.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:25.000
And it turned out that I read his article and he did it in such an insensitive way and did out out this lady and she killed herself.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:36.000
And it's just that level of insensitivity that people have towards respecting other people. There is no respect when you don't see them face to face.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Everyone needs to realize that there is another human being on the other side of that monitor.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:51.000
This is actually something that I didn't think about the Bay Area is that I've met a lot of diverse people in a lot of very particular ways over the last year.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
Any other comments? Any other comments?

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Well, it's just a mindfulness that people should have.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:03.000
It is. People aren't naturally extroverted enough to understand that, though.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:10.000
And people will also say that, oh, you're just being too PC or you're being too strict.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Why don't you just let people say what you're going to say?

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
God forbid you treat people like people.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Exactly. It's because and I also posted a link to another article earlier on my Tumblr about casual racism, how we have these phrases and sayings that are built into our language.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:32.000
But in the end, do we really know where they came from and do we know how, you know, the origins of them, how hurtful they are?

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.000
And we just say things and don't think about how we treat other people.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:41.000
You know, every every one of you listeners, you are each an individual and special person.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.000
And certainly calling, you know, in calling things gay.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.000
The word retarded, retarded, which is really, you know, I've I've been bad and use that and I really shouldn't.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Or saying someone is autistic when they're just socially awkward.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000
Yeah. Which trust me, I know what autism is.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Anyway, in the interest of time, I got to ask for your next email.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:07.000
No, it's all right. It's just good discussion, but just as I have said at least two or three times before.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Be awesome to people. Those those people that they are people, too.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.000
They have their own lives in as much history as they've lived up to this point.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:20.000
And it's actually something phenomenal. And if you don't care, then don't bother.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:25.000
There are 60 million things that could kill you every day, including yourself.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And if you've lived this long, kudos to you. You're awesome.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Next email. I just found plans for next weekend.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:39.000
This is frauds in the intro. Hey, all our crew.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Hp here. This email is mostly for more as he's expressed the most interest in the speed runs from awesome games done quick.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:51.000
But I think other people might be interested as well. At the convention AOD.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000
The convention AOD. I don't know what AOD stands for.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:28:02.000
Maybe it'll make sense in a minute. At the convention AOD being held next Saturday, the 25th at the SFO Marriott near Berlin game.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:09.000
The speed runners from AGDQ Trihex, who formerly held the world record for Yoshi's Island 100 percent, now third.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Cosmo Wright, who formerly held who formerly held the world records for Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker and Commander King 4.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:26.000
And ROM Scout, who holds the world record for Castlevania Symphony of the Night, will be hosting a panel about speed running at 6 p.m.,

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:31.000
followed by a panel hosted by Dasset Bro, an EVO commentator on fighting games and the community.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:39.000
It'll be a great chance to learn more about the art and ask questions you might not get answered as candidly if you are asking questions in their chat.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.000
Run Mrs. AOD's anime overdose.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Oh. Oh, so con this weekend. OK. I tried Googling it a couple times and I wasn't getting anything.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:58.000
I was getting a Tomb Raider old something. I know it was mentioned on the show, but I'm so amazed, surprised and proud these gamers were able to raise over a million dollars for charity.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.000
And I'm excited to get the chance to tell them how great I think they are for doing it.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:06.000
So anyone who's free next Saturday and around the Bay Area, stop on by.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:10.000
I'm freaking there. Hell, yes. Awesome.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.000
I would love to go, but that's not going to happen.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Not that I don't think this is great. Just, you know, the trip and everything. But please.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Oh, it's going to be big. Send our love.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Damn, that's going to be exciting. All right.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Suppolar. I'll try to be brief for anyone. There's a nasty canasta for anyone, including Mr. Black Wolf, if he's around, who's used or reads about the Oculus Rift.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Has there been any issues brought up with people who have vision problems?

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I'd like to try the rift someday, but I am near sighted in my left eye, so I'm afraid I won't be able to enjoy it.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Unrelated, but because of my eye problem, I cannot see 3D images, not even on my 3DS.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:59.000
This is a principal article that Sir Black Wolf wrote up on the site in the start of December, mid-November, one of the two.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I'm laughing because I don't want to say it's the exact same thing, but Bobby has a vision impairment that's exactly what you're describing.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:10.000
And you know how much he talks about the rift.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:17.000
And keep in mind, the whole point of, and I've been sort of phrasing it incorrectly, that it's specifically lenticular 3D.

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:28.000
Well, it kind of is, but if you've ever ripped one of the little 3DS files on it, it's actually two images that are superimposed at different opacities.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:33.000
And it's meant for one eye to read one part of the image, and the other eye to read the other part of the image.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:38.000
And if you don't have that synchronization between your eyes, you're not going to see it. You're going to see a blur.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:44.000
SaganChat says, to answer the writer, wait till they develop their tech to solve these problems.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:47.000
It's true. It's not totally done yet either.

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:51.000
But keep in mind, there's more to it than just the 3D imagery.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:55.000
That whole sensation of looking around and having the movement, that's a lot too.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:02.000
And I think, well, you know, like I said, Bobby, and he wrote an article on the site about it, so go dig through the things he's written on the rift.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Because he explains exactly what his vision thing is that's going on, and how he still enjoys the rift.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
So you might find that it's a very similar story to what you've got.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:36.000
If you're a PlayStation owner or PC owner, go check out DC Universe Online.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Yes, I know, DC, but it is more of like a beat-em-up style MMO, and it's a little more fast-paced.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:45.000
And I think is exactly the type of thing you're looking for there.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I honestly did find some enjoyment with Ragnarok Online too.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Because, I mean, it has a lot of that same repetitive beating over and over.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
But it was a little bit easier to control.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:59.000
I think you're always going to find floatiness in an MMO.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:05.000
You know, just the nature of multiplayer, not to mention massively multiplayer, things are a hell of a lot more difficult.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:12.000
And so, for the foreseeable future, until internet and processing speeds and everything else improve dramatically,

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:18.000
MMOs may not be your cup of tea, as I've resigned myself to think right now.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:25.000
In the chat, the individual I keep saying is 13x forever, but Jason pointed out to me it might actually be Lex forever, L-E-X forever.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:31.000
It says WildStar, it's awesome for an MMO. I've been hearing a lot of good stuff about WildStar too, I want to check that out.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Lastly, since I kind of broke Jason's brain because he had to rush through reading my last email, here's a link to a huge roguelike wiki, since he said he likes them so much.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:52.000
O-R-G-U-E-B-A-S-I-N dot com. I will definitely be partaking of this as soon as I get back.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Assuming I don't just get back, crawl in bed, and pass out like immediately.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Thank you, Nasty Canasta.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:02.000
That's a phrase I like to utter on this show. Thank you, Nasty Canasta.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:06.000
One more email from Brozime.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Hey O-L-R, I'm a relatively new listener since about episode 500 and normally can't listen live due to work. However, having just listened to your discussion about the good and bad of streaming from last week, I would like to know what you think about the mandatory stream delay of about a minute on Twitch.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I think it's a huge issue since most streams I watch, I do so because the host interacts with the chat. For me personally, I stream to my friends to record commentary for YouTube.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Since they imposed this new delay in lieu of the consoles getting streaming functionality, it's been impossible to do either of the things we had the possibility of doing before.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:34:00.000
I really love listening to O-L-R to keep my brain working at work. Hope you guys stick around, and I'm sorry if my grammar isn't tip-top, dark sucker.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Well, thankfully you get the leeway of me, but unfortunately my own brain tiredness today packed everything.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I still got the sense of what was being said, and a funny little story that I wrote about the day before.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:25.000
My own brain tiredness today packed everything. I still got the sense of what was being said, and a funny little story that I want to relay to this listener is that, guess what?

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:36.000
When we do this show here at Orange Lawn Radio and interact with our chat room, we're facing the same delay because of the fact that the setup we have here is actually slower than Twitch.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:48.000
When we used to broadcast the video for this show live on Justin TV, just to give you an idea how long ago it was, when we used to broadcast the video of the show here and we had a different setup because we had the space that could accommodate for it better,

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.000
they would actually see things first on Justin before our listeners would hear it, which I always hated.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I mean, no disrespect, it's just the fact that I wanted the video to always be secondary to the audio because it is Orange Lawn Radio, but I'm digressing a little bit.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:13.000
My point is that you still can work with that delay. Don't let it ruin what you want to do. Just figure out how you can kind of adapt with that delay.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:25.000
But I'm not saying to you, oh, just suck it up, baby. I'm not saying that because, yeah, that sucks when you want to do that commenting and for the YouTube and you need to have that instant feedback.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I do run into that problem almost all the time. Shane and I will be live streaming things and he'll be on Skype and the way he sees the game is he's watching me on the feed.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:40.000
And I'll do something and he'll laugh or I'll laugh and he'll be like, what just happened? I have to describe it to him because he hasn't seen it yet.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:52.000
And it doesn't make for the best feed. But what makes for a better feed, and maybe this is something to think about, maybe it'll work for you, maybe it won't, is if Shane and I or whoever I happen to be gaming with, if we're playing the game together,

02:35:52.000 --> 02:36:03.000
then if something funny happens, we both just saw it in the game. He's not having to rely on my feed. I realize that doesn't work for every scenario, but just think of it as a new barrier to work around.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Don't let it ruin what you're trying to do. But at the same time, it does kind of suck that people were used to it one way and then all of a sudden it changed.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:21.000
And if you did adapt to the old rules, it sucks to have the rules changed on you like that. But look at it as a challenge, not as something to end you.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:30.000
It's not a rule, it's literally a technical limitation. What would you rather have, a cap or low latency?

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000
And the answer is that two different people want two different things.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.000
I'm letting the e-mailer talk back to you right now.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:41.000
I'm letting the e-mailer speak for himself. Well, we're gonna be waiting here for a while.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
That's right, you wanna talk about delay.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:52.000
No, yeah, we covered that. And I don't think I ever realized that Twitch streams were near to live.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:56.000
I also have really no basis of comparison because it's people just doing their thing.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:03.000
And otherwise, you know, mostly popular people. And no, not even that.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:12.000
I've watched fighting game streams of my friend who doesn't read the chat except in between matches because you don't fight and watch chat at the same time.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:22.000
So I've not seen the content like Rob's talking about where the delay is that impacting.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Because in most other cases, you can't keep up with chat that actively because you're playing a game.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:37.000
What game doesn't... I guess Playroom is actually a real fine answer to answer that argument.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Yeah, but Playroom needs a delay and they need moderators.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:48.000
Chat needs to be... I don't know. Chatting like commenting too just scourges of so much of the internet.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Bobby Blackwolf would like you to know that we actually did talk about this in the segment at the end of his show last week when he calls us.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.000
So a cheap plug for the Bobby Blackwolf show if you do wanna hear us talk about this a little more.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.000
I gotta ask, we keep things moving though. Sorry, new e-mailer and I'm saying let's move on.

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:11.000
5.35, revisit our same arguments. It is unfortunate. Alternatives do exist. Do check out hitbox.tv.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Came out of the conversation last week. I looked at it today. It's gaming oriented but nothing in their terms say it has to be like literally a game.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:30.000
Alternatives exist. Find what works for you. Nico Nico, overseas. The Japan and now English site may also be feasible.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Maybe. Look for the tool that fits your needs. That's that.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:40.000
Alright, thank you very much for reading those. Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Hopefully next week we won't have an hour long Nintendo discussion at the top of the show and we can spend a little more time on those.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Nintendo bicker fight.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Alright, not really, not really. What I love about the show is that it's not really fighting, it's spirited debate.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:39:01.000
And yes, there is a big difference. There's a huge difference. Jason and I will hug it out later. Not in a sexual way. Get your head out of the gutter.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:07.000
But you know, I respect, just like Logie. Logie and I fight all the time on this stuff and it doesn't change anything.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:16.000
And we're still here. You three are here each and every. I've realized that this week. It's like, well yeah, we do this and we do this on the show.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:21.000
I'm like, wow, this has become mildly second nature to me because I've been doing it so regularly.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
And that's how we've done it for 12 years now.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:30.000
And I mean, I literally don't know what the fuck else I do with myself. Like when I don't have a show on Sunday, I'm always kind of like in my mind.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I have so much time on Sunday nights. Where did this come from?

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.000
And I'm like, oh, it's six o'clock. I should be on the air. Oh, I should be listening to Bobby. Right?

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Well, I usually am listening to Bobby anyway, unless we're both off and then it's like, you know?

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.000
All right. Anyway, focus. Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
This is fucked up.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Um, FU to my voice not being able to lay back and the lingering cough that will not escape, even though I feel better.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000
So, and then having to wake up at 6 a.m.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Mm-hmm. Uh, Jason.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
FU to Sunday drivers.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Frickin' Florian Perkins, Florian Perkins, whatever that road is down there.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Uh-huh.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
I'm doing like frickin' 15, 20 miles an hour down it.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Hey, don't tell the listeners where I live, please.

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:25.000
You don't live on Florian Perkins.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000
I know.

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:27.000
They know it's in Sacramento.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Yeah.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000
I think.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Yeah, they do.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Somewhere in this great place.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
We're moving soon anyway, so it wouldn't even matter.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Peace out, y'all.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:39.000
No, I just, it was so weird. It was trying to turn and everybody was taking their dear sweet time.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Although at the same time, I was also rushing because I literally got the intro done 15 minutes before the show started.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:48.000
So I couldn't have possibly influenced it.

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Um, there's probably another one, but whatever.

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:59.000
My FU goes to these popcorn kernels because it's the worst addiction, but I'm totally that guy when I have microwave popcorn.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Like I've got to find those kernels that are like half popped and eat them because it's the best part.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Don't give me that look.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
I'm not the only one that does it.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:07.000
I've just never heard of this before.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.000
You've never heard of it? You've got to try it because that's like the best part.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:12.000
I don't promise that I will.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.000
All right.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:16.000
Anyhow, um, Loki.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:20.000
Um, I guess FU being out of shape.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:24.000
Maybe you need to get a Fitbit like me. We'll have Fitbit contests.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
I don't know about that.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Me and Rob are friends on Fitbit now.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Yeah, we're friends on Fitbit.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.000
Hopefully, hopefully each of us will inspire each other to walk and maintain step counts.

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:35.000
I am not getting one.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.000
That's all right.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.000
As like I said before the show, different strokes for different folks.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000
All right.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:43.000
Let us do a couple more stories for you guys.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Then we'll get into the Skype line real quick tonight.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
I'm not going to leave it open forever.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
So if you want to get through, you're going to have to call pretty quick.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Two more stories first though.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
Starting with Loki.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:59.000
So hey, do you have an Oculus Rift and you happen to be a fan of Ready Player One?

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Well, there's a tech demo for you.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:04.000
And that would be the Stax Rift demo.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:10.000
It allows you to walk through one of the locales of Ready Player One,

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:16.000
which is stacks of mobile homes making these mobile home skyscrapers.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.000
So you can actually wander around those and check it out.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Looks kind of neat.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
All righty.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Too bad I don't have an Oculus Rift and I haven't read Ready Player One.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000
But as a fan of the book, does this look interesting to you from what you're seeing?

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
All right.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Moving on, this looks great too.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
I need this game.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
This YouTube was all over Facebook and Twitter and stuff.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
If you haven't seen it, please look it up.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:45.000
It's a game called Cat Lateral Damage.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.000
It's Cat Lateral Damage.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
I saw this on a Tuesday.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
This is so good.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
I'm sorry, Jason.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
I'm going to have to play a video here.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Isn't that the game that Loki brought up for his game?

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Oh, you had the name wrong?

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
He might have mentioned it during his gaming week.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:09.000
But yes, you play a cat and what you do is you run around and you knock things off.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Why? Because you're a cat.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Much like Loki's cat that he's complained about the last two weeks.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
So you run on these surfaces and that's all you do.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:21.000
And if you break enough valuables, you get combo points and so on and so on.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:24.000
It's a free download for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Oh, I didn't even know it was already out.

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:30.000
It needs maybe some work with sound effects a little bit.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
I mean, it is still in early alpha, but I love the concept.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.000
This could be like a Katamari Damacy style game.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:40.000
I'm sure it was inspired by cats in general and any owner understands.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:48.000
But the particular inspiration in my mind from this game came from one very specific place.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
You know what that is?

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.000
A little meme image that consists of a cat on a ledge with the words,

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Fuck this thing, fuck that thing, fuck this thing in particular.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Fuck that, fuck that thing in particular.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Yes, I love that.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000
I posted a picture, it was called CEO Kat.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Kat, person sitting at a desk.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.000
I should buy a boat.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Oh no, the one where he tips the coffee mug off the desk.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:14.000
I think I saw it recently, it was probably during the show, but yeah.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Sitting at a desk all nice.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Tip!

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Perfect.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Exactly.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:20.000
So good.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Ah cats.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Alright.

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
That's what the internet was really made for.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
We are going to open up the Skype line.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:27.000
It's open now.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:31.000
1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.000
If you have something you want to call in to the show to talk about tonight.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.000
Maybe, excuse me, something we talked about already or something we neglected to bring up.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Or a game you've been playing this week or maybe you have a thought on this whole Nintendo thing.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Go ahead and give us a call right now.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.000
The Skype line is open, but it will not be open very long.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Please hurry.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Meanwhile, while we wait for those calls to come in.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Let's see if there's any last minute stories.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Loki, I always check in with you for last minute stories.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:45:02.000
Yeah, there's a pretty cool ENB mod that's for Skyrim that's supposed to fix some of the memory problems that the game has.

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:08.000
And allows for draw distances which are really a lot bigger than they had more characters on screen.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
And apparently less crashes and takes up less memory.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
So, that's pretty cool.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Alrighty.

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Oops, I'm sorry guys. I was hanging up on some of these calls accidentally because I'm on the iPad.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.000
And it's like when I get multiple calls at once, it goes crazy.

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:29.000
So, go ahead and try to call again.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Orange Launch Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Geez, Rab.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Well, I wanted to take the first one because it's somebody that doesn't call into the show very often.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:41.000
But then as soon as I was about to hit the button, another one came up and I was like,

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:46.000
Oh, I want to talk to the first one there because it probably has to do with the story we were just talking about.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
So, I'm hoping they call back.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:51.000
But if they don't, I'll go ahead and take another one.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000
But we have a stream delay.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
Alright, there we go. I think I got it.

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
So, let us go to the phones.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
That cat GIF is the best GIF ever.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:03.000
It is the best GIF, isn't it?

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
The best GIF ever.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
That's right. What's on your mind, buddy? How you doing?

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Hey, so this is Bobby and I wanted to correct a little bit for the emailer who was talking about Twitch.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Yes, please. Go for it.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Because I remember, Plug Plug, you were talking about this on your show, were you not?

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Yes, I was.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:27.000
And he said in the email that Twitch is imposing this delay and they're making it a mandatory delay.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
They're not.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:34.000
The actual technical side of it is basically Twitch got popular.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:39.000
And the way they were doing streaming the old way was not going to be sustainable.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:42.000
It was crashing. There were a lot of people having dropped streams.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
I was having dropped streams.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
It was getting unbearable to watch Twitch.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:50.000
I'm already surprised that they can maintain what they've got.

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Especially with the PlayStation 4 and now they want to get Xbox One in and on it too. It's crazy.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:02.000
But it's actually, and they did this before, they had decided to do this before they added the consoles.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:07.000
So they switched to a new streaming protocol but unfortunately it introduced latency.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:17.000
And they're apparently working to lower the latency but it was either have the latency or have more people leave Twitch because nobody could stay connected to the stream.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:23.000
And it was an unfortunate trade-off. And yes, Twitch has gotten so big and everybody's like, well I'm going to go to Hitbox and I'm going to go here.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:29.000
And that's great. You can go there and then when they get too big, they're going to have to switch to do, you know,

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:35.000
they're going to have to do the same new streaming and they're going to introduce latency and everybody's going to leave there and go somewhere that's smaller.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:42.000
And it's going to be a cycle. Until they figure out how to lower the latency, it's unfortunately going to have to be there.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:47.000
It's not Twitch saying, oh it's the consoles, we have to have one minute of latency.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:54.000
No, it's just unfortunate reality of the internet right now and hopefully smart people are working on it to stop that.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:00.000
Yeah. I mean, I just, you know, again, maybe I'm spoiled because I've done this show for so long where we've always had that built in.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:07.000
So I've kind of had to think of a way to work around that. I just kind of like, you know, try to look at it as an opportunity where how can I repurpose what I'm doing?

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:14.000
And, you know, to be fair, maybe I'm not, you know, because I don't rely on that two second delay or what have you.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:22.000
I'm a little more, you know, I don't get as upset about it, but I'm just kind of like, I'm like, well, you'll make it work. We all have, you know.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:25.000
Or you could just, I mean, there's going to be competition, which is great.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:36.000
That's true. And that's true. Leaving Twitch and going somewhere else isn't necessarily, I don't want to say it's a bad idea, but I mean, the competition is, I've always said, I'm really surprised nobody's really competing with Twitch out there.

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:44.000
After these numbers that came out this past week, though, were like, what is it, more people are watching Twitch than Hulu Plus and watching like Spike TV or something like that.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Like it's, it's because there's so many viewers consistently watching all this programming out there. It's, it's pretty crazy.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:55.000
So I'm really surprised that a lot of other companies don't want a piece of it.

02:48:55.000 --> 02:49:02.000
I'm really, really surprised that the Xbox streaming is not going to be done through some type of Skype thing. I'm really surprised at that.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Maybe they're rethinking that.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Maybe, maybe.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:10.000
So, yeah, so I just wanted to kind of correct that because I know there's a lot of misinformation that Twitch is being evil.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
They're not being evil. They're trying to stay afloat.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:18.000
And this is a very unfortunate and crappy side effect for some people.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Because I know people, they do speed runs or stuff like that, and they don't remember what happened 30 seconds ago that everybody's talking about.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.000
And they're so used to, for the past couple of years, having one or two second delays.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
They're not used to it.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:37.000
And, you know, for gaming, this is a problem that is mainly for gaming streams.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:42.000
It's a gaming stream problem. I don't think any other type of streaming really has this kind of problem.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:46.000
But this is a new problem that needs to be addressed.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Hopefully people are working on it to make it work with low latency and able to handle a whole bunch of viewers.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Alright, well Bobby, I appreciate the call as always to help us, help keep us adrift here on what's going on.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Quickly, everybody tune into the Bobby Black Wolf show who is on at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern here at VOG.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000
But if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, as a lot of people do, such as that emailer.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Be sure to check out Bobby Black Wolf on Stitcher and iTunes and all the usual places, right?

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:15.000
Yep, that's it.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Alright, there, I'm doing the plugs for you. It's all good.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Also, audiblepodcast.com.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Alright, take care Bobby.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:22.000
See you Bobby.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Thanks.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Alright, we're going to go ahead and open it up.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Again, 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.000
And we'll take that call.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Um, Loki, did you get all your last minute stories out? Was it just that one?

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Yeah, it's a slow news week.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Yeah, I was going to see, I was in the middle of it.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
There wasn't really any tweets that I saw.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Was there no tweets?

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Couple shoutouts, something out of context about dog style from last week.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000
I don't remember if that was-

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Oh, that was funny though.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I don't remember if that was release dates or what we were talking about.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:56.000
My ego loves it when people quote, or when people tweet quotes from the show.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:57.000
Like, my ego really, really loves that.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
But let's get into some more calls.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Hey, this is Act Deaf.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
There's a legendary attacking you!

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Run!

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:08.000
There's like a Pokemon thing on your head. I love it. What's up?

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Yeah, it's a Pokeplus, a battle from the Pokemon Y legendary.

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:23.000
Uh, well, first of all, the guacamelee, or guacamelee, that, uh, let's get that out of the way.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000
In Spanish, it would be guacamelee.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Ah.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:36.000
So it's, uh, yeah, it's kind of like guacamelee, but yeah, well, it's similar in that spec.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Well, whatever.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:40.000
But whatever it's called, it's a great game, right?

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Yeah, it's a really great game.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:46.000
I also tried it because of another podcast I listened to.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
They were talking about it.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:56.000
And how it's referential to a lot of Mexican, and also Dia de los Muertos, so Day of the Dead.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.000
And it's a reference to that, so it's a pretty cool game.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:04.000
And then, yeah, but it has a lot of references and all that.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:07.000
But aside of that, another thing.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:12.000
It's not Bobby, I love you and I respect you, but it's not Jeff.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
It's not Peanut Butter, it's Jeff.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:20.000
And I'm gonna start saying that in Spanish, like, heff.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:25.000
So, that's to trick off people, because, seriously.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Yeah, guys, I'm gonna go back to my Bay Area job and work for GitHub.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:32.000
This debate will never, ever end.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:36.000
We're just gonna have to live with it, and it's just what we'll have to do.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Yeah, definitely.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Well, my call was pretty much about the Nintendo thing.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:48.000
And basically it was, hey, Nintendo week.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Yeah, wasn't it a crazy week?

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:55.000
I hated that headline, though, that said they admitted they flopped, because that's not true.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Those headlines have been here for...

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:02.000
They've been ongoing for literally a year now, if not longer.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:05.000
And we weren't hating them in studio, to be honest.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:12.000
Like I said, I am still going to buy the console, and I am still in support of Nintendo.

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:18.000
I understand exactly what people are saying, and I think, without reiterating my points,

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:22.000
I think my argument was the best I could possibly say on this matter.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:27.000
But, yeah, I see these articles a lot.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
I don't know if I've said it on this show.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:32.000
There's a quote that I thought of.

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:35.000
I don't know if I heard it before, or if I truly made it up.

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:40.000
But, in the case of punditry, in the case of news and this kind of stuff,

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:45.000
death and failure are the easiest thing to predict, because both are inevitable.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:48.000
But that's all, like so many people talk about.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
It's disheartening, really.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Yeah, it's really hard to bear on this type of news,

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:58.000
because all people are, oh, Nintendo's gonna go out of business,

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:02.000
they're gonna start publishing for other people or other consoles,

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:08.000
and a lot of stuff that there's really a lot to go through to get to that point.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:14.000
And right now, while Nintendo isn't doing that great, to be honest,

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:19.000
but still, they're doing it decently.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:26.000
They over-expect it, or something I had said on another site,

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:32.000
that they had a high expectancy of selling their console.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Absolutely.

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:40.000
So it was really over-exploded, or, well, you get the idea in this case.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.000
Now, I have a feeling I know where you might be going with this,

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
so I want to kind of prod you with this question here.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:49.000
What else is contributing to Nintendo's bad week?

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Well, yesterday or, I don't remember if yesterday or Friday,

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Polygon published an article on their site,

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:08.000
and basically, it was about an Earthbound person that worked on the Earthbound localization team.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:12.000
He was going to publish a book, and he was going to promote it on Kickstarter and all that,

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:19.000
and it looked like a really good project, an interesting one.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:28.000
But Nintendo said, no, cease and desist, and, well, the project is cancelled.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:34.000
And now people are calling Nintendo and saying that they're dicks because they cancelled the project,

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:43.000
and it was going to be something that it was not going to even sell for a profit.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:47.000
So, oh, they're saying Nintendo are dicks and this and that.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:55.000
But basically, if you read the article, it says that the person did contact Nintendo beforehand.

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Sorry if there's echo.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Is there?

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
What's that? No, you're fine.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Okay.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:11.000
He basically contacted Nintendo, and he is under an NDA.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Yeah, I mean, as most people, when they sign up for a job or whatever, they're usually under NDA.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:20.000
They can't be talking about the process or so forth.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:23.000
I would think, though, after so long, it's whatever.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:27.000
We always get expose books on politics and even movies and so forth,

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
so video games, I wouldn't think would be any different.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:36.000
But I also get why Nintendo wants to shut it down because this guy would be making a profit off of a Nintendo IP.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Like, I get it.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:44.000
The fact that Nintendo is shutting it down doesn't surprise me, and I don't see it as them being dicks.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:48.000
It does make me go, well, what are you so afraid of, Nintendo?

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:52.000
But at the same time, I kind of go, eh, I bet a lot of companies in their position would do that.

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:56.000
If you don't, in the land of trademarks, if you don't protect it, you lose it.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.000
So they actually have a very significant reason to do this, unfortunately.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Yeah, but can't they give him, like, instead of not protecting it, can't they give him permission to do it?

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Something that I was discussing with other people, especially on GameFAQs, it's mostly a copyright reason.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:22.000
It's basically they're protecting their IP, their product, because, yeah, even though he wasn't going to get a profit of it,

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:27.000
he was going to still sell it. It was going to be a sold product.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:28.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:35.000
And I was saying something that probably would have been a, would have been, sorry, a great alternative.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:42.000
He would have published a blog or a PDF, an e-book, basically, online.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Do it for free.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:47.000
And I don't think Nintendo would have stopped that.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
I kind of think that's probably what's going to end up happening.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:54.000
If he really wants to tell the story, it'll probably get on the internet somehow. So, all right.

02:57:54.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Yeah, basically. And I was, I was seeing the example of a Starman.net, the makers of the, of the Mother 3 translation.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Yeah.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:06.000
They didn't get stopped. So what's...

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:16.000
But money, money was never, money was never, ever involved as opposed to, you know, funding investments up front and after the fact selling.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:23.000
The difference with the translation is that it, it was, it, you know, there was definitely a lot of groundswell and a lot of people knew about it,

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:31.000
but money was never an object, at least not in large amounts from the, from, from everyday individuals.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.000
They weren't, they weren't selling the game. They weren't selling the patch.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:39.000
That's a fair point, though. It does seem weird that Nintendo never shut that down, but they'll shut this down real quick.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:42.000
But I, I get, I get what you're both saying. So, all right.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:45.000
All right. Akdeft, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:49.000
And I appreciate you talking about the Earthbound thing, too, because that's a good story to share. So...

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
Well, thank you for having me.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.000
All right. Take care, my friend. And I hope that Pokémon doesn't eat you. All right. Bye.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Bye.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:02.000
All right. I am going to have to close up the Skype line. I am so sorry to those who didn't get through, but just, we got to end here, wrap up.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:06.000
I'm sorry we ran a little long. Those things happen. But please feel free to write your thoughts down and send them on over.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:16.000
mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send your emails, and you can also do tweets, twitter dot com slash o-l-r and all that good stuff.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Is there any other last minute story, excuse me, last minute stories, Loki? Sorry, I don't know if I...

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:27.000
I was going to say that I just saw this one real quick here.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Yep.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:38.000
We're using the Oculus Rift, and also a Wii remote that allows you to play Quidditch.

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:41.000
That sounds really cool, actually.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:44.000
That's the game that people want to play, I think.

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:45.000
That's very cool.

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:46.000
That's pretty cool.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Yeah.

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:56.000
Alright. Loki, good luck with everything next week, and I didn't have any tweets to read.

02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:10.000
I guess I will say this real quick, though, because as I was going back through the twitter thing, I did notice a conversation that Bobby and I were having with one of our fellow indie podcasters, Godfrey over at Gamertag Radio, and he puts on a really great show.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:18.000
It's a very different vibe than what we do here, but that's the great thing about indie podcasting is that we all kind of do our own thing and use our own voices.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:28.000
He had a lot of good stuff to say about the experience of being nominated for a podcast award seven times and still not, unfortunately, winning and kind of seeing what's going on with all that stuff.

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Does it make him Susan, what's your face?

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:35.000
They kind of are the Susan Lucci, unfortunately, but what they do there is really great.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:40.000
So just kind of a handshake of support and a hug to those guys over there.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:44.000
I think what they do are great and what a lot of independent producers do are great.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:49.000
And I, for one, am getting a little sick of supporting these awards.

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:55.000
I know we've asked a lot for people to support and vote for podcast awards and stitcher awards and so forth.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:59.000
But, you know, especially in the case of I'm just going to name names. Sorry about it.

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:05.000
In the case of the Stitcher Awards, I didn't see a single indie in the gaming category or over the map at all.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:10.000
So I'm just kind of like, you know what, we could use our resources.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:20.000
You know, I know it's good exposure to get nominated for those things and so forth, but we could use our resources to better promote our show, better promote other indie shows and better promote this stuff.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:26.000
So I'm just going to say, as far as all this award show stuff goes, as far as getting our listeners to clickbait all this stuff.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.000
I mean, if a jury judge award thing comes around, then sure, we'd love to be considered.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:36.000
But as far as asking you guys to do this, no, we're done. We're done.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:39.000
No more clickbait award shows. We're done.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:45.000
So anyhow, hooray for indie podcasting, by the way.

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.000
Yes.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
I just want to get that thought out there at some point.

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Loki, good luck with everything this week and I can't wait to have you back on the show, but take all the time you need and we'll be thinking about you.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:01.000
And we expect regular updates on Twitter and so forth.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:02.000
Alright, you got it.

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:03.000
We want pictures of the small person.

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:04.000
Yes, we do.

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Okay, well.

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.000
I'm sorry, the smaller person, because you already have a small person.

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:09.000
That is true, yes.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
Well, Loki, your final thought?

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:22.000
My final thought is I need to go back and watch some more of the, what was it, the Skate 3 glitch videos I watched the other night and I literally got tired of laughing.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:37.000
It was just hilarious. I mean, and I've seen those videos numerous times before, but the guy, I really wish I remembered what his YouTube name was, but he seriously makes this into like an art form.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:42.000
I don't even know how he does half the stuff he does in that game, but it's amazing.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:48.000
DarkSoccer, you two are starting a new adventure tomorrow of a different sort, so best of luck with everything.

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:49.000
Thank you.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000
We'll be thinking about you too. And your final thought tonight?

03:02:52.000 --> 03:03:00.000
I've had to reset my sleep schedule, so I'm actually super tired and I have to be up at six in the morning, so I will be going right to bed as soon as I get home.

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Thanks for the booze.

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:03.000
You're welcome, enjoy it.

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Jason, thank you as always for being here.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:07.000
Absolutely.

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Sounds like your next week might be the last week we have you here for a while.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Possibly, yeah, depends on the way everything shakes down.

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.000
We'll see how that works out, but for now, any final thoughts for our listeners?

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:24.000
There's a Twitter account, emergencyNSF, and I opened it up and the first thing I see is a structure fire.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.000
Crews just entering garage on fire on Dolores at 25th Street.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
It's from two days ago, so I'm not actually that worried.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:44.000
Seems the Bay Bridge is still up, the new Bay Bridge is still up, so I'll be able to make it back in and settle down and sleep probably another four hours because last week was insane because there were a bunch of co-workers in for a particular purpose.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:57.000
This week, my team is in town. Literally my entire team except for one individual is in town. It's gonna be kind of insane and wonderful all at the same time. It's gonna be a good week.

03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:02.000
And that YouTuber, I just remembered his name, HelixSnake. Go look him up.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:07.000
My final thought as always, thank you guys for taking the time out to listen to the show. Support independent broadcasting.

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:16.000
We appreciate you helping to spread the word about the show. Leave a nice review on iTunes or on Stitcher or anything like that.

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:20.000
Unlike award show nominations, that stuff really does help, so we really appreciate that.

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Help spread the word. Word of mouth is all we got because I don't got millions of dollars to advertise. I don't have a big website backing me up.

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:38.000
It's independent and home grown, so help us continue to grow and bring more mature, intelligent voices to the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
And many different definitions of the word.

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:46.000
Alright, have a great week everybody. We'll be back next week to do it all over again. See you next time. Bye bye.

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:54.000
