7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Tonight, the news is exciting as it ever is. However, we'd like to take this moment to send our congratulations to Loki, along with Miss Loki and Baby Loki, on the arrival of newest Baby Loki this week. Congratulations! And now, on with the show.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	34000	That's right. Congratulations. This story is happy.
34000	36000	Yay! Congratulations!
36000	38000	Voice makers, confetti.
38000	40000	Hooray for genetics.
40000	50000	Celebration. Hey, welcome back everybody. My internet friends and everybody out there. Tune in to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
50000	59000	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host. Say hello, of course, to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
59000	60000	Blarg.
60000	61000	How are you doing?
61000	62000	Blarg!
62000	63000	Blarg. That was a very happy kind of blarg.
63000	64000	Yes, it was.
64000	65000	Yeah.
65000	66000	I'm okay. I'm just tired.
66000	71000	I know you have been settling in at Cool New Job, and things are going very coolly.
71000	74000	Since I am not going to be telling anybody where I work.
74000	75000	It's fine. I don't either.
75000	78000	I've decided that it is called Cool Job.
78000	79000	Cool Job.
79000	81000	And that I really like Cool Job.
81000	83000	I'll call mine Fun Job, and you can have Cool Job.
83000	85000	You have Fun Job, I have Cool Job.
85000	86000	Alright.
86000	88000	But, but, but, but...
88000	90000	Jason can have Hand Job.
90000	91000	Hahaha.
91000	92000	Alright.
92000	93000	But, but I have to say...
93000	94000	Wow!
94000	95000	Oh hey, Jason. How you doing?
95000	96000	Wow!
96000	97000	I...
97000	99000	No, your job's really cool, though, too.
99000	100000	I just have to say one little thing, though.
100000	106000	I have been walking around in my N7 hoodie, and have been called Shepherd no less than eight times during the last week.
106000	107000	They get it.
107000	108000	That's a good sign of a good workplace.
108000	109000	Yes, it is.
109000	110000	That's a good sign.
110000	111000	Hey, Jason. How you doing?
111000	112000	Hi.
112000	118000	I mean, I shouldn't be averse to that, because that falls in line with the trend of things that are at least mildly pleasant.
118000	119000	One would hope.
119000	121000	A hand job is a very good thing.
121000	123000	So, you know what?
123000	127000	It's okay. I couldn't think of any other insert, insert here job.
127000	128000	Oh wow.
128000	130000	And Dark Soccer's doing the hand jive.
130000	132000	I'm doing the hand jive because, like, what was that?
132000	134000	A happy ending massage video.
134000	135000	Hahaha.
135000	136000	Oh god, that's a great YouTube.
136000	137000	Alright, anyway.
137000	140000	I smell a future fortune cookie.
140000	141000	Perhaps, perhaps.
141000	143000	That one is so visual that it doesn't work, so.
143000	145000	Voice of the show, Jason, back here for another week.
145000	146000	Hello.
146000	152000	Celebrating wintertime, which, welcome to California winter, by the way, where it hasn't rained for 45 days.
152000	154000	I was here for the brunt of it.
154000	161000	I talked about the miserably cold, like, second week of December, and in the Bay Area, it is getting much nicer, though.
161000	165000	It's been nominal all week, and will continue to be.
165000	168000	But we are going to have you at least one more week, right? We're going to have you next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday?
168000	171000	I... actually don't know.
171000	172000	Alright.
172000	177000	I don't know, I literally have no idea what's going to happen next week because I have been...
177000	182000	We did talk hand skin ball last week, and that is still the...
182000	183000	Hahahaha.
183000	188000	Maybe your job is hand job. Hahahaha.
188000	191000	You didn't even, you didn't even tell that to be funny.
191000	194000	I can't even pick the right words to make that even remotely better anymore.
194000	197000	You know what, just ignore my comments. Ignore my comments.
197000	201000	Pig skin ball. Hand ball. Egg ball.
201000	204000	These words are not making face.
204000	207000	I'd just call it wank ball and be done with it.
207000	208000	Alright.
208000	213000	I do intend to be part of some of a Super Bowl party with some friends next week.
213000	220000	I don't know when it will start, if I'll duck out at the half. I have no idea what my specific plans are.
220000	223000	We will play it by ear, like we usually do. Like I usually do, anyways.
223000	226000	Well, we will be having a Puppy Bowl party next week.
226000	230000	I'll go ahead and say, I was going to tease this during the segment later where we talk about the plugs and stuff,
230000	237000	but I will be saying, live in studio on Orange Lawn Tradio for the first time in several years.
237000	240000	It's probably been about five years since we've had this guy on Orange Lawn Tradio.
240000	244000	Many of you know him, however, from his time on Hoard House.
244000	249000	Shane will be here live next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday.
249000	254000	So that's going to be a fun show. Or as Shane would say, whatever.
254000	263000	You know what, I know we're calling it Puppy Bowl Sunday, but my usual nickname for the bigger event that day is going to be...
263000	267000	Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There is no bigger event than where Keyboard Cat plays halftime.
267000	272000	For the more nationally accepted event...
272000	273000	Fine.
273000	278000	Could possibly be accurate. The Super Bowl.
278000	279000	The Super Bowl.
279000	280000	The Super Bowl.
280000	281000	The Super Bowl.
281000	286000	All right. So anyway, we do need to say, of course, Tech Master Loki, not here in studio tonight.
286000	289000	As you probably guessed, he has the night off because...
289000	291000	He better be rubbing his wife's feet.
291000	295000	Because Mrs. Loki did deliver the child on Tuesday.
295000	300000	So congratulations to Loki and Mrs. Loki on the newest addition to their family.
300000	303000	And I can tell you the name. The name is...
303000	307000	They named their child because remember he was teasing. It had a video game reference in it.
307000	310000	So they named their child Daniel Layton.
310000	316000	That's right. The kid's name is Professor Layton, which is kind of awesome.
316000	317000	You know what my husband said?
317000	318000	Huh?
318000	319000	Good name.
319000	320000	I know, good name, right?
320000	322000	Because I married a Dan.
322000	326000	Well, you and Dan have talked about when that day inevitably comes.
326000	328000	I don't know if you're still like serious about this or not, but...
328000	330000	It's probably not bloody likely.
330000	333000	You were tossed around the idea of Richter as a name, right? At some point?
333000	341000	Yeah, and then we've decided that if we had a girl we'd go after a name each for one of our grandmothers.
341000	344000	And then a name each for one of our uncles.
344000	345000	Ah.
345000	352000	Because we are very proud of our uncles and he does not want a Daniel Peter 3.0.
352000	353000	I see. That's fine.
353000	354000	Because Dan's a junior.
354000	355000	Ah, okay.
355000	356000	So half the family calls him Pete.
356000	357000	Okay.
357000	359000	Because his dad is Dan. But not me.
360000	363000	Professor Layton, they're setting him up for a lifetime of a student loan debt.
363000	365000	I think... right.
365000	370000	I should, just to clarify, they do spell Layton a little differently.
370000	371000	L-A-I-G-H.
371000	373000	No, I think there's an E in it in 7A or something like that.
373000	379000	And so I don't think they actually named it off the video game character. I think it's just one of those things.
379000	382000	Well, yeah, they don't want their son to get sued for copyright.
382000	383000	I mean...
383000	385000	Yeah, we'll talk about that later.
385000	391000	I'm pretty sure Mrs. Loki probably said, what about this name? And then Loki probably went, yes, yes, that name will work.
391000	401000	I do have to say though, and I've made this observation just as a Jewish convert, that while Mrs. Loki is not super observant, all of her children have had Jewish names.
401000	402000	Yeah.
402000	406000	So I have... that has not gone unnoticed.
406000	408000	So there you go.
408000	411000	And they sound like normal names to me. So two ways.
411000	414000	I do not know when Loki will be back.
414000	419000	He can take as much time off as he needs, and I'm sure we all understand. So that's that.
419000	425000	We'll miss him, but we're all thinking about him and his growing families. That's amazing.
425000	426000	Anyhow...
426000	429000	Nellie, I'm sorry, is gonna be...
429000	430000	Go ahead, quickly.
430000	432000	Is gonna be... tired.
432000	433000	Yeah, well...
433000	434000	Like I said...
434000	435000	They all are.
435000	436000	He better be rubbing her feet.
436000	437000	They are all gonna be tired.
437000	439000	He better be getting her whatever she wants, and he better be waking up a baby.
439000	447000	So anyway, let's talk about our growing family. You guys in our chat room, the always present other panelists on the show.
447000	456000	Live.vognetwork.com is where we tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
456000	462000	And if you do happen to be listening to this show live, head on over to our chat. Again, that's live.vognetwork.com.
462000	471000	And you may get your comments right on air. Sometimes epic debates on this program have started from a simple chat comment.
471000	474000	So bring it, y'all.
474000	480000	Go into our chat room. We'll let Locopoco start us off, commenting on the name. Daniel Layton.
480000	486000	Locopoco says, you must solve this puzzle or else you get no dinner.
486000	488000	That's cruel, but funny.
488000	492000	Alright, Raginator says, so no tingle Layton then.
492000	498000	I think Loki was going to stay far away from the name Tingle, that's for sure.
498000	503000	Some folks talking about the Super Bowl, and Brad from Pod Culture reminding us it's going to be the Weed Bowl.
503000	506000	And Rama's saying it's the Smoke-A-Bowl.
506000	510000	I call it the, I don't give a shit bowl, how about that?
510000	517000	I just, yeah. You know what, we've got our thing, video games, some other folks have their thing, football.
517000	523000	Some people have both, which is cool. If next Sunday's a big deal for you, have fun with it.
523000	528000	You know, just be safe, drink in moderation, don't drink and drive, all that stuff. Have fun with it.
528000	529000	We'll still be here doing our thing though.
529000	535000	So I did not finish last week's video because I was quite sick and quite busy this week.
535000	536000	Fired!
536000	541000	But, how have I never heard of Super High Impact before?
541000	542000	What?
542000	543000	You hadn't heard of that before?
543000	549000	I have never played, seen, heard of it before, and I looked up footage for use in the video.
549000	556000	And I just lost, pleasantly lost 30 minutes of my life watching the game being played.
556000	558000	It's the game that growls at you.
558000	562000	It was the most ridiculous, greatly ridiculous thing I've ever seen.
562000	564000	Yeah, it's a fun game, isn't it?
564000	570000	That's the only football game that we had at my house for the longest time, was Super High Impact.
570000	573000	It was the other one for me, Tecmo Bowl, was the only one I could, you know.
573000	580000	I think it may have been, just based off the name, I was maybe averse to it for like, fighting game reasons or something like that.
580000	588000	But, I've played a lot of one-offs in my life, I've played a lot of alternative sports games in my life, missed that one somehow.
588000	590000	I will be correcting this sometime soon.
590000	593000	It actually was pretty fun, I mean, my brothers and I would play it.
594000	597000	And I just liked that it would growl at you every time you picked a play.
597000	599000	You'd go, grrrr, make that noise.
600000	602000	So, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.
602000	609000	We have several, actually, tonight, because I kind of hit a creative block tonight when I was trying to put together the show role.
609000	611000	I was like, what are we going to talk about for the kickoff topic tonight?
611000	616000	So, I did what I sometimes do when I hit a creative block and I crowdsourced.
616000	621000	I went to my Twitter feed and I said, guys, you must be a social media expert.
621000	622000	Apparently, right?
622000	627000	I went to my social media feed, I went to my Twitter and I said, hey guys, what should we do for a kickoff topic tonight?
627000	630000	And so, I got a few answers and I got some really good stuff.
630000	637000	And so, I want to just quickly, I don't want to have any long 45 minute kickoff topics like we had last week, right, Jason?
637000	639000	I don't know what you're talking about.
639000	646000	Well, funny enough, my buddy Ian, or AtariBarbie on Twitter, actually said, Nintendo financials.
646000	650000	And I said, you should probably go to last week's show, buddy.
650000	651000	Thanks, though.
651000	654000	But I understand. It's a three hour show. He's probably behind.
654000	657000	But AtariBarbie sent me another one that I thought was a really good kickoff topic.
657000	663000	So, let me start with this one. So, quickly, asking everybody here in the room, what does game of the year mean?
663000	669000	You know, this is January. You've got a lot of podcasts, a lot of media outlets catching up on there.
669000	671000	What was my 2013 game of the year?
671000	676000	And, you know, and I even talked about this a little bit on last week's show because I said, damn it.
676000	680000	You know, I mentioned my top five games of the year in the last show of December.
680000	685000	But then I played Guacamelee. And I was like, you know what, Guacamelee, whatever.
685000	690000	That really should have been, wait, didn't we find out that in Spanish, I'm pronouncing it right, anyway.
690000	694000	I played that game and it was like, shouldn't that have been one of my top five?
694000	699000	It very well probably should have been. I probably actually would rank that higher than Spelunky at this point.
699000	703000	So, although Spelunky is very good too, but my point is, you know, these things change.
703000	705000	So, what does game of the year really mean?
705000	713000	What does it mean when, I don't know, IGN does their big game of the year or, you know, Koopa Club podcast,
713000	717000	which Ian is a part of, does their game of the year? What does game of the year really mean?
717000	726000	Game of the year means to me that it has that sort of association for fond memories.
726000	731000	It's something that you'll come back to actively or passively.
731000	736000	If you're in the mood for it, great. If you're just looking for something to do and it seems to kind of,
736000	745000	you know, fill that need for being able to take in artistic or otherwise meaningful detail,
745000	747000	that you'll go back to it for that.
747000	752000	As we said in our top three, it does not just have to be this year.
752000	754000	It just has to be something that you played in this year.
754000	758000	And with the ever-growing size of libraries, you can miss things.
758000	762000	Like, I just found out that I missed something for two decades running.
762000	770000	It's a game that resonates with you in whatever way that's meaningful to you.
770000	772000	It's as simple as that.
772000	776000	I really think that, you know, game of the year, and we kind of talked about this disclaimer before we did ours,
776000	778000	it's really, there's no right or wrong answer, clearly.
778000	783000	It's whatever game to you had the biggest impact on you for that year.
783000	788000	Or, you know, the game that you look back and you say, dang it, that was my best gaming experience.
788000	794000	And everything I did the entire year, that game frickin' just smacked me with a two-by-four,
794000	800000	either with emotion, with beauty, with gameplay, replayability, whatever it is.
800000	802000	So mine would be Mass Effect every year?
802000	804000	Possibly, honestly.
804000	809000	When you look back on 2013, what video game are you going to say, man, that game defined 2013 for me.
809000	812000	That was a great year for gaming.
812000	816000	That was practically all I played was fractal.
816000	817000	Is that a bad thing?
817000	818000	No.
818000	822000	Just because she didn't go with the artistic choice of Gone Home?
822000	826000	Or she didn't go with the mainstream choice of The Last of Us?
826000	832000	Well, I think I picked Stanley Parable as one of my games because it made me giggle.
832000	836000	But here's the thing, when you're talking to you as an individual versus, you know, you've got,
836000	840000	I know Polygon did their list and had some interesting feedback
840000	844000	because they chose to name Gone Home their top game of the year, for better or for worse.
844000	851000	Or GameSpot, which I believe also named Zelda, Link Between Worlds, just like I did as my game of the year.
851000	860000	When you have an organization, it's a little bit different because now that list represents your company, your organization.
860000	862000	It's part of your branding.
862000	866000	Yeah, it's part of your branding. It really is. It's part of your editorial and so forth.
866000	874000	And I'm going to take, look, I'm going to take a lot of shit for what I'm about to say, but I'm just going to tell it like it is.
874000	878000	This is honest, Rob. I'm just going to tell it like it is.
878000	889000	Polygon's choice of Gone Home as game of the year makes a lot of sense for that organization because both those things are kind of, well, you know.
889000	890000	Quirky, quirky.
890000	892000	Yeah, all right, yeah. You know where I'm going with this, right?
892000	900000	A little bit, you know, whereas, you know, you got something a little more mainstream like GameSpot, you know, picks a little bit more of a mainstream choice or whatever.
900000	905000	You know, it's just, it kind of does match the branding of the organization in some ways.
905000	910000	So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
910000	918000	Black Wolf says, I remember getting crap from a listener because of what I chose as my game of the year did not move the industry forward in quotes.
918000	925000	Yeah, but Black Wolf, you are your show. You have every right to whatever the hell you want to pick as your game of the year and nobody can really refute that.
925000	928000	That is your game of the year. That's my opinion anyway.
928000	937000	Well, because it is an opinion and opinions aren't wrong per se.
937000	942000	It's opinions are something based from feeling which actually can't be necessarily quantified.
942000	946000	So he's right to pick whatever he wants.
946000	949000	Black Wolf in chat says, I liked Gone Home and I also like Polygon.
949000	954000	Don't get me wrong, I like both those things too. Gone Home was a great experience.
954000	958000	Not my game of the year necessarily, but that's just because there were so many great games last year.
958000	961000	That doesn't mean Gone Home was not a great experience. It was.
961000	963000	And I gave it a positive review and I talked about it the first time.
963000	970000	It's just the, it's kind of come to be accepted as the, how do we say it, pretentious choice?
970000	975000	I mean, I'm sorry to the developers of the game that worked very hard on it, I'm sure.
975000	979000	But I'm just saying it kind of has that reputation right now of being the pretentious choice.
979000	982000	So, you know, it makes sense that a pretentious news organization.
982000	985000	Anyway, let's see. I'm just telling it like it is tonight.
985000	987000	I've been sick all week. I don't care.
987000	990000	Well, Biologist calls him like a season.
990000	995000	Locopoco says, my game of the year of 2013 was Killer Instinct and not The Last of Us.
995000	1000000	Why? Because Killer Instinct is the type of game I love most and The Last of Us just doesn't.
1000000	1002000	It's just personal preference.
1002000	1007000	And you know what? If you're a fighting game fan, I fully expect that a game like Killer Instinct would top your list.
1007000	1009000	That game is gorgeous.
1009000	1010000	Right?
1010000	1019000	Like from, you know, I, I don't think I still have my Killer Instinct cart, but for the fighting games that I got in, that I actually got into, Killer Instinct ranks up there.
1019000	1028000	I was never particularly any good at it, but I still have concrete memories about it that I know exactly what the game was, how it played, what it looks like.
1028000	1035000	Not so much the N64 because I never owned one, a little bit maybe, but the SNES and the arcade versions 100%.
1035000	1038000	Booting it up on the Xbox One blew me away.
1038000	1043000	It was, you know, I, just knowing the progression of fighting games.
1043000	1054000	The fact that Street Fighter IV went in a slightly different direction where Tekken and, holy crap, what's the other fighting game series?
1054000	1055000	Um...
1057000	1058000	Soulcalibur?
1058000	1064000	No, there's an, uh, something, something alongside Tekken that's been frequently updated.
1064000	1065000	I want to say King of Fighters.
1065000	1067000	Yeah, the King of Fighters series has been.
1067000	1074000	It's very obvious I'm missing it, but like, as many fighting games with a continued series that have come out and have been more realistic and more realistic.
1074000	1077000	Street Fighter went more exaggerated and cartoony.
1077000	1079000	Fucking unbelievable.
1079000	1080000	I'm thinking Virtua Fighter.
1080000	1083000	Mortal Kombat and Injustice is what I'm thinking of.
1083000	1093000	Um, um, and so as all those games got more realistic and, and I want to say dark, but you know, just these, just these really serious tones.
1093000	1103000	Street Fighter went super cartoony and then Killer Instinct with all of these fake creatures still has so much depth and detail that is 100% gorgeous.
1103000	1109000	Um, shifting to another topic here, Kaishudo in chat says, my game of the year is Grand Theft Auto 5.
1109000	1111000	You know, I believe that was Loki's pick for game of the year.
1111000	1112000	And believe?
1112000	1118000	Right. And we all kind of sat here and went, duh, we could have, we could have named Loki's top three because his top three was what?
1118000	1121000	Like Saints Row 4, uh, Grand Theft Auto 5.
1121000	1124000	I mean, it was the, the, the Loki games you would expect, right?
1124000	1125000	Absolutely.
1125000	1127000	Just like the fighting game fans, you know, are going to pick and so on and so on.
1127000	1132000	So anyway, a pinball fan probably really enjoyed a pinball arcade, you know, whatever.
1132000	1134000	Anyway, good topic.
1134000	1135000	And thank you.
1135000	1136000	And everybody should listen to Koopa Club.
1136000	1137000	It's a fun, fun show.
1137000	1141000	By the way, I should have also added the Metallica pinball table to my list.
1141000	1143000	I didn't realize there was a Metallica pinball table.
1143000	1144000	It's kind of rad.
1144000	1148000	Yeah, they had it at, um, uh, California extreme last year.
1148000	1149000	Awesome.
1149000	1150000	Had a big thing for it.
1150000	1151000	It was actually really cool.
1151000	1155000	Let me do a quick, uh, suggestion that came from, I love this username on Twitter.
1155000	1158000	1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-T.
1158000	1160000	But the username says John.
1160000	1161000	So I'll, I'll say John.
1161000	1169000	John said, yeah, for Pokemon games, how come they don't have the Pokemon talk like in the show instead of the horrific chiptune growls?
1169000	1173000	Well, maybe I should roll that question over to next week when Shane's here because Shane's a Pokemon expert.
1173000	1174000	He'll, he'll be able to answer all that.
1174000	1180000	But I, my understanding, it's just limitations of the hardware because you have to remember that series dates back to the original Game Boy.
1180000	1184000	And that really, you couldn't do voice for 150 characters in the Game Boy.
1184000	1188000	Well, and the fact, and I think I had covered it when I did Pokemon as classic game.
1188000	1189000	Hint, hint.
1190000	1201000	That, um, it was actually a big thing that he got the growling noises to go out by, um, using the, uh, the midi processor to have them make any of those.
1201000	1210000	Yeah. That's the other thing about that series is that with all of the core games being on portables on, you know, non optical media, it's kind of at a disadvantage for storage space.
1211000	1218000	So to fit the entirety of the world, the entirety of the textures, the entirety of the items, all of the other data that goes into making up those games.
1218000	1225000	They, and not to mention relying on, um, synthesizers, synthesizers instead of samplers or mixing those up.
1225000	1232000	Uh, the, the limitations and the capacity is not exactly at a premium in the Nintendo mobile world.
1232000	1239000	Uh, I will say Pokemon XY though does have the actual Pikachu saying Pikachu, which is the most recognizable one from the cartoon series, obviously.
1239000	1244000	I wish they would have done more, but I, they crammed a lot of stuff into that little 3DS card.
1244000	1247000	All what, 650 or something like that?
1247000	1252000	Yeah, right. So, you know, when you start to get that many, I think they kind of had to pick and choose which ones they're going to give voices to.
1252000	1253000	So there you go.
1253000	1256000	Alright, two more kickoff topics here from Twitter.
1256000	1260000	Uh, this next one comes from my pal Ronnie Talbot on Twitter.
1260000	1270000	Uh, Ronnie was on Horde House, uh, a while ago, and he was actually, a lot of people have known him because he was on, um, uh, a reality show called Big Brother here in the US.
1270000	1275000	So we're, we're Twitter friends after that. Cause when he was a nerd on big, I like trashy reality TV shows and he was a nerd.
1275000	1278000	So it was like, Ronnie, what's up? We should be friends. And now we are.
1278000	1284000	Um, so Ronnie sent me a suggestion and I know he was bitching about this on Twitter the other night.
1284000	1292000	Ronnie says, how about why is the gaming community so cannibalizing in games like League of Legends?
1292000	1298000	They are so rude to each other. They never consider the concept of everyone sucks in the beginning.
1298000	1302000	They expect auto awesomeness. Hashtag not gonna happen.
1302000	1309000	That is so true though in so many online games and you know, I don't know, maybe this is more of a Horde House topic, whatever. Let's bring it up here.
1309000	1318000	There's oftentimes really toxic communities if for new players, you know, like if you're not good GTFO, right?
1318000	1325000	And I'm always kind of like, well then why do you play in public rooms if you don't want to play against all skill sets?
1325000	1333000	If you want to play against people that are good, find the good people and set up private matches or something like it always just kind of blows my mind how mean people are.
1333000	1347000	But especially in a game like League of Legends where teamwork is so important to success, like people get really ticked off when they get a new player because they'd rather throw their hands up and say, oh, I quit than trying to teach somebody how to play.
1347000	1360000	A reason is probably the fact that games like that are quantifiably skill based and when they face someone of noticeably lower skill then it's considered a waste of their time.
1361000	1369000	And when those games more or less have a minimum of 20 to 25 minutes, that's a reasonable chunk of time.
1369000	1377000	Yeah, you can steamroll them more often than not, but Starcraft, I don't know that I've really seen it so much in Starcraft.
1377000	1383000	You get those attitudes, but usually at the end and not at the beginning, not that that's different from the point that he was making.
1383000	1393000	But quantifiable multiplayer games and yeah, I don't know where to go beyond that.
1393000	1399000	I think it's as simple as when you don't have to look that person in the eye, it's much easier to be a dick to them.
1399000	1403000	Well that defines every single game ever, which is probably also quite a bit of truth too.
1403000	1406000	That's just the freaking internet. That's the internet.
1406000	1418000	When you get in one of those hyper competitive things where your success is dependent on your team, when you get somebody that's going to quote bring you down, a lot of people get frustrated and throw their hands up and quit and they don't want to take that patience.
1418000	1424000	I remember watching you stream Final Fantasy XIV one night and you guys were shaming your party.
1424000	1426000	They don't know what they're doing!
1426000	1428000	You have to teach this tank!
1428000	1429000	What the hell man?
1430000	1437000	I guess we're no better, I don't know, but another big difference is that we didn't say it like you're terrible.
1437000	1446000	And you legitimately were teaching them so that they would actually be able to get through the instance or whatever was actually going on that night.
1446000	1448000	The Titan fight was what we were doing that night.
1448000	1449000	I'll take your word for it.
1449000	1454000	Anybody who's played XIV knows the thrill of the Titan fight, so anyway.
1454000	1456000	I'm just nodding my head right now because...
1456000	1458000	Smile and nod, smile and nod.
1459000	1470000	The anonymous internet kind of sucks sometimes for that and I really wish those people who are not going to have any patience for new people would go find their little team and go play with that and nothing but that.
1470000	1474000	Because there's going to be new people and you just have to deal with it.
1474000	1481000	Like in Final Fantasy XIV, which I play an awful lot of, if I'm going to use the Duty Finder, I'm going to probably get people that are new.
1481000	1483000	Because they're using it too to find the people.
1483000	1493000	So I've got to wait for cutscenes, I've got to explain fights, and sure I might get frustrated but I'm not going to take it out on said person because everybody's got to learn somewhere.
1493000	1495000	I also remember...
1497000	1505000	It was a little different, E3 2004, I was wandering around with you when they had the Final Fantasy XI...
1505000	1506000	Oh, the year I won the computer?
1506000	1507000	Yeah.
1507000	1509000	And you were...
1511000	1512000	Because you were...
1512000	1515000	I'm waiting to see what words... choose your words carefully, Jason.
1515000	1518000	Yeah, because I've been doing that so well tonight already.
1518000	1519000	It wasn't like...
1519000	1520000	Hand skin ball.
1521000	1523000	Thanks for the reminder.
1524000	1531000	It was not nearly as bad as what I just referenced with Final Fantasy XIV.
1531000	1536000	You were still... you were disappointingly frustrated because the collective of people...
1536000	1539000	You didn't have a lot of confidence in your team, sir.
1539000	1543000	You were just like, I want to be able to do this because I know what's actually going on.
1543000	1545000	I want you guys to be able to keep up with me.
1545000	1547000	And so it was that excitement.
1547000	1549000	I wanted to win, dammit.
1549000	1556000	Absolutely. It was the frustration born out of eagerness, which is completely legitimate and always happens.
1556000	1560000	And again, with that slant of, you actually know what the hell is going on.
1560000	1563000	You're a fan on the floor that's here because you enjoy the game.
1563000	1565000	You already have experience with the game.
1565000	1570000	But by no means did you boss, take over, browbeat anybody else you were playing with.
1570000	1574000	Yeah, I didn't walk up to a total stranger on my team and go, why do you suck so fucking bad?
1574000	1576000	You lost this round for us!
1576000	1579000	Just kill yourself! And that's what people say in online games.
1579000	1581000	You know, I would never do that.
1581000	1585000	I might roll my eyes when they're not looking, but you know, that's the extent of it.
1585000	1591000	I want to say I remember that you kind of threw hints to whoever was closest next to you.
1591000	1593000	Maybe? I could be making that up.
1593000	1596000	I would hope, because helping them would help me win.
1596000	1600000	If I'm like, alright, cast this. Go find that guy, cast it. Hit the buttons. Do it, do it, do it.
1600000	1601000	No, the other buttons.
1601000	1602000	No, no, the other buttons!
1602000	1604000	I know there's a lot figured out! Let's do it!
1604000	1608000	Look, if I knew Ronnie's topic was just going to get me called out by Jason, I would never have read it.
1608000	1610000	Damn it, Ronnie. Alright.
1610000	1613000	Love you, Ronnie. Never met you, but love you already.
1613000	1619000	Moving on, one more little kick-off topic here from Flocko Jones.
1619000	1623000	If you visit VoGnetwork.com and ever read the comments, you know Flocko Jones.
1623000	1627000	He's the number one fan of Hoard House. He's a great guy. We love Flocko Jones.
1628000	1634000	Flocko says, because it's Grammy night. Oh yeah, that.
1634000	1636000	Award show.
1636000	1639000	Yeah, award show. Really though, I like this topic.
1639000	1643000	Maybe a discussion of your favorite video game music since it's Grammy night.
1643000	1648000	Or to be more topical, music from this year's games that should have been nominated like Journeys was last year.
1648000	1654000	Let's go with kind of, what soundtracks have you discovered recently that are really frickin' good?
1654000	1659000	I'm going to kind of generalize it in that way. What soundtracks have you discovered lately?
1659000	1662000	I saw Frozen on Friday.
1662000	1667000	I meant video games, damn it. Alright, that'll work though, I guess.
1667000	1675000	Alright. Anybody? I would say again, Guacamelee was a great...
1675000	1677000	To tip the coffee out of your hand.
1677000	1680000	Was a great, great soundtrack. I love that one.
1680000	1682000	Hotline Miami.
1683000	1685000	Hotline Miami did have a great soundtrack to it.
1685000	1690000	Oh, and Drunken Robot Pornography. No, it really did have good music.
1690000	1692000	That name makes me giggle, how can it not?
1692000	1695000	What about you guys in chat? Live.vognetwork.com.
1695000	1698000	And Fractal, if you just want good background ambience.
1699000	1700000	Jason?
1700000	1703000	I know I just added a bunch of soundtracks to my library.
1703000	1708000	I don't know that I've had something...
1708000	1712000	I've been very into a lot of...
1712000	1719000	I hate using the word traditional, but you know, composed music for public consumption and not just for the medium of games.
1719000	1725000	It's been a while since I've had something in gaming that has been that specific for me.
1725000	1732000	I've been listening to an awful lot of rogue legacy music lately, and that's fun and it fits the motif.
1732000	1738000	Beyond that, it's fine. I wouldn't call it the experience on the level we're talking about, though.
1738000	1743000	We've got a couple of people in chat, including Rama and Awesome Unicorn saying Link Between Worlds.
1743000	1745000	Of course, of course, it was great.
1745000	1750000	Let's see, Rama also says DuckTales Remastered. That was a really good soundtrack.
1750000	1751000	It was really good.
1751000	1754000	SG100Matt says Broken Age has a great soundtrack.
1754000	1757000	And Tal says Banner Saga.
1757000	1761000	So those are all some really good picks. Good job, you guys.
1762000	1764000	Thank you for picking up the slack, chat room.
1764000	1767000	Thank you for picking up the slack, because I was blanking a little bit on that question.
1767000	1769000	I was like, what if I played really recently?
1769000	1775000	I mean, I keep thinking back to older games and so forth, but I can't think of a lot of recent stuff.
1775000	1783000	Yeah, it's hard, because it's very much a secondary thing, and the easy cop-out is something where the music makes the game,
1783000	1788000	whether the obvious answers that we all know here are something like sound shapes or anything else along those lines.
1788000	1792000	Music is secondary, which usually helps to float the obvious ones to the surface.
1792000	1797000	Ooh, TigerClaw says, what about the Bioshock Infinite soundtrack? Yes.
1797000	1801000	I've been listening to the Minecraft soundtrack a lot lately. That's really good, too.
1801000	1803000	Chiptune artist C418.
1803000	1809000	Great stuff, great stuff. I know this is really cliche of me to say, but the music in this game really, really, really is good.
1809000	1813000	Final Fantasy XIV is so good. It's so good. So good.
1813000	1814000	One would hope.
1814000	1818000	All right, thank you guys for your kickoff topic suggestions. Those were all really great.
1818000	1823000	So thank you, Internet. You helped save the show. All right, thank you to the folks there that I read.
1823000	1829000	Let's get into our gaming week, so specifically, what types of video games have you been passing the time with this week?
1829000	1830000	DarkSakura.
1830000	1840000	I played some Final Fantasy XIV, because I actually had a few minutes one night instead of doing everybody else's stuff that I still have other stuff to do.
1841000	1842000	Wow.
1842000	1849000	I've been checking up on my village at work during lunch, and that's really about all the time I've had.
1849000	1857000	I've just been way too tired when I come home and having to catch up on all the stuff that I thought I had an entire month to do.
1857000	1863000	Tumblr will take like three hours to catch up on. It's totally true, though.
1864000	1871000	That's not really what I'm catching up on. Tumblr is what I do in the 30 minutes I have when I'm trying to wind down.
1871000	1874000	Learning is exhausting. Expanding your brain is very difficult.
1874000	1877000	I think just getting your body back in the habit of going to work.
1877000	1883000	Well, I just want to be on my new schedule already, because it means I get to sleep in and stay up later, because that's my normal.
1883000	1889000	But because it takes so long to drive to work and back, I'm just completely worn out by the time I get home.
1889000	1892000	I haven't even been to the gym last week, but then again, I've still had this cough.
1892000	1896000	And thank heavens you won't be working Sunday nights, so you can still do OLR.
1896000	1899000	Oh, no. I had an arrangement made.
1899000	1900000	Oh, good.
1900000	1903000	Because we could trade our schedules. We had a day to trade schedules.
1903000	1904000	Oh, nice.
1904000	1913000	So I said, hey, and he raids. So I was like, hey, if I get Saturday off and you get a Sunday off, we can trade like that.
1913000	1914000	Got it.
1914000	1920000	But then it turned out he gets off in time to get home for a raid, and I have a weekend.
1920000	1921000	Yay!
1921000	1928000	So because I was like, dude, I know maintaining, and he's in whatever guild he's in is like their top ranked.
1928000	1929000	Oh, nice.
1929000	1934000	On their server. Like they are going for progression and getting firsts. They have a bunch of firsts.
1934000	1935000	Nice.
1935000	1938000	So I'll have to have him call in on Horde House one day.
1938000	1939000	That'd be fun.
1939000	1948000	He's a cool guy. But yeah, I know I did play something else, because I was trying to, oh, yeah, I was playing fractal to veg out,
1948000	1957000	because what happened is when I tried to move over all my saves from my old Steam install, and my fractal saves for some reason never showed up.
1957000	1962000	So I have to start over, which sucks, but oh well.
1962000	1965000	All right. If that's it, we'll go.
1965000	1966000	That really is.
1966000	1972000	That's fine. You've been busy. We've all been sick too, which is very funny. Well, not funny.
1972000	1974000	Jason, what have you been playing this week?
1974000	1977000	We've been sick.
1977000	1980000	Every time I laugh, I start coughing hysterically. It's awful.
1980000	1991000	As you just said, and as I said previously, between my obligations from work this week, like I knew were going to happen, and then the fact that I was completely out on Friday,
1991000	2000000	I started putting together the video for 536 last night, and my brain was just saying that it wasn't going to happen.
2000000	2006000	So I decided instead that I wanted to stop talking about making some progress on a game, and I wanted to finish it.
2006000	2015000	I sat down, and I beat Rogue Legacy, which means completing the final two bosses and story clearing the game.
2015000	2025000	I am now at the point that I'm new game plus-ing and can continue through with the Nioh versions, whatever the term is for the alternative form of the main bosses,
2025000	2034000	and then just stat whoring and continuing to gather new upgrades, which I'm perfectly fine with because Rogue likes and I love them.
2035000	2040000	That's pretty much it. Literally just about two to three hours last night.
2040000	2044000	Beating a game is a pretty good accomplishment. That's more than I usually do, so congrats.
2044000	2051000	My gaming week. Pretty much more of the same stuff like Final Fantasy XIV. It takes up a lot of my time.
2051000	2059000	I don't usually review games based off the demo, but I feel like this demo is big enough that I should mention that I did play the Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns demo,
2059000	2062000	because I was very curious to see where this is going.
2063000	2068000	No, because you can't use the Ares costume in the demo.
2068000	2078000	It comes with a new costume that I guess carries over to the game, but otherwise you have like six costumes you can switch between in the demo.
2078000	2080000	There is a point to the costume thing. That's what I learned.
2080000	2088000	There actually really is a point to that because the little twist on the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns is that your party is lightning, lightning, and lightning.
2088000	2093000	That's your party. Basically you have three lightnings. I'm not making this up. You have lightning, lightning, and lightning.
2093000	2099000	It's just that you use this, I don't want to call it the dresh fear, but it sure feels like it to me.
2099000	2105000	You use the L1 and R1 to flip between the different lightnings that you have programmed.
2105000	2114000	So you might have like red mage lightning, dragoon lightning, and like paladin lightning or something in your party, and you can flip between them using L1 and R1.
2114000	2121000	And then you have like a meter that measures stamina, I guess.
2121000	2126000	So like you can use, let's say I flip to my warrior and then attack, attack, attack, attack, blitz, attack, attack.
2126000	2129000	Well then she runs out of stamina, so I have to flip really quick to my black mage.
2129000	2133000	Now fire, fire, fire, fire, blizzard, button mashing, those.
2133000	2137000	And while I'm playing as my black mage, my warrior is recovering stamina.
2137000	2143000	So it's like you play as one, run the stamina bar out, flip to another, run the stamina bar out, flip to another.
2143000	2151000	So it's an interesting little twist on the battle system. The demo is like really, really short. Really short.
2151000	2155000	It's like five random encounters, a boss fight, you're done.
2155000	2159000	And then, oh yeah, 25 minutes worth of cut scenes, because this is Final Fantasy 13 after all.
2159000	2161000	Because it's Final Fantasy we're talking about.
2161000	2163000	Yeah, especially Final Fantasy 13, right?
2164000	2172000	So they do try to push a little bit too of their more connected type of thing they're doing with Facebook and Twitter and kind of like an online thing.
2172000	2178000	Like you're supposed to be able to send like pictures and things online where people will be...
2178000	2183000	It's kind of like a Miiverse-style integration to me, except like items can be attached to the posts.
2183000	2185000	That's really what it felt like to me.
2185000	2191000	And you can put these posts on Facebook, because like I played through the demo twice, because it's so flipping short.
2191000	2197000	So the first time I played through it, and I figured out, oh, the boss is very vulnerable to blank.
2197000	2200000	I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who want to figure it out yourself.
2200000	2201000	But I figured that out.
2201000	2205000	So the second time I played the demo, I knew how to five-star that boss.
2205000	2214000	Because I was like, oh, if I pick up a blank from this guy, I can do nothing but blank and purposely being vague, try not to spoil.
2214000	2216000	But you'll figure it out when you play this demo.
2216000	2218000	So I was able to five-star the boss.
2218000	2223000	So I uploaded that to my Facebook, except I made it shared only post-privately.
2223000	2226000	But it's supposed to unlock something in the real game, because I did that.
2226000	2229000	So it's kind of interesting how it all ties in.
2229000	2232000	It sounds like they fixed Final Fantasy XIII's battle engine.
2232000	2235000	Just from what I was watching of...
2235000	2239000	From what I've seen of people playing Final Fantasy XIII, just the...
2239000	2245000	Yeah, you could stop the gauge early, but setting everything up in advance and really letting it just play itself...
2245000	2253000	I get the difficulty and especially the rating system, but if I take a backseat to gaming, I lose interest.
2253000	2257000	So it sounds like they did a fair amount of work to work around that.
2257000	2264000	Awesome Unicorn says, Rob, you get one costume for getting the demo and another for posting your battle score on the last boss to social media.
2264000	2265000	Make sure you do that.
2265000	2267000	See, I did that, but I didn't see anything unlock.
2267000	2269000	So now I'm worried I didn't really get it.
2269000	2273000	Even though I created my name and everything, and I think I did it.
2273000	2275000	Knowing me, I probably screwed it up.
2275000	2280000	Oh well, so there'll be one stupid costume I won't be able to equip in the game.
2280000	2282000	I mean, it sounds like there's going to be 5,000 costumes, so whatever.
2282000	2284000	That'll eventually just unlock for you anyways.
2284000	2286000	Right, right. Or I could pay 50 cents.
2286000	2290000	Thanks for your support! Everybody gets the costume! Yay!
2290000	2292000	Alright, so that was the demo.
2292000	2297000	Otherwise, I can't review the game, because I got to play...
2297000	2302000	Well, I can say I got to play 40 minutes of it, but really, 10 of it was playing.
2302000	2304000	30 of it was watching.
2304000	2308000	So anyways, to be continued, because I will pick up the full game later.
2308000	2313000	Minecraft. I don't know if I mentioned in Minecraft, I am playing on the Vaga Network server,
2313000	2318000	and I completed a project of mine this week, and that was I built a tunnel with an underground railroad
2318000	2324000	that connects my old house to my new house, or where my old house used to be when the server first started,
2324000	2327000	right under the giant orange on radio sign that somebody made.
2327000	2331000	There's now a secret passage that will connect to an underground railroad that goes all the way to my house.
2331000	2334000	The only thing I haven't figured out how to do yet is get the mine cart to work,
2334000	2338000	because I don't understand how the power and all that stuff works, and I'm still trying to learn that.
2338000	2340000	I know some of you Minecraft experts are probably sitting there going,
2340000	2345000	God, Rob, it's so easy, but I haven't figured that part out yet, so I'm still figuring that all out.
2345000	2349000	So I'm hoping by next week I'll actually get the mine cart that actually runs between the two.
2349000	2353000	And the cool thing is, I didn't use world edit to do it. I built it by hand.
2353000	2357000	I figured out my coordinates, and when I was building the tunnel, I figured out,
2357000	2360000	okay, here's the point I want to build to, and then here's how I'm going to connect it from the other side.
2360000	2364000	So that was actually a lot of fun. I was actually very rewarding.
2364000	2369000	And a friend on the VoG network server offered to use world edit to build the tunnel for me really fast,
2369000	2373000	and I was like, you know what, thank you, but no, because this is actually very therapeutic for me.
2373000	2377000	Like building this little three by three tunnel is like popping bubbles on bubble wrap or something.
2377000	2381000	It's very therapeutic to just sit there, mine, mine, mine. I see why people get sucked into Minecraft.
2381000	2383000	It's fucking bubble wrap.
2383000	2388000	Why do you think my house descends like 50 levels into the core of the planet?
2389000	2394000	Because I'm like, oh my god, I found lava! Where did this water come from?
2394000	2398000	Descending into the deepest, darkest nether regions.
2398000	2402000	Anyways, I actually downloaded, because it's been forever since I've used Minecraft,
2402000	2407000	I don't know if the auto-updater would even work correctly, but I actually downloaded an updated client,
2407000	2414000	and I don't think I asked Loki to add me to the whitelist, but I will check this out soon.
2415000	2420000	Even though he's had the baby, he popped on the web chat when I was finishing the railroad the other night,
2420000	2425000	he was trying to tell me how to fix my railroad, so he'll be on there once in a while.
2425000	2431000	I just haven't asked and considered what I already said about last week. There will be a chance I will do it.
2431000	2433000	I want to figure out how to build a ferris wheel.
2433000	2439000	I bet it's possible. You know what's funny is that everybody freaking loves railroads and minecarts in Minecraft,
2439000	2443000	which is fine, I understand, but it's really funny because when I built the underground one,
2443000	2448000	somebody actually built, or is building, an overground one, because I went out on my front lawn,
2448000	2452000	and I was like, hey, somebody put a minecart here, and it said, it had the guy's name,
2452000	2455000	I'm sorry, I forgot who it was, but it had the guy's name, and it said,
2455000	2457000	I'm building a connection between Rob's house and DarkSakura's house.
2457000	2463000	So somebody, yeah, without asking, is building a minecart race that gets from my house to your house.
2463000	2464000	That's kind of fun.
2464000	2469000	It's like our own, it's our light rail, it's our monorail.
2469000	2471000	We have minecart monorail.
2471000	2473000	Eff yeah, monorail.
2473000	2475000	Alright, quickly, what else do I want to say?
2475000	2481000	Oh, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, free on PlayStation Plus right now.
2481000	2486000	Check that out, and if you have PlayStation Plus, you really owe it to yourself to check out this game.
2486000	2495000	It's really a gorgeous game, and a very simple, yet great puzzle mechanic,
2495000	2498000	where you control each brother, one thumbstick is each brother,
2498000	2502000	so that can really kind of mess with your mind when one's on the left and one's on the right,
2502000	2506000	but it's the other way around, and then one button that does action,
2506000	2509000	and it feels like an old-school PC game.
2509000	2513000	It really, really feels like an old point-and-click type of game,
2513000	2517000	except it's just you're using thumbsticks, and the click is the R1 and L1.
2517000	2521000	So yeah, I love that. That's great.
2521000	2524000	Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, check that out.
2524000	2526000	Queuing it up right now.
2526000	2530000	Ron Chan says that Underground Railroad is racist.
2530000	2534000	It is a railroad that is underground.
2534000	2535000	Should I flip?
2535000	2537000	Stop being all Tumblr, Ron Chan, seriously.
2537000	2541000	Should I flip it around? It's a railroad underground? All right.
2541000	2542000	It's a subway.
2542000	2544000	You know what? Yeah, it's a subway. There you go.
2544000	2546000	Fine, I'm building a subway. You know what I'll do?
2546000	2550000	I'm going to paint all the walls in rainbow colors, and it'll be the gay Underground Railroad.
2550000	2551000	You can't stop me.
2551000	2552000	Oh, that's awesome.
2552000	2554000	Yeah. Anyway.
2554000	2556000	Will you build one under my house, too?
2556000	2561000	SSG100Matt says instead of the Freedom Train, it's the Fabulous Train.
2561000	2562000	We'll see.
2562000	2567000	All right. Dungeon Buster's warning me. Be sure to have a box of Kleenex next to you.
2567000	2571000	I'm only probably about halfway through the game right now.
2571000	2574000	I hear it's short, but I don't know. I've been playing it for a couple hours,
2574000	2576000	and I'm probably only halfway through it.
2576000	2579000	But I'm also the type that would seriously like,
2579000	2581000	oh, there's a bench. I should go sit on it.
2582000	2585000	Check out the scenery. I spend way too much time in that Brothers game.
2585000	2589000	All right. Let's move on.
2589000	2592000	Let's get into some housekeeping.

2656000	2658000	Fun show. Check that out.
2658000	2661000	By the way, speaking of shows, because it has to be said,
2661000	2664000	I finished season three of Sherlock.
2664000	2666000	Did you?
2666000	2669000	And I was like, ugh, the whole time.
2669000	2672000	And then Dan comes in while I'm at the end, he's like,
2672000	2674000	why didn't you wait for me?
2674000	2675000	Aww.
2675000	2677000	So he's been watching Sherlock today.
2677000	2679000	Aww. Alright, he's catching up.
2679000	2683000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news for this week,
2683000	2685000	and Jason's going to start us off tonight.
2685000	2688000	And Brothers has been purchased from the web.
2688000	2689000	Good job.
2689000	2691000	I just bought Universe Sandbox.
2691000	2692000	I saw something-
2692000	2693000	That Rageinator suggested.
2693000	2694000	That Rageinator suggested now.
2694000	2696000	What is Universe Sandbox about?
2696000	2698000	Colliding galaxies?
2698000	2700000	You're God. No.
2700000	2702000	Alrighty then. Sounds fun.
2702000	2706000	Yeah, you can change gravity and mess with planets and stuff, so.
2706000	2708000	Actually, the game I have to get,
2708000	2710000	because somebody alerted me to this on Twitter,
2710000	2712000	and I forgot who said it, so thank you,
2712000	2714000	and sorry I forgot who advised me of this,
2714000	2718000	but Sid Meier's Covert Action is on Good Old Games,
2718000	2719000	and I've got to get that,
2719000	2721000	because that is one of my favorite 90s games,
2721000	2724000	even though, yeah, Sid Meier, of course, did Civilization,
2724000	2725000	a lot of those great games.
2725000	2728000	Covert Action was kind of a game that even Sid Meier,
2728000	2729000	I think, doesn't like in retrospect,
2729000	2731000	but I loved it, and I played it all the time as a kid,
2731000	2733000	so I've got to get that this week.
2733000	2736000	So, since we're talking about buying games. Anyway.
2736000	2738000	Well, when I edit the show and come across it again,
2738000	2739000	I'll message you and make sure that you got it.
2739000	2742000	Alright, thank you. Thank you.
2742000	2744000	Over the last week to a week and a half,
2744000	2745000	there was a bit of a kerfuffle,
2745000	2748000	because Microsoft was reportedly paying Machinima,
2748000	2754000	and their affiliates that are part of their YouTube network,
2754000	2760000	extra rates for positive Xbox One reviews.
2760000	2764000	These were being indicated by a tag, XB1M13,
2764000	2766000	which apparently has been taken over
2766000	2768000	and used by a number of people,
2768000	2771000	much like Virgin Mary Grilled Cheese
2771000	2775000	and every other eBay hilarity product
2775000	2779000	that has ever crossed paths on the internet.
2779000	2783000	The going rate was that Microsoft was tacking on
2783000	2787000	for partners an additional $3 per 1,000 views.
2787000	2791000	For people who get, you know, at least five digits,
2791000	2793000	but more often at least 100,000 views or more,
2793000	2796000	yeah, that's pretty big.
2796000	2798000	It was seen as a bit controversial,
2798000	2801000	because the terms were considered
2801000	2804000	that it had to be a positive review.
2804000	2807000	There would be no payout if an individual gave
2807000	2809000	any kind of a negative critiquing review
2809000	2813000	against the console for its release.
2813000	2814000	I assume it extends to titles,
2814000	2817000	but we actually don't know that for certain.
2817000	2822000	A statement provided both by Machinima and Microsoft
2822000	2825000	was that this was a typical marketing partnership
2825000	2827000	to promote the Xbox One.
2827000	2830000	Microsoft bought ad space,
2830000	2834000	as one does on keywords and any other ad network,
2834000	2839000	and Microsoft also followed up again additionally to say,
2839000	2841000	Microsoft was not aware of individual contracts
2841000	2843000	Machinima had with their content providers
2843000	2844000	as part of this promotion,
2844000	2848000	and we did not provide any feedback on any of the videos.
2848000	2849000	We have asked Machinima not to post
2849000	2852000	any additional Xbox One content as part of this media buy,
2852000	2854000	and we have asked them to add disclaimers
2854000	2856000	to the videos that were part of the program,
2856000	2859000	indicating they were part of paid advertising.
2860000	2862000	This isn't a new thing.
2862000	2866000	A lot of people saw it as astroturfing,
2866000	2867000	the term technically is,
2867000	2869000	not that Microsoft is the underdog
2869000	2871000	by any stretch of the imagination,
2871000	2873000	but ad buys are very much a thing,
2873000	2877000	and with content networks going the traditional route
2877000	2880000	as they have to do in order to have enough content
2880000	2886000	under their wing to ensure a healthy surge of content,
2886000	2889000	this kind of thing, somebody pays
2889000	2894000	to be able to be featured as part of that incoming content.
2894000	2898000	I was really surprised at the amount of flack
2898000	2899000	that this whole thing got,
2899000	2901000	and the amount of shock that people were expressing
2901000	2902000	in the community.
2902000	2905000	It's not that I necessarily supported or whatever,
2905000	2906000	but it's one of those things where it's like,
2906000	2909000	didn't you all know that this was already going on?
2909000	2912000	Like, isn't this, I thought this was common knowledge.
2912000	2913000	I know we all use ad blockers,
2913000	2917000	but have we ever seen a YouTube ad before?
2917000	2919000	It's exactly the whole thing.
2919000	2922000	Is product placement a new concept?
2922000	2924000	I don't think so.
2924000	2928000	This is, well, yeah, American Idol's a great example.
2928000	2930000	A show I just watched last night,
2930000	2932000	which I'm sure a lot of you are following too
2932000	2934000	because it is the nerdy content,
2934000	2936000	King of the Nerds, new reality show, right?
2936000	2939000	Our friend, Asuka, is on that show, right?
2939000	2942000	Member of the O.L. Army, Nicole is on that show.
2942000	2944000	So I had to tune in to see how she did,
2944000	2946000	and I was very relieved at the episode.
2946000	2947000	Let me just put it that way.
2947000	2950000	I was at a sports bar last Thursday,
2950000	2953000	and that happened to be on one of the many TVs
2953000	2954000	that was playing.
2954000	2956000	Well, the reason why I bring up King of the Nerds
2956000	2957000	is because I just watched it last night,
2957000	2958000	so it was fresh in my mind.
2958000	2961000	They had a Radio Shack TARDIS
2961000	2964000	where they actually go in the little TARDIS.
2964000	2965000	It's really funny because the way they have it set up
2965000	2967000	is it actually does look like it's bigger on the inside.
2967000	2968000	It's really cute.
2968000	2970000	But they go in, and it's like, oh, gosh,
2970000	2973000	it's like all these great mechanical engineering things.
2973000	2974000	I'm a mechanical engineer,
2974000	2976000	and everything I could ever want is in here.
2976000	2978000	The whole thing was a frickin' ad for Radio Shack,
2978000	2981000	but I didn't feel like, oh, my God,
2981000	2983000	I'm so offended at this.
2983000	2985000	I feel like I'm being used.
2985000	2988000	Where is the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen
2988000	2990000	that Radio Shack sponsored this message?
2990000	2991000	How dare they?
2991000	2993000	No, I just accepted that,
2993000	2994000	oh, Radio Shack paid for this spot
2994000	2996000	because that's what they do now
2996000	2997000	because you all fast forward
2997000	2998000	through commercials on your TiVo.
2998000	3000000	Saw another TV show on Friday,
3000000	3004000	which has literally made this the whole point of the show.
3004000	3005000	Price is Right.
3005000	3006000	Oh, yeah?
3006000	3008000	First time I've seen that show in like six years.
3008000	3010000	Oh, God, what a great example, though.
3010000	3011000	Oh, my God.
3011000	3013000	Everybody's, you know,
3013000	3015000	they call out all these brands by name.
3015000	3017000	They have to for market price.
3017000	3018000	Ooh, what a great idea.
3018000	3020000	And you see all their logos and everything else at the end.
3020000	3023000	And everybody loves the Price is Right.
3023000	3024000	Oh, my gosh.
3024000	3025000	Everybody wants to win shit.
3025000	3027000	Yes, and every time they talk about the cars,
3027000	3028000	they describe the car.
3028000	3030000	It's beautiful four-wheel drive.
3030000	3032000	You know, they're talking about all this stuff.
3032000	3034000	The new Ford Fusion with stylish interior
3034000	3035000	and deluxe seats.
3035000	3037000	What a great, oh, my gosh.
3037000	3039000	And you'll have to pay taxes on it if you win.
3039000	3042000	But even in the gaming industry, you guys,
3042000	3045000	didn't you know that like positive reviews
3045000	3047000	can break embargo days
3047000	3050000	and, you know, certain big websites
3050000	3053000	pay for, you know, the exclusives first
3053000	3055000	and vice versa when it's positive.
3055000	3058000	Like this is not something new.
3058000	3062000	I hate to be rude, but y'all are being a bit naive.
3062000	3065000	I think where y'all went wrong,
3065000	3067000	and again, I'm in that mood where I'm just telling it
3067000	3068000	like it is tonight.
3068000	3069000	I don't really care.
3069000	3072000	You all thought Machinima was an independent thing.
3072000	3073000	That's the problem,
3073000	3076000	because Machinima brought on all these indie people
3076000	3080000	into their corporation that exists to make money.
3080000	3082000	I think you all feel like that trust
3082000	3084000	you thought you were going to get out of an indie
3084000	3086000	has been breached a little bit.
3086000	3088000	I kind of think that, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong,
3088000	3091000	feel free, live.vognetwork.com.
3091000	3093000	But I think that's what this boils down to.
3093000	3095000	You thought you were getting one thing,
3095000	3096000	you're really getting another.
3096000	3097000	Sorry about it.
3097000	3098000	And this actually,
3098000	3099000	we're actually going to revisit this topic
3099000	3100000	a little bit later tonight,
3100000	3105000	but it also ties into something we talked about last week,
3105000	3108000	which the point just completely slits.
3108000	3112000	Oh, when we were discussing the Wii U last week,
3112000	3115000	Dark Soccer brought up the point about the difference
3115000	3118000	between a startup company and an established company
3118000	3121000	with a reputation and product to protect.
3121000	3124000	You do something new, you get popular for it,
3124000	3126000	and you use it to grow.
3126000	3131000	You use it to balloon in reach and popularity
3131000	3132000	and everything else.
3132000	3135000	But then if you try it again and fail, what happens?
3135000	3138000	Unfortunately, probably bad things for your company.
3138000	3140000	So you hold on to what's working
3140000	3142000	just until you can find something new that works.
3142000	3143000	Kind of sucks to say,
3143000	3145000	but this is literally the cycle of business.
3145000	3147000	I don't, there are exceptions
3147000	3152000	because some people can reinvent themselves, Amazon.
3152000	3157000	But it doesn't always happen, Barnes and Noble.
3157000	3158000	I don't know.
3158000	3161000	There are exceptions, the devil is in the details,
3161000	3163000	but this is how it works.
3163000	3165000	You get popular for something
3165000	3167000	and then you either cling onto it for dear life,
3167000	3170000	much like Bobby covered just before us,
3170000	3175000	or you finish and close down your company,
3175000	3177000	which who wants to do that?
3177000	3180000	RageNator in chat at live.bognetwork.com says,
3180000	3182000	Skye, actually not everyone loves The Prices, right?
3182000	3184000	I don't, therefore your statement isn't valid.
3184000	3188000	You're a terrible one, Mr. Grinch.
3188000	3191000	Right?
3191000	3194000	Don't just kind of look at that comment and you're like, well...
3194000	3196000	There's so much happiness and cheering and applause.
3197000	3199000	Even the people that lose are still so happy.
3199000	3202000	I want to know how that's relevant.
3202000	3203000	What?
3203000	3204000	He's entitled to his opinion.
3204000	3206000	We did bring up The Prices, right?
3206000	3207000	It's fine.
3207000	3208000	No, I was...
3208000	3209000	All right.
3209000	3211000	MM2K says my favorite comment,
3211000	3213000	the best phrase in the entire English language.
3213000	3214000	I think you're right, Rob.
3214000	3215000	Thank you.
3215000	3219000	It's also Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.
3219000	3220000	Seconded.
3220000	3221000	I'll still allow it.
3221000	3222000	I'll still allow it.
3222000	3223000	All right.
3223000	3224000	Not Y-O-U-R.
3224000	3226000	Brad from Pod Culture says Rob gives no fucks.
3226000	3227000	Yeah.
3227000	3230000	I'm going to pay for my mouth tonight, but I just...
3230000	3231000	You're right.
3231000	3233000	I actually had one of those weeks and one of those weekends where it's like,
3233000	3235000	I don't give a fuck right now.
3235000	3238000	Your body and mind have already worked hard enough to overcome sickness tonight.
3238000	3239000	It's just...
3241000	3245000	Without getting too introspective here on our little podcast,
3245000	3250000	I'm learning in life that you really need to do the things that you enjoy.
3250000	3253000	And if there's something in your life that you don't enjoy so much
3253000	3255000	and you continue to do it,
3255000	3258000	you're going to start to associate a lot of the negative feelings with it.
3258000	3259000	You might start to feel trapped.
3259000	3261000	You might not to know like what the escape is.
3261000	3264000	And there's that like fear of like letting people down or whatever.
3264000	3266000	But the reason why I bring all that up,
3266000	3269000	doing this show over the past 12 years is one of those things
3269000	3270000	that gives me a lot of joy.
3270000	3271000	It really does.
3271000	3273000	And the fact that you all show up and listen to it,
3273000	3275000	you know, sure there's what,
3275000	3278000	50 of you guys in chat right now listening live.
3279000	3282000	You're still here to listen to what I have to say.
3282000	3283000	And I'm like flattered.
3283000	3284000	I'm honored.
3284000	3285000	And I get such a reward from doing it.
3285000	3286000	So thank you really.
3286000	3288000	And those of you who are listening on the podcast feed and everything,
3288000	3289000	thank you.
3289000	3290000	I do appreciate it.
3290000	3292000	Sorry, I didn't mean to get all deep on you,
3292000	3296000	but like I guess I kind of did because of that comment.
3298000	3299000	So let's see, where was I?
3299000	3301000	Because there was something else I was going to say.
3303000	3305000	And it had to do with the whole...
3306000	3308000	Oh, I wanted to say to be devil's advocate
3308000	3310000	because I don't want people thinking like I'm just
3310000	3313000	like kicking machinima while I have the opportunity or whatever.
3313000	3316000	I'm sure there's a variety of broadcasters on the network
3316000	3320000	who said, you know, if I don't have anything nice to say,
3320000	3322000	I'm not going to say it at all.
3322000	3325000	So I think there's probably people that maybe they don't agree with Xbox One
3325000	3327000	or maybe they don't like Xbox One for whatever reason
3327000	3331000	or, you know, they have a Sony related channel or whatever the thing is.
3331000	3333000	It's not like you had to do this.
3333000	3335000	This was not mandated.
3335000	3337000	Nobody forced somebody to do this.
3338000	3340000	But it was just like, hey, here's a product placement campaign
3340000	3343000	that you can participate in and get paid.
3344000	3346000	And, you know, there's a lot of people out there
3346000	3348000	that want to get paid.
3348000	3350000	And on the heels of YouTube,
3352000	3353000	there was actually yet another thing.
3353000	3357000	We covered content ID changes and all that kind of stuff in depth.
3359000	3361000	And there was even before that,
3361000	3364000	I remember some broadcasters that I follow
3364000	3368000	were talking about YouTube's changes,
3368000	3372000	Google's changes to YouTube notifications for new videos
3372000	3374000	and something like that that everybody noticed.
3374000	3377000	Like, I don't want to overstate this,
3377000	3380000	but they made it sound like at least a 10% and possibly more
3380000	3384000	just straight up drop off of views that they would expect to see.
3384000	3387000	Just one release to the next, just pfft.
3387000	3390000	And then with these broadcasters that put out one video away,
3390000	3393000	that's pretty damn obvious. Something changed.
3393000	3395000	And then they got the technical details, figured out what it was.
3395000	3398000	I don't have all of the details in front of me right now.
3398000	3401000	But it's like, you know, you take...
3403000	3405000	It's not that they take money anywhere they can get it,
3405000	3409000	but if somebody was going to...
3409000	3411000	And I hate to say this too,
3411000	3412000	but if somebody were gonna...
3412000	3415000	If one of these companies were going to give me money
3415000	3417000	to pay their consult, I would take it.
3417000	3420000	And that was a job I would have loved to have
3420000	3422000	for the better part of my life.
3422000	3425000	Still, not entirely sure about that,
3425000	3428000	but certainly for the majority of my life,
3428000	3433000	I would have, you know, done ORLAR like a full-time job.
3433000	3436000	I would have done this for many, many years of my life.
3436000	3440000	Would I have done it and, you know, the implicit,
3440000	3444000	done it for favors, done it for positive reviews?
3444000	3447000	No, that's not the intention.
3447000	3451000	I like gaming, so I'm gonna talk about what I like about it.
3451000	3454000	I've kvetched about things that I don't like with the Xbox One,
3454000	3457000	and it has some problems,
3457000	3459000	but the games look fucking astounding.
3459000	3460000	When I've been playing the games,
3460000	3463000	they have been incredible amounts of fun.
3463000	3465000	The controller feels right,
3465000	3469000	and for a company with three gaming consoles to their name,
3469000	3473000	to get it that right and continue to drill it in that well,
3473000	3476000	it means that I like the console, and I'm gonna say nice things about it.
3476000	3478000	How much did you get paid for that? $1.50?
3478000	3480000	I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
3480000	3482000	All right.
3482000	3485000	I'm sure some of you guys have feedback on this.
3485000	3488000	I know we've given some very blunt opinions that you may not agree with.
3488000	3491000	I welcome feedback as long as, you know, it's tactful.
3491000	3492000	Instead of, you know, I don't like emails that say,
3492000	3494000	fuck you, you fucking fuck.
3494000	3497000	But if you've got, you know, the opinions,
3497000	3499000	backed-up, thought-out statements, then I welcome them.
3499000	3503000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those.
3503000	3506000	All right. Let's move on.
3506000	3508000	I've got the next story here.
3508000	3511000	And, you know, since, again, it's one of those nights,
3511000	3514000	I'm gonna tell y'all I think this story is absolute bullshit.
3514000	3516000	But it's something that people are talking about this week,
3516000	3519000	so I'm gonna bring it up anyway.
3519000	3526000	Running around the web this week that Nintendo has got a new system in the works.
3526000	3528000	Let me start out with this.
3528000	3530000	Of course Nintendo has a new system in the works.
3530000	3532000	Surprise goes to nobody.
3532000	3533000	Sony.
3533000	3535000	Because all systems are made in just the year before they come out.
3535000	3538000	Sony has a PlayStation 5 in the works.
3538000	3540000	Microsoft has a new system in the works.
3540000	3541000	Yes, already.
3541000	3542000	And the new Kinect.
3542000	3544000	These systems do not come out overnight.
3544000	3545000	We know this.
3545000	3548000	So, yes, Nintendo has a new system in the works.
3548000	3551000	But is it called the Nintendo Fusion?
3551000	3553000	Just like the Wii was called the Revolution.
3553000	3555000	Dolphin Wii U was the Revolution.
3555000	3557000	No, I had that right the first time, didn't I?
3557000	3559000	Code names are hard.
3559000	3563000	If this report from Nintendo News is to be believed,
3563000	3566000	then, yes, Nintendo is working on Nintendo Fusion.
3566000	3569000	Now, to be fair, this is an independently produced site,
3569000	3571000	and they even start off this article saying,
3571000	3573000	hey, if it's your first time here,
3573000	3576000	we have an impeccable reputation when it comes to delivering information.
3576000	3577000	Look, I understand.
3577000	3579000	They believe in this.
3579000	3581000	It's coming from their trusted source.
3581000	3582000	That's cool.
3582000	3584000	I'm not trying to shade this site because they believe in it.
3584000	3586000	I just think, no.
3586000	3591000	Because I think, A, they're basing it off a domain registration
3591000	3595000	because Nintendo registered NintendoFusion.com,
3595000	3599000	except that they actually purchased this domain back in 2003
3599000	3601000	because there used to be like a festival.
3601000	3604000	I guess Nintendo did a music festival back in the day that was called Nintendo Fusion.
3604000	3606000	I don't even remember that festival.
3606000	3608000	But, God, we would have been doing the show then,
3608000	3610000	so we would have heard about it.
3610000	3615000	But, yeah, it was a rock music video games festival that was in 2003.
3615000	3620000	But apparently, Fusion is a new console that is supposed to bring
3620000	3624000	a little bit more synergy between the Fusion DS
3624000	3626000	and what they're calling the Fusion Terminal.
3626000	3629000	And I'm not going to spout off all these specs here,
3629000	3631000	but it is just basically, as you would imagine,
3631000	3634000	it's a stronger DS and it's a stronger terminal
3634000	3640000	that I imagine is out there to compete with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
3640000	3643000	Do I believe Nintendo has something in the works
3643000	3646000	that is on the level of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?
3646000	3647000	Yes, absolutely.
3647000	3651000	The big problem they're having with Wii U is that third-party developers
3651000	3656000	don't want to go the extra mile to do stuff for the Wii U game pad.
3656000	3658000	That takes development hours and so forth.
3658000	3660000	That's one of the big problems.
3660000	3664000	Even though the Wii U was supposed to be like an Xbox 360 for developing for,
3664000	3667000	you have to be able to think differently with the whole game pad.
3667000	3669000	It's not working out with the third parties.
3670000	3671000	Whether we like it or not,
3671000	3673000	the third parties don't feel like it's a worthy investment
3673000	3675000	because of what's being sold.
3675000	3677000	If a new Nintendo comes out,
3677000	3680000	it's going to be much more attractive to third-party developers
3680000	3684000	if their console is maybe just a slightly better PlayStation 4,
3684000	3686000	Xbox One type of thing,
3686000	3688000	where if somebody builds a PlayStation 4 game,
3688000	3692000	it's super easy to port that over to this Nintendo device.
3692000	3695000	And I think that's a little bit like, duh, that's coming as well.
3695000	3697000	But as far as these specific specs,
3697000	3700000	of course they're going to change before this console's actually out.
3700000	3703000	And I think it's a bit too easy to be able to say,
3703000	3705000	oh, they were right.
3705000	3708000	Yep, yep, it looks like the next Nintendo system,
3708000	3713000	it did fuse the DS and the base is a lot stronger.
3713000	3717000	This is like saying, I'm going to wake up tomorrow,
3717000	3719000	and the sky is going to be blue.
3719000	3722000	These are very safe bets, is what I'm saying.
3722000	3727000	These are all things that we're kind of expecting out of Nintendo.
3727000	3729000	I think the only way this goes wrong
3729000	3731000	is if Nintendo really comes out of left field and says,
3731000	3736000	hey, we've got this whole new way to play games that we believe in,
3736000	3739000	and we're going to take a risk one more time,
3739000	3742000	which is not outside the realm of possibility.
3742000	3745000	They took the risk with it with the Wii, and they won.
3745000	3748000	They took the risk with the Wii U, and so far they're losing.
3748000	3750000	So it would not be out of character for Nintendo to come out
3750000	3752000	and say we have a whole new way to play games.
3752000	3754000	This is crazy.
3754000	3758000	Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided a little bit of a topic back,
3758000	3762000	but Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided early exposure for then, 2003,
3762000	3765000	like you said, for then-developing bands
3765000	3768000	such as Evanescence, Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance,
3768000	3771000	Fall Out Boy, and Berlin, and Panic at the Disco.
3771000	3772000	Wow.
3772000	3775000	Wow! That's a killer fucking lineup.
3775000	3779000	I think Evanescence was a bit prominent quite a bit before that,
3779000	3782000	but my mental timeline with the rest of those bands, damn.
3782000	3785000	That was actually a pretty good grab.
3785000	3789000	And this does sound kind of familiar because they demoed games.
3789000	3794000	2003 bands Evanescence Cold, Revice, Finger Eleven, Cauterize.
3794000	3799000	Games that were featured, 1080-degree Avalanche, Madden NFL 2004.
3799000	3802000	Nintendo GameCube, it's not just a kid's machine.
3802000	3807000	F-Zero GX was debuted at 2003, was demoed at 2003 on Nintendo Fusion Tour.
3807000	3812000	Sonic Advance 2, Game Boy Advance, Donkey Kong Country, Game Boy Advance, 007 Night Fire,
3812000	3816000	Rogue Squadron 3, Rebel Strike, 2004 bands,
3816000	3819000	Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance, Lost Prophets, Letter Kills,
3819000	3822000	2005, Fall Out Boy, The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack,
3822000	3824000	Boys Night Out, Panic at the Disco.
3824000	3827000	You see a trend in these genres, of course, but at the same time,
3827000	3831000	these are pretty, like, this is not exactly anything to snuff out.
3831000	3835000	Is it outside the realm of possibility that maybe Nintendo's gonna bring this tour back?
3835000	3839000	I mean, I know that sounds like the crazy thought, but, I mean, what?
3839000	3842000	This festival would have happened two years into the GameCube's life
3842000	3846000	when GameCube needed more of a boost with that 20-something audience.
3846000	3850000	They are taking the tack of being their own media outlet.
3850000	3853000	By which I mean, Nintendo Direct.
3853000	3857000	And then, prior to the Wii U's release, they had the Nintendo,
3857000	3862000	I don't remember what the specific name for it was, but they had the Wii U media tour.
3862000	3868000	I went to that in Denver, where instead of, you know, like, advertising in the common areas,
3868000	3872000	they rented out Office Space, whatever venue they could get,
3872000	3875000	and they set up everything for people to play.
3875000	3879000	I had quite a bit of fun. I rather liked it.
3879000	3882000	The fact that Nintendo is being their own endpoint for all of this media
3882000	3886000	to do something like this again, that wouldn't surprise me in the least.
3887000	3890000	Just a couple comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
3890000	3893000	Rama says, whether this rumor is true or not,
3893000	3897000	if the hardware isn't on par with the Xbox One or PlayStation 4, it will fail.
3897000	3900000	Kaijuto says, I think that Nintendo caters to kids.
3900000	3903000	That's their demo, and right now kids are into small gaming devices.
3903000	3906000	They don't get the console stuff like us adults do.
3906000	3908000	That's why the 3DS is doing so well.
3908000	3911000	But it's not like the Wii was 20 years ago.
3911000	3914000	That's the only issue I have with that comment is that, you know,
3914000	3919000	Nintendo did have great success with kids and adults with the Nintendo Wii,
3919000	3922000	and it's not like it was that long ago.
3922000	3925000	I don't know. That's the only thing I'm thinking.
3925000	3928000	I don't think we can write Nintendo off as a kids-only company
3928000	3931000	when they just are writing the wave of that success, you know?
3932000	3934000	They do the kids thing well, don't get me wrong.
3934000	3940000	2DS, I don't think any adult understands what the 2DS is for unless they have kids.
3940000	3944000	But the 2DS is a great kiddie device.
3944000	3947000	All right, anyhow, we could debate Nintendo all night once again,
3947000	3949000	but we're going to move on with more stories.
3949000	3952000	Yes, once again in the dark saga.
3952000	3954000	Well, this is a rumor that was going around,
3954000	3957000	and it was also perpetuated by the K-word.
3958000	3960000	Oh, the site that shall not be named?
3960000	3968000	Yeah, that GameStop in the US was going to be canceling Wii U pre-orders of Watch Dogs,
3968000	3974000	that the game was supposed to have been cancelled by Ubisoft.
3974000	3981000	Now, what actually came out is that a spokesperson for GameStop
3981000	3986000	actually heard from Ubisoft, and basically what the big problem is,
3986000	3990000	is that they actually had an error on their system that took out their pre-orders.
3990000	3995000	Three people that replied to the article that I found this on
3995000	3999000	actually said that they went out and had no trouble with their orders.
3999000	4007000	So, it's still there, but as we know, how the K likes to get on the bandwagon.
4007000	4012000	Well, I think it also says a lot that I think a lot of us look at a story like this and go,
4012000	4014000	it wouldn't really be that surprising.
4014000	4022000	Well, and also, an Italian gaming site called Witalia
4022000	4027000	said that the game was going to be out on everything but Wii U,
4027000	4031000	but maybe it's not getting a Europe release, maybe?
4031000	4035000	Who knows? It would be nice if Ubisoft would comment on this.
4035000	4040000	Well, it looks like that...
4040000	4047000	Yeah, Ubisoft actually just declined to comment, but it was a problem with GameStop.
4047000	4055000	See, when they declined to comment like that, I hate to give a K article that kind of clout,
4055000	4060000	but when Ubisoft declines to comment, that almost says more than a comment would.
4060000	4065000	That's the only thing, again, I'm not trying to freak out or get tinfoil hatty, I'm just saying.
4065000	4072000	Yeah, but it also could be that it's GameStop, and GameStop had already put out a statement or something or the other.
4072000	4078000	Alright, well, we'll see if they make an official comment or what happens with the game in the coming weeks.
4078000	4081000	They declined to comment because there's nothing to say yet.
4081000	4084000	The game's not out, there's nothing to talk about.
4084000	4089000	The comment, look forward to Watch Dogs on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U this April.
4089000	4094000	I bet you anything they had employees going in, because guess what I just read online? Is that true?
4094000	4095000	Yeah, right?
4095000	4096000	And if it gets delayed?
4096000	4100000	Though it is a sad thing when employees have to hear it from the news before they hear it from work.
4100000	4105000	I think the Ubisoft comment, I would have expected, is exactly what I just said.
4105000	4109000	Look forward to Watch Dogs on all these consoles coming April, get your pre-order in now.
4109000	4113000	That would have been the comment that I would have said, oh, okay.
4113000	4115000	It's a nice comment. Absolutely.
4115000	4123000	But the fact that instead they chose to say no comment? That's where I go, hmm, that's all.
4124000	4125000	Next story!
4126000	4134000	Owners of Dead Rising 3 will have seen that they got a massive title update last week, clocking in at 13 gigs.
4134000	4139000	This is on top of the base install of Dead Rising 3 itself already being 19.9 gigs.
4139000	4142000	13 gigs?! Ain't nobody got bandwidth for that!
4142000	4145000	Not in some states of the US, for sure.
4145000	4152000	Dead Rising 3's base install is 20 gigs as is. Of course, with the Xbox 360, you don't have to install the whole thing before you play.
4152000	4159000	But this title update clocked in at 13 gigs, and it was suspected to be linked to DLC.
4159000	4168000	A couple days later, there was confirmation from Microsoft that the 13 gig update is in fact linked to Operation Broken Eagle.
4168000	4175000	The update also does incorporate some bug fixes, add-ins, additional smart glass features, so on and so forth.
4175000	4183000	The kicker is that Operation Broken Eagle, my assumption when I read the first two, the hint and the confirmation article,
4183000	4195000	was that, oh, it's required for everybody, it's compatibility DLC so that if somebody else buys it, you can still play with them in co-op.
4196000	4200000	Operation Broken Eagle is single-player DLC only.
4200000	4208000	So enjoy your diminished hard drive space and the fixes that incorporate 1% of it.
4208000	4217000	But that download is just gonna be there, chillin', and if you buy Operation Broken Eagle, great.
4217000	4220000	If not, well, you lose the space anyways.
4220000	4221000	Wow.
4221000	4223000	Yeah, that's a hefty one.
4224000	4231000	It's funny to think about this now, now that the Xbox One has a Blu-ray drive.
4231000	4239000	We're legit talking double-digit figures of capacity instead of a possible max of 9.7 gigs.
4239000	4246000	DVD 4.7, DVD 9, 9.7, Blu-ray 25 or 50 gigs, where the majority of it is sent to the hard drive.
4246000	4249000	We're dealing with some big shit now.
4249000	4255000	I just need to say, I'm really concerned about this, coupled with the whole net neutrality thing.
4255000	4262000	I'm really worried about the size of some of these patches, which makes sense and so forth,
4262000	4271000	because these are full HD games with really 1080 textures. This is gonna be big stuff, no matter what the game is.
4271000	4278000	4K is right around the corner, even though we know PlayStation 4 and I believe Xbox One as well, they're not gonna play 4K games.
4278000	4285000	They're not built to play 4K games. That'll be PlayStation 5 and Xbox 2 or whatever.
4285000	4290000	Because it can't get any more confusing with those frickin' console names.
4290000	4298000	It would be hilarious. The most hilarious name would be the Xbox 4, because it plays 4K.
4298000	4302000	So it'd be the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, and the Xbox Four.
4303000	4313000	Anyhow, I worry with this whole net neutrality thing. If Comcast is talking 300 gigabyte cap or whatever, that's not gonna be enough.
4313000	4318000	They're not moving at the rates they need to be. I don't know.
4319000	4332000	I do serious shit online, but while they don't enforce the cap, they still have the tools in there for me to see my usage.
4332000	4336000	I am always above 250, 300, whatever they've labeled it as.
4336000	4343000	We actually somehow end up below. Maybe I'm complaining too much, but then again, we just got the PlayStation 4, so we'll see.
4343000	4352000	But with all your MMOs and all of this Skype and broadcasting and all of this online interactivity you have, it is pretty surprising that you of all people would be on there.
4352000	4354000	It's not as much traffic as you think.
4354000	4360000	It's not like it's streaming the visual aspect of the game back and forth, sure. But you do a lot of it.
4360000	4365000	And then Skype and Twitch streaming and everything else at the same time, it adds up.
4365000	4370000	I mean, yeah, I'd send whole system backups, but whatever. Differential.
4370000	4378000	Anyways, one last note for people who did not know is that Operation Broken Eagle is the first of four DLC packs.
4378000	4382000	First one to come out, well, that much is obvious.
4382000	4390000	Operation Broken Eagle is the first. Buy the season pass, as everybody seems to love to do, and you will get three more as they get released over the year.
4392000	4397000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase ANSWER.
4398000	4405000	Locopoco wants to make sure an important clarification gets out here, saying, well, the thing is, Capcom put DLC on the disc, people are pissed.
4405000	4411000	And now Capcom wants you to download the DLC and people are pissed. I think that the 13 gigs are a bit much.
4411000	4415000	Well, it sounds like you have to download it whether you're going to buy it or not. That's the problem, right?
4415000	4423000	Yeah, absolutely. This was a title update for the game itself, completely regardless of whether or not you buy the DLC.
4423000	4427000	It will happen as long as you have installed the game itself and booted up.
4427000	4435000	Well, let me do a quick story here about, since we're talking next, now we're saying next gen, except it's not really, now it's current gen.
4435000	4437000	This gen.
4437000	4448000	Along those same lines, when you asked Jamie what her best game of 2013 was, and she answered, I wanted to chime in and say, but there's still 11 more months to figure that out.
4448000	4450000	Fucking not 2013 anymore, right?
4450000	4451000	Jesus.
4451000	4458000	Alright, so anyway, this gen, or whatever you want to call the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One gen, is that, what is it, 8th generation of games? 9th?
4458000	4459000	I believe so.
4459000	4464000	Where the hell are we now? Whatever. Current games, big games. Resogun is a big game on the PlayStation 4.
4464000	4474000	Latia getting Resogun for free because of PlayStation Plus, although I'm sure some of you did, you know, who aren't into the monthly subscription thing or whatever, a yearly subscription, probably bought the game independently.
4474000	4482000	But a lot of people getting Resogun for free. So how's the Resogun developer gonna really make money? I mean, I know they get some from PlayStation, I'm sure, and they were funded.
4482000	4497000	But, Resogun developer is working on some DLC. Have you noticed, by the way, that the games they tend to give away on PlayStation Plus have DLC or have expansions coming, things that, you know, they'll get some money off of.
4497000	4500000	Like Borderlands 2, yes, the game is free, but it has-
4500000	4501000	4 DLC packs?
4501000	4502000	Oodles of DLC, yes.
4502000	4509000	Not to mention all of the 360 avatar enhancements and other customizations you can get.
4509000	4516000	Bioshock Infinite has an expansion, right? Not that- I'm not complaining, I'm just saying there is a science to this.
4516000	4517000	Give away the razor to sell the blades.
4517000	4519000	Ooh, very good comparison.
4519000	4520000	I've used that a number of times.
4520000	4531000	Yes you have, yes you have. Alright, anyway. So anyway, the Resogun developer, they did confirm in a Facebook post of all places, it was a very innocent reply on Facebook.
4531000	4537000	But now everybody's running with it, they are working on DLC for Resogun and an unannounced PlayStation 4 project.
4537000	4539000	So, could literally be anything.
4539000	4546000	So, yeah. But Resogun was a very popular online title, you know, for the launch of the PlayStation 4.
4546000	4550000	No surprise at all to hear that those guys are very busy.
4550000	4554000	So I look forward to seeing what the DLC will be and what their next project might be.
4554000	4557000	Hopefully it'll involve more particles flying everywhere!
4557000	4560000	Pew pew pew, explosions!
4560000	4562000	That was particle.
4562000	4565000	Particle man, particle man.
4565000	4569000	Aw, they might be giants. We love you.
4569000	4571000	Shaking my head. No.
4571000	4573000	Well, how about we go into some-
4573000	4575000	Shaking my head, shaking my head.
4575000	4578000	Meanie woman, meanie woman.
4578000	4580000	Doing the things that mean girls can.
4580000	4582000	I need to see that movie, you know.
4582000	4584000	Yes you do. Moving on!
4584000	4587000	Okay. So how about some legal news?
4587000	4589000	Since we've been in a legal stew already.
4589000	4591000	Haha, I went there.
4591000	4604000	So, a while back I mentioned about the Madden programmer, Robin Antonick, who sued EA and won like 4 million plus bucks because they used his code.
4605000	4614000	Well, apparently that whole decision was just reversed by US District Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco.
4614000	4619000	And said, no you don't get it, and no you don't get the interest, and no.
4619000	4620000	So-
4620000	4624000	You get nothing! You leave! Good day, sir!
4624000	4629000	Yes. And so his lawyer says, girl no.
4629000	4634000	I actually said, the evidence showed that they used his source code without permission.
4634000	4637000	So yeah, they're gonna appeal.
4637000	4650000	So basically what they said is that the jurors had no basis for their consultation because they were never shown the game side by side, which is what's necessary for copyright infringement.
4650000	4655000	So they actually had no basis for their verdict.
4655000	4661000	So does this mean we're headed towards a Supreme Court showdown over Madden? Because that could be very interesting.
4661000	4663000	If they even decide to take it up.
4663000	4668000	But this could set a precedent for programming code.
4668000	4673000	I'll never forget when one of the Supreme Court judges referenced Mortal Kombat in one of his decisions.
4673000	4679000	And that was the whole Schwarzenegger ESA thing that happened here in California, right? Remember that?
4679000	4683000	I was like, wow, the Supreme Court knows what Mortal Kombat is. That's so weird.
4683000	4689000	Well, it's only 20-something years old. They're catching up. Slowly.
4689000	4698000	Yes, but the image you have of the Supreme Court is, with all due respect to our government, the image of the Supreme Court that we get is old fuddy duddies with wigs.
4698000	4700000	You know, and so to hear them talking about-
4700000	4702000	Hey, in some countries they still use wigs.
4702000	4705000	They should use wigs here, to be honest. But anyway.
4705000	4715000	See, now I've got this Monty Python thing running through my head with the two judges taking off their robes to reveal lingerie underneath and going off on a date.
4715000	4721000	Only at OLR could we turn a story about a lawsuit into wearing lingerie underneath your robes.
4721000	4723000	It was Monty Python sketch. Whatever.
4723000	4725000	If you referenced it. Alright.
4725000	4729000	For the record, by the way, I do have to make a little side note about Cool Job.
4729000	4732000	Oh, wait. Tangent on OLR? Get out.
4732000	4739000	When people at lunch start breaking out into Monty Python songs too, you know you're at a cool job. Just saying.
4739000	4746000	Alright, let's travel around the world and see what lingerie- I mean video games are coming out in a store near you.
4746000	4748000	I ain't showing, I ain't telling.
4748000	4752000	I don't know that I'm capable of reporting on this information.
4752000	4756000	Well at Fredericks they have this lacy red thing.
4757000	4769000	Starting in the US. Starting in the US. On January 28th, the whole heap and helping of everything, Broken Age Act 1 drops on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Droid, and the Ouya.
4769000	4772000	Which is the first Ouya release of this year. Very good.
4772000	4773000	The Ouya gets a game.
4773000	4779000	Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z. I think this is the first title of any particular status.
4779000	4785000	There have invariably been other smaller, small time releases that have landed just because they were finished and got published.
4785000	4786000	At any rate.
4786000	4792000	Also on the 28th, Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z drops on PS3, PS Vita, and Xbox 360.
4792000	4794000	Recoil with a K drops for PC.
4794000	4800000	Tomb Raider Definitive Edition hits for the PS4 and Xbox One.
4800000	4801000	Getting that one.
4801000	4805000	December 20- Jesus Christ.
4805000	4808000	Increment everything by one Jason. Please.
4809000	4817000	January 29th, Recoil Liberator, Xbox Live Arcade. On the 30th, Octodad, Deadliest Catch, Windows, Mac, Linux.
4817000	4819000	Yeah, I was like, what's that?
4819000	4820000	Octodad?
4820000	4822000	Did you not, have you not played this?
4822000	4828000	No, I think about Octomom. I hate that name for her because she sounds like a Superman villain.
4828000	4835000	So Octodad released as, Octodad was a game, I don't know if it was basically supposed to be a demo or not at this point.
4835000	4838000	But Octodad was a game that was released, holy crap.
4838000	4839000	This looks weird.
4839000	4844000	Three months ago, where you control a dad in a family who's an octopus.
4844000	4846000	And you-
4846000	4847000	The hell am I looking at?
4847000	4848000	You're looking at Octodad.
4848000	4850000	He's carrying groceries.
4850000	4854000	He squirms around, it is entirely, it's not entirely mouse based.
4854000	4857000	You still use the keyboard to decide whether you-
4857000	4859000	He's wearing a suit.
4859000	4862000	Clasp things or let go of them.
4862000	4869000	If you're controlling him moving or controlling like extension, he's an octopus doing daily life tasks.
4869000	4871000	It is completely insane.
4871000	4872000	He's wearing a tie.
4872000	4873000	Yes.
4873000	4874000	And he has kids.
4874000	4876000	He has a wife and he has two kids.
4876000	4878000	Girl and a boy.
4878000	4879000	He is Octodad.
4879000	4881000	Are they Octopi too?
4881000	4882000	No.
4882000	4883000	They are all humans.
4883000	4884000	Except for Octodad.
4884000	4886000	They must be adopted.
4886000	4889000	Bobby Black Wolf says, I played Octodad at PAX East.
4889000	4890000	It was in the indie game Pavilion.
4890000	4893000	And as Joe and her mat says, yeah, I also played Octodad at PAX East.
4893000	4895000	So basically he's chicken boo.
4895000	4900000	Black Wolf says Octodad is basically an octopus trying to fool everyone into thinking he's human.
4900000	4902000	And the antagonist, the primary-
4902000	4904000	He was a disguise to look like human, guys.
4904000	4907000	The primary antagonist of the game is a sushi chef.
4909000	4910000	Who-
4910000	4911000	Taco is tasty.
4911000	4914000	Who intends to reveal Octodad to his family.
4914000	4916000	Wasn't that a scene in Monsters Inc?
4916000	4918000	Like wasn't the sushi-
4918000	4920000	There was a sushi chef that was the octopus.
4920000	4921000	Yes.
4921000	4922000	But you know what?
4922000	4923000	You know what?
4923000	4924000	Taco is tasty.
4924000	4925000	All right.
4925000	4928000	All I know is I'm getting this game for absolutely certain.
4928000	4929000	So good.
4929000	4930000	I want takoyaki now.
4930000	4932000	I just want a taco.
4932000	4934000	It came out at the same time.
4934000	4936000	Just don't go to Taco Bell and we'll be fine.
4936000	4937000	That's not food.
4937000	4938000	Exactly.
4938000	4939000	Exactly.
4939000	4945000	It came out like around the same time of these other ridiculously exaggerated control games,
4945000	4946000	Surgeon Simulator.
4946000	4949000	And it plays very similarly because there's no precision to speak of.
4949000	4954000	He is squirrelly, some might say inky and just loose.
4954000	4955000	So it controls like queue up.
4955000	4957000	It controls like shit.
4957000	4958000	But it's so much fun.
4958000	4962000	Tigerclaw gave us a link in the chatroom that you can play the original Octodad for free
4962000	4965000	at Octodadgame.com.
4965000	4966000	Yes.
4966000	4971000	And now this game has much more content in the same environments.
4971000	4972000	It's going to be very good.
4972000	4973000	Highly recommended.
4973000	4977000	Let's go to Japan and check out the releases there where you would expect to see the crazy
4977000	4978000	stuff like Octodad.
4978000	4980000	But no, that's not a release in Japan this week.
4980000	4985000	There are games that include octopuses that are a little bit different.
4985000	4986000	Settle down.
4986000	4988000	On the Playstation 3 this week, they get Diablo 3.
4988000	4992000	It comes out in Japan this week on the Playstation 3.
4992000	4993000	Also out.
4993000	4994000	Yeah, the console versions are pretty good.
4994000	4996000	So I'm sure there will be some people checking that out.
4996000	5000000	Also coming out on the Playstation 3 this week, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Full Boost
5000000	5005000	because you can't have a week in gaming in Japan without a Gundam game.
5005000	5007000	Also, Rosen Maiden.
5007000	5008000	Ooh.
5008000	5010000	They're doing a Rosen Maiden game?
5010000	5011000	Apparently.
5011000	5012000	It's coming out this week.
5012000	5013000	Can you see?
5013000	5014000	You sure can.
5014000	5015000	Let me bring that up.
5015000	5016000	It's regular and limited edition, actually.
5016000	5017000	Oh, that's cool.
5017000	5018000	And trying to see.
5018000	5019000	There's no screenshots, sadly.
5019000	5020000	Just the box art.
5020000	5023000	Rosen Maiden is a story about dolls.
5024000	5026000	It's actually pretty good.
5026000	5029000	On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan?
5029000	5030000	Nothing.
5030000	5034000	On the Playstation Vita this week in Japan, however, Rosen Maiden is released there as well.
5034000	5039000	Maikai Senkai Disgaea 4 Return comes out as well this week on the Vita.
5039000	5043000	Ibikore plus Amagami comes out as well.
5043000	5047000	So a few games on the Vita this week on the 30th.
5047000	5051000	On the Wii U this week, the Wii U Fit Meter, the Balance Board and all that,
5051000	5054000	that all comes out on February 1st in Japan.
5054000	5056000	So you have that to look forward to.
5056000	5060000	Lastly, checking the 3DS, you have Toshintoshi.
5060000	5064000	Girls' Gift RPG comes out this week in Japan.
5064000	5066000	I've got to see what this is all about.
5066000	5068000	Girls' Gift RPG.
5068000	5070000	I've seen this before somewhere.
5070000	5074000	What in the hell is that screenshot?
5074000	5077000	These are like up.
5077000	5079000	This is not a G-rated game.
5080000	5082000	Tell me you're surprised.
5082000	5085000	Look at that. I can see her taint in that picture.
5085000	5087000	She's pointing at it.
5087000	5089000	Is she fucking a bug?
5089000	5091000	I don't know what she's doing. That is disgusting.
5091000	5095000	Of course, this is where everybody's like, I wish this wasn't a radio show.
5095000	5097000	Google this, I guess.
5097000	5099000	I'll put a link in our chat room there.
5099000	5102000	Maybe Jason can put it on the video. We'll see.
5102000	5105000	I don't know. That might get us banned from YouTube.
5105000	5107000	You know where I saw it was J-list.
5107000	5110000	Toshintoshi Girls' Gift RPG.
5110000	5113000	I don't want to know if she's pointing at her gift in that picture.
5113000	5115000	There you go, chatters.
5115000	5117000	Of course, on the app I'm in.
5117000	5119000	Oh, no, that's her leg.
5119000	5123000	The app that I'm using, it just pops up the image.
5123000	5125000	Oh, nice.
5125000	5127000	Wow, I just saw Cooch.
5127000	5131000	There's definitely a gift for some people.
5131000	5133000	Moving on.
5133000	5135000	Your gift goes squish.
5135000	5137000	It's a fleshy gift. Alright.
5137000	5139000	Lalalalala.
5139000	5141000	Not attractive.
5141000	5145000	So, on the 30th of January in the UK
5145000	5147000	is Octodad, Deadliest Catch.
5147000	5149000	And...
5149000	5153000	Rymdkapsel?
5153000	5155000	Rymdkapsel.
5155000	5159000	R-Y-M-D-K-A-P-S-E-L.
5159000	5161000	Something vaguely German.
5161000	5163000	Rymdkapsel.
5163000	5166000	On the 31st we have Loadout on PC,
5166000	5168000	Naruto Shippuden,
5168000	5171000	Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst,
5171000	5174000	extra, extra names, more names added for business.
5174000	5176000	And then that's
5176000	5178000	Xbox 360 and PS3.
5178000	5183000	And then Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PS4 and the X-Bone.
5183000	5185000	And that's it.
5185000	5187000	Do we need to start screen?
5187000	5189000	There's a game coming out called Ultimate Gay Fighter.
5189000	5191000	Really?
5191000	5194000	Well, it's one of those undated games listed down there.
5194000	5196000	For January in general.
5196000	5198000	Ultimate Gay Fighter.
5198000	5200000	Which means somebody said at one point it would be out in January.
5200000	5202000	It's not actually, probably.
5202000	5204000	I'm trying to see if there's actually anything on it and there's nothing here.
5204000	5206000	Maybe somebody added that as a troll.
5206000	5208000	Who knows.
5208000	5210000	Alright.
5210000	5213000	Let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5213000	5215000	It's me, isn't it?
5215000	5217000	It is you, Jason.
5217000	5219000	Xbox 3606 got released for Android
5219000	5221000	in the last...
5221000	5223000	Was it just this last week?
5223000	5225000	It's pretty recently.
5225000	5227000	And an article went up talking about
5227000	5229000	the Turnerization
5229000	5231000	of video games artistic legacy.
5231000	5233000	Basically, in short,
5233000	5235000	it's the fact that
5235000	5237000	Turner would buy up
5237000	5239000	cheaper properties and then
5239000	5241000	automatically colorize them
5241000	5243000	to the best of their
5243000	5245000	automatic ability
5245000	5247000	so that they have some additional
5247000	5249000	value that they can add
5249000	5251000	which led to very exaggerated
5251000	5253000	and unrealistic
5253000	5255000	color tones being applied to
5255000	5257000	certain things in the background or what have you.
5257000	5259000	For you younger folks that are listening
5259000	5261000	you may or may not be aware of this
5261000	5263000	so I'll just let the old man tell you for a minute
5263000	5265000	that back when cable was a lot newer
5265000	5267000	like in the 80s and late 80s
5267000	5269000	I remember when the Turner classic
5269000	5271000	movies came out
5271000	5273000	it was very controversial
5273000	5275000	because they would colorize the old movies.
5275000	5277000	And so yeah, that's what he's talking about.
5277000	5279000	He's talking about the Turnerization is that you colorized black and white movies
5279000	5281000	to make them look modern
5281000	5283000	and some people think
5283000	5285000	it's cool, some people hate it.
5285000	5287000	And for what it's worth, I'm staring at this screenshot of
5287000	5289000	It's a Wonderful Life
5289000	5291000	and we actually had a rotation
5291000	5293000	of Christmas movies, holiday movies
5293000	5295000	playing in the office
5295000	5297000	for around the holiday
5297000	5299000	around the Christmas week
5299000	5301000	and they were all
5301000	5303000	Christmas life and a Christmas story
5303000	5305000	and Die Hard randomly
5305000	5307000	I don't exactly know why
5307000	5309000	but a whole bunch of black and white movies
5309000	5311000	in black and white on rotation.
5311000	5313000	And when I read this article
5313000	5315000	I was like, yeah I get it
5315000	5317000	I know what it means to
5317000	5319000	for all intents and purposes port something like this
5319000	5321000	but now that I'm actually looking at the screenshot
5321000	5323000	of It's a Wonderful Life in color
5323000	5325000	it's actually a little bit weird
5325000	5327000	and this isn't the same thing as like
5327000	5329000	It's a neat comparison
5329000	5331000	I think it's a very neat question
5331000	5333000	to be asking, I like this article
5333000	5335000	a lot I gotta say because
5335000	5337000	when you look at a game like
5337000	5339000	Final Fantasy VI on iOS
5339000	5341000	it is kinda like, why did they do this?
5341000	5343000	The argument, I haven't even gotten to the point yet
5343000	5345000	Well I know why they did it
5345000	5347000	In the context of Final Fantasy VI
5347000	5349000	you look at comparative screenshots
5349000	5351000	of the original SNES version
5351000	5353000	and then you take the Android version
5353000	5355000	and all of the sprites, all of the characters
5355000	5357000	all of the enemies, all of the backgrounds
5357000	5359000	the overworld, everything
5359000	5361000	was meticulously crafted
5361000	5363000	to the limitations of the platform
5363000	5365000	every single
5365000	5367000	pixel counted
5367000	5369000	and we're talking about
5369000	5371000	what, 320 by 240?
5371000	5373000	that's not even
5373000	5375000	that's not even
5375000	5377000	100,000 pixels on screen assuming
5377000	5379000	that was even the resolution
5379000	5381000	we're talking tiny, tiny, tiny
5381000	5383000	that whole era of gaming, Game Boy, NES, SNES
5383000	5385000	that's like what a watch does for
5385000	5387000	resolution these days
5387000	5389000	seriously, the pebbles are actually a little bit better
5389000	5391000	than that, I think
5391000	5393000	until the
5393000	5395000	optical media generation
5395000	5397000	began to be polygons and objects
5397000	5399000	and depth of that kind of stuff
5399000	5401000	basically Playstation, Saturn, etc
5401000	5403000	back in the cartridge generation
5405000	5407000	small factor cartridge generation
5407000	5409000	everything, we just
5409000	5411000	covered this with Pokemon and towns
5411000	5413000	everything is so specifically meticulously
5413000	5415000	crafted to get all of the detail
5415000	5417000	possible in, you know
5417000	5419000	as much size as you can do
5419000	5421000	it's a fucking wonder that Resident Evil ever fit
5421000	5423000	onto an N64 cartridge with
5423000	5425000	voice acting and the characters
5425000	5427000	and everything else, but you're looking at these screenshots
5427000	5429000	of Final Fantasy 6
5429000	5431000	SNES and Android
5431000	5433000	and SNES is
5433000	5435000	for those of us that played it
5435000	5437000	familiar, and especially very definitive
5437000	5439000	of Square of the saga, of the era
5439000	5441000	but then you look at the Android version
5441000	5443000	and it's muddy
5443000	5445000	it's a little bit washed out
5445000	5447000	there's a little bit more vibrancy to it
5447000	5449000	but at the lack of
5449000	5451000	any single pixel discernible
5451000	5453000	detail that was, you know, making
5453000	5455000	the point that they were trying to convey
5455000	5457000	the water is a bit murkier
5457000	5459000	and calmer actually in this particular shot
5459000	5461000	it looks like, honest to god, it just looks like
5461000	5463000	I think there's a certain look they're going
5463000	5465000	for, but it looks like bad Photoshop
5465000	5467000	filter throughout the whole game
5467000	5469000	I mean, it's really what it looks like
5469000	5471000	and it's interesting, because this kind of thing
5471000	5473000	does not happen all the time
5473000	5475000	there's three different things that can happen
5475000	5477000	it can either be completely unchanged
5477000	5479000	like all of the Final Fantasy re-releases
5479000	5481000	on the Playstation, it can be
5481000	5483000	done for the sake of moving it
5483000	5485000	to another platform, a poor port
5485000	5487000	like we're making the point of Final Fantasy 6
5487000	5489000	and it's not a port
5489000	5491000	of an existing game, but Final Fantasy
5491000	5493000	4 DS was actually
5493000	5495000	really impressive in what they did with it
5495000	5497000	to still keep the motif of the
5497000	5499000	original game and bring the quality
5499000	5501000	up three generations
5501000	5503000	four generations, one of the two
5503000	5505000	but it's
5505000	5507000	it's interesting to try to consider
5507000	5509000	what the actual process was
5509000	5511000	of redoing all of these
5511000	5513000	assets because you can
5513000	5515000	on a different platform, not to mention you
5515000	5517000	have to, to fit just the technical
5517000	5519000	differences of resolution and everything between
5519000	5521000	the SNES and Android
5521000	5523000	but presumably because
5523000	5525000	you're just
5525000	5527000	doing it to make it look like it
5527000	5529000	was and slightly
5529000	5531000	better when you lose
5531000	5533000	you're basically
5533000	5535000	losing culture, you're losing
5535000	5537000	design, you're losing the point
5537000	5539000	of the reason that these
5539000	5541000	games were created in the first place
5545000	5547000	yeah I
5547000	5549000	think there's a lot of people reacting to Final Fantasy 6
5549000	5551000	like wow this is a cheap cash
5551000	5553000	grab cash in game, I'm not
5553000	5555000	pleased with this, because you know Final Fantasy 6
5555000	5557000	is kind of sacred text
5557000	5559000	to a lot of people, that is like the best video game
5559000	5561000	of all time to a lot of people
5561000	5563000	certainly the best in the Final Fantasy
5563000	5565000	series to many people
5565000	5567000	a friend of mine posted something
5567000	5569000	I don't know if it
5569000	5571000	he's the master
5571000	5573000	at lack of context yet stunningly
5573000	5575000	good timing
5575000	5577000	the greatest benefit of modern consoles
5577000	5579000	is their ability to emulate the old ones
5579000	5581000	so if this kind of
5581000	5583000	thing is as big of a turn off as it is
5583000	5585000	to you rightfully so
5585000	5587000	there's still the opportunity
5587000	5589000	to play the original version
5589000	5591000	if you don't have the original medium yeah it's gonna be
5591000	5593000	a little bit different but you can still
5593000	5595000	get so much of that specific detail back
5595000	5597000	she's saying that she still has
5597000	5599000	all the original consoles and the original carts
5599000	5601000	and everything to play this on
5601000	5603000	we just got plastic protectors for our games that were in the box
5603000	5605000	and one of the games in the box says Final Fantasy
5605000	5607000	quote 3 unquote
5607000	5609000	and you can find a way to do this kind of thing
5609000	5611000	and it is a shame that the
5611000	5613000	waters are a little bit muddied
5613000	5615000	it's
5615000	5617000	it's how the company
5617000	5619000	has decided to take the game forward
5619000	5621000	into this new era
5621000	5623000	literally two decades later
5623000	5625000	awesome unicorn in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
5625000	5627000	says it's the same way that
5627000	5629000	Theatrhythm and the Kingdom Hearts browser game looks
5629000	5631000	they must have some artist at Square Enix
5631000	5633000	who just loves that style
5633000	5635000	and I'm saying this comment but I imagine
5635000	5637000	by some artist at Square Enix you mean
5637000	5639000	their outsourced vendor in China
5639000	5641000	just saying
5641000	5643000	Simpsons is animated by a studio in Korea
5643000	5645000	100% anymore
5645000	5647000	anyhow
5647000	5649000	let's move on one other
5649000	5651000	story here
5651000	5653000	because we're going to get into
5653000	5655000	we're going to get into what
5655000	5657000	Jason just talked about again a little bit later
5657000	5659000	but I want to quickly talk about this
5659000	5661000	a big announcement from SOE
5661000	5663000	Sony Online Entertainment
5663000	5665000	not to be confused with the folks
5665000	5667000	that are behind the Playstation 4
5667000	5669000	Sony's entertainment division
5669000	5671000	but
5671000	5673000	SOE does a lot of their online things
5673000	5675000	EverQuest, DC Universe Online
5675000	5677000	and so forth
5677000	5679000	well SOE is going to be doing
5679000	5681000	this all access plan
5681000	5683000	they've just announced this
5683000	5685000	and the all access plan will include
5685000	5687000	top tier membership level
5687000	5689000	in all SOE games
5689000	5691000	that includes EverQuest
5691000	5693000	EverQuest 2, DC Universe Online
5693000	5695000	Planetside 2, Vanguard
5695000	5697000	EverQuest Next
5697000	5699000	and EverQuest Next Landmark
5699000	5701000	and that will be one low monthly rate
5701000	5703000	of $14.99
5703000	5705000	there will be of course more savings
5705000	5707000	if you do 3, 6 or 12 months at a time
5707000	5709000	that's custom for most MMOs
5709000	5711000	this is kind of interesting that they're doing this one all access pass
5711000	5713000	now it probably should be noted
5713000	5715000	that I believe all these games are free to play anyway
5715000	5717000	so it's not
5717000	5719000	or they are now, they may not have always been
5719000	5721000	like EverQuest used to have a fee with it
5721000	5723000	and so on
5723000	5725000	and so did DC Universe for a short while
5725000	5727000	but they're all free to play now
5727000	5729000	so you're really paying this fee to have basically top level access
5729000	5731000	you know
5731000	5733000	which is going to be the extra perks
5733000	5735000	and inventory and character slots and so forth
5735000	5737000	that you would expect for all these games
5737000	5739000	so this is interesting that you have that one
5739000	5741000	excuse me, that one subscription fee there
5741000	5743000	so
5743000	5745000	ah yeah, it's going to happen
5745000	5747000	about April 2nd they say
5747000	5749000	any existing membership will be automatically
5749000	5751000	upgraded to the new plan
5751000	5753000	that's good news for people that might be paying separate fees
5753000	5755000	right now for top level access and say
5755000	5757000	EverQuest and EverQuest 2
5757000	5759000	and so forth, so pretty cool
5759000	5761000	so, alright
5761000	5763000	anyhow
5763000	5765000	let's take a moment to
5765000	5767000	travel back to when, you know, there was no
5767000	5769000	online entertainment
5769000	5771000	that was, that wasn't
5771000	5773000	you couldn't call in online
5773000	5775000	unless you had Sega Channel
5775000	5777000	that's how you had online
5777000	5779000	X-band, which was hilariously bad
5779000	5781000	only the rich kids had that stuff
5781000	5783000	not me, or if it was like the very
5783000	5785000	close to early 90s
5785000	5787000	you had AOL, you know
5787000	5789000	in DOS
5789000	5791000	so alright, here it is, your classic game
5791000	5793000	of the week
5793000	5795000	for all this fancy online
5795000	5797000	connectivity crap
5797000	5799000	you'll need it
5799000	5801000	go outside, DarkSocker's going to dive into
5801000	5803000	the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey
5803000	5805000	you should be playing this game, or you're
5805000	5807000	you're dumb and stuff
5807000	5809000	well, to keep up with my theme
5809000	5811000	of using games that have been represented
5811000	5813000	in Namco High, and I'm getting a little tired
5813000	5815000	of Namco games, this might be the last one
5815000	5817000	for now, I love you Namco
5817000	5819000	I love you Namco, but still, I've done a bunch
5819000	5821000	Dragon Spirit
5821000	5823000	it was
5823000	5825000	a 1987 scrolling
5825000	5827000	shooter game that was
5827000	5829000	released by Namco
5829000	5831000	it was very loud, sorry, we have a dragon shooting
5831000	5833000	fire over here, sorry about that
5833000	5835000	I'm not sure if I'm attached to it, but
5835000	5837000	no, I didn't have an intro for some reason
5837000	5839000	but it
5839000	5841000	was released by Atari Games in the US
5841000	5843000	and it runs on the Namco System 1 hardware
5843000	5845000	that was later ported
5845000	5847000	to the Amstrad CPC
5847000	5849000	Commodore Amiga, Commodore 64
5849000	5851000	DOS, Atari ST, X68000
5851000	5853000	the PC Engine and TurboGrafx
5853000	5855000	and the ZX Spectrum platforms
5855000	5857000	so basically
5857000	5859000	kind of the story is that there was
5859000	5861000	a
5861000	5863000	serpent demon named Zawel
5863000	5865000	that escaped its imprisonment after
5865000	5867000	a thousand years and kidnapped Princess
5867000	5869000	Alicia, so a soldier named
5869000	5871000	Amul has to
5871000	5873000	rescue her and destroy Zawel
5873000	5875000	oh, there's the intro
5881000	5883000	I just thought it was, it's really pretty, pretty epic
5883000	5885000	it's a dragon taking off
5885000	5887000	from a cliff, and the music
5887000	5889000	in the game is pretty good, I mean
5891000	5893000	oh
5893000	5895000	it takes
5895000	5897000	a minute to get into it, so
5897000	5899000	anyway, so basically
5899000	5901000	you have to, you can
5901000	5903000	collect up to 13 additional
5903000	5905000	powers, apart from what he comes
5905000	5907000	with which is breathing fire and dropping bombs
5907000	5909000	he turns into the blue dragon, by the way
5909000	5911000	I forgot to say that, cause anyone who turns into
5911000	5913000	a blue dragon and isn't in the game blue dragon
5913000	5915000	is pretty cool
5915000	5917000	so he can
5917000	5919000	burst flames, drop
5919000	5921000	bombs, which I guess would be
5921000	5923000	dragon poop, dragon poop has to be pretty flammable
5923000	5925000	and
5925000	5927000	Amul is pretty big when he's
5927000	5929000	just doing the flying through the screen
5929000	5931000	he takes two hits
5931000	5933000	before losing a life, and three in some
5933000	5935000	versions, the power-ups
5935000	5937000	give you extra heads that may double
5937000	5939000	or triple your firepower
5939000	5941000	but they also
5941000	5943000	increase your exposure, so while you
5943000	5945000	were stronger, you were also a bigger freaking
5945000	5947000	target, and
5947000	5949000	bless this game for doing that even though it made playing
5949000	5951000	it really freaking frustrating
5951000	5953000	so yeah, there were other releases
5953000	5955000	there was a sort of sequel on
5955000	5957000	the Famicom that came
5957000	5959000	out as Dragon Spirit the new legend
5959000	5961000	which was a port
5961000	5963000	that took place a generation after the
5963000	5965000	original game, there was an arcade
5965000	5967000	sequel called Dragon Saber that came out in 1990
5967000	5969000	that allowed for two player simultaneous
5969000	5971000	play, Dragon
5971000	5973000	Spirit was released on PC Engine
5973000	5975000	and TurboGrafx-16
5975000	5977000	and it was very close to the
5977000	5979000	arcade version
5979000	5981000	and the sound quality of that
5981000	5983000	I must say, since this is a game that I do own
5983000	5985000	it's really freaking good
5985000	5987000	and SSJ-100
5987000	5989000	Matt in chat says that I always thought those were Dragon
5989000	5991000	Vomit
5991000	5993000	yeah, because Dragon Vomit
5993000	5995000	is flammable and kills people
5995000	5997000	so
5997000	5999000	there was also
5999000	6001000	an emulated version that came
6001000	6003000	in the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary and
6003000	6005000	Namco Museum volume 5 for the Playstation
6005000	6007000	also
6007000	6009000	the PC Engine version
6009000	6011000	was added
6011000	6013000	to Nintendo Virtual Console in 2007
6013000	6015000	and on December 8th, 2009 the arcade
6015000	6017000	version came out as part of the Virtual
6017000	6019000	Console arcade in Japan
6019000	6021000	and on November 4th
6021000	6023000	2008 came out on Xbox 360
6023000	6025000	with the Namco Museum
6025000	6027000	Virtual Arcade
6027000	6029000	Playstation Network does have a release, it's a downloadable
6029000	6031000	game for PS3 and that's under Namco
6031000	6033000	Museum essentials
6033000	6035000	and as part of the Pac-Man 30th Anniversary
6035000	6037000	in 2010, Dragon Spirit
6037000	6039000	was released as part of Pac-Man's arcade
6039000	6041000	party, 30th Anniversary arcade machine
6041000	6043000	along with
6043000	6045000	Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga
6045000	6047000	and a bunch of other games
6047000	6049000	so there you have it, Dragon Spirit
6049000	6051000	and it's a really
6051000	6053000	fun little arcade shooter, it's just not
6053000	6055000	quite the
6055000	6057000	the usual thing one expects
6057000	6059000	yeah, I like this game
6059000	6061000	a lot, it's in that Namco
6061000	6063000	collection on Playstation 3 that's
6063000	6065000	got some neat games in it
6065000	6067000	I've played this a lot on there
6067000	6069000	I almost wonder if this partly didn't
6069000	6071000	inspire other
6071000	6073000	there's another game that
6073000	6075000	involved writing
6075000	6077000	I want to say it was Psychic Storm
6077000	6079000	but maybe not
6079000	6081000	but I honestly think
6081000	6083000	that this just added such a unique
6083000	6085000	feel
6085000	6087000	to a genre
6087000	6089000	that's been out for quite some time
6089000	6091000	and we don't maybe have as many shooting games like this
6091000	6093000	that survived, you know, anymore
6093000	6095000	we still get some of the Raiden games
6095000	6097000	but I would love to see a new
6097000	6099000	Dragon Spirit
6099000	6101000	there it is, your classic game of the week, Dragon Spirit
6101000	6103000	an arcade game
6103000	6105000	I'd like to add, actually, Dungeon Buster made a good point
6105000	6107000	that it had a health bar
6107000	6109000	which was pretty unusual for the time, but like I said
6109000	6111000	it was a two hit
6111000	6113000	you know, two hits you die
6113000	6115000	but that was your health bar
6115000	6117000	and a lot of life
6117000	6119000	alright, well, that is going to do it for the first half of our show
6119000	6121000	but we've got plenty more show to come
6121000	6123000	including the FUGO Question of the Week
6123000	6125000	talking about the Turnerization of Games
6125000	6127000	opinion piece, which website was that from?
6127000	6129000	BAV Club?
6129000	6131000	I just want to make sure they got credit
6131000	6133000	we're going to talk about
6133000	6135000	that big
6135000	6137000	that big name lawsuit
6137000	6139000	that everybody's talking about this week
6139000	6141000	we're going to get into that fuckery
6141000	6143000	it's such a sweet story, love
6143000	6145000	gross
6145000	6147000	I see what you did there
6147000	6149000	we also have your mails, FUs of the Week, your phone calls
6149000	6151000	when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio
6151000	6153000	right after this
6159000	6161000	welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
6161000	6163000	where we are
6163000	6165000	having episode number 537
6165000	6167000	in progress for this
6167000	6169000	January the 26th of
6169000	6171000	2014
6171000	6173000	myself, DarkSakura, and voice of the show
6173000	6175000	Jason here with you guys tonight
6175000	6177000	not here tonight
6177000	6179000	Loki, if you missed our announcement
6179000	6181000	in part A, Loki and Mrs. Loki
6181000	6183000	welcomed Daniel Layton
6183000	6185000	their new son to the world
6185000	6187000	earlier this week
6187000	6189000	on Tuesday, so Loki will be off
6189000	6191000	until he decides he's ready to come back
6191000	6193000	which knowing Loki will probably be next week
6193000	6195000	but we won't hold him to it
6195000	6197000	he'll come back when he's ready
6197000	6199000	alright, we still got plenty of news to take care of
6199000	6201000	so let's get into it
6201000	6203000	some rapid fire news
6203000	6205000	Jason, if you wouldn't mind starting us off today
6205000	6207000	oh yeah, I guess I did a really good job of distracting myself
6207000	6209000	and not paying attention to the fact that I'm starting this
6209000	6211000	okay
6211000	6213000	following the discussion of Final Fantasy 6
6213000	6215000	on Android
6215000	6217000	Final Fantasy 6 on Android has a major freezing glitch
6217000	6219000	it was released last week to the Google Play Store
6219000	6221000	and the new version
6221000	6223000	comes with graphical improvements
6223000	6225000	yeah, we knew all that
6225000	6227000	spoilerific, maybe
6227000	6229000	possibly, but
6229000	6231000	to cut a long story short
6231000	6233000	and to obscure any of the details
6233000	6235000	the glitch
6235000	6237000	prevents gamers from completing the game
6239000	6241000	play if you want, it happens
6241000	6243000	it happens
6243000	6245000	man, I
6245000	6247000	I'm unfortunately kind of running out of my
6247000	6249000	knowledge with Final Fantasy 6
6249000	6251000	and I really don't want to give away any kind of a key
6251000	6253000	plot point
6253000	6255000	the game freezes in Thamassa
6255000	6257000	if you're there
6257000	6259000	and you don't want to have to redo the game
6259000	6261000	stop playing there
6261000	6263000	wait for an update to become available
6263000	6265000	update it, the problem will be fixed
6267000	6269000	Square Enix recently registered the
6269000	6271000	seeds of salvation in the US
6271000	6273000	as the
6273000	6275000	speculation continues to abound
6275000	6277000	the current theory
6277000	6279000	is that this is a
6279000	6281000	western localization for Dragon Quest
6281000	6283000	to be used
6283000	6285000	for, this trademark could be
6285000	6287000	the Nintendo 3DS remake of Dragon
6287000	6289000	Quest 7, or maybe even
6289000	6291000	for the suite of smartphone remakes
6291000	6293000	like the Unity powered Dragon Quest 8
6293000	6295000	Journey of the Cursed King
6295000	6297000	we'll see a trademark
6297000	6299000	a trademark may not go
6299000	6301000	anywhere, just like a patent or anything else
6301000	6303000	we'll see what they wind up doing with it when the game
6303000	6305000	becomes available
6305000	6307000	more hints towards a re-release
6307000	6309000	of Majora's Mask are being dropped from
6309000	6311000	Nintendo in A Link Between Worlds
6311000	6313000	director
6313000	6315000	Hiromasa Shikata has teased
6315000	6317000	in an interview with Game Informer
6317000	6319000	that the remake could be
6319000	6321000	coming because having
6321000	6323000	Majora's Mask in Link's house was a
6323000	6325000	special request from Aonuma's
6325000	6327000	production team
6327000	6329000	now why would they ask us to do
6329000	6331000	that?
6331000	6333000	well we'll just have to wait and see
6333000	6335000	and this can't possibly be a surprise
6335000	6337000	hello Ocarina of Time 3D
6337000	6339000	it's a matter of getting the game
6339000	6341000	to look correctly and since
6341000	6343000	I missed it the first time around I am very much looking
6343000	6345000	forward to playing Majora's Mask 3DS
6345000	6347000	on the 3DS
6347000	6349000	if it happens
6349000	6351000	if it happens
6351000	6353000	gee let's think about this
6353000	6355000	something that finally happened
6355000	6357000	after months and months and months and months
6357000	6359000	and months and months of waiting is that
6359000	6361000	Blizzard made Hearthstone
6361000	6363000	in open beta
6363000	6365000	I installed it and didn't play it
6365000	6367000	wrong company
6367000	6369000	after pretty much everybody
6369000	6371000	who wanted to play the beta was already in the
6371000	6373000	closed beta Blizzard finally
6373000	6375000	opened the super special secret club
6375000	6377000	of people playing Hearthstone namely everybody
6377000	6379000	to the world
6379000	6381000	so yeah
6381000	6383000	Blizzard has opened up
6383000	6385000	Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft so for whatever reason
6385000	6387000	you just forgot you wanted to play it at some point
6387000	6389000	you can actually download that and
6389000	6391000	check that out fun
6391000	6393000	it's only available however in North America
6393000	6395000	right now so when will the game
6395000	6397000	officially launch knowing
6397000	6399000	Blizzard it will probably be in 2017
6401000	6403000	I didn't know Blizzard and Valve
6403000	6405000	were so similar Blizzard
6405000	6407000	does things soon
6407000	6409000	which again
6409000	6411000	I just don't care tonight so I'm just gonna tell you
6411000	6413000	big reason I cancelled my
6413000	6415000	World of Warcraft account is because that expansion
6415000	6417000	is not happening in the next few months
6417000	6419000	there is gonna be nothing to do in
6419000	6421000	World of Warcraft for about six months until that
6421000	6423000	expansion gets here no no no no
6423000	6425000	rep rep grinding Rob rep grinding
6425000	6427000	oh yay and the
6427000	6429000	raids that aren't really that much fun anymore
6429000	6431000	but anyway I digress
6431000	6433000	didn't mean to turn it into a
6433000	6435000	hate fest I don't hate
6435000	6437000	hate is a strong word it's just
6437000	6439000	Warcraft
6439000	6441000	and I are seeing other people right now that's all it is
6443000	6445000	you're seeing other MMOs
6445000	6447000	that's right moving on
6447000	6449000	I did not realize
6449000	6451000	this was a Steam feature
6451000	6453000	I'm using my little quotey hands feature
6453000	6455000	because I've never preordered a game on
6455000	6457000	Steam but apparently if you were to preorder a
6457000	6459000	game on Steam you would
6459000	6461000	actually have to contact customer support to cancel
6461000	6463000	that preorder you couldn't just like click a
6463000	6465000	button that's like wait never mind or cancel
6465000	6467000	well
6467000	6469000	no more will you have to do that as the
6469000	6471000	refund an item button is now
6471000	6473000	displayed on Steam so if you wish
6473000	6475000	to cancel a preorder
6475000	6477000	you can do so just as easily
6477000	6479000	as you can place the preorder
6479000	6481000	which I always thought was the way it should be
6481000	6483000	but whatever
6483000	6485000	so there you go well now it is hooray
6485000	6487000	hooray one thing
6487000	6489000	that I'm sure many of you didn't order
6489000	6491000	because this would cost a lot of money
6491000	6493000	I think this actually ended up going for over
6493000	6495000	$90,000 it was a copy
6495000	6497000	of the super rare
6497000	6499000	Nintendo World Championship
6499000	6501000	NES cartridge
6501000	6503000	and this cartridge really looked like shit
6503000	6505000	there's no other way to put it but this thing looked like it had been in
6505000	6507000	a dumpster somebody had scratched
6507000	6509000	the label off and written in a
6509000	6511000	Bic pen Mario
6511000	6513000	because I guess
6513000	6515000	the first game in Nintendo World Championship
6515000	6517000	was Mario you can tell like mom or dad
6517000	6519000	did this it's Mario
6519000	6521000	but anyway so it was found and
6521000	6523000	there's only 116 of these cartridges
6523000	6525000	in the world so they always
6525000	6527000	go for a crap ton of money even when they
6527000	6529000	look like such garbage like this
6529000	6531000	game did on the outside it's
6531000	6533000	a pearl on the inside because it's
6533000	6535000	a very rare little tournament game
6535000	6537000	so yeah
6537000	6539000	let me see if I can find the final amount
6539000	6541000	right now here on eBay oh it went for
6541000	6543000	$99,902
6543000	6545000	I want to know who paid that you know what do you want to bet
6545000	6547000	they're not going to it was just a troll bid
6547000	6549000	it was probably 4chan that placed that bid let's be honest
6549000	6551000	alright
6551000	6553000	there you go
6553000	6555000	Dark Sakura sorry the moment you
6555000	6557000	pass it over to me and my lungs
6557000	6559000	protest alright
6559000	6561000	yeah yeah
6561000	6563000	well
6563000	6565000	there is something that was and I
6565000	6567000	was very impressed by this when I
6567000	6569000	saw it today in my browsing
6569000	6571000	is that there is
6571000	6573000	going to be a preview for Castlevania
6573000	6575000	Lords of Shadow 2
6575000	6577000	but this is specifically going to happen
6577000	6579000	in Australia
6579000	6581000	and the reason being
6581000	6583000	is that it's also a blood drive
6583000	6585000	so if you are in Sydney
6585000	6587000	on Thursday the 30th
6587000	6589000	from 5 o'clock onward
6589000	6591000	if you go to the Elizabeth Street donor center
6591000	6593000	at 20 Elizabeth Street
6593000	6595000	you can not only play Castlevania
6595000	6597000	Lords of Shadow 2 you could possibly
6597000	6599000	save up to 3 lives
6599000	6601000	for every pint of blood you can it's usable
6601000	6603000	by up to 3 people
6603000	6605000	so eat a lot of spinach
6605000	6607000	and you know steak that morning
6607000	6609000	and make sure you pass your
6609000	6611000	hematocrit and give blood
6611000	6613000	and let us know how the game is
6613000	6615000	does Australia allow the gays to donate blood?
6615000	6617000	I don't know
6617000	6619000	I don't live there
6619000	6621000	I think that's stupid
6621000	6623000	it is stupid
6623000	6625000	well in other news
6625000	6627000	there is something showing up on the Wii U
6627000	6629000	Virtual Console this week and that
6629000	6631000	is Mighty Bomb Jack
6631000	6633000	the NES game
6633000	6635000	also known as the scourge of Game Center CX
6635000	6637000	GX? CX
6637000	6639000	whatever
6639000	6641000	well basically you just use bombs as a weapon
6641000	6643000	and you jump and look for treasure and do stuff
6643000	6645000	so hooray it's 5 bucks
6645000	6647000	which is about what you'd pay
6647000	6649000	for it at the flea market
6649000	6651000	and then
6651000	6653000	I want
6653000	6655000	dammit Rob why do you link me stuff
6655000	6657000	because when it
6657000	6659000	says these two magic words I automatically
6659000	6661000	know oh this is a story Jamie wants to see
6661000	6663000	there is a mod
6663000	6665000	for the Starbound beta
6665000	6667000	that has elements
6667000	6669000	from Mass Effect
6669000	6671000	so now it's
6671000	6673000	Starbound Mass Effect edition
6673000	6675000	and it is officially my favorite
6675000	6677000	mod on the Citadel
6677000	6679000	just saying
6679000	6681000	but it actually
6681000	6683000	adds in the
6683000	6685000	Biotics so you can
6685000	6687000	lift and
6687000	6689000	slow down things and I guess
6689000	6691000	singularities and what not
6691000	6693000	and it converts your ship to the Normandy
6693000	6695000	to the original SR1
6695000	6697000	from the first Mass Effect
6697000	6699000	so you have all kinds of different
6699000	6701000	races showing up there
6701000	6703000	and you just need to use the
6703000	6705000	Kawa's Xbox
6705000	6707000	mode character creator
6707000	6709000	and the simple extend the character creation
6709000	6711000	mod and the stuff is up on
6711000	6713000	the Starbound forums so let me know
6713000	6715000	if it works
6715000	6717000	I may or may not be trying this tomorrow
6717000	6719000	hahaha
6719000	6721000	alright
6721000	6723000	uh
6723000	6725000	dar2 is in our chat room saying I thought the
6725000	6727000	Mass Effect fans on OLR would like that yeah I saw that
6727000	6729000	too and I said very yes
6729000	6731000	was my response
6731000	6733000	alright let's go to
6733000	6735000	the Foogle question of the week
6735000	6737000	you take Facebook, you take Google Plus and you slam those
6737000	6739000	words together and you get what we call
6739000	6741000	Boogle
6747000	6749000	as I promised this week's
6749000	6751000	question on Foogle relates
6751000	6753000	to the Turnerization of video games
6753000	6755000	article that Jason
6755000	6757000	read earlier from ABClub.com
6757000	6759000	so we decided we would ask our
6759000	6761000	listeners what do you
6761000	6763000	think about remaking classic games
6763000	6765000	do you think it's a good thing for the classic
6765000	6767000	games or would classic games be better
6767000	6769000	left untouched and resources
6769000	6771000	spent on new games
6771000	6773000	I'm going to read just a few of these answers from Facebook
6773000	6775000	so I'm going to tell you guys please go check out
6775000	6777000	facebook.com slash orange launch radio to read all
6777000	6779000	of the answers on the show but I'm so happy
6779000	6781000	to see Princess Irene answering
6781000	6783000	the question this week our good old friend
6783000	6785000	Princess Irene is back and she said
6785000	6787000	so succinctly in her very Irene
6787000	6789000	style her reply is
6789000	6791000	it's total bullshit
6791000	6793000	which I can't do in her voice because I haven't heard her voice
6793000	6794000	in years
6794000	6796000	it's total bullshit is what Irene said
6796000	6798000	about remaking classic
6798000	6800000	games
6800000	6802000	Daniel S says they can
6802000	6804000	remake games all they want it won't take
6804000	6806000	away from what they made long ago
6806000	6808000	I just wish devs would pay more
6808000	6810000	attention to the consoles they're porting to
6810000	6812000	that and support the game post
6812000	6814000	launch stupid Chrono Trigger
6814000	6816000	IOS port is stupid
6817000	6819000	I vaguely remember there being some
6819000	6821000	series of bugs or just like
6821000	6823000	the selection or something
6823000	6825000	I forgot there was a Chrono Trigger port
6825000	6827000	I'm pretty sure we covered it
6827000	6829000	I stopped downloading those IOS remakes
6829000	6831000	I just stopped, I couldn't
6831000	6833000	I threw up my hands and said I can't
6833000	6835000	and that was it
6835000	6837000	Moving on to Awesome Unicorn who says
6837000	6839000	I support remakes and reimaginings that offer significant changes
6839000	6841000	or improvements over the original
6841000	6843000	a la the Final Fantasy 4 DS remake
6843000	6845000	or the Lufia 2 DS reimagining
6845000	6847000	Mobile ports of Final Fantasy 5 and 6
6847000	6849000	just feel like they've been changed simply so new artists
6849000	6851000	can list the games on their resumes
6851000	6853000	Want to put a significant work into
6853000	6855000	improving the graphics and gameplay experiences?
6855000	6857000	Please feel free to do so
6857000	6859000	Want to make a quick buck? Save yourself the time and effort
6859000	6861000	put your game on Virtual Console or Playstation
6861000	6863000	Network and start working on something else
6863000	6865000	I like it, that's an order
6867000	6869000	Our good pal Jeremy
6869000	6871000	from Koopa Club answers the question
6871000	6873000	and says remaking a classic game is totally fine
6873000	6875000	if done correctly
6875000	6877000	A good Square Enix example
6877000	6879000	is the DS remake of Final Fantasy 4
6879000	6881000	or Dragon Quest 5
6881000	6883000	Pretty much everybody is making exactly the same point I did
6883000	6885000	The Final Fantasy 4 DS remake
6885000	6887000	is absurdly good
6887000	6889000	Which really started with the 3 remake
6889000	6891000	and I think a lot of us were hoping
6891000	6893000	I think a lot of us were hoping
6893000	6895000	for that with 6
6895000	6897000	and then we get this
6897000	6899000	and we're like cash in
6899000	6901000	Ziba replies
6901000	6903000	and says I love remakes
6903000	6905000	especially ones remade for
6905000	6907000	IOS because I get to play them on the go
6907000	6909000	SSJ100Matt
6909000	6911000	says when a game is remade
6911000	6913000	for the right reasons and the right way
6913000	6915000	it can be great
6915000	6917000	When it's used as a quick, half-assed cash grab
6917000	6919000	then it only hurts the legacy and image that game once had
6919000	6921000	A great way to remake a game
6921000	6923000	is with the help of the community
6923000	6925000	Chrono Trigger resurrection
6925000	6927000	had a lot of promise
6927000	6929000	made by fans and independent people
6929000	6931000	wanting to share the favorite game with a new generation
6931000	6933000	Sadly it was stopped
6933000	6935000	before it could be finished
6935000	6937000	Well because they were going to do that IOS port
6937000	6939000	that we all forgot about
6939000	6941000	My friend Shane
6941000	6943000	who's going to be here next week says
6943000	6945000	I think it's okay to remake a game if it's stupidly
6945000	6947000	hard to get your hands on a copy
6947000	6949000	and you've already given up hope of a straight up port
6949000	6951000	coming to some device
6951000	6953000	Something like C code in 2 or whatever could benefit
6953000	6955000	from such a practice
6955000	6957000	The graphics was super dumb to do though
6957000	6959000	It's already on a lot of different platforms
6959000	6961000	and they made it look worse with odd script changes
6961000	6963000	So bad
6963000	6965000	I'm hearing all of that in Shane's voice
6965000	6967000	So bad
6967000	6969000	Gamergirl says
6969000	6971000	I don't see anything wrong with redoing some games
6971000	6973000	because it gives people who haven't played the original
6973000	6975000	nor can they find them a chance to play
6975000	6977000	Looking at a few of the answers
6977000	6979000	from Google Plus
6979000	6981000	Let's see
6981000	6983000	ActDeft gave us a haiku
6983000	6985000	version, we love haikus
6985000	6987000	Remakes are okay
6987000	6989000	but if the devs are lazy
6989000	6991000	the port will be bad
6993000	6995000	Flaco Jones
6995000	6997000	Remakes are okay
6997000	6999000	No it's fine
6999000	7001000	Don't make me police the police
7001000	7003000	Flaco Jones says
7003000	7005000	I'm fine with remakes but I think the original
7005000	7007000	version should be bundled in there
7007000	7009000	as well so the classic game can still be
7009000	7011000	experienced and appreciated
7011000	7013000	That's a good way of doing it
7013000	7015000	I like that idea
7015000	7017000	AJ Twist lastly on Google Plus says
7017000	7019000	Remakes are good as long as there are
7019000	7021000	no significant changes that change the
7021000	7023000	gameplay or story. Changes to the story
7023000	7025000	that make it better to understand are always
7025000	7027000	welcome in my opinion. I think some
7027000	7029000	remakes should include an original port
7029000	7031000	so we can better appreciate the new and
7031000	7033000	old versions. Kids need a reason
7033000	7035000	to play some classics
7035000	7037000	Flaco Jones answer is actually pretty interesting
7037000	7039000	because Cave Story has really epitomized
7039000	7041000	this. It doesn't
7041000	7043000	exactly have the lifetime and the multiple
7043000	7045000	generation. It doesn't span
7045000	7047000	multiple generations to see what's gonna happen
7047000	7049000	but Cave Story started
7049000	7051000	as and still is an indie title
7051000	7053000	but its groundswell has just continued
7053000	7055000	to grow and grow and grow over the last
7055000	7057000	I don't even know when it
7057000	7059000	originally came out. I want to say two years now
7059000	7061000	I want to say 2012
7061000	7063000	but there's like three different versions of the game
7063000	7065000	There is the original pixel
7065000	7067000	art and very crude
7067000	7069000	synthesized music
7069000	7071000	and then they kind of refined it
7071000	7073000	and upgraded it and made it look
7073000	7075000	less blocky but still
7075000	7079000	a motif of that style
7079000	7081000	Yep
7081000	7083000	They improved
7083000	7085000	everything, made it, added yet
7085000	7087000	another depth of detail, gave it more
7087000	7089000	style, improved the soundtrack and really brought it
7089000	7091000	up and apparently there's
7091000	7093000	even a third tier where the music
7093000	7095000	I've heard the music, it's more
7095000	7097000	it's more full production
7097000	7099000	fully featured production instead of
7099000	7101000	like little synthesized
7101000	7103000	designs and then
7103000	7105000	the graphics are
7105000	7107000	fully fleshed out
7107000	7109000	but still kept
7109000	7111000	in a blocky style
7111000	7113000	Three
7113000	7115000	very distinct styles
7115000	7117000	in two years is pretty crazy
7117000	7119000	but every version lets you select
7119000	7121000	from any combination of them
7121000	7123000	both independently graphics and sound
7123000	7125000	Alright
7125000	7127000	Those were some of the answers from Facebook and Google Plus
7127000	7129000	I read about half of them tonight just for time's
7129000	7131000	sake to keep things moving so I'm sorry I didn't read all
7131000	7133000	the answers, thank you to everybody that took the
7133000	7135000	time to answer and I encourage all of our listeners
7135000	7137000	to read what people had to say over
7137000	7139000	at facebook.com slash orange launch radio
7139000	7141000	and google.com slash plus orange launch radio
7141000	7143000	Alright, let's travel on
7143000	7145000	with some more news
7145000	7147000	Loki
7147000	7149000	Loki
7149000	7151000	Sorry, I'm so used to seeing it
7151000	7153000	on the show roll
7153000	7155000	Alright, not Loki
7155000	7157000	Loki imposter
7157000	7159000	Bigger beard Loki
7159000	7161000	As spotted on
7161000	7163000	LinkedIn from the profile of
7163000	7165000	Rob Stokes, the senior level designer at
7165000	7167000	Harmonix
7167000	7169000	an unannounced Kinect game
7169000	7171000	for the Xbox One has allegedly
7171000	7173000	been cancelled. In mid-2012
7173000	7175000	Harmonix originally announced that they had
7175000	7177000	several projects in the works that were not related
7177000	7179000	to Rock Band or Dance Central
7179000	7181000	or Fantasia Music Evolved
7181000	7183000	but no further details
7183000	7185000	were given on any of these outside
7185000	7187000	of a spotted job listing looking for a
7187000	7189000	combat designer in 2012
7189000	7191000	to be used for next generation
7191000	7193000	hardware. Last year
7193000	7195000	Harmonix stopped dropping
7195000	7197000	DLC weekly for Rock Band
7197000	7199000	and went through two waves of
7199000	7201000	layoffs. The only comments
7201000	7203000	provided when asked about
7203000	7205000	changes to their upcoming lineup were
7205000	7207000	responsible for the highest rated Kinect titles
7207000	7209000	for Xbox 360 with our Dance Central
7209000	7211000	franchise and we're very excited
7211000	7213000	by the possibilities of the new motion sensing
7213000	7215000	technology for Xbox One. Right now
7215000	7217000	our Kinect development is focused on the already
7217000	7219000	announced Disney Fantasia Music Evolved
7219000	7221000	a title which we believe further innovates
7221000	7223000	in both the motion gaming and music space
7223000	7225000	Nothing else to confirm today other than
7225000	7227000	a heads up that we've got a lot of stuff happening
7227000	7229000	that you'll hear about soon
7229000	7231000	and by soon they probably mean
7231000	7233000	six months from now at E3, five months
7233000	7235000	from now
7235000	7237000	An unknown game gets canned
7237000	7239000	Well rest in peace
7239000	7241000	game we never knew you
7241000	7243000	I mean but
7243000	7245000	I don't know I
7245000	7247000	I'd hate to be all like doom and gloom but I kind of
7247000	7249000	worry about Harmonix like you know the Rock Band
7249000	7251000	bubble kind of burst we haven't really
7251000	7253000	seen a lot from them lately I know there's this
7253000	7255000	Fantasia thing which is gonna be a big deal but it's
7255000	7257000	it's still not here and now they're canceling
7257000	7259000	projects we've heard about layoffs like
7259000	7261000	and it's not like Harmonix
7261000	7263000	makes a bunch of stinkers it's just like you know
7263000	7265000	the Rock Band bubble kind of burst like
7265000	7267000	They don't
7267000	7269000	They don't make a bunch of
7269000	7271000	stinkers but I don't think they get the critical acclaim
7271000	7273000	like we would all hope that we would
7273000	7275000	all prefer that they did
7275000	7277000	Let's be honest frequency and amplitude were amazing
7277000	7279000	games they weren't exactly the
7279000	7281000	biggest sellers
7281000	7283000	But Rock Band was huge
7283000	7285000	Rock Band was an absolute run away
7285000	7287000	And Activision really screwed that whole
7287000	7289000	thing up but anyway it's neither here nor there
7289000	7291000	Yeah
7291000	7293000	Well good luck with whatever Harmonix
7293000	7295000	is working on maybe they'll be able to
7295000	7297000	blow us away at the next E3
7297000	7299000	We love you Harmonix and we look forward to seeing everything you do
7299000	7301000	for now and
7301000	7303000	as long as you continue to be able to do it
7303000	7305000	Which we hope is a very long time
7305000	7307000	I somehow doubt that Harmonix's
7307000	7309000	next game would be called Music Saga
7309000	7311000	Because
7311000	7313000	Thank you
7313000	7315000	I'm bowing
7315000	7317000	Because as I'm sure many of you have heard this week
7317000	7319000	King
7319000	7321000	Is it king.com or king? I guess they're
7321000	7323000	king and they're located at king.com but anyway
7323000	7325000	This company, you know what they're Zinga2
7325000	7327000	I'm gonna call them Zinga2
7327000	7329000	Because that's what they are to me Zinga2
7329000	7331000	Has decided to
7331000	7333000	Trademark the word candy
7333000	7335000	They now
7335000	7337000	And they got it
7337000	7339000	So they basically own the trademark on the word candy
7339000	7341000	When it comes to video games I mean if you want to sell
7341000	7343000	Candy in the grocery store that's one thing but you will make a
7343000	7345000	Video game with the word candy in it that's another
7345000	7347000	And by the way they also
7347000	7349000	Got the word saga
7349000	7351000	So if you want to make a game with the name
7351000	7353000	Saga in it you will have to
7353000	7355000	Answer to king
7355000	7357000	The makers of the banner saga learned in this the hard way
7357000	7359000	When king sent them a cease and desist
7359000	7361000	In king's defense
7361000	7363000	King came out and said well
7363000	7365000	We're not really like we really
7365000	7367000	We don't really think the banner saga is like
7367000	7369000	Trying to infringe on our trademark
7369000	7371000	We have to do this because if we don't
7371000	7373000	Defend it then people are gonna come
7373000	7375000	Along and you know
7375000	7377000	Will lose the trademark and then people
7377000	7379000	Will try to make their you know
7379000	7381000	Clone games
7381000	7383000	And to be fair
7383000	7385000	On the iOS marketplace and the Google
7385000	7387000	Android play market
7387000	7389000	There's a lot of shitty clones
7389000	7391000	To try to ride the success of these games
7391000	7393000	But where do we draw the line people?
7393000	7395000	I've even seen those at 3am shitty advertising too
7395000	7397000	And you all
7397000	7399000	I know you're all sitting there expecting me to say
7399000	7401000	LOL
7401000	7403000	Square Enix, Saga Frontier
7403000	7405000	LOL, 7th Saga
7405000	7407000	LOL, Candy was a song
7407000	7409000	In DDR, etc, etc
7409000	7411000	I mean yeah I mean it's
7411000	7413000	Ridiculous that they own the trademark on
7413000	7415000	Those words because
7415000	7417000	Especially in the case of Saga
7417000	7419000	There's so many other games
7419000	7421000	That have nothing to do
7421000	7423000	With a game that was ripped off
7423000	7425000	Fucking bejeweled in the first place
7425000	7427000	Again I'm just keeping it real tonight
7427000	7429000	It's a little silly that when their game is a rip
7429000	7431000	Off in the first place they get the
7431000	7433000	Right to these words
7433000	7435000	I think I
7435000	7437000	I played Candy Crush
7437000	7439000	A little bit I couldn't even tell you how much
7439000	7441000	I'm pretty sure I thought it was a
7441000	7443000	Zynga game and I stopped
7443000	7445000	Only for
7445000	7447000	Not only for lack of interest but also in the
7447000	7449000	The great Zynga
7449000	7451000	But
7451000	7453000	Not petition
7453000	7455000	Boycott?
7455000	7457000	Thank you the great Zynga boycott of 2013
7457000	7459000	And the previous fucking 3 years
7459000	7461000	2 anyways
7461000	7463000	The thing about
7463000	7465000	Them saying that they have to go through
7465000	7467000	Due process and they don't actually want it to happen
7467000	7469000	Is that it doesn't work out that way
7469000	7471000	Either they
7471000	7473000	Either the
7473000	7475000	The person they charge follows the cease and desist
7475000	7477000	And makes a name change or
7477000	7479000	Cans the project out right
7479000	7481000	Or the person they charge with it rebukes
7481000	7483000	And King loses the
7483000	7485000	Trademark
7485000	7487000	Only if they
7487000	7489000	Only if the
7489000	7491000	Party doesn't like
7491000	7493000	Countersue or whatever the appropriate
7493000	7495000	Motion is will the whole
7495000	7497000	Process just get settled and dropped
7497000	7499000	But if anybody balks at this
7499000	7501000	They're gonna lose the trademark
7501000	7503000	That's what happens
7503000	7505000	They shouldn't have been given this trademark in the first place
7505000	7507000	Oh absolutely, everything else about this
7507000	7509000	Is fucking absurd
7509000	7511000	They should have been given the trademark for
7511000	7513000	Candy Crush Saga
7513000	7515000	Because Candy hasn't
7515000	7517000	Existed for I don't even know
7517000	7519000	How many decades
7519000	7521000	Candy Land
7521000	7523000	How does
7523000	7525000	Who owns the Milton Bradley suite now
7525000	7527000	God they've all changed hands so many times
7527000	7529000	Somebody should have a yell it out
7529000	7531000	Is it Hasbro?
7531000	7533000	They have every right
7533000	7535000	To make the game Candy Land
7535000	7537000	As a pour on iPhone
7537000	7539000	If they want
7539000	7541000	I fucking double dog dare King
7541000	7543000	To go sue the makers of Candy Land
7543000	7545000	Yep
7545000	7547000	And then it'll throw the whole thing
7547000	7549000	Honestly what I would like to see happen
7549000	7551000	Is Milton Bradley
7551000	7553000	Or whatever holdings
7553000	7555000	Go after them
7555000	7557000	Just to prove a point I would love to see that
7557000	7559000	Hasbro you were correct
7559000	7561000	I would love to see them prove a point
7561000	7563000	Just to go bitch please
7563000	7565000	Um
7565000	7567000	You know it's
7567000	7569000	Weird though because in a roundabout way
7569000	7571000	It's actually given a lot of additional exposure
7571000	7573000	For Banner Saga which is um you know
7573000	7575000	That's a good thing for them
7575000	7577000	But yeah it's just so ridiculous
7577000	7579000	Like those people that are working hard
7579000	7581000	Making the Banner Saga they should not have to deal
7581000	7583000	With this fuckery
7583000	7585000	That's the real problem it's a waste
7585000	7587000	Of resources
7587000	7589000	This is not their fucking problem
7589000	7591000	It's really gross
7591000	7593000	That they're having to even deal with this
7593000	7595000	The only silver lining is that the entire
7595000	7597000	Internet community backs them
7597000	7599000	And so it's a great amount of exposure
7599000	7601000	For their game at least take solace
7601000	7603000	In that a lot of people heard about Banner Saga
7603000	7605000	That wouldn't have heard about it otherwise
7605000	7607000	Let's be real
7607000	7609000	So that's the positive
7609000	7611000	So what are they going to change it to like Banner story or
7611000	7613000	But here's the other problem with
7613000	7615000	Zynga 2
7615000	7617000	Is just like the mother ship Zynga
7617000	7619000	They have a history of fucking copying
7619000	7621000	Games
7621000	7623000	Candy Crush Saga is a copy of
7623000	7625000	Jewel Quest
7625000	7627000	Which in turn is a copy of Bejeweled
7627000	7629000	So yet they want to prevent
7629000	7631000	Other people doing what they did
7631000	7633000	Anyway in my opinion
7633000	7635000	Allegedly just throwing those words out there
7635000	7637000	Just in case
7637000	7639000	But it is on record that King
7639000	7641000	Supposedly
7641000	7643000	Copied another game
7643000	7645000	And they called it Pack-a-void
7645000	7647000	They tried to go after another developer
7647000	7649000	Back in 2009 because they wanted to
7649000	7651000	Basically buy their game and put it out
7651000	7653000	But King put out a statement this week
7653000	7655000	Because you know Reddit's going to find it
7655000	7657000	4chan and all the internet community people
7657000	7659000	They're going to find it and they're going to bring it to light
7659000	7661000	There'll be a NeoGaf post and then everybody goes
7661000	7663000	Yeah take them down, take them down, show King
7663000	7665000	Stick it to the man and so forth
7665000	7667000	And that's exactly what happened is that it came out
7667000	7669000	This developer said hey King tried to buy my game
7669000	7671000	In 2009 then they just copied it
7671000	7673000	And put out Pack-a-void instead
7673000	7675000	So King had to put out a statement
7675000	7677000	King does not clone other people's games
7677000	7679000	King believes that IP
7679000	7681000	Both our own IP and that of others
7681000	7683000	Is important and should be properly protected
7683000	7685000	Like any prudent company we take all appropriate steps
7685000	7687000	To protect our IP in a sensible and fair way
7687000	7689000	At the same time we are respectful
7689000	7691000	Of the rights and IP of other developers
7693000	7695000	Sorry just letting that comment sink in for a minute
7695000	7697000	Before we launch any game
7697000	7699000	We do a thorough search of other games
7699000	7701000	In the marketplace as well as review of
7701000	7703000	Trademark filings to ensure that we are not
7703000	7705000	Infringing anyone else's IP
7705000	7707000	However for the avoidance of doubt in this case
7707000	7709000	The game which was coded by a third party
7709000	7711000	Developer five years ago has
7711000	7713000	Been taken down
7717000	7719000	Let's see I believe
7719000	7721000	What happened is that
7721000	7723000	The developer who made this
7723000	7725000	Clone actually
7725000	7727000	Came out and said yeah
7727000	7729000	King kind of hired me
7729000	7731000	To do this and I had to do it quickly
7731000	7733000	And I had to get it out before the
7733000	7735000	Original game Scamper Ghost was set to be
7735000	7737000	Released essentially
7737000	7739000	So
7741000	7743000	What happened is that they came out and said
7743000	7745000	King contracted the third party
7745000	7747000	To make the game he made it at their
7747000	7749000	Request to their specifications so King is
7749000	7751000	Responsible I'm fairly certain 99%
7751000	7753000	Of people everyone except King
7753000	7755000	Would agree that Pack Avoid is a clone
7755000	7757000	Of Scamper Ghost and that was a statement
7757000	7759000	From Matthew Cox
7759000	7761000	Who was the developer who
7761000	7763000	Made Scamper Ghost
7763000	7765000	Essentially so
7765000	7767000	I mean it's
7767000	7769000	Ridiculous that they were given this trademark in the first
7769000	7771000	Place
7771000	7773000	The old laws are not
7773000	7775000	Working when it comes to intellectual property
7775000	7777000	In this country I'm gonna say
7777000	7779000	In this country a bunch of the laws aren't
7779000	7781000	Working when it comes to anything
7781000	7783000	Well seriously I think
7783000	7785000	Well at least we're not in an all out full blown
7785000	7787000	War I mean there are some things that are
7787000	7789000	Working but you're right there's a lot of
7789000	7791000	Fucked up shit period
7791000	7793000	There's a lot of broken things that need to just be completely
7793000	7795000	Thrown out and revamped
7795000	7797000	No one wants to
7797000	7799000	Alright
7799000	7801000	Ah
7801000	7803000	There you go
7803000	7805000	I think we all agree it's
7805000	7807000	Fuckery does anyone want to try
7807000	7809000	To take the devil's advocate position even if I'm having a hard
7809000	7811000	Time in this circumstance I mean
7811000	7813000	I understand there is a lot of clones
7813000	7815000	There's a lot of people and there's some guy that
7815000	7817000	Spoke out that made
7817000	7819000	A game and get a load of this name
7819000	7821000	What was the guy
7821000	7823000	He made a game call and he's been contacted
7823000	7825000	By King's legal team the creator of
7825000	7827000	Quote all candy casino
7827000	7829000	Slots jewel craze connect
7829000	7831000	Big blast mania land
7831000	7833000	Yeah that's not SEO bait
7833000	7835000	Look girl
7837000	7839000	You're the reason why
7839000	7841000	Zynga 2 has
7841000	7843000	This leverage
7843000	7845000	To be like those types
7845000	7847000	Of games are the reason why even though
7847000	7849000	A slot machine game may have nothing to do
7849000	7851000	With candy although I'm surprised candy crush
7851000	7853000	Saga is not you know rip that off too
7853000	7855000	But
7855000	7857000	Like you know even though the the slot
7857000	7859000	Machine game may be kind of different let's
7859000	7861000	Be real that name is
7861000	7863000	Fuck you're fucking baiting people with that name
7863000	7865000	That's why they got that trademark
7865000	7867000	Is because of you
7867000	7869000	Just think about that for a minute
7871000	7873000	I guess that's as far as the devil's advocate
7873000	7875000	Position I can go
7875000	7877000	Let's move on let's do something happy
7877000	7879000	I need happy news dark soccer give me some happy news
7879000	7881000	Happy is like me I don't have any
7881000	7883000	Oh yeah I do have happy
7883000	7885000	Well you know we talked about Ubisoft in
7885000	7887000	Part A well how about some more
7887000	7889000	Ubisoft news
7889000	7891000	They are going to be adding
7891000	7893000	Roughly a hundred
7893000	7895000	Jobs for their Quebec
7895000	7897000	City studio
7897000	7899000	They're planning on investing
7899000	7901000	25 million and
7901000	7903000	About 460,000
7903000	7905000	Of that is from the government of Quebec
7905000	7907000	That's going to strengthen
7907000	7909000	The company's infrastructure
7909000	7911000	So they
7911000	7913000	Are they already have about
7913000	7915000	360 employees and they're going to be
7915000	7917000	Bringing on about another hundred so
7917000	7919000	Yay for boosting
7919000	7921000	Canada's job market
7921000	7923000	Because they've been hit hard too
7927000	7929000	Right yeah so I
7929000	7931000	Just think when we have a story about that there's jobs
7931000	7933000	Being added as opposed to taken away that's a good thing
7933000	7935000	That's good news
7935000	7937000	Like hearing that so congrats
7937000	7939000	To Ubisoft that means things are going well over there
7939000	7941000	Indeed
7941000	7943000	And you know I
7943000	7945000	I honestly hope to see
7945000	7947000	I mean clearly Ubisoft
7947000	7949000	Is running kind of you know
7949000	7951000	Strongly right now so I'd like to see what
7951000	7953000	You know the spells for the future
7953000	7955000	I'd like to see you try to say you don't have the resources
7955000	7957000	To port things to Wii U
7957000	7959000	Yeah
7959000	7961000	Oh burn
7961000	7963000	Had to
7963000	7965000	Alright Jason what do you got
7965000	7967000	Minecraft's sales have exceeded
7967000	7969000	One million in just
7969000	7971000	A month
7971000	7973000	It's first month of life on the PS3
7973000	7975000	Um
7975000	7977000	Since its release
7977000	7979000	As an overall recap since its release
7979000	7981000	Eleven million units of the PC version
7981000	7983000	Have been sold as of last June
7983000	7985000	So even that figure is
7985000	7987000	Probably pretty grossly out of date
7987000	7989000	At this point
7989000	7991000	The Xbox 360 version has another
7991000	7993000	Ten million sales
7993000	7995000	Ten million players which I think
7995000	7997000	Is a bit of a misnomer
7997000	7999000	Attached to sales but at any rate
7999000	8001000	The Xbox 360 version has another
8001000	8003000	Ten million players
8003000	8005000	Has another ten million
8005000	8007000	Players joining that number
8007000	8009000	There's a lot of people that own both or all three
8009000	8011000	Like I own the 360 version and the PC version
8011000	8013000	But Notch still says that it ain't gonna make it
8013000	8015000	To the Wii U
8015000	8017000	So we continue to cry
8017000	8019000	But eleven plus ten plus one and invariably
8019000	8021000	I would throw out very
8021000	8023000	Like another four million or something like that
8023000	8025000	Just PC sales alone
8025000	8027000	Not half bad for the
8027000	8029000	For the survival
8029000	8031000	Blocky create everything
8031000	8033000	Yourself kind of adventure
8033000	8035000	I'm looking forward to seeing those crisp
8035000	8037000	Graphics on the Playstation 4 when that
8037000	8039000	Version is released
8039000	8041000	Pixel art like you wouldn't believe
8041000	8043000	It'll look exactly the same
8043000	8045000	Of course that was a joke
8045000	8047000	Well I would imagine some of those limitations
8047000	8049000	When it comes to you know the space you have to work with
8049000	8051000	And so forth like that's gonna change but
8051000	8053000	I was reading something I don't know if this
8053000	8055000	Translates to the console versions
8055000	8057000	I'll save I need I wanna
8057000	8059000	Read more about it I'll save it till the end of the show
8059000	8061000	Okay good sales for the PS3
8061000	8063000	It's gonna be a powerful source again
8063000	8065000	Powerful force against the PC and Xbox as well
8065000	8067000	Ummm
8067000	8069000	You think it's not
8069000	8071000	Gonna jump up to the double digit millions?
8071000	8073000	Oh on the Playstation 3 and 4
8073000	8075000	The only reason it wouldn't is because
8075000	8077000	I think most people that are interested in it
8077000	8079000	Have already bought it on PC or Xbox 360
8079000	8081000	But I mean don't
8081000	8083000	Underestimate what a huge flipping game
8083000	8085000	Minecraft is I am always surprised
8085000	8087000	I think I talked about this in a prior week but I overheard
8087000	8089000	One of my co-workers talking
8089000	8091000	Like you know the middle-aged
8091000	8093000	Ladies that I work with one of them was talking about how
8093000	8095000	She was playing Minecraft got addicted to it over the holiday
8095000	8097000	And like not the type of gal
8097000	8099000	I usually expect to be playing video games when I heard
8099000	8101000	She was playing Minecraft I was kinda like that's kinda rad
8101000	8103000	She was talking about the creepers and you know
8103000	8105000	Trying to dodge and she's like you gotta build houses
8105000	8107000	I was explaining it to another person you gotta build these houses
8107000	8109000	And stay away I was
8109000	8111000	You know this game is huge
8111000	8113000	I was actually gonna wear a different shirt tonight
8113000	8115000	But the fact that I had this on
8115000	8117000	Is pretty coincidental
8117000	8119000	Two three weeks ago
8119000	8121000	I was at Wells Fargo
8121000	8123000	And the lady that I was working with
8123000	8125000	Asked me about my shirt
8125000	8127000	I'm wearing
8127000	8129000	If anybody has checked out the
8129000	8131000	GitHub shop I'm not gonna go too crazy with it
8131000	8133000	But GitHub has a bunch of themed shirts
8133000	8135000	The shirt that I'm wearing right now
8135000	8137000	Is a pixel art version
8137000	8139000	Of the Octocat
8139000	8141000	The GitHub mascot and it's in a
8141000	8143000	8-bit pixelated version
8143000	8145000	And so the person that I'm working with
8145000	8147000	Sees this and she's asking me
8147000	8149000	If it's Minecraft and I had to kinda
8149000	8151000	I had to kinda dance around the issue
8151000	8153000	Because I was like
8153000	8155000	It's that kind of a style
8155000	8157000	It doesn't have anything to do with Minecraft
8157000	8159000	But they were both inspired from the same thing
8159000	8161000	And you know
8161000	8163000	Of all of the things that
8163000	8165000	8-bit would mean something to someone
8165000	8167000	The fact that Minecraft
8167000	8169000	Can kind of be that common
8169000	8171000	Thread of understanding
8171000	8173000	Is reasonably interesting
8173000	8175000	And to notch
8175000	8177000	And to notch's credit
8177000	8179000	It is very
8179000	8181000	Obvious, very definitive
8181000	8183000	And it is very well done
8183000	8185000	When you're seeing Minecraft stuff at Walmart
8185000	8187000	Yeah right?
8187000	8189000	Yeah
8189000	8191000	That says a lot right there
8191000	8193000	Well I don't go to Walmart
8193000	8195000	But that's the course that Angry Birds took
8195000	8197000	So yes, I agree with that statement completely
8197000	8199000	I don't like to give them my business
8199000	8201000	But I was there helping Becky
8201000	8203000	Find stuff for her son for Christmas
8203000	8205000	That's fair
8205000	8207000	I ended up there too for something
8207000	8209000	It was the one place in town
8209000	8211000	That supposedly had a Playstation 4 camera
8211000	8213000	Because I've been trying to get that one
8213000	8215000	Oh my god, it is impossible
8215000	8217000	Sorry for the tangent train
8217000	8219000	It is fucking impossible to find a Playstation 4 camera
8219000	8221000	They are all gone
8221000	8223000	I was on a tip
8223000	8225000	On Twitter, I went to Fries.com
8225000	8227000	To order a
8227000	8229000	Playstation camera which they said would ship
8229000	8231000	January 26th
8231000	8233000	And I was like, alright, I'll wait the week, whatever
8233000	8235000	So I placed the order, you know, 70 bucks or whatever
8235000	8237000	New update, 2015
8237000	8239000	No, I get an email, we're sorry
8239000	8241000	We're not going to be able to ship on the day
8241000	8243000	We'll hold your pre-order if you want to cancel
8243000	8245000	Call such and such a number
8245000	8247000	I was kind of irritated
8247000	8249000	Why did you advertise something you knew you couldn't
8249000	8251000	Uphold?
8251000	8253000	I was a little irritated at that
8253000	8255000	Anyhow
8255000	8257000	I mean, I don't need it
8257000	8259000	I want it for broadcasting
8259000	8261000	That would be fun and doing other things
8261000	8263000	But it's not changing my opinion
8263000	8265000	It's a little frustrating
8265000	8267000	They're so flipping hard to find
8267000	8269000	Anyhow, let's talk about something that will be
8269000	8271000	Maybe a little easier to find
8271000	8273000	When it comes out
8273000	8276000	Sanity?
8303000	8305000	Sanity 2? This game is
8305000	8307000	Slightly punishing
8307000	8309000	Some people see it as, you know, it's like
8309000	8311000	The Dark Souls of 2D platformers
8311000	8313000	But anyhow
8313000	8315000	They first announced the
8315000	8317000	Sequel for WiiWare and PC
8317000	8319000	And now they're going to raise
8319000	8321000	$200,000 to try to get this
8321000	8323000	It looks like it will probably, actually I'm kind of
8323000	8325000	Curious where they're at right now
8325000	8327000	120, nope, go away
8327000	8329000	127,000, 26 days to go
8329000	8331000	26 days to go
8331000	8333000	So four days they've already
8333000	8335000	Comfortable funding
8335000	8337000	Now that I've mentioned it here
8337000	8339000	They'll get another 100,000
8339000	8341000	But anyway
8341000	8343000	Yeah, if you like
8343000	8345000	The retro adventure games
8345000	8347000	You're going to get a kick out of this
8347000	8349000	For $15 you get
8349000	8351000	The Steam and DRM free copy
8351000	8353000	Of the game on release
8353000	8355000	So it's basically pre-ordering a game that will be done in a year
8355000	8357000	If they get certain stretch goals
8357000	8359000	They're looking at 3DS and Vita versions
8359000	8361000	At 1.15 million
8361000	8363000	Wii U, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One
8363000	8365000	Versions at 1.65 million
8365000	8367000	Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
8367000	8369000	At 2.35 million
8369000	8371000	Those stretch goals are quote
8371000	8373000	Subject to negotiation
8373000	8375000	Be interesting to see how that goes
8375000	8377000	So yeah
8377000	8379000	Pretty cool
8379000	8381000	Fans of La Mulana like Dark Tetsuya
8381000	8383000	I know are very happy about that
8383000	8385000	Alright
8385000	8387000	Pretty happy to see it's a new character too
8387000	8389000	Sugi, fun stuff
8389000	8391000	This game is really
8391000	8393000	In the same vein of everything that we've talked about before
8393000	8395000	This game is so incredibly
8395000	8397000	Meticulous as well
8397000	8399000	From when it was originally released in 20
8399000	8401000	Shit
8401000	8403000	Before 2010 it was originally like
8403000	8405000	2007
8405000	8407000	Or so
8407000	8409000	And the PC remake
8409000	8411000	That they made is
8411000	8413000	The Wii version was rather tame
8413000	8415000	But the PC remake that was released last year
8415000	8417000	Or 2012 I can't recall
8417000	8419000	I remember the Wii one was delayed
8419000	8421000	Dramatically improved
8421000	8423000	And yet another game with a storied history
8423000	8425000	Of something that has just been
8425000	8427000	Refined and refined and refined
8427000	8429000	For the better
8429000	8431000	And now they're continuing forward with new content
8431000	8433000	Perfect, wonderful
8433000	8435000	Alright
8435000	8437000	Well let's look at the wonderful content that sits inside our mailbag
8437000	8439000	Mailbag at
8439000	8441000	OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails
8441000	8443000	Every week Dark Sakura dives in the
8443000	8445000	Mailbag head first
8445000	8447000	And pulls out a couple emails that she
8447000	8449000	Believes are worthy of repeating
8449000	8451000	Here on this program
8451000	8453000	How many emails do we have tonight? Three
8453000	8455000	Three emails
8455000	8457000	I haven't checked for anything else and I'm only going to read these three
8457000	8459000	Probably just a bunch of spam
8459000	8461000	Howdy gang stars
8461000	8463000	Howdy
8463000	8465000	I'd like to expand on the thoughts that I tried to express
8465000	8467000	In the FUGL question of the week from last week
8467000	8469000	I was unable to do so due to the confines of an outdated
8469000	8471000	Artform that only exists in the modern world
8471000	8473000	For the purposes of nostalgia
8473000	8475000	QQ more
8475000	8477000	Also known as Haikus
8477000	8479000	Haikus
8479000	8481000	For people who didn't catch that
8481000	8483000	Like I didn't catch that mic
8483000	8485000	Just now
8485000	8487000	By the way Haiku is not outdated
8487000	8489000	It is still in use
8489000	8491000	Nintendo has a unique place in the marketplace
8491000	8493000	But only
8493000	8495000	But one only also held by Sony and Microsoft
8495000	8497000	In addition to being a video game developer
8497000	8499000	Nintendo is
8499000	8501000	As is well known a console creator
8501000	8503000	While their role as a video game developer
8503000	8505000	Allows them to be much more unique
8505000	8507000	In how they approach the market
8507000	8509000	Nintendo's role as a console creator is much different
8509000	8511000	In that role Nintendo must not
8511000	8513000	Offer a product
8513000	8515000	That is tailored for any specific use
8515000	8517000	Or function
8517000	8519000	They must instead provide a product that allows for
8519000	8521000	A wide variance
8521000	8523000	Of products and services
8523000	8525000	A narrow focus on specific tasks
8525000	8527000	And function serves to only limit
8527000	8529000	The products the company other than Nintendo
8529000	8531000	Can utilize on their console
8531000	8533000	If not incentivize companies
8533000	8535000	To avoid the console altogether
8535000	8537000	For that reason
8537000	8539000	Nintendo should work to broaden the kinds of products
8539000	8541000	And services
8541000	8543000	That companies other than Nintendo can put on their
8543000	8545000	Current console the Wii U
8545000	8547000	One of the ways they can do this is by providing
8547000	8549000	A decent stable and safe online environment
8549000	8551000	That can be utilized through the Wii U
8551000	8553000	And I need to renew my chat room
8553000	8555000	Because it's not working
8555000	8557000	Where was I?
8557000	8559000	It doesn't have to be a robust service
8559000	8561000	Like Xbox Live or PSN
8561000	8563000	I help my nieces spend hours a day
8563000	8565000	Playing games on the Disney website
8565000	8567000	They don't have to sign in or provide any
8567000	8569000	Information in order to play
8569000	8571000	My nieces can just call up the Disney games website
8571000	8573000	Click on whatever particular game they want to play
8573000	8575000	And enjoy
8575000	8577000	Perhaps Nintendo could come up with something like that
8577000	8579000	Also boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, additionally boobs
8579000	8581000	Stay black, Redertainment
8581000	8583000	For history's sake
8583000	8585000	January
8585000	8587000	No, January
8587000	8589000	19th
8589000	8591000	Last week's
8591000	8593000	Fugu question of the week
8593000	8595000	Redertainment's haiku was
8595000	8597000	Create a better platform
8597000	8599000	For online gaming
8599000	8601000	Also boobs, boobs, boobs
8601000	8603000	At least his email
8603000	8605000	His email did truly expand on that
8605000	8607000	Because he added more boobs
8609000	8611000	No
8611000	8613000	I don't necessarily disagree with what he's saying
8613000	8615000	At all
8615000	8617000	They've got to figure out how to get those third parties back
8617000	8619000	The thing about
8619000	8621000	The very last point about
8621000	8623000	Creating a safe environment
8623000	8625000	Is what the definition
8625000	8627000	Of a safe environment
8627000	8629000	Is going to be
8629000	8631000	What you just described
8631000	8633000	Your nieces being able to go on Disney and play games
8633000	8635000	I don't know this for certain
8635000	8637000	But I'm pretty damn sure that yes
8637000	8639000	Games become available just like
8639000	8641000	Getting a disc into the Wii U
8641000	8643000	Or downloading something from the shop and going to it
8643000	8645000	That's an online environment
8645000	8647000	Kind of
8647000	8649000	Super Mario 3D World and the Miis
8649000	8651000	Gravitating around
8651000	8653000	That is an online environment
8653000	8655000	That those online aspects come into your game
8655000	8657000	Xbox
8657000	8659000	Microsoft and Sony provide a
8659000	8661000	Robust messaging and communication system
8661000	8663000	Alongside matchmaking
8663000	8665000	Multiplayer, etc, etc, games
8665000	8667000	Um
8667000	8669000	As soon as you allow
8669000	8671000	Two people to communicate
8671000	8673000	It is inherently unsafe
8673000	8675000	Period, that's why every single game has
8675000	8677000	Online interactions not rated by the ESRB
8677000	8679000	Because people will say
8679000	8681000	Type, gesture, do whatever
8681000	8683000	They can possibly do
8683000	8685000	Based off whatever they want to do
8687000	8689000	Indeed true
8689000	8691000	So it's difficult, that's all I'm saying
8691000	8693000	It's quite difficult
8693000	8695000	Yes, let's
8695000	8697000	But thank you for the email, it's very
8697000	8699000	Very pointed considering the
8699000	8701000	Lengths of the debate we went to last week
8701000	8703000	Thank you and I agree with the boobs
8703000	8705000	Seconded
8705000	8707000	This email comes from Andy R
8707000	8709000	Hey OLR
8709000	8711000	First time writers who forgive me for any
8711000	8713000	Grammar mistakes, okay
8713000	8715000	Just wanted to say that I agree with Jason
8715000	8717000	About the Wii quote failing
8717000	8719000	As a game console, it didn't succeed
8719000	8721000	On the strength of its library at first
8721000	8723000	It succeeded at being
8723000	8725000	The Tickle Me Elmo of Insert Year Wii
8725000	8727000	Came out
8727000	8729000	Even my parents bought one and there's no way
8729000	8731000	They would have bought any other video game console
8731000	8733000	It was a runaway success because
8733000	8735000	It managed to strike a chord
8735000	8737000	With a casual crowd who tend to be more
8737000	8739000	Fickle about what catches on and what doesn't
8739000	8741000	Wii U has failed to capture
8741000	8743000	That market again, myriad of reasons
8743000	8745000	In my opinion
8745000	8747000	And I don't think it ever will at this
8747000	8749000	Rate, it's now the more hardcore gamer
8749000	8751000	Crowd feels scorned after
8751000	8753000	How the Wii was largely marketed
8753000	8755000	To a different crowd
8755000	8757000	Anyway, just my two cents, I don't think Nintendo
8757000	8759000	Is necessarily in dire straights
8759000	8761000	Mario Kart and Smash
8761000	8763000	Still have a chance to turn things around
8763000	8765000	And at least get the gamer crowd back
8765000	8767000	On board, they'll keep cranking out
8767000	8769000	Their first party games and I think they'll be
8769000	8771000	Fine by the end of the generation
8771000	8773000	Can I just, I just want to say real quick
8773000	8775000	While you cough up a storm there, the whole
8775000	8777000	Tickle Me Elmo comparison, like I
8777000	8779000	Get that angle, like the Wii was kind of like
8779000	8781000	The hot thing that year, so like I get the position
8781000	8783000	There, but could you kind of say the same thing about
8783000	8785000	The Xbox One and the Playstation 4 this year?
8785000	8787000	Nope. Why?
8787000	8789000	Because what's the
8789000	8791000	There was nothing really to rival
8791000	8793000	Sorry, there was nothing really to rival the Tickle Me Elmo
8793000	8795000	When it came out, I'm just saying
8795000	8797000	In terms of that type of toy and things that
8797000	8799000	Had that much hype, but now we've got
8799000	8801000	First of all, direct competitors
8801000	8803000	So there's two of them
8803000	8805000	Offering comparable deals
8805000	8807000	And each with their dedicated fanbases
8807000	8809000	It's really
8809000	8811000	An
8811000	8813000	It's like
8813000	8815000	Comparing
8815000	8817000	Apples and oranges
8817000	8819000	To a
8819000	8821000	A potato
8821000	8823000	Well, but
8823000	8825000	To be fair, the Wii and the Playstation 3
8825000	8827000	Came out the same year, yet the
8827000	8829000	Wii dominated the conversation based off
8829000	8831000	The strength of Wii Sports and the other launch titles
8831000	8833000	This generation's consoles are still on the shelves
8833000	8835000	Maybe not so much the PS4
8835000	8837000	Because of stock for the overseas
8837000	8839000	For the overseas launch
8839000	8841000	But this is exactly the point that I was trying to make
8841000	8843000	Is that the Wii was gone
8843000	8845000	For so long
8845000	8847000	Yeah, you could pre-order
8847000	8849000	You'll get stock when you get it
8849000	8851000	Like the 360 had been the year before?
8853000	8855000	Gotcha
8855000	8857000	It's really hard for me
8857000	8859000	To have a mental
8859000	8861000	A particular map of this
8861000	8863000	Because I've been a latecomer to every single console
8863000	8865000	I've never done it on launch day
8865000	8867000	I've never tried to get it on launch day
8867000	8869000	Failed and had to
8869000	8871000	Continue to follow up to actually
8871000	8873000	Take physical stock
8873000	8875000	Of when this stuff is available
8875000	8877000	Yeah, they work out
8877000	8879000	Supply issues
8879000	8881000	They ramp up, people buy them with less frequency
8881000	8883000	And they start to show up again
8883000	8885000	Jamie just made the point
8885000	8887000	That their dedicated camps
8887000	8889000	Are responsible for these
8889000	8891000	Millions of sales in the first month
8891000	8893000	Yep
8893000	8895000	100% true
8895000	8897000	But the Wii persisted
8897000	8899000	The Wii was the perfect storm
8899000	8901000	Because it had this huge up front
8901000	8903000	Rush that had an incredibly
8903000	8905000	Long tail and incredibly long wind down
8905000	8907000	And
8907000	8909000	Something I came up with
8909000	8911000	Listening to last week's episode again
8911000	8913000	They had good
8913000	8915000	Late
8915000	8917000	Late life releases
8917000	8919000	Galaxy was absolutely phenomenal
8919000	8921000	Uh
8921000	8923000	Fucking
8923000	8925000	Every single Wii game
8925000	8927000	I have on the shelf literally just
8927000	8929000	Erased from my mind
8929000	8931000	Nintendo had a good late life library
8931000	8933000	Which is
8933000	8935000	Stereotypically Nintendo
8935000	8937000	These releases keep going the entire time
8937000	8939000	Which only boosted its numbers
8939000	8941000	But that initial surge of
8941000	8943000	Everything
8943000	8945000	Was all because of a new audiences
8945000	8947000	And Wii Sports
8947000	8949000	Carried over to Wii Fit
8949000	8951000	Let's move on with the rest of the email
8951000	8953000	Oh yeah we didn't finish that did we
8953000	8955000	No we did not
8955000	8957000	Also quickly on the topic of the Magic the Gathering movie
8957000	8959000	You guys were comparing it to Battleship
8959000	8961000	Or Clue or other board games
8961000	8963000	But there's already a strong narrative in the game
8963000	8965000	There have been a ton of books and comics that flesh out the story
8965000	8967000	And they've even got an entire team devoted to making sure
8967000	8969000	That all the properties stay true to the world
8969000	8971000	That game has created
8971000	8973000	Pausing here
8973000	8975000	I did read a lot of the Magic the Gathering comics
8975000	8977000	When I was really into playing it
8977000	8979000	And
8979000	8981000	I just
8981000	8983000	Wasn't that interested in the backstory
8983000	8985000	It was just a fun game to play
8985000	8987000	Piggybacking on your pause here
8987000	8989000	I get the whole
8989000	8991000	It's not Battleship or Clue
8991000	8993000	Okay I get that angle
8993000	8995000	I kind of think about Dungeons and Dragons
8995000	8997000	Obviously there's a very rich story there
8997000	8999000	There's the books and everything else
8999000	9001000	And then the movie came out and it was kind of
9001000	9003000	This crap
9003000	9005000	And I wanted to like it because Tom Baker was in it
9005000	9007000	And a lot of times those books
9007000	9009000	And everything else they kind of get ignored
9009000	9011000	I mean the World of Warcraft movie is going to
9011000	9013000	Face this problem, you know how much of the books
9013000	9015000	Is it really going to pay attention to it
9015000	9017000	There is a rich story
9017000	9019000	For the Warcraft stuff too
9019000	9021000	Star Trek and Star Wars, this new Star Wars
9021000	9023000	Movies, it ain't going to follow any of the books
9023000	9025000	Well they already said that the books are pretty much
9025000	9027000	Now Apocrypha
9027000	9029000	To finish this up
9029000	9031000	Almost all the blocks
9031000	9033000	Magic term for three consecutive
9033000	9035000	Expansions tell a story
9035000	9037000	And while it can be tough to figure
9037000	9039000	That out just through individual cards
9039000	9041000	It is there
9041000	9043000	Just pointing it out because I doubt this will be like
9043000	9045000	A Yu-Gi-Oh type thing
9045000	9047000	And definitely not something like Battleship
9047000	9049000	I know we're being cynical
9049000	9051000	Because a lot of video game movies turn out like garbage
9051000	9053000	I think it would be awesome if the movie
9053000	9055000	Turns out really well
9055000	9057000	Like if they can actually pull it off
9058000	9060000	It would need a freaking Lord of the Rings treatment
9060000	9062000	To make it good
9062000	9064000	Honestly
9064000	9066000	What does that say about all the negative critique
9066000	9068000	Of The Hobbit though
9068000	9070000	Yeah but then again
9070000	9072000	The Hobbit is a children's book
9072000	9074000	Therefore it was actually
9074000	9076000	A relatively short story
9076000	9078000	Did not need
9078000	9080000	Stuff pulled from
9080000	9082000	The side books and short stories
9082000	9084000	And every other little doodle
9084000	9086000	Tolkien happened to put on paper
9087000	9089000	It needed to be one fucking movie
9089000	9091000	I love this comment from Bobby in the chat room
9091000	9093000	Land will be tapped in a theater near you
9095000	9097000	Love it
9097000	9099000	I get it
9099000	9101000	I just keep having flashbacks
9101000	9103000	Of how many hours of my life I wasted
9103000	9105000	Playing Magic
9105000	9107000	Finally Rob
9107000	9109000	Why so much hate for the non indie podcast
9109000	9111000	I listen to a ton of podcasts each week
9111000	9113000	Some indie and some not
9113000	9115000	Even the ones that are affiliated with the company
9115000	9117000	I listen to people who love video games
9117000	9119000	And talk about video games
9119000	9121000	Thanks and keep up the podcast
9121000	9123000	As Andrew are
9123000	9125000	Thanks for asking that actually
9125000	9127000	So I can kind of set the record straight
9127000	9129000	On some things here
9129000	9131000	Hate is a strong word
9131000	9133000	Hate is a very strong word
9133000	9135000	I don't hate non indie podcasts
9135000	9137000	I don't hate them
9137000	9139000	I really like to support indie podcasts
9139000	9141000	And my fellow people that go out there
9141000	9143000	And really work their butts off
9143000	9145000	Because indie podcasters
9145000	9147000	Have to work ten times as hard
9147000	9149000	To achieve something that
9149000	9151000	A corporate backed podcast
9151000	9153000	Can achieve very easily
9153000	9155000	Whether the quality be good or not
9155000	9157000	And that's just the way it is
9157000	9159000	I'm not saying that out of a jealousy thing
9159000	9161000	But it really irks me in the indie scene
9161000	9163000	When I see people
9163000	9165000	Striking each other down
9165000	9167000	Why are you fighting with each other
9167000	9169000	And having these silly little wars
9169000	9171000	When we have to fight
9171000	9173000	There's so much to get noticed anyway
9173000	9175000	Amongst these corporate backed things
9175000	9177000	And look to the story we talked about earlier
9177000	9179000	With the whole
9179000	9181000	Paying off
9181000	9183000	Paying for the plugs
9183000	9185000	Product placement and so forth
9185000	9187000	It kind of gets into some of the other things
9187000	9189000	You really have to consider are a factor
9189000	9191000	When you talk about corporate games
9191000	9193000	Does that mean all the people
9193000	9195000	That work for these corporate companies
9195000	9197000	And work for corporate podcasts are shrills
9197000	9199000	No no no
9199000	9201000	That really pursued their passion
9201000	9203000	They do it for a living, I applaud them
9203000	9205000	There's a lot of very talented people that do
9205000	9207000	Happen to do it for a living
9207000	9209000	I don't necessarily need to be
9209000	9211000	Plugging them because they've got their audience
9211000	9213000	They're easy to find, you know where to look
9213000	9215000	But I will say
9215000	9217000	Again, having a night where I'm just going to
9217000	9219000	Tell it like it is, there are also
9219000	9221000	Some people out there in the industry
9221000	9223000	That are doing these shows
9223000	9225000	That don't have that level of passion
9225000	9227000	On some shows
9228000	9230000	That's been very obvious to me
9230000	9232000	As a listener, maybe I'm just
9232000	9234000	Old or picky, I don't know
9234000	9236000	I definitely have heard those corporate based
9236000	9238000	Podcasts where somebody was only there
9238000	9240000	Because they had to be
9240000	9242000	And that just
9242000	9244000	When we
9244000	9246000	Put so much effort into this
9246000	9248000	And do it for nothing
9248000	9250000	That really stings sometimes
9250000	9252000	When you hear people talking up
9252000	9254000	This particular podcast where people plainly
9254000	9256000	And obviously don't want to be there
9256000	9258000	That's the really tricky part
9258000	9260000	However, granted, that is the minority
9262000	9264000	So
9264000	9266000	I think that's great that you have your shows
9266000	9268000	That you support and listen to
9268000	9270000	And there are some great corporate based shows
9270000	9272000	Out there, but I just
9272000	9274000	I choose to support those that have to
9274000	9276000	Work a little bit harder to get noticed
9276000	9278000	I would add to that that
9278000	9280000	The situation is getting
9280000	9282000	A bit more diverse and by the same token
9282000	9284000	A little bit muddier because
9284000	9286000	The rise of YouTube and
9286000	9288000	It's the same story over and over and over again
9288000	9290000	You affiliate, you partner, you whatever
9290000	9292000	But these
9292000	9294000	You know, corporate backed
9294000	9296000	Networks that
9296000	9298000	Pick up individual
9298000	9300000	I don't quite know the business
9300000	9302000	Details of it, but corporations
9302000	9304000	That pick up
9304000	9306000	Indie producers
9306000	9308000	Because their content is
9308000	9310000	Engaging and they have an established base
9310000	9312000	And they
9312000	9314000	Do so so that they can provide
9314000	9316000	Um
9316000	9318000	So that the
9318000	9320000	Said originally
9320000	9322000	Indie can start doing things
9322000	9324000	For the company, for the corporation
9324000	9326000	But it also
9326000	9328000	The theory is that it's a two way street
9328000	9330000	The individual is able to
9330000	9332000	Continue doing what they're doing
9332000	9334000	Take on additional responsibilities with the company
9334000	9336000	But also do events
9336000	9338000	Personally taking advantage of company
9338000	9340000	Resources
9340000	9342000	And also literally
9342000	9344000	Legal protection, YouTube fuckery
9344000	9346000	To some extent, that kind of thing
9346000	9348000	There's a lot of interesting
9348000	9350000	Indie organized
9350000	9352000	Networks on YouTube
9352000	9354000	And various other locations right now
9354000	9356000	And it's
9356000	9358000	It is really hard
9358000	9360000	To figure out
9360000	9362000	On what side of the coin
9362000	9364000	These people lie
9364000	9366000	Sometimes
9366000	9368000	But the point is that
9369000	9371000	Be there for the content that you enjoy
9371000	9373000	And that you can tell the people enjoy as well
9373000	9375000	That means, that probably means
9375000	9377000	You're having a good time listening to it
9377000	9379000	It's really the whole point
9379000	9381000	There are some people out there very passionate about
9381000	9383000	Games who are gamers and
9383000	9385000	Are very good at what they do
9385000	9387000	And have a lot of good things to say
9387000	9389000	Unfortunately, not everybody's in the game industry for those reasons
9389000	9391000	And that's a harsh reality
9391000	9393000	That
9393000	9395000	You know, you'll find out for yourself
9395000	9397000	If you go to some of these press events
9397000	9399000	And see it first hand
9399000	9401000	That's all I'm going to say
9403000	9405000	That individual lives in Arizona
9405000	9407000	Or did by the area code
9407000	9409000	Thank you Andrew
9409000	9411000	Well, last email
9411000	9413000	Give away his home address while you're at it Jason, jeez
9413000	9415000	Well that's not in the email
9415000	9417000	I would if I, no no no
9417000	9419000	I did want to say thank you for the email
9419000	9421000	Because the beginning said it was a first time emailer
9421000	9423000	So I love those whole long time listener first time callers
9423000	9425000	First time writers?
9425000	9427000	And your grammar was excellent
9427000	9429000	What's up gang?
9429000	9431000	So funny enough
9431000	9433000	I just got done posting
9433000	9435000	On the Frugal Question
9435000	9437000	And my email is kinda sorta about the same thing
9437000	9439000	I'm playing through Devil May Cry
9439000	9441000	The 2013 one
9441000	9443000	And I've come to realize
9443000	9445000	I love the raw gritty and cocky new Dante
9445000	9447000	And the game itself as a whole
9447000	9449000	I was wondering what your thoughts were on the game
9449000	9451000	Haven't played it, that's just me
9451000	9453000	I remember when the game released
9453000	9455000	And it was, cool topic of the month
9455000	9457000	Was to hate the new Dante
9457000	9459000	Do you think that gaming in this generation
9459000	9461000	Has an unfair advantage
9461000	9463000	Due to the internet negativity
9463000	9465000	I remember when the only gaming news
9465000	9467000	I would get was just for magazines
9467000	9469000	Oh well I guess we were just getting old
9469000	9471000	It was a P
9471000	9473000	I have to admit I have not
9473000	9475000	Played the new Devil May Cry
9475000	9477000	It went cheap on Steam, I was thinking about buying it
9477000	9479000	It's free on Playstation Plus right now actually
9479000	9481000	Let me, he's gonna hate me
9481000	9483000	Alan!
9483000	9485000	Alan! Help!
9485000	9487000	Help me!
9487000	9489000	Cause he has played it
9489000	9491000	Can you hear us in there?
9491000	9493000	Do you know what we're talking about?
9493000	9495000	We're talking about the new Devil May Cry game
9495000	9497000	And none of us have played it
9497000	9499000	But I know you have played it
9499000	9501000	And what did the emailer want to know about the Dante
9501000	9503000	First question was
9503000	9505000	I wonder what your thoughts were on the game
9505000	9507000	And he said that he liked the new Dante
9507000	9509000	It has
9509000	9511000	Like
9511000	9513000	Everything is super edgy
9513000	9515000	And grim dark
9515000	9517000	And the new Dante
9517000	9519000	Drops the F bomb a lot
9519000	9521000	And it's very try hard in that regard
9521000	9523000	But as far as the play style
9523000	9525000	Like the art direction
9525000	9527000	And the settings, I really enjoy that
9527000	9529000	The new Dante, he's cute
9529000	9531000	I mean you get to see him naked
9531000	9533000	I'm downloading this
9533000	9535000	I don't care
9535000	9537000	I will say it does do a very good job
9537000	9539000	At bringing a quality to, well you know somewhat
9539000	9541000	To objectifying the man
9541000	9543000	I would like to see him objectify some more
9543000	9545000	And
9545000	9547000	There on the PC version
9547000	9549000	There are mods, not nude mods
9549000	9551000	Damn!
9551000	9553000	But I think there's a shirtless mod
9553000	9555000	How do you know about this stuff you perv?
9555000	9557000	Cause when I got it on Steam for like
9557000	9559000	17 cents, I googled Devil May Cry mods
9559000	9561000	And there's a site for it
9561000	9563000	I think you might have googled
9563000	9565000	More specifically than that
9565000	9567000	Just saying!
9567000	9569000	I think a lot of the original franchise
9569000	9571000	Devil May Cry fans are upset
9571000	9573000	About the reboot
9573000	9575000	It's because there was no real resolution
9575000	9577000	To the original franchise
9577000	9579000	The new Dante is a lot
9579000	9581000	He's different from the original one
9581000	9583000	In kind of shitty ways
9583000	9585000	So there's some anger there
9585000	9587000	It's a fun game
9587000	9589000	Thank you for letting me pick on you, appreciate it
9589000	9591000	I just like that the whole Devil May Cry thing
9591000	9593000	Actually came from a Resident Evil
9595000	9597000	Type thing
9597000	9599000	My last experience with Devil May Cry
9599000	9601000	Was playing Devil May Cry 3
9601000	9603000	Failing so hard
9603000	9605000	That I unlocked easy mode
9605000	9607000	And I have not played another one since
9607000	9609000	Not because
9609000	9611000	Not out of personal scorn or anything like that
9611000	9613000	But because I didn't get a PS3
9613000	9615000	For two or three years
9615000	9617000	And still to this day
9617000	9619000	My PS3 library is
9619000	9621000	Literally nothing compared to the 360
9623000	9625000	Devil May Cry 4
9625000	9627000	Eventually came out on the 360
9627000	9629000	But not until after it's PS3
9629000	9631000	Oh my god, it's still 50 bucks on Steam
9631000	9633000	It's free right now on PS3
9633000	9635000	Yeah, but I don't
9635000	9637000	I don't play my consoles
9637000	9639000	My hand hurts
9639000	9641000	At any rate, PlayStation Plus
9641000	9643000	I picked it up
9643000	9645000	I will definitely pick this series back up
9645000	9647000	I don't know, I've loved this series
9647000	9649000	I don't remember much of the second one
9649000	9651000	But I'm sure I enjoyed it
9651000	9653000	I definitely love this kind of play style
9653000	9655000	Terrible at it, obviously
9655000	9657000	Easy mode
9657000	9659000	But I now have Devil May Cry reboot
9659000	9661000	And I'll pick it up
9661000	9663000	As soon as the opportunity presents itself
9663000	9665000	But it's in my library
9665000	9667000	So I can, in theory, do that
9667000	9669000	Whenever I want
9669000	9671000	Yeah, whatever
9671000	9673000	I'm paying 50 bucks for it
9673000	9675000	There'll be an Uber sale soon enough
9675000	9677000	Oh, there was more to that email
9677000	9679000	Yeah, Rob, geez
9679000	9681000	PS, on a side note
9681000	9683000	I just finished Brothers A Tale of Two Sons earlier this week
9683000	9685000	If you've not played this game, pour yourself a nice glass of wine
9685000	9687000	Sit down and prepare to play
9687000	9689000	One of the most beautiful games you will ever play
9689000	9691000	It is three hours of an amazing score
9691000	9693000	Gorgeous graphics
9693000	9695000	And one hell of a memorable story
9695000	9697000	Congrats, Loki, on the new edition
9697000	9699000	And that comes from Travis
9699000	9701000	Not our Travis D, but a Travis H
9701000	9703000	The same one that we answered on Google earlier, right?
9703000	9705000	Yes
9705000	9707000	Thank you for the email, Travis, appreciate it
9707000	9709000	And another recommendation
9709000	9711000	For Brother A Tale of Two Sons
9711000	9713000	Yeah, but oddly enough
9713000	9715000	His name just like sent a song
9715000	9717000	Sailing through my head
9717000	9719000	Because for the moment I first read his name
9719000	9721000	I actually read Trevor
9721000	9723000	So now I have the magical Trevor song stuck in my head
9723000	9725000	So thank you, Travis
9725000	9727000	Alright, thank you to all our emailers
9727000	9729000	Mailbag at orangesontrated.com
9729000	9731000	This is the place to send your thoughts for a future episode
9731000	9733000	Alright, in the meantime
9733000	9735000	We got to get to our FUs of the Week
9735000	9737000	Let's do it
9737000	9739000	Why do we do the FUs of the Week?
9739000	9741000	Because we're mad and stuff
9741000	9743000	This is bad
9743000	9745000	This is justice
9745000	9747000	This is punishment
9747000	9749000	This is fucked up
9749000	9751000	FU to free pastries that I can't eat
9751000	9753000	That's it
9753000	9755000	It's tragic
9755000	9757000	It is tragic
9757000	9759000	Because I'm being a good girl
9759000	9761000	My FU goes to not knowing when to say when
9761000	9763000	Jason
9763000	9765000	I don't know
9765000	9767000	I don't know
9767000	9769000	I don't know
9769000	9771000	Jason
9773000	9781000	Is this the part where I kill the pity party by saying that because San Francisco is kind of sort of vacation for me
9781000	9783000	For a month vacation
9783000	9785000	Since it's vacation for me I relax my diet a little bit
9785000	9787000	And then I'm gonna do this kind of stuff
9787000	9789000	Be more serious about this stuff when I get back home
9789000	9791000	No, FU to being sick
9791000	9795000	It actually impacted this week a hell of a lot harder
9795000	9799000	This week was gonna be really important to me
9799000	9801000	And it still was a lot of shit
9801000	9803000	A lot of productive shit happened
9803000	9809000	But I had a really bad feeling about it going into Friday
9809000	9817000	I was having trouble staying awake during the day every single day this week
9817000	9822000	And then me and a bunch of coworkers go out for a nice time on Thursday night
9822000	9824000	And I get back into my hotel room
9824000	9826000	I'm more or less fine
9826000	9828000	Friday hits and I'm just destroyed
9828000	9832000	And so were about 20 other coworkers of mine
9832000	9836000	Probably even more than that that I haven't seen or talked to to actually know the final numbers
9836000	9838000	FU to being sick
9838000	9840000	FU to being miserable
9840000	9844000	FU to the kind of sickness that doesn't let you sleep laying down
9844000	9846000	Sitting up to sleep does not work so well
9846000	9848000	Thankfully I'm basically over it
9849000	9852000	FU to somebody else who may have gotten me sick
9852000	9854000	Maybe, not really
9854000	9856000	There was another one
9856000	9859000	I've said this probably for the last two to three weeks
9859000	9861000	FU to sleep schedules
9861000	9865000	I'm gonna be up all night tonight of my own doing because I'm like that
9865000	9873000	Finishing off 536 because I don't want to get in a rut of being behind YouTube videos
9874000	9878000	FU to having to catch up and having to sleep and having obligations and everything else
9878000	9880000	Sorry to hear you, well I was sick too
9880000	9882000	I should have given a nephew to being sick myself
9882000	9884000	But luckily it didn't last long
9884000	9886000	That's the good news
9886000	9890000	Basically better yesterday and then today I woke up
9890000	9894000	I felt pretty damn good this morning
9894000	9896000	And that's the best part about being sick
9896000	9900000	Even though I couldn't do too terribly much to recover
9901000	9905000	As soon as I did, oh my god, it was so rejuvenating
9905000	9907000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys
9907000	9911000	Then we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR
9911000	9913000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
9913000	9915000	That's all one word, OrangeLoungeRadio
9915000	9919000	But not just yet, we're gonna first do just a couple more stories here for you
9919000	9920000	Before we open that up
9920000	9925000	Bethesda has announced last Thursday the members of the VoiceOver cast
9925000	9928000	That will be working on The Elder Scrolls Online
9928000	9932000	Which is due to come out three days after April Fool's Day
9932000	9934000	Why did I read it that way? I don't know
9934000	9935000	I felt like it
9935000	9937000	Everybody knows what day April Fool's Day is
9937000	9939000	And if you don't, well
9939000	9942000	You'll find out what, you'll find out when it happens
9942000	9945000	The cast members as announced
9945000	9948000	I'm just gonna go, I'll do it all
9948000	9950000	John Cleese as Cadwell
9950000	9954000	The cheery and endearingly mad lost soul who is not afraid of anyone
9954000	9957000	Bill Nighy, High King Emmerich
9957000	9960000	A merchant prince whose determination won him the throne
9960000	9964000	Kate Beckinsale, Queen Iryn
9964000	9965000	Leader of the Ald...
9965000	9968000	Man, I'm very good at pronouncing these, aren't I?
9968000	9970000	Leader of the Aldmeri
9970000	9973000	There's some real garbage words in The Elder Scrolls
9973000	9975000	They're classical
9975000	9979000	Leader of the Aldmeri Dominion and Queen of the High Elves
9979000	9983000	Alfred Molina as Abner Tharn
9983000	9986000	A wily old wizard who is head of the Empire's Elder Council
9986000	9988000	Linda Carter as Azura
9988000	9993000	The Daedric Princess from Skyrim who is a popular part of the lore
9993000	9995000	Fuck yes Wonder Woman
9995000	9997000	These are, these are, these are
9997000	9999000	A celebrity cast exactly as they said
9999000	10001000	Michael Gambon, The Prophet
10001000	10004000	A blind man who guides the player through their journey
10006000	10008000	Can we talk about this?
10008000	10010000	I get it, mystical history and all that kind of shit
10010000	10012000	But a blind man who guides the player through their journey
10012000	10014000	Come on!
10014000	10015000	Sorry
10015000	10017000	I don't understand, what's the...
10018000	10020000	A blind man who guides people
10020000	10022000	Well, why not?
10024000	10026000	I'm in one of those moods
10026000	10028000	Malcolm McDowell as
10028000	10031000	You think it's fine? What about, like you see the blind fighters
10031000	10034000	Yeah, it's possible
10034000	10036000	There's the stories, people, echolocation
10036000	10038000	I've even heard of blind people riding a bike
10038000	10040000	I get it, I don't know
10040000	10042000	We've got blind people who listen to the show
10042000	10044000	And do the video game
10044000	10048000	Like the crazy video game clears
10048000	10050000	Like on Killer Instinct and stuff
10050000	10052000	I'm trying to think of the games that are out there
10052000	10054000	Where they do everything
10054000	10056000	It's so impressive
10056000	10058000	Okay, I'm being an idiot, I accept that argument
10058000	10060000	I don't know, something about these descriptions
10060000	10062000	Something about these descriptions
10062000	10064000	The way they worded it
10064000	10066000	The way they worded it
10066000	10068000	They worded it, they got to you
10068000	10070000	Malcolm McDowell as
10070000	10072000	The Daedric God who schemes to
10072000	10074000	Enslave the mortals of Tamriel
10074000	10076000	Some extras
10076000	10078000	Peter Stomer
10078000	10080000	The Skulled King, a monarch who led his people
10080000	10082000	Into an unlikely alliance
10082000	10084000	Jim Ward as
10084000	10086000	A renegade high elf wizard
10086000	10088000	Exiled from the realm for raising the dead
10088000	10090000	Jennifer Hale as
10090000	10092000	A Nord high giant who
10092000	10094000	Along with the prophet, aids the player
10094000	10096000	Michael Richardson, Sai Sahan
10096000	10098000	A noble martial artist and
10098000	10100000	Master swordsman
10100000	10102000	Getting it, I don't care what it is
10102000	10104000	This is a pretty amazing cast
10104000	10106000	And then the mosaic of all of the actors
10106000	10108000	And actresses, voice actors and actresses
10108000	10110000	At the bottom, even if you don't recognize the names
10110000	10112000	You're gonna recognize these faces
10112000	10114000	Good for them, Bethesda
10114000	10116000	Fucking awesome work, thank you
10116000	10118000	Akuma JP is talking about
10118000	10120000	You see it in almost all Chinese movies
10120000	10122000	What's wrong?
10122000	10124000	Yeah, it was
10124000	10126000	Hold on, cause you got support here in the chat
10126000	10128000	SSG100Matt says, I think Jason just feels the notion
10128000	10130000	Of a blind prophet leading someone is cliche
10130000	10132000	And overused
10132000	10134000	These are all completely valid
10134000	10136000	I
10136000	10138000	Distilled into its simplest
10138000	10140000	Form, it seems hokey
10140000	10142000	Predictable and typical
10142000	10144000	But that's also what makes it the best possible
10144000	10146000	Thing, because the fact that without sight
10146000	10148000	You can do anything of this nature is
10148000	10150000	Absolutely stupendous and
10150000	10152000	Amazing of the individual
10154000	10156000	You're all correct, thank you
10156000	10158000	It's true
10158000	10160000	A white flag, I surrender
10160000	10162000	I surrender
10162000	10164000	Alright
10164000	10166000	Well, one thing
10166000	10168000	We need to wrap up the show cause we're dying over here
10168000	10170000	One thing we can all agree on
10170000	10172000	Is that the Super Nintendo is rad
10172000	10174000	And Super Nintendo is still having
10174000	10176000	Games made for it, which is pretty cool
10176000	10178000	Super Fighter Team
10178000	10180000	Is a retro publisher
10180000	10182000	And they are shipping a Super Nintendo
10182000	10184000	Run and gun platformer named
10184000	10186000	Nightmare Busters
10186000	10188000	And if you pre-order the game you will be
10188000	10190000	Seeing this shipped to your house very very soon
10190000	10192000	This game was originally supposed to launch
10192000	10194000	In 1994
10194000	10196000	You thought Duke Nukem
10196000	10198000	Forever had a long development
10198000	10200000	Two decades in the making
10200000	10202000	That's quite a bankroll
10202000	10204000	No more Duke Nukem jokes
10204000	10206000	Anyhow, it never happened
10206000	10208000	And yeah, a completed version
10208000	10210000	Was discovered years later
10210000	10212000	And Super Fighter Team started taking the pre-orders
10212000	10214000	Of the cartridge
10214000	10216000	If you want it, it'll cost you just $70
10216000	10218000	Plus shipping
10218000	10220000	How many years is $70?
10220000	10222000	Well, keep in mind that if you inflate the cost
10222000	10224000	Of what the cartridge used to cost back in the day
10224000	10226000	It was about $70 in today's money
10226000	10228000	It's very strange, I don't remember
10228000	10230000	I still have some very beat up
10230000	10232000	SNES boxes
10232000	10234000	I don't really remember the cost
10234000	10236000	A new SNES game
10236000	10238000	Probably because my mom and dad bought it
10238000	10240000	But that was my age
10240000	10242000	When I had my SNES
10242000	10244000	Oh, when Street Fighter 2
10244000	10246000	And Mortal Kombat with those complex
10246000	10248000	Chipsets that were in them
10248000	10250000	They were like $69 or even
10250000	10252000	I think it might have been $79
10252000	10254000	I remember exactly how much the killer instinct
10254000	10256000	Cost when I got it
10256000	10258000	It was exactly $60
10258000	10260000	I got it at Montgomery Ward
10260000	10262000	If that doesn't age it
10262000	10264000	Didn't Phantasy Star IV on the Genesis
10264000	10266000	Cost like $99 or something
10266000	10268000	Like really expensive?
10268000	10270000	I don't know that it was that much, was it?
10270000	10272000	I don't know, for some reason my mind goes
10272000	10274000	Tigerclaw, look it up for us
10274000	10276000	Every once in a while I just hear
10276000	10278000	These figures and it's
10278000	10280000	It's outrageous by today's
10280000	10282000	Standards, yet it seems somewhat
10282000	10284000	Expected and also you account
10284000	10286000	For the fact that cartridges aren't in mass
10286000	10288000	Production, which means they're more expensive
10288000	10290000	To produce
10290000	10292000	It's a strange conflict of trying to
10292000	10294000	Figure out where exactly
10294000	10296000	My mind is in regard to
10296000	10298000	How appropriate this cost is
10298000	10300000	But it looks fun, looks like a fun game
10300000	10302000	Good on them
10302000	10304000	Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line
10304000	10306000	It's open now, 1877 Game OLR
10306000	10308000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
10308000	10310000	If you want to give us a call and talk about any of tonight's topics
10310000	10312000	Or anything else we might have discussed tonight
10312000	10314000	Please go ahead and give us a
10314000	10316000	Call, it is the show after all
10316000	10318000	Where every gamer has a voice
10318000	10320000	Let's see
10320000	10322000	I'm going to try and pull up any tweets
10322000	10324000	I didn't see any earlier though
10324000	10326000	Remember how I said I was going to save an
10326000	10328000	Article for the end of the show?
10328000	10330000	Oh yeah, I do
10330000	10332000	Gee, thanks
10332000	10334000	In my defense
10334000	10336000	Two days away from being sick
10336000	10338000	I'm not at 100% yet, not that I remember
10338000	10340000	Thought you were going to help to bridge things together
10340000	10342000	Alright
10342000	10344000	Let's go to the phones
10344000	10346000	Because we do have a call coming in, hooray
10346000	10348000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10348000	10350000	It's DJ Ronimaz, how is everybody in the studio today?
10350000	10352000	Hey good, good to hear from you buddy, what's up?
10352000	10354000	We are all equally recovering
10354000	10356000	I feel that
10356000	10358000	I feel your pain
10358000	10360000	I just finished rebuilding my entire machine after my hard drive crash
10360000	10362000	Late last night
10362000	10364000	Oh
10364000	10366000	Yuck
10366000	10368000	But it's okay, all my important data
10368000	10370000	Including the porn, was saved
10370000	10372000	Yay
10372000	10374000	Okay
10374000	10376000	I got a couple of things I want to get off my chest
10376000	10378000	Then I'm going to get up on out here and let other people call in
10378000	10380000	Fair enough
10380000	10382000	Now, I was trying to call in last week
10382000	10384000	And get in this whole Wii U
10384000	10386000	Debate and debacle
10386000	10388000	And
10388000	10390000	Granted, the Wii U is
10390000	10392000	Not a disaster
10392000	10394000	According to what some people are saying
10394000	10396000	Because people forget
10396000	10398000	For every console that Nintendo sells
10398000	10400000	They make a profit
10400000	10402000	Compared to other manufacturers
10402000	10404000	In Microsoft, they take a loss
10404000	10406000	So whether people think that Wii U
10406000	10408000	Is an abysmal failure
10408000	10410000	Nintendo is still laughing all the way to the bank
10410000	10412000	I thought that wasn't true anymore after they did the $50 price cut
10412000	10414000	I could be wrong
10414000	10416000	Well, maybe after the initial
10416000	10418000	$50 price cut
10418000	10420000	But then as parts get a little bit cheaper
10420000	10422000	I mean, in the beginning they were losing money
10422000	10424000	Off the 3DS when they did the initial price cut
10424000	10426000	But now
10426000	10428000	They're making profits off the 3DS
10428000	10430000	Because
10431000	10433000	Parts become cheaper, make your money back
10433000	10435000	Alright, I'm with you
10435000	10437000	So I am saying
10437000	10439000	When Nintendo gets their next console out
10439000	10441000	It's gotta have that hardware power
10441000	10443000	Of what's out there now
10443000	10445000	They can't be like
10445000	10447000	Skimming on the cheap and be like
10447000	10449000	Well, we'll be the budget console
10449000	10451000	For everybody
10451000	10453000	Well, wait a second
10453000	10455000	If they match the current generation by the time the new one rolls around
10455000	10457000	What will that have bought them?
10457000	10459000	Well, what I mean is they need to
10459000	10461000	Not match, but make it to the next level
10461000	10463000	I mean, you see what I'm saying?
10463000	10465000	They have to add a little bit of hardware prowess
10465000	10467000	To make them step above everybody else
10469000	10471000	That's what I'm saying
10471000	10473000	Got it
10473000	10475000	Alright, fair enough
10475000	10477000	We've got to come in our chat room
10477000	10479000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
10479000	10481000	AkumaJP says, I'm so sick of this topic
10481000	10484000	Why do we keep debating the Nintendo stuff into the ground?
10484000	10486000	Even when people
10486000	10488000	Like, love to get
10488000	10490000	People out there that really get pleasure out of just
10490000	10492000	Kicking Nintendo when they're down, I think, sometimes
10492000	10494000	People like to see the giants fall
10494000	10496000	I guess
10496000	10498000	Very much
10498000	10500000	Well, why don't you tell us more about that porn collection
10502000	10504000	Well, there is a reason why I had to go get a
10504000	10506000	3TB hard drive
10508000	10510000	Any cons coming up that you're getting excited for?
10510000	10512000	Yes, I will be
10512000	10514000	Going to Katsukan next month
10514000	10516000	And I will be debuting
10516000	10518000	Dr. Luigi
10518000	10520000	Oh god, Katsukan, oh man
10520000	10522000	Man, it was years ago when I went to Katsukan
10522000	10524000	I had such a good time though
10524000	10526000	Yes, and somehow, mysteriously, the picture of you as the
10526000	10528000	Black Mage disappeared
10528000	10530000	So I have to go digging for it
10530000	10532000	Oh no
10532000	10534000	Well, it's probably for the best, let's be real
10534000	10536000	I've got to work on a cosplay for Dragon Con
10536000	10538000	Because Travis Donovan is fully expecting
10538000	10540000	That I'm going full on cosplay this year
10540000	10542000	I've got to figure that whole mess out
10542000	10544000	I don't know what I'm going to do
10544000	10546000	I'm going to lose a little weight first
10546000	10548000	It will determine if I'm going to do sexy cosplay or not
10548000	10550000	You need to do Joker
10550000	10552000	Joker? Oh, I was like
10552000	10554000	My mind went to Batman Joker
10554000	10556000	Oh, Joker from Mass Effect
10556000	10558000	Yeah, I guess that would be pretty mean
10558000	10560000	We can get you the SR2 hat
10560000	10562000	That might be something
10562000	10564000	Especially when Donovan and Jenna
10564000	10566000	Do the whole Miranda and Shepard thing
10566000	10568000	I guess the Joker would fit right in with that crowd
10568000	10570000	So, why not
10570000	10572000	Awesome
10572000	10574000	I said hi
10574000	10576000	Will do
10576000	10578000	Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG Network
10578000	10580000	Listen in, kids
10580000	10582000	It's what's good
10582000	10584000	For LG, you know
10584000	10586000	Alright, take care, buddy
10586000	10588000	Alright, take care
10588000	10590000	1877 Game OLR
10590000	10592000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
10592000	10594000	If you want to give us a call
10594000	10596000	And comment on whatever's been going on in the news
10596000	10598000	Bobby Blackwolf, I forgot, had sent me
10598000	10600000	Some messages earlier saying I should
10600000	10602000	And I thought this was really funny
10602000	10604000	He noticed that earlier in the show
10604000	10606000	Guitar Hero 3
10606000	10608000	Was trending on Twitter
10608000	10610000	Isn't that weird? Guitar Hero 3 is years old
10610000	10612000	Yeah, it's depressing
10612000	10614000	The reason why
10614000	10616000	Because Metallica just played
10616000	10618000	One at the Grammys
10618000	10620000	And all the little kids were going
10620000	10622000	Hey, this is from Guitar Hero 3
10624000	10626000	Even though
10626000	10628000	It's like one of the biggest
10628000	10630000	Facepalm right now
10630000	10632000	Is like of epic proportions
10632000	10634000	Oh no
10634000	10636000	You're talking about songs that like
10636000	10638000	Defined the
10638000	10640000	No
10640000	10642000	No, no
10642000	10644000	It's sad
10644000	10646000	But it's hilarious at the same time
10646000	10648000	Do I need to get the
10648000	10650000	I mean, at the same time, that's not a surprise
10650000	10652000	And
10652000	10654000	It's great that they're saying
10654000	10656000	Guitar Hero 3 specifically
10656000	10658000	I don't know if it was on that, but
10658000	10660000	I'm surprised you could unstick your hand
10660000	10662000	From your face with that
10662000	10664000	Alright, I gotta go to the phones
10664000	10666000	Quickly, quickly
10666000	10668000	Hold on, hold on
10668000	10670000	Just one thing
10670000	10672000	You be quiet, I hung up
10672000	10674000	One thing that has to be said
10674000	10676000	Is that
10676000	10678000	If anyone ever doubts that
10678000	10680000	Metal music isn't
10680000	10682000	Music music
10682000	10684000	You need to listen to that whole fucking Metallica album
10684000	10686000	It's black album, isn't it?
10686000	10688000	No, I don't
10688000	10690000	Was one all black? Oh, Ride the Lightning
10690000	10692000	Alright, Zaku's calling back
10692000	10694000	Are we ready for Zaku this time?
10694000	10696000	Yes, it's all working
10696000	10698000	Alright, here we go
10698000	10700000	Hi Zaku
10700000	10702000	How's it going?
10702000	10704000	Because I'm too lazy to turn on my PC at night
10704000	10706000	That's fine, what's up buddy?
10706000	10708000	Ah, nothing much
10708000	10710000	Just kicking back
10710000	10712000	What is that you're playing over there?
10712000	10714000	Is that Forza?
10714000	10716000	No, Gran Turismo
10716000	10718000	Oh, Gran Turismo, okay
10718000	10720000	What's up?
10720000	10722000	Ah, nothing much
10722000	10724000	Just, you know, as I said
10724000	10726000	Still playing, getting through my PS3 as usual
10726000	10728000	But, other than that
10728000	10730000	I managed to pick myself up a
10730000	10732000	Pretty spiffy racing wheel that I'm gonna pick up tomorrow
10732000	10734000	From eBay
10734000	10736000	Yeah
10736000	10738000	So, figured I may as well get used to
10738000	10740000	Like, the last throws of playing
10740000	10742000	On a controller
10742000	10744000	But other than that, it's like
10744000	10746000	I'm still kind of like
10746000	10748000	Still kind of shocked
10748000	10750000	That the patent office
10750000	10752000	Would go so far as to give
10752000	10754000	A single company the trademark
10754000	10756000	For an entire word
10756000	10758000	That's like giving Crayola the patent
10758000	10760000	Or the trademark for the color blue
10760000	10762000	I mean, for King
10762000	10764000	To get that much, wield that much power
10764000	10766000	You know there's gonna be other people
10766000	10768000	Obviously Hasbro
10768000	10770000	Or anyone who's already
10770000	10772000	Had products with the word candy on it
10772000	10774000	In the past and want to target mobile
10774000	10776000	Or pretty much
10776000	10778000	They're pretty much in the crosshairs
10778000	10780000	Because once they do, they'll get the C&D's immediately
10780000	10782000	Well, I would actually like to see
10782000	10784000	I think Hasbro would fight that
10784000	10786000	And I would actually kind of like to see that happen
10786000	10788000	I think a lot of us would be
10788000	10790000	Rooting for that kind of throwdown to happen
10790000	10792000	Well, Dark Soccer had joked
10792000	10794000	During Bobby Black Wolf's show earlier
10794000	10796000	That Disney should do a game based on King Candy
10796000	10798000	I like your macross shirt by the way
10798000	10800000	From Wreck it Ralph
10800000	10802000	Doing a King Candy game
10802000	10804000	And I was like, yes, Disney should do that
10804000	10806000	Because Disney's legal team
10806000	10808000	Is a force to be reckoned with
10808000	10810000	And that would be a fun little court case
10810000	10812000	To watch go down
10812000	10814000	But who's hand
10814000	10816000	King ended up greasing
10816000	10818000	In the patent office?
10818000	10820000	There has to have been some sort of
10820000	10822000	Backroom deal
10822000	10824000	Of sorts
10824000	10826000	Definitely a little bit of hand skin ball
10826000	10828000	Going on over there at the patent office
10828000	10830000	Thanks Ralph
10830000	10832000	There's no way
10832000	10834000	You would be able to get
10834000	10836000	The trademark for a single word
10836000	10838000	That's so common in
10838000	10840000	Universal
10840000	10842000	Well
10842000	10844000	Even English
10844000	10846000	There's no way you would have done that
10846000	10848000	Without having to grease someone's palm over there
10848000	10850000	Well, Bethesda
10850000	10852000	Bethesda trademarked the word
10852000	10854000	There went my dreams
10854000	10856000	Of making the boob scrolls
10856000	10858000	But still it's like
10858000	10860000	Candy
10860000	10862000	Which is something that it's really
10862000	10864000	Really delicious honestly
10864000	10866000	Not just delicious
10866000	10868000	It's a noun
10868000	10870000	Of something that's already common
10870000	10872000	How could you
10872000	10874000	Trademark something
10874000	10876000	That is so ubiquitous
10876000	10878000	That even candy makers
10878000	10880000	Are in danger because if they try
10880000	10882000	To promote their
10882000	10884000	They try to create a promotional app
10884000	10886000	The technical answer
10886000	10888000	The literal reason why that's allowed
10888000	10890000	Is that they don't have carte blanche
10890000	10892000	On anything that has the word candy
10892000	10894000	They have carte blanche on video games
10894000	10896000	And interactive media
10896000	10898000	That uses the word candy or saga
10898000	10900000	Well there goes
10900000	10902000	Any hopes for Hershey's
10902000	10904000	Doing promotional games on mobile
10904000	10906000	I'm gonna ask the real tough
10906000	10908000	Questions here at Orange Lounge Radio
10908000	10910000	How did they not
10910000	10912000	Get the trademark on the word crush
10912000	10914000	Why are we not hearing about the word crush
10914000	10916000	Because that makes me think if that's the unsaid thing
10916000	10918000	Because you know they tried it
10918000	10920000	So why are we not hearing about them getting the trademark
10920000	10922000	On the word crush
10922000	10924000	I really hope it's because of grape crush
10924000	10926000	I really hope
10926000	10928000	The people that made crush soda were like nope
10928000	10930000	More of an orange person myself
10930000	10932000	But I digress
10932000	10934000	Isn't crush already
10934000	10936000	Not already a trademark
10937000	10939000	So it kind of conflicts
10939000	10941000	So I think they would have to give them candy
10941000	10943000	Because no one else has trademarked
10943000	10945000	Or let alone used it as a brand
10945000	10947000	As a single word
10947000	10949000	I mean it's getting to that point
10949000	10951000	It's almost bizarre
10951000	10953000	That they gave them
10953000	10955000	Something like that
10955000	10957000	That could easily be invalidated
10957000	10959000	As long as
10959000	10961000	They try to go after the
10961000	10963000	Wrong entity
10963000	10965000	Like Disney
10966000	10968000	But it goes to show that
10968000	10970000	Our patent system
10970000	10972000	Is completely broken
10972000	10974000	It's where you can
10974000	10976000	I mean the point is that
10976000	10978000	If you have software patents
10978000	10980000	And then you have trolls going after you
10980000	10982000	For having certain features that are
10982000	10984000	Obiguous to all other
10984000	10986000	Mobile phone platforms
10986000	10988000	Like barcode scanning
10988000	10990000	Or even sending
10990000	10992000	Communications like network calls
10992000	10994000	Someone must have
10994000	10996000	You know that process
10996000	10998000	Even sending secure calls
10998000	11000000	Zaku
11000000	11002000	Since I'm asking the tough questions here tonight
11002000	11004000	How do we fix it?
11004000	11006000	We all sit here and say it's broken
11006000	11008000	How do we fix it?
11008000	11010000	Well I mean this is something that Congress would have to
11010000	11012000	Enact laws for
11012000	11014000	But it's not
11014000	11016000	The same one that got us in
11016000	11018000	Is going to get us right back out
11018000	11020000	Out of the frying pan
11020000	11022000	And into the fryer
11022000	11024000	It's gotten paid for by
11024000	11026000	Special interests
11026000	11028000	So there will be people, there will be certain entities
11028000	11030000	Certain software companies that wouldn't want
11030000	11032000	The status quo to change
11032000	11034000	It would benefit from having
11034000	11036000	To patent software
11036000	11038000	Ideas
11038000	11040000	Instead of the whole
11040000	11042000	Instead of actually building something
11042000	11044000	Or creating a single idea
11044000	11046000	That can be patented as opposed to actually
11046000	11048000	Creating the code
11048000	11050000	Alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show
11050000	11052000	It is broken
11052000	11054000	And I'm gonna complain some more
11054000	11056000	Take care buddy
11056000	11058000	Have fun with your steering wheel
11058000	11060000	All new way to play
11060000	11062000	Take care buddy
11062000	11064000	I think that it's gonna do it for calls tonight
11064000	11066000	Cause we're well past 9 o'clock
11066000	11068000	Here and we only gotta work tomorrow
11068000	11070000	So we're gonna
11070000	11072000	Quickly I think I saw a tweet come in here
11072000	11074000	At the last moment
11074000	11076000	It was a story I wanted to address
11076000	11078000	And I should have
11078000	11080000	Mentioned it earlier in the show but I didn't
11080000	11082000	Cause you know
11082000	11084000	I was too busy ranting about something
11084000	11086000	When I said I prefer Orange Crush
11086000	11088000	I was actually talking about the R.A.M. song
11088000	11090000	Playing at drums on Rock Band
11090000	11092000	Also
11092000	11094000	I was thinking about
11094000	11096000	Pineapple Crush was really
11096000	11098000	Actually the superior brand of Crush
11098000	11100000	Pineapple Crush was amazing
11100000	11102000	We do have a couple quick tweets here
11102000	11104000	Let me get to it
11104000	11106000	Tigerclaw tweeting us saying
11107000	11109000	So we brought them up earlier in the show
11109000	11111000	Because they're gonna have that online
11111000	11113000	The subscription pass that works for all their game
11113000	11115000	But it's gonna come at the cost
11115000	11117000	Of Free Realms
11117000	11118000	Closing down
11118000	11120000	That game was pretty shitty anyway
11120000	11122000	It's on the PS3, it's awful
11122000	11124000	Star Wars Clone Wars Adventures
11124000	11126000	Vanguard Saga of Heroes
11126000	11128000	And Wizardry Online
11128000	11130000	All shutting down
11130000	11132000	Most of them on March 31st
11132000	11134000	But Wizardry will be last to close
11134000	11136000	On July 31st
11136000	11138000	Rest in peace
11138000	11140000	SSG100Matt says
11150000	11152000	What?
11152000	11154000	Oh yeah there was something about this
11154000	11156000	They conspired to sell
11156000	11158000	Counterfeit game packs for the UltraCade
11158000	11160000	Unit
11160000	11162000	It also involved global VR
11162000	11164000	And MAME developers
11164000	11166000	He reached a plea deal with the state of California
11166000	11168000	And the sentencing has happened
11168000	11170000	41 months in prison
11170000	11172000	How about that
11172000	11174000	I don't even remember why we were so mad at him
11174000	11176000	In the first place
11176000	11178000	Because they were replacing our legit old machines
11182000	11184000	And they were making people pay for MAME
11184000	11186000	I just want to give a shout out though
11186000	11188000	Because we had some nice people pimping our stuff tonight
11188000	11190000	So I just want to give a nice shout out
11190000	11192000	To some people that were pimping our stuff tonight
11192000	11194000	Pixel Pacas
11194000	11196000	Said not interested in watching the Grammys
11196000	11198000	Listen to the video game podcast OLR
11198000	11200000	Thank you Pixel Pacas
11200000	11202000	That was quite kind
11202000	11204000	It was very kind, so did Koopa Club
11204000	11206000	Said almost the same thing, forget the Grammys and listen to
11206000	11208000	OLR Live instead, though if the Grammys
11208000	11210000	Were like best grandma awards
11210000	11212000	Then we totally watch it
11212000	11214000	You know what though, I do have to say
11214000	11216000	And thank you to Tumblr for keeping me in the loop
11216000	11218000	Daft Punk
11218000	11220000	Did they win stuff?
11220000	11222000	Best Album
11222000	11224000	Oh did they win Best Album?
11224000	11226000	Good for them
11226000	11228000	I know they were nominated
11228000	11230000	They won 4 Grammys and
11230000	11232000	Paul McCartney won a couple
11232000	11234000	Actually
11234000	11236000	There was an amazing tweet earlier
11236000	11238000	That can sum up my thoughts on Macklemore
11238000	11240000	Perfectly
11240000	11242000	This is my personal opinion
11242000	11244000	What was the retweet?
11244000	11246000	I had retweeted a user named Randall Chris
11246000	11248000	Macklemore dropping
11248000	11250000	The actual queer musician from
11250000	11252000	Same Love so Madonna can
11252000	11254000	Sing the hook instead is so comically
11254000	11256000	Appropriate
11256000	11258000	That sums up my thoughts exactly
11258000	11260000	Thank you
11260000	11262000	Anyhow
11262000	11264000	That's gonna do it for

11276000	11278000	Earlier in the email segment about we are an independent podcast
11278000	11280000	We do have to really work hard for the
11280000	11282000	Exposure we do get, word of mouth is
11282000	11284000	So valuable, please
11284000	11286000	Consider leaving us a nice review in

11304000	11306000	Really appreciate it, thank you for stepping up into
11306000	11308000	A full blown host role tonight
11308000	11310000	I did reasonably well
11310000	11312000	Other than completely resetting
11312000	11314000	My brain in part B and thinking
11314000	11316000	Oh shit, I was supposed to read these articles
11316000	11318000	Something's happened
11318000	11320000	To be fair, I called you Loki
11320000	11322000	At one point
11322000	11324000	That reset happened
11324000	11326000	Immediately after you called me Loki
11326000	11328000	It happens to the best of us
11328000	11330000	It all works out
11330000	11332000	Stay healthy folks
11332000	11334000	Our one listener
11334000	11336000	Stay healthy, keep it together
11336000	11338000	Drink your orange juice
11338000	11340000	Or whatever
11340000	11342000	That is what I was doing all day yesterday and today
11342000	11344000	My final thought tonight is
11344000	11346000	I'm gonna have to shave this beard in a couple weeks
11346000	11348000	And it's gonna be sad
11348000	11350000	You need to shave your beard
11350000	11352000	You just need to trim buddy
11352000	11354000	I need to shave the beard
11354000	11356000	That's the problem
11356000	11358000	You need to shave something fierce
11358000	11360000	Alright, and last but not least
11360000	11362000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
11362000	11364000	It's winter, I ain't gotta shave shit
