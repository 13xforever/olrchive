00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Happy 2014 to everyone. That sound you heard was contracts sending consumers weeping over their favorite games being delisted from various services. Could this be a sign of strained relationships to come in 2014? All this and more on tonight's episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000

00:31.000 --> 00:45.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 534 for this January the 5th of 2014.

00:46.000 --> 01:04.000
My name is Rob Roberts here to talk with you about what's going on in video gaming with all of you guys participating be it live at the Voice of Geeks Network, live.vognetwork.com or via the podcast feed be it on iTunes podcast or Stitcher or TuneIn or YouTube or however you choose to listen to the show.

01:04.000 --> 01:12.000
My name is Rob Roberts which I believe I already said but I have not said her name. She is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
And since you deserve to have your name said twice too, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Double fuck.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
How does one, no let's not go there. Are you cursing out your iPad?

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
Yeah because of my auto correct that I still leave on because fuck it.

01:28.000 --> 01:37.000
I've had a rather off day myself because I normally do my big Tumblr post everyday and I didn't until I got here.

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm having a super off day today like and I'll tell you in a minute after I've introduced any but everybody but just like oh my gosh.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
I went to the gym today though.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Yeah.

01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Which also set off my day because I normally go on Monday but I went today since I've got plans tomorrow because oh my god I'm employed. I only have two weeks of freedom.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Congrats.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Thank you.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
And now we're just praying that you're not going to have to work Sundays because that's going to cause a real interesting monkey wrench for.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
I'm gonna, it's one night I think I can, I'm pretty sure I can get that off.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Good.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
I can get that night off with my eyes closed.

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
Vog is going to get real interesting if she doesn't get Sunday nights off but we're all crossing our fingers.

02:13.000 --> 02:22.000
Anyway so yeah it's just been and I left the house because of sports ball. There's nothing that motivates me to leave the house and go to the gym like sports ball.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Now here's what.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
I got back and it was still on.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah sports ball goes on for a very long time.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
But how crazy is the gym right now because you have everybody that's like oh my new year's resolution is to go to the gym every day.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
Now I imagine there's a good percentage of already puttered out after two days or it's like fuck this and fuck that.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
But you, you went today. How was it today?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
It was really dead.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
It was super dead.

02:45.000 --> 02:50.000
Well I went at 1230 and I stayed until close to two.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
No I left the house more around one and my workout only takes about an hour.

02:55.000 --> 03:04.000
So I had no trouble. There were a few new faces but I think that the biggest crowds are the ones that come after work.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
After work yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
And so until I know what my schedule is I'm keeping on my regular you know.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
I'm usually either a Monday Wednesday or Monday Thursday.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Since it is a video game show have you been working in any of the exergaming stuff in your routine yet?

03:18.000 --> 03:30.000
No and I'm meant to play DDR. I need to actually take down my, the other dance pads because I told you I've got a whole bunch of those thick ones.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
What were the good ones called?

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
The metal pads.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Not the metal ones.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Oh the red octane or whatever?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I bought like.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
I was thinking informer. That was a Canadian rapper song.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
That was snow.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
But that was a song, informer right?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Informer.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Ignition.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Ignition thank you.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
There he is. Techmaster Loki here to save the day via Skype. You were just dying over there wanting to scream it out huh Loki?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I was gonna wait.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Well you didn't. That's fine. How you doing Loki?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
That's why I said I was going to.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
How are you doing Techmaster Loki?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
I'm doing okay.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Good good.

04:08.000 --> 04:26.000
And for those that missed the memo a couple weeks ago because I know we've had some folks that have been out of the habit of listening because of the holidays and everything. Loki is joining us via Skype for about a month or so. He is on baby watch because Mrs. Loki is due before the 20th so that could literally be any day now.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Yeah any day now.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Yep. So Loki is there just in case he has to.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And I bet she wishes it was five days ago.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Get the call. Yeah.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
She's hoping by next Friday I think.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Okay. Is there like is there a particular reason is there like you know a sale on Monday or something or I'm kidding.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm kidding.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
No one knows.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
I think it's mainly just so that you know she can get more time off I guess because then you know it'd be the weekend and that kind of thing.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
See see there's a trick to it.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
This this country is so screwed up because in other countries like there's paternal leave.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
So we get like the least amount of maternity leave of practically anywhere in the world.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
So stupid.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
But thank you capitalism.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Well Loki don't expect to get paternity leave from this program because you heard what Dark Soccer said.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
No I'm kidding.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
You take all the time you need but I know you you'll be you'll be back here ASAP because you'll be like I need a break.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah. Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
All right.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Sounds good.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
Also joining us here in studio say hello to the one and only voice of the show VX Jason X V X Y Z element of me.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
That's me.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
How are you doing.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
I'm doing pretty all right.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
How long do we get your deep baritone voice for here at our studio.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
As long as you want me.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Well not seriously.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
I was going back to Colorado at some point.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Yeah.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
I have duct tape.

05:45.000 --> 05:50.000
Well the running inside joke between me and Seattle has been that I've just been chill and just sleeping underneath the table.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
So you know.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Well that works.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Arrangements could be made.

05:53.000 --> 06:03.000
No I have my work obligations are wrapping up at the end of this month so we'll probably be driving for the first show of February.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
OK.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I imagine.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
There you go.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Current plan anyways.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
I feel like we have to have like a goodbye.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Goodbye show.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Bye Jason for now.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
In parentheses for now.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
That all that that's sounding like it'll basically be happening.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
So you know we'll see.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
All right.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.000
Well and for those that don't know Jason does commute like 90 minutes just to be here on the show Sunday night.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
So he does a lot.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
He doesn't do that.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
He does the whole YouTube thing.

06:25.000 --> 06:38.000
So I mean my God over the years Jason really got us set up with the Web site and everything like I know deep man did a lot of the coding in the setup but you did all the like making sure we have a place to host him and all of that and helping him out.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You guys have been working on that.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
And although we are in due need for an update maybe that's that's a new year's resolution a little bit this year.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
But yeah you've just done so much for the show and I don't think people realize because you're not always here.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
Talking but the last few months we've been able to get you here talking.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
That's good.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
Now at least at least I'll have a 13 seconds of speech in shows continuing for the foreseeable future.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
There you go.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Great.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Well plus 30 seconds for the outro.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
So I will have I will have my standing minute on this show for for as long as I would as long as I can continue to do so.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Rama said that you're our answer to Barry White.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
So I'm wondering how many children are going to be conceived to your voice.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
I will take that as an incredibly flattering compliment and picking up on Twitter to let me know.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And that comment coming from live.vognetwork.com.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
Maybe I should have Jason say that.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Live.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Yeah.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
When I can say it straight.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
So hot.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
We do tape live Sunday nights 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern and you can join the festivities at live.vognetwork.com.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Well I'm fired.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
I see that was the trick the whole time.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
You guys brought Jason here because you want to replace me.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
I see how it is.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
You're looking at me because Loki I can't look at him.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
He's on Skype.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
You could be.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
You told me to turn off the camera.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
That's true.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
That's true.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
I was worried about bandwidth and everything.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
All right.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Anyhow.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Welcome.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Welcome back Jason.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
And Jason's also helped helping me stay grounded tonight because OK.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
So we're talking about this a little bit before the show that like I'm just a total like space cadet today.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.000
And if you were to ask Alan my partner he would say that I'm already like the most forgetful guy anywhere.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
And it's totally true.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
But like today was just like especially bad like OK.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
So we're sitting there for those that have never participated with the show live.

08:26.000 --> 08:33.000
We always do a quick call at the end of Bobby Black Wolf show because he always is of course the show life before us here at Vogue Network.

08:33.000 --> 08:42.000
And you know so after that calls done we usually sitting here in studio for about seven minutes while Bobby wraps things up does a transition song so we can take over the feed and do our thing.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
So we're just kind of sitting here in studio la la la la la la.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
And Jason kind of pipes him and goes Hey Rob are you are you going to call Loki.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm like shit.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
So I like less than two minutes.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
Yeah.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
I get started.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Our song was already running.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Yeah.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And it's like we're missing the fourth.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Exactly.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Is he out tonight.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I forgot to fight.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I forgot to ask.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
No.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
And then.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
And then after that he says is there anything else you need me to remind you to do.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And I just look at him and I go.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
How do I put on pants.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
And then the most hilarious part of all while the little the little thing and the podcast listeners don't usually hear this.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
So I'm going to play this just for the podcast listeners.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Here's something for the live experience.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
You're listening to the Vogue Network.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Up next the show where every gamer has a voice.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio Live.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Right.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
So that's playing and while that is playing literally the opening theme song comes right after that song right while that song is playing.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
I said oh shit I don't have my voice recording program up.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
So I'm like launching quickly Adobe.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
So yes Jason did need to remind me to do something else tonight.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
It was a very good first five minutes of the show.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Meanwhile I was sitting here reading the chat room in Tumblr.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yes.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I don't.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Well that's what you do every week.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Hey.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
All right.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
I participate.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Rageinator says.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Mostly.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
I know why Sky's forgetful.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Dude it's called Alzheimer's.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
At 35.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Ouch.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Like I know 35 is old to some people but let me tell you a couple things.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
A.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
It's not.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
B.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Start eating your blueberries.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
It's really not.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Eating more blueberries.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I could eat blueberries.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
C.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Get off my lawn.

10:21.000 --> 10:32.000
Actually I will say this when I was studying nutrition one of the research papers that I wrote was about how blueberries are good for improving memory capacity and preventing memory loss.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
So just saying.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Excellent.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
And I promise we'll get to games after this.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Act Def says Jason the assistant.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
You know in some ways it's kind of true.

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
Like I would say he's the intern but he's you know obviously because we haven't had Drew in forever so he's basically fired.

10:49.000 --> 10:57.000
So I could say Jason is kind of the intern or the assistant but the assistant is a good term because the assistant really does all the work and then everybody else takes credit for it.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
So I think this is a very fitting title for Jason.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Because he's the administrator.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
He is.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
He could ruin us real good if you wanted to.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I could ruin us too.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
I have the power that I will hopefully never exercise.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Bring it down.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Bring it down.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
What?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
I was going to say though that I owe Drew because Drew helped me get my job.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Yes.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
So thank you.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
So Drew is still working with us.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Kind of.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Keeping me in money.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Just don't let him knock over any tables at your work.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
All right.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Thankfully they're rooted to the ground.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Good.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
OK.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
So I have a couple of bonus games.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
I have a couple of things I want to talk about at the top of the show.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Two mini kickoff topics tonight.

11:37.000 --> 11:44.000
And one of them tying into we brought up Bobby a minute ago and on his show tonight they were having what I was calling a wank fest.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
And I mean that in the most loving way.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
But not too much love.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
About the Oculus Rift.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
They were talking about the Oculus Rift a lot and you know I've tried the Rift.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
I played that at Dragon Con.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
I thought it was awesome.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
I thought it was good in like 15 minute chunks because I started to get a little.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm old remember.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
So yeah I liked it in small doses or whatever.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
But that got us to a conversation here in studio where we were talking about peripherals.

12:09.000 --> 12:18.000
And Jason said you brought up a game that you were talking about the Rift or something and we were talking about how this game was awesome in arcades.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
What game were we talking about?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Prop Cycle.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
Prop Cycle.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Who remembers Prop Cycle in the arcade?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Hands in the air.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
I worked an Amco arcade when it was new.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
For the listeners that may not know Prop Cycle, Dark Soccer, what is Prop Cycle?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It's something annoying.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
It's a giant exercise bike hooked up to a huge monitor.

12:38.000 --> 12:48.000
And basically you pedal it and steer around trying to pop balloons and do tricks and go through holes and try not to burn your legs off.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
And some people hook them up to Addams Family pinball tables.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Oh yeah that's true. I've heard about that.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
The reason why I bring that up is because arcades have sort of been sunsetting a little bit.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
As we know them anyway.

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
Arcades are more turning into Reno for little kids.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
And I say Reno because it's a little more busted than Vegas.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
So these arcades are turning into busted little places for kids to gamble their money away and get tickets.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Does that mean they're ReNets?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
They're little ReNets.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
That's what they are.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
The biggest little quarter munchers in the world.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
But with this, obviously you have all these ticket spitting games and so forth.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.000
But we're starting to see these games that were very unique experiences in the arcade slowly go away.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
Or when they do have arcade games, it's all I see.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
It's either driving games for an excellent example like Mario Kart where you actually sit in the freaking cabinet.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
But I'm thinking back and I'm going like, you know what?

13:47.000 --> 13:53.000
No child is ever going to get to experience, unless they go to a retro gaming event or a convention center.

13:53.000 --> 14:01.000
No child is ever going to get to experience playing Star Wars in one of those freaking cabinets that move to the left and right as you sat in it.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Now there I go being old again.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
But seriously, for those that haven't experienced it, you poor bastards.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
You're really missing out.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
Like being old rules for no other reason than getting to play the Star Wars motion cabinet.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
There were more. Remember the Space Harrier cabs in the After Burner?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
The After Burner would go completely upside down, wouldn't it?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Uh, no I don't think so.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Almost.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
And then Star Blade.

14:22.000 --> 14:27.000
Which we had a deluxe Star Blade at the Dollar Theater and the guy would just be like, oh it's you.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Infinite credits.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
So, Mike, Jason go ahead.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I was going to say there are different classes of cabinets of course.

14:34.000 --> 14:41.000
There's just the standard stand up, there's sit down and then there's, I don't think I've ever been in a moving Star Wars cab before.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
But I've definitely been in a sit down, non-motion version.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
But I remember seeing that After Burner cabinet.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
There's Daytona USA for example.

14:51.000 --> 15:03.000
You get a little, the range of machines is anywhere from a bucket seat to a damn near full sized car that you get into and jolt around as you run into things and people run into you.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
And that still happens.

15:07.000 --> 15:21.000
Gameworks in Arizona has really, really nice Initial D 5 machines when I was there and Time Crisis keeps getting bigger and then smaller to save money and then bigger when the new game comes out.

15:21.000 --> 15:31.000
I think I agree that the flashy, huge level of it is dying down in terms of how much you'll see it.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Just in general, you go in an arcade you've never been before.

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
And just to be clear, that is my question in all of this, so if you guys over at the chat room want to answer this, live.vognetwork.com.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Is the day of the giant pompous what the fuck peripheral done?

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
I think the day of innovation in the arcade is done.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
Heck no it's not done. That's the whole reason they have certain games in the arcade.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
For example, Tetris with a giant fucking controller.

16:00.000 --> 16:08.000
That is pretty cool. Like even me, again I'm 35 and when I saw that big Tetris machine in the arcade I was like, ooh shiny!

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
And I ran over to it and fed it all my money to play with that giant joystick because it was, you know, kind of funny.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
That is freaking annoying.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
It is a little bit. But it's a ticket spitter at the end of the day. You get tickets depending on how well you do.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
As is Super Monkey Ball, as is, well, Fruit Ninja isn't.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
There's Doodle Jump.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, Doodle Jump, Infinity Blade, Fruit Ninja, Rerave pretty soon if not already in certain arcades, yeah.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com just to catch up on some comments from the live participants.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
Tigerclaw says, which Star Wars? The one from Atari in the 80s or the Star Wars trilogy arcade?

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
Now that you mention it, they were both pretty cool because the trilogy one had that giant lightsaber battle with Darth Vader, right?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
But I was talking about the old school 80s ones.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
The vector.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, the vector games.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
Let's see, and some folks talking about the Power Glove because it's like peripherals on a smaller scale.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Not all of them work.

17:01.000 --> 17:08.000
Think about it, this show exists because of one of those pompous peripherals in the arcade that got people moving, right?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Dance Dance Revolution, that's how Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki all met.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
And met you too, Jason. It was all through DDR.

17:14.000 --> 17:23.000
I still remember the day that we actually really, really hung out was the day that we took the trip to Milpitas.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And played Para Para.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Which was also Pompa's peripheral.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
Orange Wright says, didn't F-Zero's AX cabinet move too? Yes it did, that's one of my all-time favorites.

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
Let's see, also, SJ100Matt talking about a big convention from this weekend that I know a lot of my friends back east went to.

17:39.000 --> 17:46.000
SJ100Matt says, I went to MAGFest this weekend and there were a ton of people who brought their kids to the show and had them play a bunch of the classic games there.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
For example, I saw a dad play classic Oregon Trail on an old Apple II with his six to nine year old kid.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I later saw that same family playing classic Gauntlet together.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That happens at an Atari party though.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Well there's little things like that everywhere.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And Penny Arcade Expo, that's one of my favorite places, is the classic game room.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Yeah.

18:02.000 --> 18:12.000
I was gonna make the point that playing it after the fact is not as strong as when it is the culture of what you're doing when you're growing up.

18:12.000 --> 18:19.000
But then again, I have missed a ton of games and gone back to play them to really understand what was going on.

18:20.000 --> 18:33.000
Not to mention, whenever I talk to friends that have been computer geeks their whole life, they'll talk about their VX Spectrum and their Trash80 and their Apple IIe, Apple IIg, Commodore 64 and the whole lot.

18:33.000 --> 18:40.000
I don't even remember what my computer was, my first computer, but it was an IBM PC running DOS.

18:40.000 --> 18:49.000
I have quite literally never owned a computer that was not a classic Macintosh or an IBM PC DOS slash Windows.

18:49.000 --> 19:00.000
I knew a friend with a Commodore 64 and I took in a fair amount of knowledge and got used to the sound and the feel and how you actually use that machine.

19:00.000 --> 19:09.000
But all of these other systems, I never owned a console before on SNES, but I still know a pretty damn good amount of games from back then.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Reasonably so.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
So will six year old kids today not understand an Apple IIe?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Of course they will.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
How they adapt it depends on how they want to play it.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
Let me steer us back on path a little bit because we're veering from the original topic here with good reason.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
The six year old certainly can still experience the Apple IIe and all that.

19:33.000 --> 19:39.000
We had a story last week about how Archive.org is bringing back old games and we all know what emulators are and all that.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Even so, those old machines are going to exist and so forth.

19:42.000 --> 19:48.000
Steering us back to where we were, that experience of sitting in a moving Star Wars cabinet while playing Star Wars.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.000
There might be a couple of those machines still in existence, but it's not something a lot of people are ever going to get to play.

19:54.000 --> 20:03.000
I do know of one afterburner that was in working condition that was at Scandia.

20:03.000 --> 20:11.000
I don't know if it's still there, but it was there a year and a half ago, which was the last time I went.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
It's not every arcade. You're talking about one arcade happens to have this machine.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
It's not nearly as prolific as it once was.

20:19.000 --> 20:28.000
Now, Loki, let me go back to you a minute because you were saying that yes, we still have the pompous peripherals, but they too have shifted to ticket spinning.

20:28.000 --> 20:37.000
Well, yeah, some of them. There's a lot of games, especially I think in arcades now, that's all you see is the big flashy games.

20:37.000 --> 20:45.000
It's either going to be a driving cabinet for a game or it's going to be a game with some elaborate weapon attached to it.

20:45.000 --> 20:56.000
Or a Dance Dance Revolution machine. It's got to be something flashy to get your attention because you're not going to play just a regular game in the arcade.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
And little kids love flashing lights. Boy, do they ever.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Oh yeah.

21:03.000 --> 21:15.000
So I don't know. For me, I kind of see it transitioning. I do see a lot of the ticket spitter, but it really bums me out to think like when I talk about Prop Cycle, there's going to be a lot of people that just don't know what that really is.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Or the snowboarding games, the skateboarding games, Alpine Racer.

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
Yeah, those games are fun. Or even like the old skeet shooting games where you had the giant gun. No arcade is going to have a gun in it like that anymore.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Unless it's the Cabela's hunting redneck game.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Or it's the thing you put 50 cents in at Disneyland.

21:32.000 --> 21:44.000
I don't know. Some people make really bad decisions when it comes to their arcade stuff. Remember, Scandia in Sacramento here, they replaced all their skee-ball machines with a giant fucking shooting gallery thing.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
It's still there.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
Is it really?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
Yes it is.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
How funny.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
It's silly.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
It's strange.

21:51.000 --> 21:58.000
Alright. So anyhow, if you have some thoughts on this, you can always email us. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

21:58.000 --> 22:09.000
I want to move into our second kick-off topic. This one will be really quick. This is more of a follow-up of sorts, but I wanted to come clean on the show because I'm sure some folks are going to have something to say about this.

22:09.000 --> 22:21.000
But I did something over the weekend, and because of this something I did, there's going to be a PlayStation 4 showing up on my porch on Tuesday from Amazon Prime.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
So I finally took the plunge and bought a PlayStation 4.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
And I posted this on Twitter because I was, I don't know what I was talking about. Something else nice was like, oh yeah, I bought a PlayStation 4.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
One of the first replies I got was, of course you get sassy replies. Everybody likes to be sassy on Twitter.

22:38.000 --> 22:51.000
And one of the first replies I got was from Flaco Jones, who said, oh, Rob must have really wanted to play Don't Starve because the system is only as good as the games that are on it, and Don't Starve is coming out for PlayStation Plus in January.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
So, you know, going back to the OLR golden rule, that must be what finally broke Rob.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Clearly that's not the case since I bought that for you on Steam.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
Exactly. It's like, no, I already have that on Steam.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
But no, well, it's a couple things.

23:06.000 --> 23:17.000
A, when the PlayStation 4 first, first came out, I didn't quite have the finances that I did after, you know, now that we're past, you know, the holidays and everything like that.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
I had better finances, so I was able to finally get one.

23:20.000 --> 23:28.000
And also, I think what pushed me over the edge, obviously, I would like to play Resogun and some of this other stuff that's on the download.

23:28.000 --> 23:35.000
Like, you know, I'd like to at least try Contrast, and, you know, even though I already have Don't Starve on PC, I'll probably play it on console, too, because I tend to do that.

23:35.000 --> 23:43.000
But then also, I still want to really play Need for Speed, and a friend's able to get me a sweet deal on Assassin's Creed 4, so I'm like, all right, I'll try to play those games, too.

23:43.000 --> 23:52.000
And the other thing that's weighing on my mind, I'm going to get judged for this, but the Final Fantasy XIV beta test starts next month, so I have to be ready for it.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
So that's what finally pushed me over the edge and I got my PlayStation 4.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
Now I got to find one of those stinking cameras. The cameras are totally, like, nowhere.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Best Buy.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Really?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Order it on Amazon.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Nope, nope, it's not on Amazon.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Sold out through their partners for $120.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
GameStop Online.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Maybe. I'm going to have to dig around a little more to find it, but yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
So I got my PlayStation 4.

24:16.000 --> 24:21.000
So I will have more to say on that next Sunday when I actually get it all set.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
Steph is judging you.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
Is he?

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
I'm kind of judging you a little bit.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Why are you judging me?

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Because I judge you all the time.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm getting mine after I'm working.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
I can bring a controller and we can actually play two player games.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
I'm getting mine after I start working, so.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Yeah, there you go.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.000
And Loki will probably get one as well.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Oh, come on.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
Everybody in chat's like, slash me is judging, judging.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
Shut up.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
A dark Tetsuya, where's our eye of judgment?

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Shut up.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
Breakman in chat.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
I got drunk and bought songs on iTunes.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Sky gets drunk and buys a PlayStation 4.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
He's way more hardcore than me.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
I was surfically pober, ossifer.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
And all I did was buy a technologically fancy deadbolt.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
You know what the second sassy tweet I got?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
So I got Flaco Jones tweet was the first sassy tweet.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
You want to know what the second sassy tweet was?

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
One of us. One of us.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
No, I got plenty of that.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
No, the second, I think one of my friends who works for Sony actually tweeted that one.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
One of us.

25:23.000 --> 25:31.000
No, the second tweet I got was from the first mate Slidekick over at gamebuoy.org

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
who just replied with hashtag Team Xbox One.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
And I'm like, just fuck.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Don't start that shit with me.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Do not start that fucking war with me right now.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
I'll get an Xbox One as well, but probably over the holidays.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
I'm not buying them the same month. It's too expensive.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
But the holidays, I'll have enough saved up.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
We're probably not getting an Xbone if we do until much, much later.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
Yeah, I'm like, but then there'll be that new Halo or something.

25:58.000 --> 26:03.000
I don't know what games you guys are really into, but there'll be something that you're going to be like, I need it.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
Well, I think our opinion now is just we don't give a fuck.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Mm hmm.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
Sort of. I mean, we're sort of like, what are we doing?

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
How much stuff do we have on Steam?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
And we have new computers.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
Is that a weird place to be, though, because you guys were such collectors before?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
I mean, your vault and everything.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
I think that we've really turned our hearts back towards our classics.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
You know, and we love all the new stuff, but I mean, there's hardly anything now that comes out on the console

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
that we can't find either the same game or something as good on PC.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
And, you know, we just sunk 900 bucks into both of our computers,

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
which granted, it would have been a lot more if we need to do graphics cards,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
but our graphics cards are already great.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
And now I'm playing everything without a hiccup.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.000
I didn't even think about wanting to go back in the other room and, you know,

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
out of my warm computer room and into the cold, cold, cold living room.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
See, for me, it's kind of the opposite.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Like, I like to get away from the computer in the office once in a while

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
and, you know, sit on the couch and watch.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
Well, because I turned up the heat for all our friends coming over.

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
But, you know, I like to plop on the couch and enjoy a game once in a while, you know?

27:11.000 --> 27:18.000
Well, you know, I don't really like usually if I'm gonna leave the room,

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
like I'll take my DS in the front room and was that me or you?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
I think it was you.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
No, mine's on mute.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
But I sorry, it's iPhone time, everybody.

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
But I'll take my DS into the front room while Dan's doing something

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
or, you know, I like to sit in there and crochet,

27:39.000 --> 27:44.000
but I haven't really had too much of an urge to sit down and play anything on the console.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
The last controller I picked up was an Xbox controller to play Skullgirls.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
And I'm probably gonna be starting Rekt here, but other than that.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
All right, well, I will be enjoying my PlayStation 4

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
and I'll tell you more about it next week after I have it and all.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
But for now, let's talk about what we have been into this week in a segment we call

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
How Was Your Gaming Week? What types of video games have you been playing this week?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Dark Sakura.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Well, I played Skullgirls.

28:12.000 --> 28:17.000
I'm playing Final Fantasy XIV again, just trying to get on there a little bit more active.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
I'm gonna do that stupid quest that I hate.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
And I'm stuck in a dungeon.

28:25.000 --> 28:31.000
So I'm also playing Mass Effect 3 again because I had to fix Becky Shepard.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
That's usually... Becky will give me her Xbox save.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
I go in, you know, modify it and give it the right color hair

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
because the red, the default red hair in that game sucks.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So I fix it.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
And then Locopogo asked me who I maimed in Skullgirls.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
And I used, oh God, what's her name? Who's the Princess Lady?

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
Well, by saying Princess Lady, hopefully that closes the chat.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
She's cool.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
I've not played it, so...

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
And I'm about to, I actually tried to start Rekt here last night,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
but I didn't get very far.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
And, oh, what else was it?

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
Because I bought something and now for the life of me, I cannot remember.

29:17.000 --> 29:22.000
Parasoul, by the way. Parasoul is who I was trying to remember.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
And Dan, and Queen Semia just reminded me too.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
And Dan and I are supposed to be starting back on...

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
Borderlands 2 again.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
I don't know why I can't remember the names of stuff today.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Good, it's not just me.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Well, no, I told you I've been like this all day.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I've just been kind of, maybe more coffee. Rob coffee.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
You really want more coffee? I can make that happen.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
Actually, yes.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
No, you don't have to...

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Same one, please. It was good.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
Yes, ma'am.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Oh, Rob.

29:57.000 --> 30:03.000
And I actually, and then for New Year's actually, we did not do our rock band thing.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
We actually had Epic Cards Against Humanity.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.000
With the holiday cards thrown in that had the...

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
I got a whole set of cards that all of the responses on them were about semen.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
And those came up in three people's hands.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
I think everybody's New Year was Cards Against Humanity, just judging from Facebook.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
And that's what I did too.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
And Trivolo.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
Literally, yeah, it was Cards Against Humanity and alcohol.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
I think that's like how 90% of America reigned in the New Year.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Because that's exactly where I went, what happened.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
I made coffee vodka and chocolate vodka.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
We literally did nothing but that game for three hours.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
And then by the time it was like, you know, and it was like, oh shit, it's 1158.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Turn on the TV, put on the thing.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
And don't forget Animal Crossing.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
I crossed those animals, they are quite cross.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
And Zelda and Pokemon.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
I'm playing Pokemon X instead of dance playing Y.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
And I'm still playing some Zelda.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
Gender appropriate.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Well, but I wanted the...

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
The whole reason I'm playing X is not because of any of the legendaries or anything.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
I want the damn Houndoom.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I don't care, I want the evil dog.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
I want Houndoom.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
I don't know these Pokemans anymore.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
I need to play. I've been meaning to pick it up.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
It's a dark dog. He looks like an angry Doberman.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I love it.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Thank you for the coffee, Rob.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
I gotta go dress it up now, so it's Loki's turn.

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, brand.

31:36.000 --> 31:41.000
So yes, this week I played...

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
I don't know what I really played other than one game in particular.

31:45.000 --> 31:53.000
Okay, so as I had promised on the show before that I was like, okay, okay, let's set that Minecraft server up finally.

31:53.000 --> 32:01.000
So I went to check because our friend Gally had actually allowed us access to his server.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
But apparently his server's gone.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
So I was like, well crap, you know, how much is it gonna cost to actually run a server now?

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
And thankfully I found it for a very cheap amount.

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
It lessened my Netflix subscriptions.

32:15.000 --> 32:23.000
So I went ahead and bought a server or rented a server and imported our map back in there.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
So our Minecraft server's up and running again.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Yay, thank you, Loki.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
And that's what I was doing this week, was setting that up and messing around with that.

32:33.000 --> 32:40.000
And I even messed with some new plugins and stuff and had an NPC builder that I spawned last night.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
And he built Normandy for Dark Sakura.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
Yay!

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It's gigantic.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
It's fucking huge.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
You reposted all the information again right on the forums?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Yeah, it's on the forums.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
Everything's been updated, how to log back in there and stuff.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
And you just may need to redownload your client if you haven't played in a long time.

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
Because they have a new client now that updates within itself instead of having to redownload it each time.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
And so if you haven't gotten that new one yet, you have to redownload that.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
That's what I had to do.

33:13.000 --> 33:22.000
On top of that, my old copy's gone anyway because I upgraded my computer and didn't copy over my Minecraft because I knew I could redownload it.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
The new Minecraft has streaming integration too, which is pretty cool.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
That's pretty cool.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
The last thing I remembered is that someone put a huge N7 in front of my underground bunker.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
I think that's huge.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
Wait until you see what they fucking did to your house.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
I'm gonna move into the Normandy.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
I lit it up on the inside. Yes, you can very well move into the Normandy.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It's very possible.

33:46.000 --> 33:51.000
I don't follow Mass Effect that well, so it's the Normandy 2, I guess.

33:51.000 --> 33:58.000
Isn't there a map that they can access online that shows them where all the landmarks are?

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
Yes, there's also a link to that.

34:02.000 --> 34:10.000
I don't have the landmarks marked yet because everything's brand new again, but you can track people on the map.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
I do that a lot, even at work, and I'll talk to people while they're doing stuff.

34:15.000 --> 34:22.000
Now, it is a whitelist server, so it causes people some aggravation because you have to wait a bit to get access to it.

34:22.000 --> 34:29.000
But if you just go to our forums at vognetwork.com and let Loki know in the official Minecraft thread that you want access to the server, he'll grant it for you.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
You have to agree not to be a dick and ruin people's things.

34:33.000 --> 34:41.000
Don't ruin people's things, but that doesn't mean people haven't decided to still do weird shit.

34:41.000 --> 34:48.000
I'll just say real quick, when I logged back in, and sorry to get into my week a little bit, but I played Minecraft for the first time in a long time.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
I was like, okay, first things first, I should probably finish this stupid house.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
So I finished my house, and then I made a mistake.

34:55.000 --> 35:01.000
I was digging underneath my house because I think I wanted to write my name in clay or something.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
And as I was digging, I was like, wait, what the hell, there's more brick under here. I didn't put any brick in here.

35:05.000 --> 35:10.000
Somebody built a copy of my house directly underneath my house.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
That's great.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
So I was like, what the fuck? And then I guess it turns out, I think it was Hitstun that did it.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.000
I might be misblaming somebody, but I think he took responsibility.

35:19.000 --> 35:28.000
So Hitstun said what he was hoping to do is to rig my front door so that when I go in, I would be transported to the copy of my house and be like, what the hell's going on?

35:28.000 --> 35:34.000
So that's about the limit of fucking with people that you can do in the server and not get in trouble, which I actually thought was pretty funny.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
But you know what? I showed him, I said, fine, I'm going to turn this into my basement sex dungeon.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
So I've built...

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
So that's where the dungeons have come from.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000
Yes.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Complete with stripper pole?

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
I'm very limited by Minecraft's resources. In fact, it's not much of a sex dungeon.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Just build a fence straight up. There you go, stripper pole.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.000
Yeah, all I can really do is just have a really big bed so far.

35:55.000 --> 36:01.000
But that is the plan is that the house that Hitstun built for me, I will make my sex dungeon. I'll show you.

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
Well, I need to, as I said in chat room, I need to have dead fish in my Normandy.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
There better be an aquarium with dead fish in it. I'm just saying.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
All right. So anyway, sorry, Loki. I didn't mean to derail your segment, but go ahead.

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
No, that's it. And so I actually, I chopped down the size of our map and stuff because there's a lot of extra space.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
So they'd regenerate some new terrain and I got to say that new terrain is really fucking boring.

36:23.000 --> 36:34.000
So I don't know what, you know, unfortunately they changed the way that like their algorithm or whatever on how like stuff spawns and like how terrain is generated.

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
There's some interesting stuff, but man, like I was originally going to, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get our map imported in there.

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
So I was like, okay, well I'll just see what our map looks like now with the same seed and stuff. And man, it was fucking terrible.

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
It was just like swamps everywhere. Just swamps for as far as you can see.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Nice.

36:56.000 --> 37:04.000
But yeah, it's, it's, it's working now and you know, there's horses and stuff and actually I may go through there and take up the monsters.

37:04.000 --> 37:12.000
Cause right now I just have it as a, you know, we still can do creative, but I have monsters walking around and stuff just for the hell of it.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
They kind of annoy me.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
Well I like seeing the random Slenderman showing up in my basement, you know. It's cool.

37:19.000 --> 37:27.000
I thought at one point, maybe you can't do this financially or whatever, that's fine. But I thought at one point we were going to have like a creative server and a survival server.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Or is that, that's, I thought you could like...

37:29.000 --> 37:36.000
We can still do that. But I just, I don't know. There's not a lot of people playing right now. I just stick it on creative for now.

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
What I'm going to do is build stuff into it like the mob arena and that way we have things to do.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
Okay, that works. That works. So if we get the participation there, then maybe we'll look at doing that. But for now it's just the creative mode.

37:48.000 --> 37:53.000
But I've been having a lot of fun with creative mode. I didn't think I would, but I've been having a lot of fun with it. So it works.

37:54.000 --> 37:59.000
Anyway, okay, so to piggyback on the rest of the Minecraft story, I have also played a ton of Minecraft this week.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
And Robert M. in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says,

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
I don't know what house the sky is. I saw Loki's throne room, the Zero Mega Man stuff, and the dungeon.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
I was at least aware enough not to lock myself in a cell.

38:11.000 --> 38:16.000
Here's the deal. Okay, so originally my first house was like right in the center of the map.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
And people...

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
You notice a giant snowman next to it.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
People really were fucking with me in that house. So I got really mad and I was like, fuck this, I'm packing my shit and leaving.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.000
So I bulldozed that house and I went really far south on the map, which at the time was really far south on the map, although it's not that far.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
So if you go south, you'll see a brick house eventually and that's mine.

38:34.000 --> 38:42.000
But you can also tell now one thing I did this week is I did that very cliche Minecraft thing where I built 8-bit sprites into Minecraft.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
So I now live on Black Mage Beach. So I live on top of this giant cliff that I...

38:47.000 --> 38:55.000
And I had to clear out a huge mountain to get it. I live on top of this giant cliff and on the back side of the cliff is a giant 8-bit Black Mage sprite.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
And what I did, because I had to do some tricky things with the water so that the whole thing wouldn't get...

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
Because stupid me was like, oh shit, the cliff's not big enough to build the entire sprite.

39:04.000 --> 39:10.000
So I had to kind of... So it's now Black Mage Beach. So I put all sand down there and that's where I live now is Black Mage Beach.

39:11.000 --> 39:19.000
So come say hi, but stop fucking with my house or I'm gonna move somewhere where you won't find me. That's for sure.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
Alright.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
Oh, we'll find you.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
Yeah, I know, right. They'll build another nether portal right at my front door. When did this show up?

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
Well, hey, that's part of the network system we have to go around to each other's houses.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
No, it is very cool. Like, somebody spent a lot of time to make that so I don't want to sound ungrateful.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
It's just I'm always like, damn, like...

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah, I think that was also Hitstun. He's been doing a lot of stuff.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
Well, props for you, Hitstun, even if you were trying to mess with me. Alright.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
For the record, the other thing that I did see was Minecraft on an Android tablet.

39:53.000 --> 39:59.000
And promptly saw Julian lining up about ten blocks of TNT and blowing stuff up.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
So I learned that you can blow stuff up on the...

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Yes you can. Yes you can.

40:03.000 --> 40:09.000
Okay, so other games I've played this week. I did play an extraordinary amount of Final Fantasy XIV, as I usually do.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
I finished the 2.1 patch story.

40:13.000 --> 40:19.000
And what I'm going to say might be a little bit spoilery, so plug your ears for 30 seconds.

40:19.000 --> 40:23.000
If you don't want to hear this, okay, so I'm going to say something that is borderline spoilery.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
So just... I don't think it really is. Okay, plug your ears.

40:26.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm convinced more than ever that we're going to find out that this game is an Ivalice Alliance game.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
And that's going to come out probably in the first expansion.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
There's just... there's too damn many clues that tie into...

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
And there's a big one at the end of the 2.1 patch that ties into Final Fantasy Tactics.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
And I'm like, this is a freaking Ivalice game. That's what the first expansion is going to be.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
I bet. I'm putting my money on it. So we'll see.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
But I think that's really exciting. It's super cool if that's the case.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Well timed. 30 seconds just now.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Alright, awesome. Okay, then I'll shut up and talk about something else.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
How about I'll talk about another game that takes like 30 seconds to play.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
Okay, I'm going to talk about Divekick.

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
In Divekick, you do two things.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
You dive and you kick.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
There is literally two buttons for Divekick. I'm sure a lot of you have seen this.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
So Extfer and I played a little bit of this.

41:14.000 --> 41:19.000
Brad from Pod Culture was kind enough to buy me the game when it was on the Steam sale and what have you.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
So thank you very much. He picked that up for me so we could screw around with that.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
And so Extfer and I were playing that the other night.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Unfortunately we were suffering a little bit of a lag.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Like it was really kind of laggy online.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Now to be fair, I was video streaming.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Probably not the best thing for ping time.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
But I was a little bit like, ah, this is kind of a bummer to play online.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
But when it worked, it was kind of silly fun.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I think I described it on the stream as this.

41:42.000 --> 41:48.000
This is the type of game that is great for like conventions or anytime you get 20 people drunk in a room together.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
And you just want to play this.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Because obviously there's not a lot to it.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
It's not like Ultra, Street Fighter, 4, Turbo.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
Your barrier to entry is literally three buttons.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
One button, two button, both buttons.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Oh yeah, yeah. One button, two button, both buttons.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
You're right. So there's that.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
So I'm like, oh no, Jason. There's only two buttons.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And you set them at the very beginning of the game.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And yeah, even to move backwards.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
If you hit the kick button without hitting dive first, then your character will hop backwards.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.000
And if you want to move forward, you have to just dive, kick, dive.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
And then you hit both buttons to do special moves and all this stuff.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Yeah, it's silly, but it's fun.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
Some of the characters are a little crazy.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
But I guess that's part of the charm of the game.

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
And yeah, I had fun when it was just like the normal...

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
Instead of Ken and Ryu, you have dive and kick.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.000
And so those were the best matches where it was just dive versus kick.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
So we had fun with that.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah, the abilities and the movement differences of some of the characters.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
Whatever the psych ward, patient, dragon thing guy is controls.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
Yeah, one of them teleports.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Really weird.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
One of them turns invisible when he dives.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
And that's good and bad.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
It's good because you're invisible, but it's bad because he's invisible for everybody.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
Locopoco said in chat, you know they played a dive kick tournament at EVO.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
Oh, I'm sure they did. I think this is a huge thing now.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
I think that's when it debuted.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Maybe. Possibly. Not sure.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
Alright, so anyway, that was dive kick. I had fun with that.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.000
One other game I played this week that I'll talk about now is a game I think I talked about about a year ago.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
And last week was our best of show.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
And I completely neglected to name this game, even though I remembered to say something on Hoard House.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
But probably because Hoard House is a show about online games.

43:31.000 --> 43:37.000
But silly me, really should have put this game in my honorable mentions or even in the number 5 slot on last week's OLR.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Because I think I actually did name it number 5 on Hoard House, but you know, minds can change.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
But for seriously, this is one of the best games that came out last year.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.000
Path of Exile I played quite a bit of this past week.

43:47.000 --> 43:54.000
I hadn't played it in a while and just randomly was like, oh I should see what's going on here because you know it's on Steam and so on.

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
So I loaded it up. And they're having like a contest right now. By the way, Path of Exile, free to play.

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
And it's like one of the best. Oh, you just loaded up the picture of your Normandy, didn't you?

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
Stop derailing me, Darcyra.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
Oh god, it's awesome.

44:07.000 --> 44:14.000
Path of Exile, probably one of the best free to play things that's out on PC right now because it doesn't try to nickel and dime you to progress.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.000
You can do the whole story without paying for it. All the paying stuff is cosmetic.

44:18.000 --> 44:24.000
Although, if you want to do like guilds and get a bigger bank, they do try to charge you for that stuff.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
But I think it's very reasonable. You get a lot for nothing in this game.

44:28.000 --> 44:34.000
So I think if you like roguelikes or Diablo clones at all, you should try Path of Exile.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
You really have nothing to lose. And it's fun.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Well, you just said two magic words.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Roguelike? Well, think...

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Considering all my nominations.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Jason, what is Diablo at its core?

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Well, I mean, Diablo...

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
It's a roguelike.

44:49.000 --> 44:56.000
Good point. It has its, you know, 3D advantages, but it's very much a dungeon crawl, which is all those games are.

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
And that's exactly what Path of Exile is, too.

44:59.000 --> 45:07.000
With an insane, fucking insane talent tree that reminds me of the Final Fantasy X game board where you just could move anywhere. It was crazy.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
The crystal... chrysanthe... I don't remember.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
Crystalarium or something, yeah.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
That sounds right.

45:14.000 --> 45:19.000
But anyway, so yeah, Path of Exile, great. Oh, so what I did this week, they have these regular tournaments.

45:19.000 --> 45:27.000
So right now, they're having like a one-week tournament to just, you know, get as much experience as you can on this character in one week.

45:27.000 --> 45:34.000
But the game's on hardcore mode. And there's these other features, too, that I don't fully understand because I haven't played the game in a while.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
But something called Nemesis, which I don't know if that makes the enemy stronger or what, and something where the shrines can affect you or the enemy.

45:39.000 --> 45:45.000
But for me, I'm just like, it's hardcore. Meaning if you die, you die. Game over and you're done.

45:45.000 --> 45:56.000
So far, my character's still alive and she's level 11. So for somebody who hasn't played in like a year and didn't really play that much to begin with, I'm very happy with my progress.

45:56.000 --> 46:01.000
So I'm gonna see how far I get on that. So yeah. Love the soundtrack in Path of Exile as well.

46:01.000 --> 46:08.000
Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, not everything is a roguelike.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
Correct, not everything is a roguelike. Mass Effect is not a roguelike. Final Fantasy is not a roguelike.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
No. No, but I do like roguelikes.

46:16.000 --> 46:24.000
Honestly enough, though, you know what game I've kind of had this urge to play is Venture. I want to hook up my Colecovision.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.000
That is old school. Is Minecraft a roguelike? I guess not.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
It's a sandbox.

46:29.000 --> 46:37.000
Yeah, it's more of a sandbox. Okay, anyhow, let's, okay, that's enough about my gaming week. Oh, Jason, I don't want to miss you, though. Jason, how was your gaming week?

46:37.000 --> 46:48.000
My last week was incredibly lazy. I know I opened up a couple common things and played, like, literally less than five to ten minutes of, and just stopped. I don't know why.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
That's okay, because the news in gaming is the same way this week.

46:52.000 --> 47:02.000
Easy week, catching up on sleep more than anything else, and a couple of legitimate days of work, but that's it. Last week was terribly unexciting.

47:02.000 --> 47:16.000
All right, fair enough, fair enough. All right, excuse me, let's get into some housekeeping real quick. I always plug the Twitter and the Facebook here, so twitter.com slash o-l-r and facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and we're also on Google+.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
If you'd like to prove to us that people are still using Google+, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, all one word.

47:22.000 --> 47:47.000
Also, we're at youtube.com slash orange lounge radio, where Jason will post the orange lounge radio enhanced edition, I don't know what else to call it, so it's the orange lounge radio enhanced edition, typically about a week after the show airs, and, you know, the first week was just nothing but the show on YouTube, but now you really have been enhancing it, so Jason, tell us a little bit about, because you just posted last Sunday's show today, it's great.

47:47.000 --> 48:16.000
I finally got it up with upload and everything else like that, it was literally like 1230 in the morning, local Pacific time of course, but I want to start being able to actually feature some of this stuff visually, so the fortune cookie message of the week, podcast listeners trying to see if there's something else we're gonna do, but the show always ends with a fortune cookie message of the week that Jamie comes up with, and so I throw the video in in the outro, because it's just a way of sending you

48:16.000 --> 48:19.000
something fun to depart the show with.

48:19.000 --> 48:40.000
Yeah, it was always, and the reason why that was instituted in the first was just because the podcast listeners were like, I have no idea what this man is talking about, it's something we do live only because it's so weird to say, okay, well, we're gonna just hit disconnect now and dump all our listeners, so we always kind of just end with a little, like a song or something, she does a lot of stand up comedians and things like that, so.

48:41.000 --> 49:08.000
Last week was Brental Floss, Super Mario 3D World with Lyrics, Christmas Week was Night Santa, no no, Christmas at Ground Zero, Weirdo Yankovic, and plenty of other fun random stuff to go with, but last week I put the visual representation of Listless in the video, when we were talking Mighty No. 9, Call's designs, as one of us referenced individual one, put that on top.

49:08.000 --> 49:21.000
YouTube doesn't allow you to link to anything, so a creative solution is gonna have to happen for figuring out how to give appropriate attribution to a lot of these articles and whatnot now.

49:21.000 --> 49:39.000
I would also like to extend a very special thank you to Dungeon Buster and ActDeft for giving me chapter timestamps for episode 532 and 533, so if you go to youtube.com slash orange on radio, expand the description and then you can hop straight to a chapter just by clicking the little timestamp in the description.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
That part's awesome.

49:40.000 --> 49:49.000
Wonderful, incredibly helpful, that's what I wanted to do from the get go, and it's time consuming as all hell, so thank you so much both of you for doing that.

49:49.000 --> 50:01.000
That's great, thank you guys for doing that, and yeah that's awesome, because if you're just like, oh I want to hear that Listless from last week again, because I just remember Alan's answers were so bad, because they were so mean, you could just go back to the Listless.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
You could just say that because he's not here.

50:02.000 --> 50:18.000
Well, and I know he's listening and making a stank face at me right now as I say that, but no, for real, you can go click on the number there and it will actually take you right to that section, that's really cool, so thank you Jason, thank you to your helpers, Dungeon Buster and ActDeft who all made that happen, that's great.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Very cool.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I'd like to thank our team of AV Techs.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
I know right, we have a whole team now, Team OLR, it's great.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
But I would not like to thank Jesus.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
Stop, stop Kathy Griffin.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.000
Alright, anyhow, so that's it for housekeeping, yes?

50:33.000 --> 50:34.000
Sounds like it.

50:34.000 --> 50:38.000
Alright, then I think we are finally ready to start the news. Loki!

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Sorry, it's fighting the cat off of me.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Oh that's okay, I was like, uh oh, Loki's AV Tech.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
Kitty!

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
Yeah, she was trying to be in my face and stuff.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
That's what cats do.

50:49.000 --> 51:00.000
Anyways, so this is I guess why we can't have good things, and that would be people exploiting stuff in the name of cheating.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
And this happened with, I guess, NES Remix.

51:05.000 --> 51:14.000
They had a time attack contest that was going on, and apparently people figured out, hey we can exploit this by pausing and unpausing.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
You know, the slow-mo and the original NES.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
Apparently the gameplay would start before the timer would start.

51:22.000 --> 51:31.000
And so doing that, you'd be able to finish a certain level or something with a very low time that wouldn't exactly be accurate.

51:31.000 --> 51:41.000
So because of that, they said, in the interest of being as fair as possible, we decided to terminate the event without recognizing the fastest time.

51:41.000 --> 51:48.000
We sincerely apologize for this matter, and particularly because the vast majority of people played fairly.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
That's too bad.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
Way to go, bad apples ruining it for everybody.

51:54.000 --> 51:59.000
But at the same time, I mean, here's the thing that gets me.

51:59.000 --> 52:04.000
These games are supposed to go through this long quality process, which maybe NES Remix was a little more rushed.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
I kind of think it was.

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
So maybe it didn't go through some of that, but I always think the pause-unpause trick was huge on the NES.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
So nobody thought to try that.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
I mean, granted, maybe not so much in the games that are included.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
Like, pause-unpause was more like Gunsmoke was synonymous with that.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
That was the infamous game for that.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
So maybe they didn't think to try it in the games that they included.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
But I was just kind of like, I was just surprised that.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
I mean, yes, I want to blame the bad apples, and they do take the blame.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
But you also kind of have to go, really?

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
It's not like they hacked it.

52:38.000 --> 52:45.000
They just found a problem that you guys didn't find yourself that really anybody could use to get their times better.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.000
Yeah, that's the really interesting part about this, is that it's not malicious, technically.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.000
There is no falsifying information.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
This is a legitimate quirk of the game that people took advantage of.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
That's fucking amazing!

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
We don't have awesome games in the show world, do we?

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
I don't think so.

53:01.000 --> 53:08.000
Quick shout-out to Awesome Games Done Quick that was taking charity for cancer?

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
Yeah, for cancer research that was taking place over the course of today.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
And these people...

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I think it's more than just today.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
It was yesterday and going on and on, yeah.

53:17.000 --> 53:22.000
And these people, they don't break a game in a malicious sense.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000
They know the game inside and out to actually take advantage of these little personality quirks

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
and put it towards making the game doing better at the game than other people could with straight-up skill.

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
That's a thousand times different because those publishers are not currently running a contest for speedruns.

53:38.000 --> 53:45.000
But even like speedruns, though, a lot of times people exploit glitches to go faster through games.

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
If it's in the game and they're not actually hacking, I don't see a problem with it.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
There's not a problem with that.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
But the whole start, stop, start, stop, start, stop thing, that's a problem.

53:55.000 --> 54:03.000
Because NES Remix is not programmed to really recognize that the way it should, which is a fault of the game's design.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
But then it's also a fault. That's why it's called an exploit.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Because they're exploiting that bug.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
There are certainly numerous interpretations of the word exploit.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
I understand that it makes the contest difficult.

54:19.000 --> 54:26.000
If you were to actually see people perform this live and one person's screen is just flickering uncontrollably

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
because they're taking advantage of stuff, yeah, that sucks to watch.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
But that's not what's going on here.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
These people found something to make them better at this game.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
It's the frickin' DDR bar argument all over again.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
Look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

54:39.000 --> 54:46.000
Tech2030 says, Nintendo Lately, some people are bad, so we're taking everything away from you.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
Oh, isn't that the truth? Hello, Swapnote.

54:49.000 --> 54:53.000
I mean, obviously, a point I'm gonna make.

54:53.000 --> 54:59.000
King of Kong, this harkens back to a time where games didn't phone home and they couldn't just have the results come back automatically

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
and be sorted, tallied, everything else.

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
But the fucking world record for Donkey Kong was 100% horseshit to begin with.

55:07.000 --> 55:11.000
And that's why... fuck me, I'm gonna forget his name. I already forgot his name.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Not Weebie, what was other dude's name?

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Other Donkey Kong world record holder.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
Barbecue.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
Oh, Mitchell. Billy Mitchell.

55:22.000 --> 55:33.000
He, knowing what he knew of the game, his lawyer buddy, he knew that the score that was put forward in the world record was terrible.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
So he sat down and blew it out of the water.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
Thus begun the great Twin Galaxies.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
And the King of Kong.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
And now there's Hank Chen too, let's not forget.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

55:45.000 --> 55:56.000
But my point being is that, you know, the fact that this can be done and verified via mechanism in the game really sucks for the contest

55:56.000 --> 56:03.000
because to put the time into figuring out this stuff, it shows how dedicated to the game these people are.

56:03.000 --> 56:12.000
And if there is no mal-intent, if there is no malicious, like, deliberate changing, it just sucks that people wouldn't be, you know,

56:12.000 --> 56:21.000
that they wouldn't be recognized for being able to pull this off instead of just, oh, you didn't play the game the way we wanted you to play it, so everybody loses.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
Eh, kinda sucks.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
Yeah, but a pause-unpause thing isn't really a part of the game itself.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
Like, it's kinda one thing, like, again, to talk about the awesome games done quickly when people exploit Mario Land.

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
Exploit Mario levels. It gives them no advantage that is not already immediately present to them.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.000
Right.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
So what's wrong with it?

56:42.000 --> 56:52.000
I, when you're screwing with the timer when it's about time, I just, I don't know, it's totally different to me because, again, you have a current contest going on

56:52.000 --> 57:01.000
and somebody's bending the rules using a feature not everybody knows about, whereas, you know, obviously people don't know the fastest way to beat a game.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
That's what this competition is about.

57:05.000 --> 57:13.000
Yeah, but if you were to, okay, let's say you're to watch, let's say you watch a speed run-through of NES Remix and it's just the dude pause-un-pausing, pause-un-pausing.

57:13.000 --> 57:19.000
Are you gonna be really impressed by that? Or are you gonna be like, no, this guy's just pause-un-pausing to get his time left, that's cheap.

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
And that was the very first point that I made, is that it does not make for good watching, but that's not what happened here.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I agree with that point, 100%, absolutely.

57:28.000 --> 57:34.000
Whereas the awesome games done quickly is great watching, because, like, people actually look at that and go, well, A, it's for charity, I'm not gonna knock a charity event,

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
B, a lot of people watch it and go, oh, sweet, I never knew I could do that in Mario, I'm gonna try that myself.

57:40.000 --> 57:51.000
So, the first answer is that they curate the best-looking, you know, the games that come together well that are the most attractive to watch.

57:51.000 --> 58:02.000
That said, I watched something from summer last year, possibly even 2012, where somebody speed-run-ed, speed-ran, speed-ran Super Meat Boy,

58:02.000 --> 58:11.000
and one of the tactics with Flywheel, Fly, the little line character that, uh, I'd never played his horse game,

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
one of the tactics was to use up your double jump, pause-un-pause, and then get a third jump.

58:17.000 --> 58:27.000
Just once, not repeatedly, but it was a quirk of the game's engine that even blew away Team Meat that were on the phone at the time that it happened.

58:27.000 --> 58:34.000
And, uh, I believe it was Edmund, you could just hear him, he's just like, what?

58:34.000 --> 58:41.000
So, it doesn't make for good watching, it's legitimate, it's not malicious.

58:42.000 --> 58:47.000
Possibly. That is something else that we can have in this day and age.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
That's that.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
Yeah, but Nintendo understands patches, I mean, come on, this is online, we're talking about here, I mean.

58:54.000 --> 58:58.000
Alright, any final word on this, Loki? This situation?

58:58.000 --> 59:04.000
It's just disappointing that, you know, it got exploited like it did, especially for a contest.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
Alright, well, moving on, talking about something a little different,

59:08.000 --> 59:14.000
one of the games that came out right before the end of the year, over in Japan anyway, is Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII,

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
or as others have called it, Final Fantasy XIII-3.

59:17.000 --> 59:24.000
The game is not out here in the States yet, but it will be out in February, question mark, I think it's the end of February when we get it.

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
Well, the game's out in Japan, and of course there's a lot of DLC, and I don't know if you guys have seen the DLC,

59:29.000 --> 59:35.000
some of it is really ridiculous, like a lot of it is outfits for Lightning, and it's the type of shit she would never wear,

59:35.000 --> 59:42.000
but whatever, it prints money, so they have it out there, like you can get like a moogle dress and stuff too.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Good lord.

59:43.000 --> 59:49.000
One of the things, and I'm sure Dark Sakura's gonna choke on this, you can actually dress her up as Aerith from Final Fantasy VII.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
Can I stab her?

59:50.000 --> 59:51.000
With flowers.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.000
With the flowers and everything.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
I'll stab her with the flowers. I can do that.

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
And no, you cannot play as Sephiroth, I'm sorry Dark Sakura.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Well the only way to get this in Japan is to purchase the V-Jump strategy guide that Square Enix bundled the DLC with,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:14.000
but actually that didn't happen that way, in theory that's what it was supposed to happen, it was supposed to be exclusive DLC,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:22.000
but oops, it didn't work that way, because what happened is that the DLC was accidentally pushed out to the marketplace with everything else that came out,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:31.000
such as the Final Fantasy VII DLC for Cloud was supposed to be there, being able to dress up like Yuna from Final Fantasy X was out there too,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000
another one of Jamie's favorite characters, you can actually dress the character up, that DLC was supposed to be there,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
but Square was actually in breach of contract by putting the Aerith DLC out there.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Somebody's gonna lose a lot of money. Way more than what they're gonna make on this DLC.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000
The DLC was yanked on December 20th, an apology tweet went out saying, sorry we had to pull this because the strategy guide,

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
and they had to apologize to the makers of the strategy guide too.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:03.000
They did note that Cloud and Yuna would return, because I guess they pulled everything, and then Cloud and Yuna outfits returned,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
but they did not say anything about the Aerith costume, so yikes.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
But you know at the same time mistakes happen, like I can think of games have accidentally been set for free,

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
like didn't that happen with Fable III at one point, I mean I know they gave that away eventually for the games for gold thing,

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
but at one point didn't they give away all of Fable III online accidentally for free?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Yeah I believe so.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It was two or three, one of them, they gave it away online, you know these things happen,

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Steam Sale, Don't Starve, and Borderlands 2 both had the wrong price at one point, people were getting them dirt cheap.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah I may have done that.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Yeah exactly, so you know these types of things happen, but it does kind of, I mean when it's the game being priced that way,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I kind of look at it and go okay that really sucks for the makers of that game,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
because that's kind of essentially money out of their pockets or whatever.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:02.000
With this when I look at it and it's DLC, like especially cosmetic, silly DLC, which is what this is,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
it's a little harder for me to go, oh this poor strategy guide company, I'm just like this is stupid.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Why are we giving strategy guide companies exclusive DLC, I mean I guess that's to sell strategy guides,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000
but I know they did that with like Saints Row, and it was terrible DLC,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000
like the one for Saints Row IV is just some gun skins, that's it.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It's really just more of an incentive for people who like to collect all this stuff,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
and you know to buy the strategy guide, I mean really that's the incentive.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And I mean I have a friend that works for one of the strategy guide companies,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
and he's like yeah they pay all this money to get these exclusives and to get these type of things to go out.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I guess the hardcore fans of the game, I mean you know a Final Fantasy VII Aerith costume,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
you know Jamie might not be Aerith's biggest fan, but there's a lot of people that would want to grab that,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000
but it's just a costume.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Hey well since you know that Square Enix is basically running Eidos now,

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
maybe we can get an Aerith skin for Tomb Raider, like the original one, so she can keep throwing her off a cliff.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000
One can only hope, I guess.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Be careful what you wish for, because there is that Tomb Raider, I forget the name of it,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
the PlayStation 4 version, which by the way is another reason I bought the PS4, because I want to get that.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Legendary Ultimate?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Whatever. She's got new hair addition.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Definitive edition.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Thank you. I'm gonna call it the Tomb Raider, she got new hair addition.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
She got her hairs did.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.000
She got her hair done edition, and maybe, be careful what you wish for, there might be some of that DLC or something,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.000
that would be so silly, but I love the idea of Dark Sakura getting Aerith DLC for that game for Tomb Raider,

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
just so she can keep killing her in mysterious ways.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.000
You know that I still have my very first memory card with my save file at the Jenova fight,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
because first of all, the Jenova fight is freaking awesome, and second, I get to see the bitch die.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I cheer every time, it just makes my heart warm.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
So how about some other news?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Dave Roberts, who is the CEO of PopCap, is retiring on the 8th,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:32.000
and the one replacing him is John Vecchi, who's basically going to be taking over.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
And as we know, PopCap is a division of EA now.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So yeah, he's also leaving around the same time as Jason Kapalka, and they're like, bye, we're done.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I mean, I'm sure they've earned their retirement, yeah.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
But if I worked for EA, I'd want to retire too.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.000
You still have to, and that's the whole thing, you still have to wonder, because this is a very odd trend we see,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000
is that, didn't the same thing happen with BioWare? Those guys left, right?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Now we see the PopCap guys left, it's just-

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
What if they started their own company called BioCap?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Plus, I mean-

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
PopWare?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
What has PopCap been doing? I mean, I remember they used to crank out the game-

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Plants vs Zombies 2.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Yeah, I know, I know, there's Plants vs Zombies 2, there's the Garden Warfare, and then there's Pagle 2, right?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
But that was kind of all they did this past year?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Licensed all of the Bejeweled offshoots on various platforms.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Yeah, I mean, you could even play, for a while you could play Bejeweled and Pagle on WoW.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I missed their website.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
And the Plants vs Zombies level in WoW, that was fun too.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
I realize the website's still there, but it's probably not the same.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I haven't checked- admittedly, I haven't checked it out in a while.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
But I used to like to go to PopCap.com and just play all their little free games that were in the Flash,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
because they had some funny stuff in there.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:02.000
There's a lot of games that people don't really talk about, like Big Money was one of them,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:08.000
and sometimes they'd have these little gem games in there, but I don't know if that's just kind of not what they're about anymore.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I don't know, I stopped playing Bejeweled because of Doctor Who.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Were those games continuing to be made and published even after they were under EA?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Oh, I'm sure if it'll make money it does. Yeah, the iPhone store has a lot of those games.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.000
No, I mean on their website specifically, little freebies like that.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Did those continue to be produced and come out after EA?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I'm gonna be honest, I haven't looked, but they're probably all Facebook games if nothing else.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
That's probably what it is.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
They need to be able to track it and prove that it's worthy.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
They can't rely on feeling and intuition, it has to have metrics.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I rely on feeling and intuition. All the time.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Previously the Freebie Flash games were just essentially demos.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:59.000
They were episode 1 demos of, for $15.95 you can get the full version that has extra puzzle levels and full...

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:05.000
They did the Peggle thing on Steam, the Peggle Extreme, that was basically just crossover with Valve games.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
The Portal level was really fun.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And they had the Warcraft plug-in one too, it was awesome.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000
That's what I talked about earlier, because I used to just sit waiting for the pug or whatever,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
because I was always DPS, and play Peggle for an hour until I finally got picked up.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Alright, well I think we should probably go over to Loki's story, right Loki?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Yes, speaking of people leaving, Criterion, the two co-founders of that studio have now left to form yet another studio.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And Criterion may remember them for the wonderful, awesome racing games Burnout, and some of the more recent Need for Speed games.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:55.000
But yes, so now they are going to form a brand new company, and I don't know what they're naming it yet.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Maybe they're going to join the PopCap guys! That'd be pretty cool.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:13.000
But yeah, they're saying, you know, news breaks along with Fiona Sperry at I Have Left Criterion Games, welcome to the real future.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Whatever that means.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But I guess they're going to form their own company or something.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
The futures!

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Well, there you go. We'll just add that to the list.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So it's going to be Criterie Popware?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Crit Pop.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Crit Pop.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
You never know.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Let's see, okay, so here's the thing, I went to PopCap.com just because I was curious, and the first thing you see is kind of like an ad for all the stuff on iPhone, and then you go to more games, and it shows you more games.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Bookworm Adventures!

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Yeah, like, you know, in San Aquarium, that game was the shit. I love that game. They even have like an arcade version of that, right?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Okay, but you can learn more PC download, and then all the way at the bottom, online games, little tiny link that leads you to online games, and I think, yes, this is where you can play.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Okay, then it's like here's the featured games, and then you can all get, so four clicks later, finally.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And they still have their most popular games on top.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Do I just hit learn more and I can play in San Aquarium?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Download free.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Okay, but it's not playing the browser like it used to be.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
No.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
So they've definitely changed the site a little bit. That's too bad.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Because EA likes to fuck it all up.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Certain personalities just don't, you know, you reach a point where, you reach a point where your company changes, you either turn into EA or you join them, and then you get to the point where you want to start all over again, because in a big corporation, you're limited in what you can do.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Well, also I think kind of, you know, the direction that EA's going with a lot of their games is definitely focused on monetization, and maybe that's not necessarily something that these guys want to, you know, deal with.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Perhaps.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I understand that the point of a corporation is to make money, but what happens to, you know, the only reason I think that we have such a big indie community now is, first of all, the technology is easier to come across, and second of all, that we have more people who are willing to make games that people will like, just for the love of it.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:31.000
You know, and I think that a lot of people are being driven more towards the indie game scene rather than going for these big, you know, publications.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Fair enough.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.000
All right, well, I think we're going to shift gears here a little bit with our next story, right, Jason?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Yeah, so, as perhaps a small little addition to us reporting last week about various network services, online services, having outages during the holidays, which was due in large part to an influx of gamers, but there was another interesting story that happened in the last couple of days, that a Twitch and YouTube streamer by the name of PhantomLord caused a humongous stir,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:12.000
wound up apparently making the record for the most-watched livestream on Twitch at any single time.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:29.000
The numbers were up over 140,000 consecutive people, something along these lines, and basically what it boils down to is that he's a League of Legends player, League of Legends, Dota, invariably various other games that was touched on in the incident,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:40.000
but basically what happened, and this is his livelihood, this is how he makes money, so livestream, ads, monetization, Twitch subscriptions, he was doing what he normally does and starts playing Dota.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:12:00.000
When I first read this article, basically the gist of what happened was that, whether by monetization or some other reason, he started becoming the target of an attack by DDoS griefers, essentially, apparently this is being attributed largely to a collective known as Derp.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:23.000
And the way that I heard the story when this happened last week is that PhantomLord was going about his routine, playing Dota, playing League of Legends, playing Dota, playing whatever else he wanted to, and this collective, indeterminate number of people was watching what he was playing, watching what he was streaming, and would target that game, that network, bring it down.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:47.000
So much so that it happened with a game, so it'll happen to the big individuals, League of Legends, Dota 2 again, but also affect smaller, something I'd never even heard of before, Disney, for crying out loud, Disney's Club Penguin, that's what it was, I knew I had to bring it up, I've never heard of this before.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I only know because they sell the little shit things in the Disney stores.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
They are shit.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And I love penguins.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It's just like a little social network, like Second Lifestyles social network.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
It's a Facebook game for kids. It's Disney.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
But that was brought down too.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:25.000
So the culmination of this result was that PhantomLord's stream went, he changed it to a static image instead of webcam based, and basically just disappeared for, until the stream wound up being taken down, and the claim was that a police raid happened on his house.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:53.000
He was the target of a police raid, as a hoax, meaning that individuals called the local police for him, his address got leaked out on the internet, and then people phoned in a hostage situation to police, and then, you know, damn near SWAT team, but just the serious guns of police came to his house, put him in handcuffs, they stopped short of arresting him because there was nothing going on,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:07.000
but the claim was that his house was searched, he was in handcuffs, placed in the back of a squad car, you know, being interviewed by individuals, rifles, guns drawn, pointed at him, you know, the works.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:26.000
That was a couple days ago, and I watched, he, PhantomLord posted an hour long explanation of the day's events, apparently there's been like 30, 40 pizzas that have showed up at his house, and you know, the normal nonsense that happens whenever a high value target appears.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Which, by the way, this whole act of swatting or whatever is illegal in California now, and it was a huge thing because people were doing it to like Tom Cruise and Miley Cyrus and all the Hollywood people, right, so I don't know where this particular individual is, but if that had been in California, where the guy lives, that would have been illegal to call, or actually, if the, if the phone-er was in California, that person could go to jail for that, I mean, that's, that's how serious it is, and it needs to be.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Let's, I mean, let's be real, that, just, people should not fuck around with things like that, like it's, it's one thing to take down an online service, which I also don't agree with, because you're ruining the fun for everybody else, or what have you, you know, if you have a squabble, you work it out intellectually, or whatever, you have a discussion, a debate, you know, you don't, this is just going to bad places, but calling the cops on somebody is, that's especially, that could like screw somebody's life up, you know?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
That's not okay.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Especially, too, you know, like, there's this picture that's just posted in chat, I mean, there's some scared-looking people there on top of that, too, you're also decreasing manpower from legitimate crimes going on.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Yes, yes, that's, that's, that's one of the awful things, too, so, I mean, the punishment needs to be swift and severe for this type of fuckery, so, anyway.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Just to expand, the colloquial term, if somebody was swatted, or swatting someone, means that you phone in a hoax to the police, and get a swat-level response enacted on an individual, an individual home address, just an individual's, that you know their location, their whereabouts.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I, so, I watched the video an hour long, I read this article, it turned, as it turns out, this, this was likely not a blatant, like, I don't, I don't think that this whole attack was fabricated just for money, but it wound up working out in Phantom Lord's favor, because, as reported by various outlets,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Phantom Lord agreed, he was having a private conversation with the individual or individuals that are the collective derp, and he said that, if my team starts losing, you can start taking down, you can take down the server so that we don't get a registered loss.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000
They start, they start out the, they start out the round, the Phantom Lord's team is doing okay, they start losing, the attack begins.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:10.000
My understanding, my assumption is that derp just said, oh, we can take him down, let's continue to do that, you know, raising the ante, so not only do they take down the one game he's playing, but they continue to do so across multiple networks.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:23.000
The controversy that's happening is that Phantom Lord, because of the influx of users, he enabled subscriber-only mode in chat, which means if you are going to chat with him on Twitch, you have to pay $5 to do it.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And he raked in six figures, and, like, another five figures of monetization on YouTube with ads.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000
So the whole thing could have just been an elaborate hoax to make fleece money?

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:39.000
I don't think it was a pre-precept- what's the right word here?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Premeditated?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I do not believe it was premeditated, and I, there's a lot of fault to go around, people are even blaming Twitch for not taking down a stream as soon as the influx was just affecting five or six networks outright.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:08.000
It does bring up an interesting point, at what point does Twitch need to be like, this stream is not about gaming at this point, and pull the plug, because in some regards, I think that is an element to blame.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:18.000
The argument is that how could Twitch possibly watch as much live content as on their network, but they can certainly pay attention to the most important, because that's where this scale of attack tends to happen.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000
If this is the largest stream that's ever happened on Twitch, somebody saw it.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Yes. And apparently he also broke rules that he continued to show ads on the entirety of the stream, even to subscribers that aren't supposed to get it.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
So there are a number of legalities that are happening here as well.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:48.000
But it was- swatting is not a new thing, it's not a gaming thing, I've heard it happen to pundits and other prominent tech individuals at least a year or so now is when I first kind of heard of it.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
But it's not a fucking joke either, and that's something to emphasize.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
When police come to your house, it's never a joke.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Well no, and I'm talking like the person, the coward making the call, it's not a fucking joke for them to be doing it either, because just like Jamie said a minute ago, you're taking them away from real issues, and the person making that call is going to get in a lot of trouble.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Because, you know, if I were the guy, I'd sue him.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
But, you know.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
America!

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
It's the internet equivalent of a bomb threat, and we've all been high school and have dealt with those numerous times for sure.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But it's not a joke.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Yeah, it is not, by all means.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
There's the I'm older than you, because for me it was pulling the fire alarm. Somebody would always pull the fire alarm.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Oh, we had those too. My high school, the first week of school, what's the short version of the story?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.000
There was a bomb threat at one o'clock in the afternoon, we didn't leave the school grounds until five.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000
You know what they started doing though is that they built paint sprayers into those things so that when you pulled the thing it would spray you with paint and they would know who pulled it.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Like die exploding money bags that are persistent for a fair amount of time to find the culprit.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Yep.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Alright. Well.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Fun.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I know, right? Let's shift the topic a little bit and talk about some upcoming games.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
I am so excited about Cuphead.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Oh my god, this is great. Cuphead is a run and gun video game that's being done by Studio MDHR that is, it's sort of set like a one on one fighting game, but with different levels as you progress through it.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And there's definitely some kind of a, well I guess it is a run and gun element, but it made me think a lot of Mega Man 2 with just how the main character is going.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
The big thing about this though is the aesthetics to the game. It's based off of the old 1930's cartoons.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:58.000
So it even seems to have this degree of older film grain on it. And the characters look like they are straight out of early Disney and early Mary Melodies.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000
You know, free World War 2 era cartoons.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
One of the movies in the Bioshock Infinite viewer things that you can look at.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:18.000
But I mean, even the Captain Silver thing sort of makes me think of the early Betty Boop and Popeye that I used to watch.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:28.000
But it's really neat and I hope that the music in the trailers is some of the music that's definitely in the game because I really like just the overall feel that it gives.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I'm super excited by this. I'm probably more excited about this than just about anything coming out.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Also, the other character if you play in co-op is called Mugman. So you have Cuphead and Mugman.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:51.000
It's so adorable. It's super adorbs. And it's supposed to be out on PC first, then Mac and Linux, and then consoles.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I want this game.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah, it looks really cool. I want to check this out too. I just love the visual aesthetic behind it. What a great idea for a game.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It's so cute. I just want a shirt with Cupman on it. Or I want like a cup hat.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Locopoco in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Skullgirls had a character named Peacock that had the same aesthetic.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Peacock is kind of creepy looking. And honestly, I think a lot of Skullgirls, I would want to put more in the 40s and up sort of that noir period.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Because the music is some of that same type of jazz big band style. And definitely the scenery harkens back to some of the film noir.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:42.000
I don't know that it's related to Skullgirls. The styles are completely different.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are coming out very soon.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Although I have a feeling this week is pretty dry, but we'll check in anyway with Loki with the US.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Well, if you don't own a Wii Fit balance board, now you can.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:10.000
As part of the Wii Fit U disc versions that are coming out, they have one that's just the disc game and the balance board.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.000
And one that is, I believe, just the game and the pedometer.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Well, the one with the balance board of course has the pedometer in it as well.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
So if you don't want to download it digitally, you can pick it up this way.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000
And technically not a game, but some more Disney Infinity figures are coming out this week.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Wreck-It Ralph, Vanellope, and Rapunzel.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Well, those are all good characters. That's cool.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Wreck-It Ralph doesn't have their own stage or anything though, right?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.000
No, they've kind of gotten lazy with some of these. They don't have any more playsets coming out.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000
So all they have is just these toy box characters.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And even they're going to have these toy box sets coming out later on.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:04.000
But it's basically just the two characters and then a background and a skin for the toy box mode.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
It's kind of, I don't know.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Alright, well is that it for the US?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
That's it.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000
We're heading to Japan where there is one game out this week.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
We don't really get back into a regular release schedule until next week.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
But there is one game out this week on January 11th.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
And if you're act-deaf, you'll care about this game.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Because on the Nintendo 3DS, Hoshi no Kirby Triple Deluxe comes out this week in Japan.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Yes, that is the Kirby 3DS game.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Makes its way to Japan this week.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
That's the only release on the 11th.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.000
So it's a bummer the 3DS isn't region free or act-deaf could import that.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
But you'll just have to wait.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Unless you happen to have a Japanese 3DS.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Then check that out.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Time to import.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Only one game on the 9th.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And that's Metal Gear Solid Rising for PC.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
So, no.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Alright.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Alright, just a few more stories before you guys.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Loki.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So Fallout, and this is kind of ironic.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics have been removed from good old games or GOG.com.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:24.000
This is basically in regards to the expiration of Interplay's franchise rights as of the 1st of this year.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And because of this, now I believe Bethesda is going to be the new owner of that.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000
I actually have this from GOG because they were giving it away.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
I was going to say it was a giveaway at one point, wasn't it?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Yeah, it was free.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Now we know why they gave it away.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
They knew it was coming.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
So they gave it away.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And this of course is also going to lead into Bethesda trying to get these games onto Steam.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Which I'm sure they're going to be able to do that.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Not sure when though, but they're going to probably have it up at some point.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
So the games are going to end up on Steam?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
I think so, yeah.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
They basically said no.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.000
They'll have a look at other options once they've taken care of the Steam portion.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000
But they may have it on other services as well.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000
Well, especially if the rumors are true that we're getting a new Fallout this year.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
And that's going to be a big E3 reveal from Bethesda.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
There's a new Fallout game.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
It was in Listless, it must be true.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Well, I just think logically Elder Scrolls was the last game.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
So the Fallout will go back to that series unless they're going to do something new.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Not to mention they finally own it and have full control of it.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
So it would make sense to have the old games out there available for people to catch up.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Well, one thing you won't be able to catch up on are some other games that got removed from Steam.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Usually we wouldn't talk about every game that gets delisted from a service.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
But A, it's a slow news week.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000
B, the caliber of what we're talking about here is pretty big.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Activision actually removed some Marvel licensed games from various digital storefronts.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Obviously Steam being the most notable.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Including Deadpool, which has only been out for six months.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.000
But it has now been delisted from Steam, which is interesting because it came just a day or two after the game had been on sale as part of the holiday sale.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
So that was very interesting.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Other games removed Spider-Man games, including Edge of Time, Shattered Dimensions, Friend or Foe.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:35.000
X-Men games, Destiny, Origins, Wolverine, and the official game.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Apparently don't know the real reason why these games were delisted from Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
But the Amazing Spider-Man still there on all the storefronts.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And Activision still has the rights to do the Amazing Spider-Man 2.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:58.000
No reason was given by community manager Dan Amrich, who actually confirmed the removal of the games.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Didn't talk about why.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Some people are thinking it has to do with the whole Disney-Marvel deal going on there.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
That something's going to happen there.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000
The expiration of the licensing agreement between the two companies.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Being cited is probably what happened.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Disney is going to move towards self-producing and publishing their own games for these franchises in the coming years.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I don't think that they are.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Actually, I think that at least it was with Star Wars that they were only going to franchise this stuff.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I don't think that they're developing anything in-house.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I'm trying to remember back to those stories.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I seem to think that, well, think of it this way too.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
They're probably going to sell it to a lower bidder.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
You know what I mean?

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Or a higher bidder?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Yeah, sorry, a higher bidder.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
They're going to make the most money possible is what I'm saying.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Well, yeah.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
That wasn't with Activision.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Maybe a studio that Disney maybe has a stake in would be a better thought.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Or maybe it's kind of for the better because a lot of these games at Activision, especially their licensed games, are kind of shit.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:08.000
So it's probably a good thing that they kind of try to wipe these out of the digital marketplaces as best they can.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Get some fresher games in there that might not be so terrible.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Alright, let's see what comes.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
This E3 is going to be a big one to see what types of announcements.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Because if there's a new Star Wars game coming, we'll see it by 2015 because you're going to have the movie coming out and they've got to get it out by then.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Anyway, let's travel back in time to a time when games were a little more simple.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Back when Star Wars were vector games.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Take it or leave it.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You took it.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Back when you had regular panty shots in video games.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
What?

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000
That's what this game is all about.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Oh, that's what I'm like.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Dark Sakura, you're going a little crazy today.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Alright, it is the classic game of the week.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Dark Sakura, what is this week's classic game of the week, which apparently involves panty shots?

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Wonder Momo.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So, again, I'm going through my list of Namco games that have characters involved in Namco High.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Amazonia from this is included in Namco High.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
So, this game only came out in Japan.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I have actually played it though.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
It came out in 1987 and it was a beat-em-up arcade game.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:29.000
It's supposed to be kind of the parody of the Ultraman type games.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Basically, you play as a girl named Momo who is, you know, instead of actually playing her as a superhero in the world,

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
she's on a stage like she's performing for people.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And she's at the Namco Theater.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And so she's an actress who's playing the role of Momo or Wonder Momo.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And it has a digitized voice in it.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
And it's basically just a fun little, you know, beat-em-up.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
It came out, like I said, in 1987.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
It also came out on PC Engine in 1989.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And on the Wii Virtual Console, both the arcade version and the PC Engine version came out in 2007.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And 2009 was the arcade one.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
So, going back though to the gameplay itself, she can only kick.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.000
And then she builds up her Wonder Meter and then has a cyclone animation.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:35.000
And then can attack with the Wonder Hoop, which she can use as long as she's Wonder Momo.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000
But when she throws the hoop, she has to wait for it to bounce back to her sort of Captain America-like.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And then she has, you know, energy beams and, you know, kind of the Ultraman thing.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
And then she has an attack called the Wonder Typhoon that's a big energy wave.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:57.000
It also has some fan service. When she jumps, you can see her underwear.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
And she has to dodge a photographer in the audience who's trying to get a peek up her skirt.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And if he gets a peek up from her skirt, she's stunned. Or embarrassed.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:16.000
So, and then, of course, one of the images that's on the curtain at the beginning of the game is Momo wearing a towel.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:24.000
So, like I said, there have, there were other versions. There was a PC Engine version, which is actually the first version that I played.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
And I have played an arcade version too.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:35.000
It came out, the Virtual Console version came out on, sorry, the PC Engine version came out on Virtual Console in 2007.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
And like I said, the arcade one followed in 2009.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
And this...

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
What the? She just did like the splits or something. It was very awkward.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
When she jumps, right?

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
What the hell is this game? No, she did something on the ground.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Oh yeah.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I think it was when she got hit.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That's her turning into Wonder Momo.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
There we go.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
It's a very strange game.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Well, it is a weird game. The other thing too is that there, she's had other appearances.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000
She was in Namco Cross Capcom, partnered with Bravo Man.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.000
She was on a card in Batten Kaitos.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000
She was in Tales of the Abyss as a doll.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And thank you for posting the picture in chat.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
The picture in chat is the PC Engine version.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:34.000
She is on a float in Marvel Land and her Wonder costume is in Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2 and in the Idolmaster.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:46.000
There's actually an album done by a J-Pop singer named Haruko Momoi who did a Wonder Momo new recording basically based off of Wonder Momo.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.000
There's also a gachapon figure of Momo that you can find for the Namco Girls collection.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000
And her final appearance, if you're not counting...

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Well, I mean, of the character Wonder Momo herself is in Queensgate Spiral Chaos.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
However, another character, like I said, is in...

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Her rival is in Namco High, which is Amazonia.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
Alright, there it is. I'm just entranced by watching this gameplay.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
She just kicked a velociraptor in the face in the video.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:44.000
The other thing too is that more of this actually went into sort of a bit of a post-Namco apocrypha from Shifty Look who does an online webship called Wonder Momo Battle Idol that brings back basically Momoko who gets the Wonder Momo power and that's where Amazonia came from.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It is so weird to see this 80s, 90s anime manga style just because...

01:34:50.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Like, I don't watch too terribly much, but all the old classic series that everybody knows from TV that actually made it to America or showed up in video stores.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000
And then just the change of what it's been ever since 2008 forward.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Playing these old games, it hits you real hard. It's a very definitive style and seeing it again is always fun.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:23.000
You know, I still have to go in and play some of those really quirky games from the late 80s or the mid to late 80s.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Like, God, I just had it in my head. Psycho Soldier, which I've done as a classic game before.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:38.000
I don't think it's an anime, but Blue's Journey seems to make me think of similar art styles but more like bumpy 3D special stuff.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Well, it was just that whole level of 80s anime style where it was really into the big eyes and that whole aesthetic.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:55.000
I mean, look at Ranma, Inuyasha follows the same aesthetic. Dirty Pear, old Dirty Pear. I love Dirty Pear.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Old Bubblegum Crisis. Dominion Tank Police. That was more 90s, wasn't it?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Interstellar. Finding Crossover. That was Matsumoto Studio.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
What was the old one that sci-fi- Oh, Lotus War. Record of Lotus War.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Record of Lotus War. Do you know that actually started based off of a tabletop game?

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Did not.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
Which I would love to find the original game.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Alright, so I believe that's it. Your classic game of the week. The very strange but somewhat charming.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
It's a fun little game.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Wonder Momo. She needs to buy a Wonder Moomoo with all those photographers trying to-

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I just think it's fun having the sort of limited stage, literally the stage, and then having to interact with the audience watching you.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Even if it's the crappy photographer.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Alright, I'm gonna close that up.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
A funky little game.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Alright. Alright, well, when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Launch Radio, including the FUGO Question of the Week, rapid fire news, and your emails, FUs of the Week, Twitter topics, your calls, hopefully tonight.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:14.000
We didn't get a lot of calls last week, but we're thinking now that people are getting back from their holiday breaks and so forth, we might hear from more of you tonight.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.000
So be ready for that at Orange Launch Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
But first, we're gonna take a quick break. We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:44.000
We are live, of course, with episode 534 already in progress for this January 5th, 2014, the second half of our episode.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
If you missed the first half, well, the good news is, on the podcast, you can just hit rewind and listen all over again.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000
But if you're live, you'll have to check that out on the feed a little later this week.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000
We still have some fun stuff coming up, including your calls, the FUGO Question of the Week, and mailbag and all that stuff.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000
But first, some rapid fire news.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Loki, joining us via Skype. You there?

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Yes, I am here.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
All right, take it away.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.000
All right, so let's talk real quickly about a game that I don't think they've really talked about in a while.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So it's like E3, maybe 2012? The Devil's Third, which was a game that was gonna be put out by Itagaki.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And it's in progress still. Originally it was gonna be published by THQ. Now that's changed, of course, and still on its way.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I guess it's gonna be coming out this year. So that's pretty cool.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Not sure what type of game it is, but probably good breast physics will be involved in there somehow.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
All righty then.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Without a doubt.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Huh?

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Without a doubt.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Yes. It is a trademark.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Next, there is a brand new game coming out on Xbox Live Indie Games from Ska Studios.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:12.000
You may remember them from such games as I Made a Game with Zombies in It.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:19.000
And this is kind of a follow-up. It's called Time Viking and Space Raptor.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
And it's ridiculous, much like I Made a Game with Zombies in It.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
That sounds great.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Yeah, and it has an awesome song, which obviously I can't play, but it's pretty sweet. So check it out.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And actually it's only 80 Microsoft, oh I'm sorry, not Microsoft points, $1.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
So can't beat that price.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:48.000
And last but not least, I'm not sure if this is just to get more people to try it out or to get those people that are like,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Hey, you know what? I really do like Jago.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Now the free character instead of being Jago is gonna be Saberwolf in Killer Instinct for the Xbox One.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000
If you would like to play as Jago now, you have to pay $5 to unlock him.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So I guess it's cool that they're kind of rotating that stuff around.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:16.000
But at the same time I kind of feel that this is maybe a way to get those people that weren't paying money

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
because their favorite character happens to be one particular character that they're offering for free,

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.000
now to try to get them to pony up $5 for it or to buy the full game.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Well, to be fair, a game like League of Legends rotates through various characters too.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
So, I mean, it wouldn't be out of character for a game to offer a handful of their characters for free.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
If that makes any sense.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
I guess it does.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It's an interesting consideration for people that may have had a slightly late start to get into that game.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
They're just getting used to Jago and now they literally have to relearn the game.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.000
They literally have to relearn a character and if they don't pay, they have no other choice.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
LocoPoco in chat says Spinal gets released this month also.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.000
It's kind of weird to me how they trickle out the fighters in these games now.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
And I realize it's not like Killer Instinct is the first to do it.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Even Mortal Kombat had their DLC characters.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
But at least in Mortal Kombat, you had like 30 characters in the game already.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Whereas Killer Instinct didn't really have a lot.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
It's weird to me the way this game works.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
It's super fresh, I guess.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
But, you know what, I haven't really played it myself.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I know a lot of people I talk to and follow on Twitter seem really into it.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Some people have said it sold the system for them.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
So I can't hate. It's just weird.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
So now is Spinal included with the full game price?

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Or is that something that they're making you buy in addition to the game?

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
My assumption is it's part of the Season 1 subscription or whatever.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Season 1?

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Yeah, right.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Oh boy.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Alright, well let's move on with some more news.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Some of the rapid fire news here.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Now, if you heard Bobby's show tonight, he talked a lot about the Oculus Rift.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
And there's this Tumblr post.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.000
You know it's a slow news week when we're getting news off Tumblr.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
But there's this Tumblr post going around, which is really based off of YouTube, I think.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Where somebody is playing Metroid Prime.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Apparently they got working with the Oculus Rift.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Now, I seem to recall when I played Oculus Rift at Dragon Con.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Bobby had a copy of F-Zero GX, the GameCube version running on Oculus Prime.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Which was a lot of fun to play.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000
So this isn't too much different than that.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:34.000
But that's still really cool that somebody is running a game that I think a lot of us would want to play on Oculus Rift.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Metroid Prime.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
So that's very cool.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
There's a video floating around out there.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Of course you can't really get the full experience.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
You can just kind of see what you would see through both eyes.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.000
But I will tell you this, having played the GameCube on Oculus Rift.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
It's like the TV is right in front of your face.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Looking around is more like looking around that giant TV.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
And so it creates a good sensation in racing games like F-Zero and so forth.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And I guess it would kind of be neat in Metroid Prime.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:08.000
But when the game isn't natively built for an experience like Oculus Rift, it's really going to be losing a lot.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:17.000
It still has some benefits because it still shifts your focus so that some other portion of the screen is primarily what you're looking at instead of just being peripheral.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:30.000
But it's not going to be Team Fortress 2, A for the awesome, all this kind of stuff where you look to the left and you can see completely original landscape as far as you can actually turn your head.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:37.000
So here's something really funny is that apparently, because I tweeted to Bobby that this is going to be on our show tonight.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:41.000
Well apparently the guest on his show knew the guy that was on that Tumblr.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And so this is the funny way that Twitter works.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:54.000
So he's just the guy that's in those Tumblr pictures here, Symatic Bruce, just tweeted at us and Bobby and Reverend Kyle who is on Bobby's show tonight,

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Oh Lord, I've been Tumblr'd.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Tumblr'd.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Tumblr'd.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000
You know what, if you want to get very meta Dark Soccer, you should screen cap that and Tumblr it again.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Blink me.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I'll do it. I'll do this shit.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000
I'll have to do it when I get home.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Tumblr-ception.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Bong.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Alright, are you in chat? Where are you? Why can't I see you in chat?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000
I'm in chat.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Optio.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Oh, you're not an op. You're not an op for some reason.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Really? Weird.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000
I don't know. Alright.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
Anyway, all that aside, let's move on with some other rapid-fire news.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
ToeJam and Earl 3.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I seem to remember talking about this before.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
ToeJam and Earl 3, it didn't finish.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
It was supposed to be on the beta, but it didn't finish.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:41.000
But I think what happened here is that somebody actually got this on eBay and was able to get this available now for public download.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
So it is emulation, technically piracy, but the game never came out, so you know what?

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
It's there.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:57.000
They did do a version on Xbox, but ToeJam and Earl 3 was originally supposed to be a Dreamcast game, and this game never got finished for it.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.000
So I guess you see relics of the Xbox version in this, but obviously this is kind of a unique experience here.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000
So yeah, getting a Dreamcast development kit from eBay, the kit actually had a playable beta of ToeJam and Earl 3 on it.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:13.000
So the guy did the right thing and put it on the internet for all of us to play.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:22.000
The article you're thinking of is that he was considering some kind of a fundraiser to either continue development or just to what extent it was going to be released.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Probably for the better that it looks like it was just straight up released and made essentially public domain, even though it takes a very specialized system to be able to actually play it.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:33.000
There you go.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:39.000
And then also rapid fire news tonight, and again, it's a slow news week, because I'm just going to keep it real here.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
What the fuck kind of news is this? But it's going around the internet.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.000
So I admittedly say, what I'm about to report on is really stupid, but since it's what people are talking about, I'm going to bring it to the table.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:56.000
There's a rumor going around that an unannounced third-party game is apparently being developed for Wii U.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:04.000
The project will launch in 2014 exclusively on the Wii U, and this is coming from a French gaming website called Gameblog.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
And it's supposed to be similar to Bayonetta 2.

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I don't think that means similar in play style, I think just a similar score in that same, not necessarily an A-list game, maybe like a B-list game like Bayonetta, is a score like that.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:23.000
It isn't related to the Bayonetta franchise, however, making it crystal clear.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:26.000
So I'm like, well, that's a wide fucking net.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:32.000
There's going to be some type of third-party exclusive Wii U game.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
It's not going to be a huge game.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Yeah.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Wow, man, I could come up with that kind of news.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I know, right, but whatever.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
The next DDR will have an up arrow.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
This is just for everybody to wank off to with their predictions and so forth.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
See, there's some guy supporting the Wii U.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Exactly, exactly.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I would think, though, if I'm going to bring this wank to climax, so to speak, I would assume the third party is Sega.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Because Sega's been pretty good to Nintendo.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.000
And I don't know, Sonic exclusive, that's already kind of happened.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I mean, for this to really be news, it would have to be a bombshell.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Could you imagine Shenmue 3 only on Wii U?

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Could happen.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
No.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Why not?

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Why not? Because they won't make their money back.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
That's exactly why.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
It has to be something that Nintendo pays for, basically.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Why did Sega put this on at games?

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:44.000
And supposedly Wii U, again, this is wank, but there was that article out there on VG charts or whatever that the Wii U outsold the Xbox One in the last week or two leading up to Christmas.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And that in Japan, it made some recoveries in December, that the new bundles they put out over there actually really helped with sales of the Wii U.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Now, I'm not, obviously...

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Well, fantastic that they outsold the Xbox One after having a whole year to sell systems.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Well, congratulations to them.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:09.000
I'm not saying that Nintendo is suddenly like OMG, like just blew everybody's panties off and, you know, has made this full recovery.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:15.000
But at the same token, I think to throw it in the trash is a little premature as well.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:25.000
All I'm saying is they need all the help they can get because, honestly, as stuff goes along, we're going to see less and less games being multiplatform on the Wii U.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I mean, there's going to be a lot more games that are just PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:36.000
And even though the Wii U looks like it should be capable of running that stuff, it just isn't.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Alright, well we shall see what happens next. Anyway, in the meantime, Dark Sakura.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Uh, some stuff that may or may not be wank.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So, if, gosh, stupid iPad. I'm going to throw this thing in the toilet.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Next to Loki's Wii U?

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
Yeah, next to Loki's Wii U.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I don't have a Wii U.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
That's because it's in the toilet.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So, um, there was, uh, it had been mentioned before that a developer of an arcade game, it was called Tobii Technologies.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
They had a game that could be controlled by eye tracking.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:23.000
And now they are bringing out eye tracking hardware that's going to let you use your eye movements to control other games.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000
They're already working with Amnesia, The Dark Descent, Skyrim, and StarCraft.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
And there is video online that you can check out.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:44.000
In other news, there is a new character joining the Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for iOS and Android.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Um, that is going to be, um, Ryo Hazuki.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
And, uh, he is going to be, uh, apparently, um, in a bulldozer.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:58.000
No, it's a car. Um, a boat and a plane for all of them.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:06.000
And it looks like his, uh, his, uh, stuff is actually looks like old Sega machines.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.000
So, one of them looks like an afterburner. There's an outrun car. That's kind of neat.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Um, and then, last but not least, um, there is...

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
That's a space area on it.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Oh, space area. I couldn't see it very well on my, on my iPad. Sorry.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Um, Free Comic Book Day is coming up on Saturday, March 3rd, which we all, all of us comic book fans love it.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:34.000
There will be a special Archie, um, comic that's going to be a Mega Man X edition.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And it looks really nice.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.000
And it's, uh, being done, uh, let's see. It's a flip comic.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So, take advantage of Free Comic Day. Get your Mega Man on.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
That's it.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Sounds good.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Uh, when is Free Comic Book Day?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
March 3rd. I mean, May 3rd.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
I was like, yeah, I thought it was a little later than that. Alright.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Yeah, and, and, and then you get the Free Comic Book Day, um, uh, bags.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Um, for like the rest of the year. Advertising the one that's already passed. Whenever you go get your comics.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Awesome. Alright, uh, let's go to the FUGL question.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
It was May. I screwed up. Thank you, chat room. Whatever.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together. You get FUGL...

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
No, we call it FUGL.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Yes, you do. We call it FUGL just because it has a ring to it. I don't know.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Uh, the FUGL question of the week where we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we read some of our favorite answers here live on the show.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Maybe all of them tonight. We had 11 answers on Facebook. I could probably read all those.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Alright. Uh, ooh, some of them are long. Maybe not. Spoke too soon.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Alright, uh, here it is. Tonight is a building off a game we talked about earlier.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Uh, Dark Sakura talked about the, uh, Cuphead game, which was, um, the game... I keep wanting to say fighting game, but it's not. It's like a...

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:13.000
It actually has fighting game elements in it and they're one versus one fights, but it's a running game.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Okay. Well, I called it a fighting game because I thought that's what it kind of looked like, but I thought, alright, well, it led into this question of the week.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
If you were to design...

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
It's a fighting gun.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Okay. If you were to design your own fighting game, what would inspire you?

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
And I imagine most people were thinking of Street Fighter S type of game. We'll see what we get into with some of the answers here.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So what would inspire you? Just like the 30s cartoons inspired this game, what's your inspiration for a fighting game?

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Uh, Fifth Dream replied and said, I only want to make a fighting game if I could get Tim Burton or Edward Gorey to hand draw the whole thing in black and white.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Anybody have a time machine?

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Uh, Jove Dea says something wacky like the concept of Clay Fighter 63 and a third, which I always loved that title by the way,

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:04.000
but with the gross or non-PC cartoon or gaming character like Ren and Stimpy, Conker, Chowder, Jake the Dog, Bender, The Tick, and so on.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Uh, Codeman says, I think what would inspire me more are the crazies at Walmart.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
People of Walmart in the game.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
You like Walmart in the fighter? Oh.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.000
It would have a dive kick type feel and clothing customization. You would have the tackiest clothing options possible.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:25.000
One of the characters have a special attack where they send a horde of kids to scream and beat up the other fighter.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I really haven't thought about this at all though.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:35.000
I think one of the super attacks should be called a CPC so that, you know, Child Protective Services will show up.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Call one of them Black Friday on Christmas Eve.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Ed B says, I want another Power Stone with four player combat local and online. That's a good-

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:45.000
I am behind that 100%.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Co-signed.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Ragenator says, I designed a game that's over the top, absurd, that's equal parts Beavis and Butthead, Ace Ventura or The Mask, and Animaniacs.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Not those characters per se, but the feel of them, their style of humor.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Uh, Locopoco-

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
Still a slapstick game.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Yeah.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Locopoco replied and said that my dream would be to make a fighter with the same three versus three mechanics of Marvel versus Capcom 2, but all the fighters are drag queens.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Tagline would be serving up fierceness to some other hoe's face. Bam.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:22.000
You know, that's almost my dream game too, would be a RuPaul's Drag Race game where they actually throw shade.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Just saying. That's their special attack, they throw shade.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Andy R. replies and says, I'd love to see PlayStation All-Stars 2.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Uh, the game was really fun for me, having been a long time PlayStation fan, but I felt like most people either wrote it off for being too similar to Smash Brothers or being too different than Smash Brothers.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Uh, Elliot B. says, I'd be inspired by my own lack of ability and make a fighting game with a very accessible tutorial mode.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Despite enjoying Street Fighter Tekken and so forth, I'm absolutely hopeless at pulling off anything beyond a Hadouken.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Wasn't Killer Instinct's tutorial, like, it was expansive, but it was still detailed to the point that if you don't understand fighting game mechanics between the frame counting and the combo learning and the hitboxing and everything else, it was my understanding that Killer Instinct is like one of the best intros in this kind of thing you can have.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:17.000
I think one of the DOA games had stress relief mode in it too.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
I've actually played none of the other games.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Where it was super easy.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
All right, Tech 2030.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Pokemon would be a great inspiration for a fighting game. Huge roster of monsters to choose from with all elemental specialties.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Leveling up, move sets, and evolution would play a big factor.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000
An arcade mode with all your challengers as gym leaders with their own specific monster specialty.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I think a lot of the systems in Pokemon have the potential to cross over to the fighting genre.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Uh, Degenerate Johnny says, my type of fighting game would be a Mortal Kombat-like game featuring Dr. Seuss characters.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.000
The reason for the Mortal Kombat system is because Dr. Seuss characters have great finishing maneuvers.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Imagine Sam-I-Am's finisher being him force feeding his opponent green eggs and ham that will cause him or her to explode.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Or the cat's hat devouring his opponent's hole.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
Okay.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
SS 2100 Matt says, picture this.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Fantasy characters from classic literature and fables, Alice vs. Big Bad Wolf, done in the art style of American McGee and developed by NetherRealm Studios.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Not really an original idea, but getting those two together would only lead to greatness.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:23.000
So, taking it to some dark places with those last couple Facebook answers there.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Let's uh, let's see how dark things got over at Google+.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Uh, we had ActDeft reply and said, um, my ideas either exist already, like fighting is magic, or in their development, Pokemon fighting game teased in video or Pokemon rumble.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
So I'm gonna go the easy route and say, Capcom vs. SNK 3, dammit!

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And SVC chaos doesn't count.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
That is a fair answer.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Uh, Redertainment, lastly, here over at Google+, says, I remember playing a game on the Genesis as a kid that had a single player experience, but when it came time for battles, did so like in a fighting game.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I haven't been to remember what game it was or happened to come across it anywhere, but I think I would make a fighting game like that.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Either that or use my project as an excuse to bitch slap politicians.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
So, didn't they make a fighting game out of politicians? I see it was kind of controversial.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I'm sure.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I'm sure they did.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:15.000
But, uh, any idea what he's talking about there? Genesis is a kid that was a single player experience, but during battles was a fighting game.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.000
That does sound shockingly familiar, but I can't put any details in mind.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I can't place my finger on what game he's talking about. It's a little too... not enough details for me.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Chat room? Anything? Chat room?

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Yeah, we'll see what the chatters have to say over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.000
Uh, any, any fighting game requests here in studio or Loki on the Skype line?

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Um, I would say, like, uh, I don't know. I was just reminded to watch Salty Bet, so...

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Maybe bring back Eternal Champions.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Because it's weird. Holy cow. But yeah, that'd be a perfect, uh, you know, Moogan.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:59.000
I mean, any of that stuff is just, you know, that would make the perfect fighting game and just watching how ridiculous things could get and, you know, on the website, Salty Bet.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Um, yeah, that. I would love to see that. Hell, I'd love to see an app for Salty Bet in, like, you know, on consoles. That'd be fantastic.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
That would be kind of fun.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:18.000
I think it would be kind of fun even though I, you know, I give EA shit all the time. Wouldn't it be fun if they did a, um, fighting game with their major players?

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:22.000
I mean, that would be kind of fun.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I don't know. EA's done some really terrible fighting games. I mean, they had... they did the really awful Marvel one, like, a while back.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Um, Rise of the... what was it? It was Rise of the, um, Imperfects or something like that?

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
No, I didn't bother.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:46.000
And then there was, um, the Def Jam, um, fighting game that they had that was terrible.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Well, see, they just licensed an engine that works. There you go.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
I guess.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Alright. I already gave my answer. I went to RuPaul's Drag Race where they actually throw shade and just kick the crap out of each other, but then hug it out at the end of the day.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.000
And maybe, like, instead of a finishing move, they lip sync for their life. And that would be, like, that's how it ends. So that's my fighting game fantasy.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Uh, Jason, you're awfully quiet over there. What would be your fighting game fantasy?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:26.000
I... I don't know that I really have one. I like fighting games as they stand, and, um, I don't know. That's not really a genre that I've ever had... had, uh, fanciful dreams about, we'll say.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I want a fighting game to smack some sense into Jason. Play more fantasy.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Apathetic fighter, where they just... they don't really move.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000
What did you say to me?

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:47.000
They think... it's just two characters lying in bed, and they might get out. Alright. Anyhow.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Job.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Uh, let's... but it's cold outside. Alright, let's move on with some more news. Loki, I think you're gonna start us off with some news here.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Yeah, so apparently, um, DayZ did really well for, um, you know, the first week that it's been out.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:15.000
And now this is the alpha client of the standalone version of DayZ, not necessarily the same plugin for Arma 2 that, you know, has been out for a long time now.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:25.000
But, um, they had 400,000 copies sold in the first week. Um, their server, um, was hit... was actually with, uh, 40,000 people at one time at the highest.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:33.000
And, um, they're doing pretty well. They're actually gonna roll out some new updates, um, soon throughout, I guess, 2014.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Some of this stuff includes, like, um, better security against, you know, hacking and exploits. Also, uh, cooking and the ability to hunt animals in the game.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:59.000
So, um, I had bought, um, or had gotten, was it the DayZ, uh, you know, mod for Arma 2, but I still haven't gotten a chance to actually play it. Um, but it looks interesting.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:09.000
I don't know a lot about this game, honestly. I've seen it all over Steam, and I saw it during the sale, but, you know, again, I don't have time to play everything, and it's probably a good thing when it comes to sales and so forth.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:19.000
But, yeah, this is just kind of a game I've missed out on. So, roughly, like, why would I want to get it? Why is this game doing so well, Loki? What void does it fill in gaming?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:46.000
It's basically a zombie survival game, but it's incredibly realistic, because Arma is, you know, kind of a military survival, a military sim, and so it has everything from, like, you know, you carry all of your equipment, you have to go scavenge buildings for, you know, stuff, but mostly, um, you don't have to watch out just for zombies, you have to watch out for the other players, which, you know, there's all sorts of crazy stuff that goes on with the other players, you know, kind of taking that whole survival mentality.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.000
And it's basically permadeath, so any time you get killed in the game, you're gone.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Because I was gonna say, I was like, oh great, just what we need, another zombie game, because I've never seen one of those before, but I get it, so it's, like, hyper-realistic, and it's more like the hardcore, it sounds like, not like Dark Souls in that regard.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I've taken it to understand that it's basically a first-person shooter, well, third-person, you see your character running around, third-person action paired with Minecraft, because crafting and combining and cooking, smelting, all that kind of stuff, plays a big role in getting the supplies that you need to survive.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:34.000
It is survival taking advantage of a lot of really modern and popular concepts in gaming. They've looked pretty fun, not entirely sure it's my type of game, but they've been fun to watch.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vagnetwork.com, and I'm not, he might be referring to this, or he might be referring to something else they're talking about in chat, because they're talking about a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game and so forth, but Tech2030 says...

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
He's talking about a Pokemon thing.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Oh, okay, well he said, I wanna bring this up anyway, Tech2030 said, yeah, that didn't seem like it was an actual game to me, it just looks like some CG filler or something.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:15.000
So, I guess that's not about this particular game, but it does kind of get me thinking, like, sometimes I kind of wish, like, in Steam or whatever, when there's a game, you can get the TLDR, didn't version of the game, you know, too long, semicolon, didn't read, like you can get, or didn't watch with a trailer, like, what is this game all about?

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Super realistic zombie thing, like, just like Loki described in, like, two sentences, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know, is it, am I just that lazy American guy who can't be bothered? I guess I am, it's fine.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:42.000
But there's so many games, I can't keep track of them all. It's tough, I guess that's why I have lovely people like you to talk to in this show, and blogs to try and keep tabs on all of it, because it's pretty crazy out there.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Don't cry, Rob.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
I might cry, I might cry a little bit. Alright.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Bitter tears?

02:03:47.000 --> 02:04:03.000
I'll cry tears of happiness over this, because this is pretty cool. Video games crossing over into the GLAAD, or the GLAAD, intriguing LGBT characteristics of 2013.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000
And if you don't know what any of these, I just threw, like, all this alphabet soup at you. If you don't know what GLAAD is, it's the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, is that what that is?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I think so.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Basically, when, you know, they're trying to, sometimes they're a little bit militant, but for the most part, they do a lot of good stuff for, like, just trying to make sure that people are aware, like, you know, for example, in gaming, you shouldn't call other people something that rhymes with maggot.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:39.000
They had really good information at the Castro Street Fair a few years ago. I remember running into some of their people there and actually having a really good conversation.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Right. And LGBT, of course, you've probably heard that before, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered. So GLAAD puts out this list, I suppose, every year, and I know they've done this for television, but they put out a list of the most intriguing LGBT characters of 2013.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And most of it is, of course, about television. Let's, I'm trying to think about some of the other stuff that they actually put in there.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I haven't seen the list, but I think, like, Modern Family, maybe, that's more...

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Probably the year it came out. Oh, okay. There's that French film, Blue, I actually pulled up the list from GLAAD.org here. Blue is the Warmest Color is, like, this huge French film that's about these two younger girls that fall in love and so forth.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Let's see, Fox has a comedy called Brooklyn 99, which has a deadpan, I've never seen this show. I guess it's the Andy Samberg Fox show, which I don't...

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Okay, I mean, I know Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live, but I didn't know he had a show now. Captain Ray Holt is apparently a gay character and, you know, kind of does deadpan.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I think it's... Let me phrase it this way. I'm gay myself. I think you all know that now if you've listened to this show.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
No. I know, right? I was surprised.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
I only talked about my partner, Alan, earlier in the show.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
It's coming out, your 2014 resolution?

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Right. Okay, so if you didn't know, okay...

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
He went back in for five seconds so he could come back out again.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:05.000
So, I like video games and I'm gay. Gasp, shock, awe. It's 2013, or 2014. I'm still writing 2013 on my checks. It's 2014, this shouldn't shock people anymore.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:19.000
My point is, as a gay man, I don't like when we see these stereotypes on TV. I realize sometimes they're fun. Like, you know, Jack on Will and Grace, he served a purpose and that show was years old and at the time.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:25.000
But you know who my favorite gay character on television was? Like, my favorite portrayal of a gay guy on TV?

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Neil Patrick Harris from Hello, I Met Your Mother?

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
No, but he is great in general. Who doesn't love Neil Patrick Harris? But no. Well, he's not a gay character on the show.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
He's playing a straight character.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:44.000
But anyway, my absolutely favorite portrayal of a gay man on TV is the ABC comedy Happy Endings, which unfortunately isn't on anymore. There was a character named Max.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:53.000
And Max was this slobby video game playing guy who was into dudes. He was me, basically.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
You're not slobby.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:00.000
But, I mean, like, he was my spirit animal. That's why I liked that portrayal. So he was probably on this list in one year.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:08.000
You want to know one thing that's pretty fucked up? I was watching an interview with John Barrowman and he auditioned for that role in Will and Grace.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:18.000
And was rejected for it because he wasn't gay enough. After having, what, married his partner a couple years ago?

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Irony.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Irony. Anyway.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
They need the stereotype instead of the normal frickin' human being.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:30.000
If you've never seen Happy Endings, I'm almost positive it's on Netflix. It's got to be on Hulu, but I think it was on Netflix, too, and that's my favorite portrayal.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:38.000
But anyway, why did I bring this all up in the first place? Because it does have to do with games. I didn't just go on a random tangent about gay things in the media.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:46.000
What made this important is that amongst this list of movies and TV and so forth, they actually called out here, and you actually can see here on the site, number five,

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:56.000
they actually called out The Last of Us, which, you know, was a huge PlayStation 3 game. And unfortunately, it's one of those games that's on my list to play, but I'm behind.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I love that game so badly.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:10.000
I know. It's in my rental queue list and I really want to play this. And just reading more about this makes me want to play it more because there is a character in the game named Bill that's kind of like a loner in one of the towns in the game that you learn through a backstory.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:23.000
He had a partner named Bill. They were in a relationship, but because of the plague, the partner, I guess, I'm assuming, turned into a zombie or whatever the deal is in that game, and so it kind of gets into a story about that relationship.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:39.000
But again, Bill, not a stereotype. So that's, you know, but that's really cool that we're seeing video games really kind of penetrate the mass media in all these sorts of ways where it's not just, you know, how do I phrase it?

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Like, it's not just video games kind of, oh, you can sit at the table too because, you know, my kids play Pac-Man and so forth. But no, like in this very political organization's list of acknowledging representation in various art forms, they include video games right alongside movies and television.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000
That's really cool.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I believe they also named a comic book character in this as well.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Is it Batwoman?

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:15.000
No, it is shape-shifter Benjamin Deeds came out as gay, leading his teacher Emma Frost to immediately reply, I don't care.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:21.000
I think it actually gets into the whole, this is just kind of all the LGBT characters in comics. It's one, like, kind of blanket.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Of course, they bring up Wiccan and Hulkling, but they're actually like, I ship them so hard.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.000
So, Prodigy, and so forth. So they include comic books in this too.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:40.000
And there was also North Star got married in comics, I think last, the year before, I would say.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:54.000
But there was also, though, I wasn't a big DC fan, but there was a whole big shitstorm around Batwoman being able to propose to her girlfriend and not get married because no one was getting married.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Yes, and then there was that whole ugliness too when that story came out about the art that they wanted people to draw for, like, an audition.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
The Harley Quinn naked, dead in the bathtub.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Yuck.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Sexualizing suicide, that type of thing.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Anyway, let's focus on the positive, and that is gaming media and a powerful story like The Last of Us sitting right alongside these other, this is a good thing.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
You know what, I have a goal for this year, Rob.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
What's that?

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
John Berriman on the show to do a bumper.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
That's my goal.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
That's a lofty goal.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Dear John Berriman, will you please do a bumper for O.L.R. because I love you.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000
If he's at Dragon Con this year, I will make it my, because now you know I'm all about Dragon Con.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
I'm going to be on a plane to Atlanta come Labor Day.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Thank you, Bobby.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
You better fit me in your overhead compartment because I need to see my man.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
When you say it that way, it sounds so sexy.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:40.000
I want to be his hag.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:41.000
You can be my overhead compartment.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Ew, no, it's gross because you're a friend.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000
All right.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
I wasn't even thinking of Rob.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Rob, you're a horrible human being.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000
Yes, I know.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
That's why you love me.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
That's why you love me.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
All right.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Speaking of horrible human beings, Dark Sakura.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Do you love or loathe?

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Speaking of horrible human beings, Dark Sakura.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
No, I'm not saying Dark Sakura is the horrible human being.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I'm saying the story is about what horrible people are doing.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.000
It's about fuckery is what it is.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Yes, it's a story about fuckery.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:14.000
I'm kind of glad that now I have a new computer that never had WoW touch it.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Blizzard sent out a big warning for World of Warcraft players saying that there's a dangerous Trojan

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.000
that they should be on the lookout for that could steal their account information,

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:28.000
information even if they're using an authenticator.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:35.000
It's called you can actually find it by going by making an MS info file.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:42.000
This is, of course, you know, PC, because I don't see anything about it affecting the Mac players.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:48.000
But you look for a startup program that's either Disker or Disker 64,

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:56.000
and it will show up with Disker run DLL 32.exe, you know, the usual, or Disker 64.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:02.000
And then they're trying to basically find out how to remove it, but none of the regular virus programs can.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I can tell you that there are ways of removing Trojans, but you need to completely disconnect from the internet

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
once you find out the how.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:19.000
So you can get rid of them, you just need to be able to dig into your startup files.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
And you'll probably have to do a registry clean as well.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Just a warning to those of you that want to play MMOs, don't let stuff like this scare you from playing MMOs,

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:34.000
but you've got to be careful because people really, they come after the golden games and stuff,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
and people's accounts, like hardcore.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.000
So if the game ever offers like a second level authentication, and almost all the big MMOs do,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.000
WoW certainly does, in fact it's a universal battle net, Final Fantasy XIV has an authenticator,

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Star Wars, The Old Republic had one, I'm assuming Rift has one too.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000
You know, if they have these second levels of authentication, take it, take it, take it, do it.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Because I'm always shocked.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
But they're saying this is breaking through the authenticator.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Yes, this breaks through the authenticator because what they did, my understanding is it's like a fake curse client.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Is that they were putting it up there as the WoW curse client, which is a very popular add-on managing,

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000
so people would Google it and they would get this, not the first time.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
And you can't really get rid of curse that easily even after you've uninstalled.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I'm going to read though this paragraph that's a reply to this that was submitted by Hvok, I guess.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.000
I would encourage anyone with the Trojan to seek help before resorting to a reformat,

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:32.000
and to make sure you're not getting help from one of those quote professionals who just reformat for you.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Everything available on the virus suggests it should be entirely removable by fairly standard manual removal methods, like I was saying earlier.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:44.000
It does nothing special. There's no TDLFS file system, no alternate data stream files.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000
It doesn't even particularly protect itself except by a couple task scheduler entries.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:56.000
And so, yeah, I've removed one of those annoying ones that keeps reinstalling itself every time you connect to the internet,

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
and I had to do a complete registry rewrite on mine.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Yeah, be careful. You will have to get the gun and shoot your computer.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
And then burn the room.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:08.000
But this will just be, this one seems super easy to remove from what I'm seeing on here.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:12.000
I think it's more in there as kind of a half-assed kind of thing,

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:19.000
because if they really wanted to make it dangerous, then, you know, they could have done a lot more to it.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat saying,

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:29.000
remember, I got hacked by gold farmers in WoW, and I never played it.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000
That's right, but he had a Battle.net account, I'm assuming from playing like Starcraft or Diablo or something else over the years,

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.000
and they used that to make the WoW tune and get gold and all that.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.000
And Brad from PodCulture says the only way to be 100% sure is to nuke and reformat.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:53.000
That's not necessary. If this one isn't doing any file protection on itself other than task scheduler, that's not necessary at all.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Maybe with this, but I think it's important to say that what Brad is saying,

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000
Blizzard, what they call BluePoster community managers were saying,

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:05.000
when they didn't know enough about this, that's what they were saying you would have to do if you got caught with this.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:09.000
At this time, the only sure way we know is to reformat your computer, exactly what he said.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:16.000
So sometimes in the early stages and they're still trying to figure out what the hell this virus, Trojan, whatever it is, that's how you get rid of it.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:23.000
I do also suggest, and I'm normally not a big advocate of different programs,

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
but Hijack This is very useful.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
I like the name, Hijack This.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:35.000
No, what it does is it runs through all of your processes that are running so that you can get rid of any type of shareware, spyware, anything like that.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:44.000
And I also run a program on my Chrome that, and don't enact it on our website because we need the ads, called Ghostery.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Or whitelist vognetwork.com, please.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:52.000
But it's called Ghostery that basically stops websites from installing trackers and advertising detail.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
And it works for Facebook.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:03.000
In a crazy related story, I don't know if you heard about this, but Yahoo apparently got a huge hack over the past few days that where people,

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:10.000
you actually had to click on the ads, but when you click on the ad, it would install malware, like somebody hacked Yahoo in that regard.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:17.000
And I have an app on my iPhone where whenever you open it up, the ad on the bottom automatically opens up a game to download.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
And that is so irritating. I can't imagine that as per Apple's terms of service.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
It's gonna kill that now, just literally. That situation, just get rid of it.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Yeah, yeah. No, seriously.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
And they're resorting to nefarious things.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
Stop rewarding them in any way.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:39.000
That's ad networks, whether somebody actually manages to make it into a more or less reputable network.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:48.000
That's what Drive by Malware and Drive by Downloads were all about, is that you're on a site that isn't technically illegal,

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:56.000
but can't get a prominent first-party ad network to allow them to monetize their content and get ad revenue off of web pages.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:11.000
And in the era of constant Java vulnerabilities, constant Flash vulnerabilities, and even older browsers and just basic rendering exploits,

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:19.000
this is the argument for making sure that all your stuff is up-to-date and disabling as many third-party plugins as you reasonably can.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Java and Flash being the two biggest offenders. If you're that crazy, disable JavaScript and you will be that much safer,

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000
but your internet browsing experience will also be much worse.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:41.000
That's why I'm... There's another program I use, too, that's another type of ad blocker, but it also, again, blocks those little installs from advertising and tracking your...

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Because Facebook tracks your web search data for advertising.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:51.000
That way I keep seeing porn ads.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:18:00.000
The Facebook one that I use is called Facebook Purity, and it removes all of the ads, all of the trackers, and you can even set it up to make Facebook look like it did five years ago.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:12.000
But there's a number of trackers that keep from auto-installing stuff, tracking your data, and blocking JavaScript installs.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I love this comment, though, in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com, and then we'll move on to the next story.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Retertainment says malware, like the Yahoo toolbar.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
No, the Ask toolbar, too.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Or, this always cracks me up. I mean, this is a little bit of a rant, but I'm sorry, I have to go there.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:37.000
The Alexa toolbar, right? I mean, that was a big thing back in the day, and now that website, which I think they were bought by Amazon, it measures traffic, I guess, based on the toolbar usage and so forth.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:48.000
That's one of the meters that E3 uses to see if your website is worthy, you know, of being blessed by the E3 pope, where your organization can come in.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Because believe me, I've been on both sides of it, where yes, my site was good enough, no, my site was not good enough.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:59.000
And it always blew my mind. I'm like, really, Alexa? Like, most tech-minded people I know know to get that shit off their computer.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Like, that might have been cool in, like, 1998, but now, less cool.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
It's like having Gator.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Yeah, right? Or Weatherbug. Or all the stuff my parents have on their computer.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Bonsai, buddy. Whatever the hell that is.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Rob.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Bonzi.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Rob. Why does your dad's computer take fifteen minutes to boot, Rob? I just bought it.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Rob, I bought him a new PC and he already broke it, Rob. Rob, can you come over?

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
The inevitable screenshot.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
That's also, like, Dan's grandmother wanting to...

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:35.000
And it's like you load it up and literally the corner thing, where the time is, is like three rows high, fifteen icons. It's like, oh my god, people.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.000
The inevitable screenshot of people's browsers with, like, fifteen or twenty search toolbars.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Yeah, then my dad's like, well, I was on this genealogy website and they had to install it, Rob. This is genealogy.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
My dad's really into genealogy.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
So is Dan's grandmother, and we, but she's...

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.000
There's something about genealogy and spybars.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:20:00.000
But she's gotten really good about not installing any of that stuff. We basically said, if it asks you to install it, call us first.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:08.000
So, she's actually pretty, gotten pretty computer savvy. So proud. She's so nice.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:13.000
Alrighty. Uh, Loki. Is Loki there?

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Yeah, sorry about that.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:16.000
That's alright.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Have you been cat-butted again?

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000
What?

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Have you been cat-butted again?

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.000
No, she's sleeping right here. I've been salty-bedded again.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:35.000
See, this is what I miss about having you in studio, because at least I can see you when your eyes are glazed over. Loki, over here! It's fine, it's fine.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I was watching Naruto get his ass kicked by one of the riders.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Unfortunately, it was the one that was like, oh yeah, there's no way that he's gonna lose. I'm gonna bet big on that. Yeah.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Didn't happen. Anyways, so speaking of betting and professional things, apparently there is an esports team, the Quadratic Gaming Esports team.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And the CEO, Simon, he has disappeared, because he owes a lot of people money.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Apparently he is owing, was it, won a pro Starcraft 2 player $23,000 in salary and prize money for months now.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:32.000
And I guess they're even saying that upwards to $40,000 is owed in total across a bunch of other staff members.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:38.000
And he has basically disappeared since middle of December. So that kinda sucks.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Yeah. You know, we just had a story a couple weeks ago about how esports is getting bigger and bigger. I mean, is this the dark side of what's to come?

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Or is this not? It's just an isolated thing. What do you think? Is this something we're gonna hear more about?

02:21:53.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Well, especially when more money's involved, I could see more of this type of stuff happening. But it's just kinda disappointing, I guess.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:07.000
But I think this type of thing happens, it's not just isolated to esports, that's for sure.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:10.000
That's true. There's bad people everywhere.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Oh god, what was the company's name? The Maryland? Rhode Island? Oh man, I'm not even getting any of the details anymore.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
The Baseball Stars MMO company.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Rhode Island.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Curt Schilling.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Yeah, Schilling and Rhode Island and the back game.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:32.000
And you wanna talk about raking up big money in a big hurry? Wow.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Alright. Well, let's move on. Jason, what do you have for us before we get to the mailbag?

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Well, are you scared yet? Talking about money always tends to make that happen.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:56.000
There is a new biofeedback-based horror game called Nevermind that attempts to detect players' fear and make the game harder as their fear continues to rise, provided that they're not able to calm themselves back down.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Basically the point is, find what breaks you, confirm that via the in-game monitoring of your heart rate variance via a chest strap that you wear when playing it, and throw similar kinds of scares or more or less scares just in general.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:30.000
The plot of it is that you are a... I read this and my brain already reset. You are hired as a neuroprober at the Neurostalgia Institute. I don't like either of the way those words come together.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:46.000
It's somewhat of an Inception-style plotline in the sense that you are living out other people's horrors and mental states to determine the cause of all of their suffering and all that's occurring in the first place.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.000
It's intended to be a fully-fledged game, solving puzzles based in other people's fears and minds.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:05.000
I want to know where this is actually being rolled out, because it has a very big barrier to entry in the sense that you actually need a couple of pieces of hardware to monitor what's going on in the first place.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:09.000
But you want to talk about immersion and really finding the best game to play?

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:12.000
I would lose this game in five seconds. That's what scared me about that.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:14.000
The Vitality Sensor.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Yeah, the Vitality Sensor. That was called the Wii was supposed to do. Whatever happened to that thing, right? But I think it disappeared, but I'm like, I would so lose. I get freaked out by games and so forth.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:30.000
I could not do this kind of stuff on my own, but I love playing stuff like this in groups.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:38.000
And even if I'm the one to do it and everybody else is there to watch, playing off of other people's emotions is so much fun.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:40.000
That's true.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Yeah, I don't think I see. I think it's all just being teased right now. Developed as a part of Masters of Fine Arts thesis within the University of Southern California's Interactive Meeting Games Division.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Never mind, took about a year to build to its present source as a proof of concept game.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:07.000
Reynolds plans to hold a Kickstarter project to launch the game with a variety of disturbed patients in late 2014.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:17.000
You know, it's very interesting to see the places that gaming might be headed in the next 10 years, because think about how far technology has gone just in the past, you know, 10 years as it is.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:22.000
We had head-mounted screens in the 90s, but they were just TVs three inches from our face.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
And now we're in them with depth and motion and everything else.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.000
Yeah, with, you know, it's kind of an Oculus Rift night here at VoG, but yeah, exactly.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000
You know, like you look at that as part of what could be the future of gaming.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.000
You look at something like this that actually can kind of like feel your emotions, so to say. It's kind of freaky.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:46.000
But of course, it's also important to say not everything always catches on, like the Vitality sensor or like 3D televisions have kind of fizzled out.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
We thought it was going to be a huge thing. It's kind of not.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Especially for something that would be such a one-off accessory.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:58.000
There's actually a lot of potential for this, because there is this alternative use to something that can also be put to use for exercise games otherwise.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Because people wear chest straps to monitor their heart rate and get a better sense of how they're doing on their workouts.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:15.000
So if you couple application of these accessories with this and other complementary games, there's a lot of potential for, you know, a good base of games to take advantage of it.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:22.000
And it won't just be a one-off purchase for something you'll play three times and then shove off to the land of misfit accessories.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:31.000
All right. Well, yeah, I wonder if this is the type of game that will get demoed for me at a convention in the future, but we'll see.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:37.000
All right. In the meantime, we're going to go to the segment where you guys email us every week.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. That is Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:50.000
And DarkSocker is going to dive into the mailbag head first and find some emails that she believes are worthy of being read on the show tonight.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000
I was making this squish.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Not a lot in the mailbag. Relatively.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Two. There were two.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.000
You know, y'all should have made New Year's resolutions to email the show at some point this year.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
And I just want to put this out there real quick.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:09.000
I'm always blown away when we get emails that are like, I've been listening to you for six years and this is the first time I've ever sent you an email.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:15.000
And it's nobody I've ever heard of, but I'm always like, wow, there's like more people out there that I didn't even know existed.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
So all I'm saying, don't be shy.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:25.000
If it's your very first time ever emailing the show, I'll make DarkSocker give a buy on the spelling and grammar.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Just email us and say hello. We'd love to hear from you. Please comment.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
And I only do that because it's hilarious.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Yeah, she isn't. She isn't. It comes from a place of love, not of hate.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Of love of grammar.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Love of education.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.000
That's right. All right.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Unwelcome education.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000
All right. To the emails.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
How goes it, O.L.R.? Grammar please.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Lol.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
I say how goes it so.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
I say how be.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Anyway, this is my first time hitting up the show as I'm always busy during the live show.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Perfect.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
And I just wanted to thank you for the entertainment during my busy work weeks.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Don't stop.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Hope you all enjoyed the New Year.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Yes, New Year.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000
First time emailer IQ.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
IQ.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
You need to get rid of your galaxy and get an iPhone.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Was a.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Stop.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000
IQ was a PlayStation one game that's very hard to find now that had a great sound.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000
E-Y-E-Q-U-U.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Oh, you're thinking of Intelligent Cube.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Yeah, but it was IQ.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:27.000
If you find the game, it's like I period Q period. Remember?

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
That game was weird.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.000
I remember the game.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I don't remember the art.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:31.000
It was a very good game.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
It was a very hard game.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Wasn't it like a PlayStation release game?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
It was like one of the first games I got for it.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Very close, but I don't think it was that early.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.000
I didn't have a PlayStation until like a year or two before the PS2.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:45.000
What the hell do I know?

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.000
I think that was the first game I ever rented on the PlayStation was Intelligent Cube.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:55.000
I remember the only early, early PlayStation that I remember is the jam-packed demos.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:58.000
And I remember playing irritating stick.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Irritating stick was...

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
I love those jam-packed demos were awesome.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Yeah, those PlayStation demo discs were the shit.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:10.000
You know, we have like a pile of them, like two years worth of them.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Good stuff.

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Those demo discs.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Anyway, thank you to the kind emailer who just wrote in to say hello.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Appreciate it.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
T-Y-I-Q.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:20.000
You must have a high IQ if you listen to this show.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:22.000
All right.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:27.000
The last email says, if you read this on air, use Turbo Lover as the name.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Okay.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Well, since you actually put your real name in the body of your email, I'm going to change that out for Turbo.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Okay?

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000
Happy New Year, guys.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Just want to let Rob and the rest of you know that my Xbox Live account was hacked.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Found this out when my new Xbox One called me Jen instead of by his name.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Of course, nothing bad happened since I don't keep current information on there,

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:54.000
but an email from Xbox Microsoft would have been nice.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Hope the hackers don't learn to use the Kinect anytime soon.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Love your show.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Later, Turbo Lover.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Whoa.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.000
So this, because we haven't heard of Xbox hacks happening really in a while,

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
but he's saying this is happening on the Xbox One.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Yeah.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Huh.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
I mean, it's all an Xbox account.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Well, yeah.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.000
No, it's Microsoft.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:19.000
And there was the story from Bobby from Christmas Eve that the support reps didn't allow people to break in.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:24.000
And so he just wound up getting the survey email from Microsoft after the fact.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Right.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
But nothing changed on console or on account.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Something to consider is that I would like to know from this emailer,

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:38.000
do you share your Microsoft password with another site that possibly got hacked?

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:41.000
And maybe they reverse engineered, you know,

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:44.000
because that was a big thing going around about how they got into the last Xboxes,

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:48.000
although I remain somewhat skeptical if that's 100% true.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.000
But it does happen with other like, and just just a general piece of advice.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.000
I know I've said this on the show before, but please, please.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Your banking account password.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Do not use that password anywhere else but your bank, your email password.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Do not use that anywhere else but your email,

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
because what does everything come back to to reset your passwords on other sites?

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Your email, your email.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
And those are probably the two most important things are your bank account and your email.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Never, ever, ever share those passwords.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.000
If you share those passwords with any other website, especially Xbox Live or something like that,

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:23.000
that's vulnerable and gets hacked a lot, change it right now.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Pause the show.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Change those passwords.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:26.000
You'll thank me later.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Secondary piece of advice.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Don't share security questions and answers between them either.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:36.000
You would be a lot, a lot of sites now are using really unique questions.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.000
It's like mothers made a name.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
That shit is easy to figure out.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
And some of that stuff where you were born.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Hello, LinkedIn or Facebook.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Yeah, or because people will pass around memes on Facebook that are like,

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
fill out this survey and get to know all about me.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
That's all the fricking password reset where those came from.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Those were a scam to begin with.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
I used to do those on LiveJournal all the time.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.000
All of us did.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.000
All of us did.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Because we weren't thinking that far ahead.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Because it came from our friends.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:06.000
I, this part of a reason why I, you know, say that my hometown is mobile

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000
and I've mentioned where I was born, but I hardly ever do it.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
There's a reason behind that.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.000
And I don't tell people the hospital I was born at or the street I lived on.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:21.000
I think only maybe a total of six listeners total have my address.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Right.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
And that's because I've met them in person.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Right.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Well, that's, that's how I feel about my real last name.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Like, no offense, but it's just like, I separate my work life and my-

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
I want to be a famous artist someday, Rob.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Oh, but I'm staring at this envelope that says Rob Roberts.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Oh no, it doesn't.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
See, I want to be a famous artist someday.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
So as many people know, my name is possible.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Just makes me more famous.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Oh, uh, Bobby Black Wolf.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Good point.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:46.000
Same with the, here's your poor name, street you grew up on,

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:47.000
plus your mother's maiden name.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
L-O-L-O-L.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Yeah.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Yeah.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
So I just make up something.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
And so many people buy it, hook, line, and sinker.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
And I was probably one of those people, honestly.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Well, I, I, I've always gone in and used, um, either I've,

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:04.000
I've used the stepmothers, even though I don't really tell her that much anymore.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I've used her maiden name.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000
I've used my grandmother's maiden name.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:10.000
And I have a list of what I use where I'm kind of anal about that.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:13.000
So be safe people, scary internet.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Sorry.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Random tangent that I don't think that email or intended, but it's a good,

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
just more education, more education.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Because like I said, like, I'm not saying all this to sound high and mighty.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Like I'm saying this to S to say, I have made these mistakes too.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
And now looking back, I go, gosh, Rob,

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
I wish someone had smacked you upside the head.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I've had two email accounts hacked in my life.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Oh yeah.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
My, my Yahoo account was hacked some time ago.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Yahoo one say well once.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I can safely say that I've never had my email, um, uh, hacked.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Lucky you.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Um,

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.000
but I don't know if it's because all of my passwords have been in a non-English

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.000
language.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:52.000
All right.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Is that it for emails?

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.000
That's it.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Well, we need some more for next week.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:59.000
So please consider mailbag at orange lawns radio.com is the place to send

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
those emails. In the meantime,

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:04.000
this is the part of the show where we get angsty with a segment we've been

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
doing ever since episode one. And you know what? Here we are.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:11.000
It's the first show of 2014, which would mean our 12th broadcast year.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.000
We don't officially have the 12th anniversary until, until June.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.000
But I mean, with the show started in 2002 to 2014 is our 12th broadcast year,

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:19.000
if you can believe it.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And we have done this segment ever since episode one,

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:25.000
because sometimes guys, we just like to bitch.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Oh, this is bad.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Here is justice.

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Here is punishment.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Here is...

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
This is fucked up.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
FUs of the week time.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:47.000
The bird that shat in the middle of my windshield while I was, uh,

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000
going down, uh,

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
the 80.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000
FU birds.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Remember that time we were at Sizzler and some bird.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
First off, that's funny in and of itself.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Remember Sizzler?

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Remember when it almost killed my boyfriend from the food poisoning?

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
But then, just to add insult to injury,

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:11.000
a bird decided to take the biggest shit I've ever seen a bird take.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Right on my windshield.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
We've seen the cars in Davis.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
But no, uh...

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
It's like the bird ate at that Sizzler.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
You know what?

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Well, I mean, the runoff in the back is like...

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
And, and, and, and, and

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:30.000
FU'd in me because I have a present for your and Alan's anniversary.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Shucks.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
That...

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Well, I told you what one of them was already.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:38.000
It's, you know, that sign that's in my house that says Dan and James and they both hate you.

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000
And I made you a typography present that's basically different nerd fonts.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Well, we're, we're trying to move in March,

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
so if nothing else, it'd be how I got a house for you.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Well, I'll, I'll just continue next week.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Yeah, can't wait.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:54.000
Or we'll do dinner lunch prep for lunch.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Appreciate it.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:56.000
Prep for lunch snack.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:57.000
Prep for lunch snack.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.000
All right.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Uh, Loki, your FUs.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Uh, my FU goes to Salty Bev because I just can't pick a winner.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Just can't pick a winner.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Um...

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
I don't know. I'm not super angsty.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.000
Um, FU to, FU to all the construction on this street

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:16.000
that I know is gonna fuck up everything when I go to work tomorrow.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:17.000
And I just, I just...

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Because, you know, tomorrow's the day that everybody goes back.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.000
I went back to work on Thursday, but everybody goes back tomorrow.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
And I'm just not looking forward to the fuckery

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
that is construction on this street at 8 AM.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Happy New Year! Fuck everything!

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Yeah, right?

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
So, I'm not looking forward to that.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Uh, Jason, last but not least.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:34.000
Oof.

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:37.000
FU to sleep schedules, and mine especially.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Um, I don't think I've woken up before, like, 10 AM for...

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:45.000
probably three to four months now.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.000
And I might have to be up at six in, like, three weeks.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
And it's a horrifying thought.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Especially on the week after my team's meetup,

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.000
where there will be lots of late nights.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Late nights, I don't know if libations is the correct word,

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000
but there will definitely be lots of celebrations and ongoing.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
And to have only a weekend to recover,

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
which also includes coming up to Sacramento,

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:11.000
getting back into San Francisco at just a little bit before midnight,

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
and still having to wind down.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Waking up the next day that early is not going to be fun.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
FU sleep.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
I, I...

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
I've got to reset my schedule too.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Alan and I were, like, sleeping until, like, 11.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:25.000
I think one day we slept until noon.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Like, during the...

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Noon!

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Noon!

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I was up at 2 PM today.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Oh my gosh.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.000
And yesterday.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Okay, you win.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:35.000
I mean, I wake up multiple times, but, like, my, my sleep schedule,

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.000
because I don't have a commute, has changed everything,

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
for better or for worse.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:44.000
I, yeah, waking up, I, I didn't, like,

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
I didn't wake up that early to get out here

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
when I took my road trip out to California.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.000
I woke up at, uh, 11, because I wasn't exactly going to prepare

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:59.000
for 12 days of TMI stewing in your own filth on the road for 12 hours.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Um, you know what I mean.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:05.000
You're sitting in one place, you're, you know, going,

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
well, it was kind of cold outside.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:10.000
Anyways, I, yeah.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
As long as you waited until you got to a rest stop,

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
because you make it sound kind of nasty.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:15.000
I was making a sweat comment.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Oh, okay.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:17.000
All right.

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:20.000
Not that you like, you know, you just, I'll just pee.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Not, not rat race on the police officer's car.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Anyways, yeah, I have not woken up early in a long time,

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
and I'm going to have to wake up insanely early

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.000
so that I don't get caught in peninsula San Francisco traffic.

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
It's going to suck.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:42.000
I, I feel your pain, because I have to reset for my hour and a half drive.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:46.000
The, the people, the people in training that actually do, you know,

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.000
have a set schedule.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
You do actually have to be there in the morning.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Yeah.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Yeah, I know that.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Citrus Heights to Elk Grove.

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Yeah.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:56.000
I'm fighting the downtown traffic,

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000
so that's why I'm leaving well before I have to.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Yeah.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Or maybe I just will stop sleeping and live on No Does and Red Bull.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Not that I advocate that, but I've done it before.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
All right.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys,

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
and then we're going to get to your calls at 1877 Game OLR,

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
But don't call yet, because we have two more stories.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Loki.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:28.000
All right, so there's a brand new iOS and Android app that's going to be,

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:32.000
I'm sorry, yeah, it's being made by Yuji Naka,

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000
and it is a game where you photograph whales.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:40.000
A little bit of a change from some of the other games that he's done.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:49.000
It is, I guess, free on iOS with in-app purchases and five bucks on Android.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.000
Is it called Porpoise Snap?

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:58.000
It's called Real Whales.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Yeah.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Slow News Week.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Darcy, did you run to the store to download this now?

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:06.000
No, I'm actually downloading another game that I saw a review for,

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000
but I didn't understand that it was already out, called Dancing Russian Men,

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:15.000
by the guys that do Weebl and Bob.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
The Badger Badger Mushroom Mushroom.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Oh, God, that.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:27.000
And apparently, this game looks like, it plays like Vibraman.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
All right.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Well, one more story for you guys,

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
and this will make some of our listeners very happy to hear about this,

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:38.000
because I know some of you out there really love your My Little Pony.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
Rama, hi.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Where's Rama? Where's that guy?

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.000
Hi, Acta.

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Where are my bronies at?

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Put your hooves up.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Rob, by the way.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:46.000
All right, what?

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I actually watched some.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.000
Did you?

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.000
And I didn't hate it.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
You know what? I can't hate.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
I've never watched it, but I just want to point out-

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000
It was actually kind of funny.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:57.000
I don't smoke weed either, but I don't have a problem with people that do.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Anyway, my real point.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Main Six is the group that made the My Little Pony fighting game.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.000
My Little Pony fighting is magic, which, what happened?

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:09.000
This whole thing went back and forth.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Didn't they get cease and desisted, but then they came back,

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000
and it was like, oh, the creator will make other things for you,

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
but it can't actually be a My Little Pony fighting game.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
So, anyway.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Well, they have an engine they want to put to use,

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:24.000
but to be a pony-based game has first shut down.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Okay, so I guess here's the latest with that game.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:32.000
With that game, the group went to their blog, which is at mainsix.com,

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:36.000
and they actually said they're going to launch a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000
They haven't chosen what.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.000
At some point early this year when the game development will really kick off,

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.000
and of course the game will use the Z engine,

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
which Skullgirls use the same engine and so forth,

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:51.000
and some of the- actually, it sounds like all of the characters in the game

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
will be created by Lauren Faust,

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:56.000
who made the My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic TV show,

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
and all those characters.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:03.000
And obviously My Little Pony, they do conventions and shit for this,

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:07.000
so I don't see any way that they won't make their funding.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.000
The sky's the limit for this thing, so there you go.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:14.000
We're trying to raise $420,000 to make this happen.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
No, I don't know what the amount is.

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
All right.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
Anyhow, so there it is.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
That is that.

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:23.000
That's it.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Let's open up the Skype line, you guys.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:29.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:30.000
That's all one word.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:34.000
Now, I'm trying the new thing with the Skype line that we started last week,

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.000
so I'm hoping it works okay.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
But we'll see.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Your call's hopefully coming in very soon, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:48.000
Oh, we are getting a call, so let's go to the phones and take that call,

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
and let's get to it.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Who's this?

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Hey, this is Def.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Oh, my God, video.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Are you just saying that because last week I ragged you because you called in

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
and you didn't even say anything about the new video

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
we had going during the calls?

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Yeah, kind of.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
My first thought when I saw the video was,

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:10.000
oh, my God, I got to set my video so you can see me too.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:11.000
There we go.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000
And forgot about telling or at least saying something, but okay.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:18.000
Which makes for great radio when we talk about all this video.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:21.000
But seriously, though, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:29.000
Well, I was going to mention a mini-review of a game you talked about

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
or at least received in a Twitter topic.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Yeah?

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
That is Bike Rider DX.

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Don't know if any of you got it or buy it.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:41.000
The very last, one of the last news articles from last week

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
about it being the most downloaded game in Japan,

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
that said it looks trials-like on the 3DS.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:50.000
You know, I will say this, that tweet that Aaron sent us,

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
YYRC, oh, maybe I shouldn't have said his real name, sorry,

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000
but the tweet that he sent us actually got retweeted

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
by the people that made that game.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
And, like, yeah, I was getting the emails on that, like,

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
because, you know, a tweet you were mentioned in was retweeted.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:05.000
And so, yeah, that was kind of, I thought that was really cool

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
that his tweet got acknowledged.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
So you actually downloaded the game and checked it out.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Yeah, I had some extra money on the eShop, so I got it.

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:18.000
And it's a pretty fun game.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Not that challenging and not that different all around.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000
It's basically the same game throughout all the levels.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:31.000
It gets kind of difficult later on, but not that much challenging.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
It's a pretty simple game.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.000
But it's really fun.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
For the $3, it's worth it.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I think it's a must-buy for the 3DS.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
There you go.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
And it has really great music, too.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000
The value is all there.

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:47.000
And so this is something you can get on the North American.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:48.000
Because that was one thing.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
When I saw that, I was like, oh, but I can't get the Japanese.

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
But it is available in the North American store.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:53.000
It is.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:56.000
I don't remember if I linked it in the description of last week's YouTube video

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:01.000
because YouTube doesn't let you link to any arbitrary URL and annotations.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.000
But I'll double check and make sure that it's in the episode description.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
More YouTube fuckery. Get out.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000
No, I can see.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:11.000
There's a lot of dumb shit on those YouTube annotations.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Yeah, it sucks. Anyway.

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.000
Well, like I was saying, it's a pretty fun game.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:25.000
So if you have $3 to spare for the eShop, it's a pretty fun, simple game.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I got it on Friday.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
I almost beat it all.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000
It's, I think, 15 levels.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:37.000
And each level has five different stages.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:41.000
And I have almost beaten it.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:42.000
That's right.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I have like two different levels missing.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:51.000
And there's also Grand Prix mode that it's like an endless mode.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:56.000
And that's pretty much where the replayability comes into play.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Because it's endless and you have many obstacles to dodge

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:03.000
and all that stuff that makes the game fun.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
All right. I think you've got me pretty convinced.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
I've got some Nintendo stuff to check out.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.000
I have to check out that.

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
And I have to check out Dr. Luigi, which came out this week.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
And I have yet to play that either.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
I forgot that that game was coming out.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
But yeah, that came out the past couple days.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:20.000
So I noticed, just before I let you go, I noticed the story that I just did.

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
Because I know you're a brony.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Where's your hooves at?

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
I actually have my brony sister going on.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
Of course you do.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Now, you tweeted us that story right before I read it.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
This is just a funny coincidence.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
The fighting is magic, Mane6.

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Are you looking forward to this?

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:41.000
Is there something you'd like to add or clarify on what I talked about?

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:47.000
Well, if people know me and have listened to OR before

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.000
and listened to my calls and everything like that,

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:55.000
yeah, I'm pretty excited about this.

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:00.000
And I even tweeted to Mane6 that they have my full support.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:03.000
And they tweeted me back, thanks.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:07.000
And hopefully, and like I was saying last week,

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:12.000
hopefully their game is going to be popular and it's going to get a lot of support,

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
especially because of the bronies, the bronies.

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.000
The bronies are a force to be reckoned with.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:20.000
They will get that game funded, I know it.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Yeah.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
Alright. Well, act after I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Thanks so much for the call.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Thank you for having me.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
You're welcome. Good to see you.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:31.000
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Bye.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Ah, that's fun.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word,

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.000
if you'd like to give us a call.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
Did you notice his microphone?

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.000
No, I didn't.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.000
It was a handheld K-Rev rock band microphone.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Oh, was it K-Rev?

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.000
I thought it was a rock band.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
That style, meaning it wasn't like a headset,

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:54.000
but it was a, I love the fact that those things are dual purpose like that.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Like a USB mic type of thing.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Just handheld like us.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Alright.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:01.000
While I wait for some more calls to come in, if anybody else is going to call in again,

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
that's 187, you don't have to send us a video.

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
If you're shy, that's fine.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:08.000
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
if you want to give us a call and talk about whatever.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Call us.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Loki, do you have last minute stories you want to talk about?

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Real quick, I was going to mention that Nintendo has apparently lost a patent lawsuit,

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:26.000
and it was against a company called Tomita.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:33.000
And this is for a patent for, I guess, some of the camera technology that's used in the 3DS.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:38.000
They now have to pay 1.82% of the wholesale price on every 3DS sold.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:42.000
Alright, we got another call coming in here, so let's go to it.

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:43.000
We're going to go to the phones.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Hey, Kaijuto, how you doing?

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
I'm alright.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
I just want to give you guys some quick advice.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:55.000
You guys were talking about the, well, what the hell do you call it?

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:59.000
The maiden name, what the hell is that called again?

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:04.000
When you forget your password.

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Oh, the what?

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
I forgot, what is it again?

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:12.000
The porn name game?

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:13.000
I totally forgot, I'm drawing a blank.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:14.000
What is it called?

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000
The porn name game?

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
No, not the porn name.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
You know, when, yeah, your security question.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Oh.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Yeah, okay, that thing.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Did anybody ever stop to think that you don't actually have to put any type of name, you

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000
could just put like a series of just like random letters and numbers and codes like

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:32.000
a password, that's what I do.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:33.000
You really could.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:38.000
I never put like maiden names or street addresses or anything like that, I'm like, they don't,

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
you know, you don't need to put that in there.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.000
I would be afraid that I would lose that, like that I would put in like the dummy information,

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.000
I would lose that, but if I had like an ultra safe way to keep that information, I think

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:49.000
that's a brilliant idea.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Like the whole, like my made up story about me.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
This is the fake street I grew up on.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:58.000
This is my mom's fake maiden name and just like going down the list, I think would be

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:02.000
actually like a pretty brilliant thing just as long as, see, my forgetful ass would lose

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.000
it, wouldn't it, Jason?

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000
Yeah, like I wouldn't, yeah, like I wouldn't recommend it for like, you know, like any

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:14.000
type of credit card account, like nothing major like that, but like for video games.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:20.000
What I do is, is after I have the questions in, I take a screenshot and I print that out

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000
and I just put that in with the game, you know, like it's a PC game, you know, and I

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000
have all my questions there with all my random letters and numbers.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:28.000
That's smart.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:29.000
That's how I do it.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
You know, and I suppose I should say that at some point too, because I've heard of these

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.000
applications and Jason, you're, you're, you're a bigger nerd than me when it comes to stuff

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:35.000
like this.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Surely you've heard of this stuff before.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.000
There's these applications out there that a lot, like it's like a wallet type of thing,

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.000
like that you store on your drive where it's like one password, but that one password generally

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:48.000
one password generates other passwords for whatever sites that is actually a prominent

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
name of one of those applications called one password.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.000
Oh, there you go.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
I just gave somebody a free plug.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:54.000
There you go.

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:57.000
They have agile, agile bits, I believe is the company that produces one password.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:02.000
I think I have a friend that works for one of those companies, but it's on mobile.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Um, the only the I've heard of a lot of them, you know, they're, they've been a dime a dozen

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:10.000
for years and years, and unfortunately some of them masquerade as the problems themselves

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:11.000
malware.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000
That's scary.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:17.000
Um, but the big two that I hear about constantly are one password and last pass.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
I, okay.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Yeah, I don't, I don't necessarily trust those.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Like, uh, you know, I just rounded have, I don't know.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:28.000
I'm the type of person I'd like to have different passwords for everything.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:31.000
You know, I'm just all over the place and I try to keep track of them.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:35.000
I usually forget them and I always have to go back and like reset them, but I'm like,

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:36.000
I don't care.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:39.000
I think it's a great idea and uh, I don't blame you whatsoever.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:44.000
And I, I think, I think this is good to talk about ID alternatives and, and all these

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:48.000
things that people can do to, to make sure that their accounts stay safe, uh, quickly

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:51.000
because, you know, before I let you go, what else have you been playing lately?

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.000
What games you've been into?

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Uh, I've been playing everything.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:57.000
I was wanting to mention to you guys, um, there's a game that I started.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:01.000
It's um, it's kinda like, I hate the game Terraria, but I can only compare it to Terraria.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:06.000
I actually don't like that game, but, um, it's a game called Starbound, which has a

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:07.000
lot of potential to it.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:10.000
It's one of the, um, what the hell do you call it?

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:13.000
The steam early access things.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:14.000
And it's pretty much almost done.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
It's like in beta mode right now.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
And, um, you start off in the spaceship.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.000
It's, it's 2D.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:23.000
It's basically, it's Minecraft and 2D, but you're like flying through space and there's

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
like all these different planets that you can travel to.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Some of them have life in it.

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Some of the life is hostile.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Some of the life is friendly.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:33.000
It's a really cool game, but, um, it gets a little hard and you get a little burned

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:34.000
out on it.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:38.000
And because it's an early access, there's a, you know, there's a few, like, um, a few

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:42.000
times it'll like crash on you to do like weird stuff, but, um, it definitely looks like it

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:43.000
has a lot of potential.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:47.000
I hope, I hope that they able to like implement everything that they, uh, that they're talking

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:48.000
about here.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Cause they're talking about space battle.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:53.000
They're talking about, you know, they, they're thinking big with this game and I'm just like,

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:57.000
I hope they can pull that off because, uh, there was an app that I was really excited

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
about called Star Command.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:00.000
You guys heard about that game?

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Well, Star Command, uh, real short is it was an app where, you know, these guys are like,

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
oh, we're going to make this thing like Star Trek.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:08.000
We're going to have diplomacy.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:12.000
You're going to be able to like travel to different planets and you know, basically

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
you're going to live out your life as a Starship captain.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:18.000
You know, you're going to like go to planets and interact with people and you know, just

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
like Starbound, some of them are going to be friendly.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Some of them are going to be mean.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:27.000
And, um, they got about 35% of that game done and they decided to release it.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
You know, it's good.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:30.000
I got it.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
I just got to say, I wasn't super into Terraria either.

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:33.000
I can, I, I'm not knocking the game.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:34.000
I see why people are into it.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:38.000
I just couldn't really get into it myself, but Minecraft took me a while to, to wise

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
up to, but I love the idea of a 2d Minecraft.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
So I'm going to have to check this game out myself.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.000
It looks pretty cool.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Yeah.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:48.000
One of the things I noticed real quickly, you might be like me and what, what I hate

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:52.000
about Terraria and what I love about Minecraft is there's slow down points in Minecraft and

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Terraria is just all this hectic shit and you're constantly jumping over shit and shit

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:57.000
is coming after you.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:58.000
And that drives me crazy.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:03.000
That's one of the reasons why I didn't like, um, comparing, uh, what the hell is that game

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
with the, uh, it came out for, I think it came out for Xbox.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:09.000
I think it was like, um, where you were like an alien and you were fighting the military.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
It's supposed to be like open world.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
You know what I'm talking about?

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Where like you, you morphed into different guys.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:16.000
Like you can take their body.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Are you thinking of Destroy All Humans?

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000
What is it called?

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Destroy All Humans?

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:21.000
No, no.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:25.000
It was, it came out at the same time as a Sony superhero game.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:32.000
Where you have like the electricity, somebody came out, you know, I noticed about that game,

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.000
uh, the two differences again between prototype is the slow down point.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000
You know, when you get older as a gamer, you kind of appreciate those slow down moments.

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.000
You know, you don't want to Loki's thinking the game was prototype.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:44.000
That's it.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.000
Yeah.

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Prototype prototype was just constant.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
They're just constantly shooting at you.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
There's no break point, you know?

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Gotcha.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:52.000
And that's what I hate about Terraria.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:53.000
And that's all.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:54.000
All right.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Thank you so much for the call.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:56.000
You take care.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Okay.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Thanks for the tip on the game.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:01.000
All right.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.000
That is going to do it for the Skype line because Dark Soccer, you got a thing that

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:06.000
you got to go, right?

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:07.000
So we got to wrap up the show.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Yeah.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:11.000
My husband and I were supposed to have a date after the show and I was going to text him

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:12.000
when we were done.

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Oops.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
And he's like, um, I'm already at Cheesecake Factory.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Oops.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:17.000
So.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:18.000
All right.

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Well now if you want to meet Jamie after the show, you know where to go.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Yeah.

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:21.000
And I'm not paying for you guys.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000
So there you go.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:24.000
I didn't say which Cheesecake Factory.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.000
There you go.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:26.000
That's right.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:27.000
There's a ton in the world.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:28.000
All right.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Quickly, quickly.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:32.000
I just want to do some tweets here before we wrap up and Jamie don't leave because I

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
have something I got to give you two.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Um, let's see.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Uh, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Um, I know I saw our old pal who was on the show a while ago.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Oscar had tweeted and said, I'm currently tuned into OLR and that just reminded me to

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:50.000
say, I think I might've mentioned this a couple of weeks ago, but in case I didn't Oscar

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
is on season two of King of the nerds.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:57.000
So not only was she on the Sony reality show, now she's on the TBS reality show.

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Very happy for her.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:55:59.000
Best of luck to her.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:00.000
She's so fun.

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Yeah, she's fun.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
And uh, she's, she's a member of the OL army.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:06.000
So if you don't know who to root for on this show, now you do.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:07.000
Cause we endorse her.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
An act of bullshit.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:10.000
What?

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
I am not paying for you at the Cheesecake Factory.

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
Oh, I'm not, I'll put it this way.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
I'm not even paying for me.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:17.000
I have a gift card.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:18.000
She's washing dishes.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Okay.

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Uh, I want to give this shout out, a tweet, a shout out to a pod culture saying, uh, saw

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:28.000
something at a Kmart that they were pushing for the new consoles.

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:32.000
And my first reaction was there's a Kmart still open somewhere.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
No, they're on the corner from my house.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:35.000
I know they're here.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Well, you know, the one right over here on sunrise closed now.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:41.000
So, but, uh, yeah, let's see.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:45.000
It's a rent to own program, I guess is something that Kmart is starting.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.000
And this is something that you could do for the new consoles if you want.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.000
So they're being ghetto, like Renison or pass, I guess.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
But you know what, Hey, you know what?

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
I just see it as there.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:59.000
They got to do something that target and Walmart aren't doing because what they're doing right

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:00.000
now isn't working.

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:03.000
So, well, they are doing something that target and Walmart aren't doing.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:04.000
They're failing.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:07.000
Unfortunately, there've been a lot of programs like this that I've been seeing lately.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
There was one from Best Buy recently.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:13.000
There was basically like, you know, pay a little bit and be able to upgrade early.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:18.000
It all revolved around tablets and mobile phones, smartphones, and probably TVs and

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.000
whatnot as well.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
These programs are all bullshit.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:27.000
And don't, don't do the research, find out how much money you're going to spend.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Weigh that against what you can be smart with your money.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:35.000
The problem with rent to own like that too, is that you have to deal with investing in

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
repo people and people don't pay.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
Ooh, what a mess.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:40.000
All right.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:41.000
We are going to wrap things up and get final thoughts.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
I do have one other thing I got to get out here, Dark Sakura.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Fist?

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Yes.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:46.000
I'm going to punch you with it.

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:47.000
No.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Uh, this is, um, something that apparently you had expressed a desire in having.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:55.000
And so, um, our friend of the show who was here about a year ago, Tim, Tim trip, wanted

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
me to pass this on to you.

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:58.000
Awesome.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.000
I just opened it.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
There's a DS cart in there.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:02.000
It's my Japanese coach.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000
There you go.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Cause I've been wanting to practice.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Yeah.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:06.000
The only thing.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
And of course my forgetful ass forgot to give it to her.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:09.000
So.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Thank you, Tim.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:11.000
It's interesting.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:12.000
Cause he texted me going, did you give her that game?

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Thank you, Tim.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:14.000
All right.

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:15.000
So there you go.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:16.000
Thanks.

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:17.000
We need to hang out again soon.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:18.000
All right.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:21.000
Now we got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:22.000
Uh, Loki.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:25.000
Uh, thank you for being here tonight and good luck with everything.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Especially if the baby should arrive this week.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Best of luck to you.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Oh yeah.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:30.000
I'll need it.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:31.000
All right.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Sounds good.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Uh, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.000
Go play the Minecraft server.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.000
That's right.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:37.000
Go play the Minecraft server.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
We have two people already on there right now.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
I'm spying on them.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:42.000
You're spying on them.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.000
That's awesome.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
Uh, my final thought, I have two final thoughts tonight.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
My first final thought is don't fuck with my house.

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
My second in Minecraft.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Well, in real life too.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:51.000
You shouldn't do that.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Don't fuck with my Normandy.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Just, yeah.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Don't, don't fuck with me in general.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:00.000
And my number two final thought is, uh, I need more people to play Path of Exile with.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:01.000
So, uh, if you want to go.

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:02.000
It's Windows only.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:03.000
I wanted to try it out.

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:04.000
Ah, bummer.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:05.000
I didn't realize that.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.000
And it's free to play.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:07.000
It's free to play.

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:11.000
So if you want to come play a roguelike and crawl some dungeons with me, uh, let's, let's

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:12.000
play that.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:13.000
Uh, hit me up on Twitter.

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:14.000
Hit me up on my Twitter.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Uh, Jason, thank you for being here as always.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Always.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:19.000
You, you the best.

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:20.000
I the best.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:21.000
You the best.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:22.000
You are.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:23.000
You really are.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Uh, your final thought for our listeners tonight.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:26.000
Be safe people.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:29.000
New year, new, uh, new wonderment and also new problems.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
So be safe and play it smart out there.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Alright.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:37.000
And, uh, lastly, but not leastly, uh, heading out to the cheesecake factory, which she'll

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:40.000
be signing autographs from 10 to 11 tonight.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
Uh, two things.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:46.000
One, I think it's hilarious that Shane just joined the chat room.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
And number two, why is that hilarious?

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:49.000
He does listen to the show.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
Well, yeah, but we're about to end the show.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:52.000
Oh, cause we're ending the show.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:55.000
No, he came in to send me a private message yelling at me about something.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:56.000
That's usually how it goes.

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:59.000
Number two, I'm having cheesecake.

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Sakura out.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
Alright, that does it for another episode of orange launch radio.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show.

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:10.000
If you liked what you heard over the past few hours, don't forget guys support independent radio.

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:13.000
Um, we need, we need your help.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:17.000
Word of mouth is all we've got because I'll tell you what, the major podcast award shows

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:23.000
out there, they ain't doing shit for us cause it's always some big show that's got tons

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:27.000
of advertising bucks and websites with millions of visitors.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
They, they sweep everything.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:33.000
So we should start our own award series called Indies rule.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:34.000
Exactly.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Or you know, if you get more than like 10 bucks of support from any or like more than

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:44.000
a certain amount of support from a major facility, then you're disqualified.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.000
Just just spread the word about your favorite indie show.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Be it us, be it, you know, some other, be it Bobby black Wolf show or pod culture, maybe

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.000
another show on bug, maybe another show on another network, maybe, maybe radio PlayStation

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
who sent us a tweet tonight.

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
My favorite show is anime jam session.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:05.000
So go spread the love about your favorite independent broadcasting and uh, you know

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:10.000
what, if you think you want to do this yourself someday, I don't see you as competition.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
I see you as a friend.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:13.000
Let's help you podcast.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Get your word out there.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Have, have your voice and uh, just don't be a dick about it.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Don't fucking swat people.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:21.000
Don't eat my cheesecake.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
And don't eat my cheesecake.

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:24.000
Good night everybody.
