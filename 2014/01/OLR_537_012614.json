{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, the news is exciting as it ever is. However, we'd like to take this moment to send our congratulations to Loki, along with Miss Loki and Baby Loki, on the arrival of newest Baby Loki this week. Congratulations! And now, on with the show. Orange Lounge Radio That's right. Congratulations. This story is happy. Yay! Congratulations! Voice makers, confetti. Hooray for genetics. Celebration. Hey, welcome back everybody. My internet friends and everybody out there. Tune in to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. It is the show where every gamer has a voice. My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host. Say hello, of course, to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. Blarg. How are you doing? Blarg! Blarg. That was a very happy kind of blarg. Yes, it was. Yeah. I'm okay. I'm just tired. I know you have been settling in at Cool New Job, and things are going very coolly. Since I am not going to be telling anybody where I work. It's fine. I don't either. I've decided that it is called Cool Job. Cool Job. And that I really like Cool Job. I'll call mine Fun Job, and you can have Cool Job. You have Fun Job, I have Cool Job. Alright. But, but, but, but... Jason can have Hand Job. Hahaha. Alright. But, but I have to say... Wow! Oh hey, Jason. How you doing? Wow! I... No, your job's really cool, though, too. I just have to say one little thing, though. I have been walking around in my N7 hoodie, and have been called Shepherd no less than eight times during the last week. They get it. That's a good sign of a good workplace. Yes, it is. That's a good sign. Hey, Jason. How you doing? Hi. I mean, I shouldn't be averse to that, because that falls in line with the trend of things that are at least mildly pleasant. One would hope. A hand job is a very good thing. So, you know what? It's okay. I couldn't think of any other insert, insert here job. Oh wow. And Dark Soccer's doing the hand jive. I'm doing the hand jive because, like, what was that? A happy ending massage video. Hahaha. Oh god, that's a great YouTube. Alright, anyway. I smell a future fortune cookie. Perhaps, perhaps. That one is so visual that it doesn't work, so. Voice of the show, Jason, back here for another week. Hello. Celebrating wintertime, which, welcome to California winter, by the way, where it hasn't rained for 45 days. I was here for the brunt of it. I talked about the miserably cold, like, second week of December, and in the Bay Area, it is getting much nicer, though. It's been nominal all week, and will continue to be. But we are going to have you at least one more week, right? We're going to have you next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday? I... actually don't know. Alright. I don't know, I literally have no idea what's going to happen next week because I have been... We did talk hand skin ball last week, and that is still the... Hahahaha. Maybe your job is hand job. Hahahaha. You didn't even, you didn't even tell that to be funny. I can't even pick the right words to make that even remotely better anymore. You know what, just ignore my comments. Ignore my comments. Pig skin ball. Hand ball. Egg ball. These words are not making face. I'd just call it wank ball and be done with it. Alright. I do intend to be part of some of a Super Bowl party with some friends next week. I don't know when it will start, if I'll duck out at the half. I have no idea what my specific plans are. We will play it by ear, like we usually do. Like I usually do, anyways. Well, we will be having a Puppy Bowl party next week. I'll go ahead and say, I was going to tease this during the segment later where we talk about the plugs and stuff, but I will be saying, live in studio on Orange Lawn Tradio for the first time in several years. It's probably been about five years since we've had this guy on Orange Lawn Tradio. Many of you know him, however, from his time on Hoard House. Shane will be here live next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday. So that's going to be a fun show. Or as Shane would say, whatever. You know what, I know we're calling it Puppy Bowl Sunday, but my usual nickname for the bigger event that day is going to be... Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There is no bigger event than where Keyboard Cat plays halftime. For the more nationally accepted event... Fine. Could possibly be accurate. The Super Bowl. The Super Bowl. The Super Bowl. The Super Bowl. All right. So anyway, we do need to say, of course, Tech Master Loki, not here in studio tonight. As you probably guessed, he has the night off because... He better be rubbing his wife's feet. Because Mrs. Loki did deliver the child on Tuesday. So congratulations to Loki and Mrs. Loki on the newest addition to their family. And I can tell you the name. The name is... They named their child because remember he was teasing. It had a video game reference in it. So they named their child Daniel Layton. That's right. The kid's name is Professor Layton, which is kind of awesome. You know what my husband said? Huh? Good name. I know, good name, right? Because I married a Dan. Well, you and Dan have talked about when that day inevitably comes. I don't know if you're still like serious about this or not, but... It's probably not bloody likely. You were tossed around the idea of Richter as a name, right? At some point? Yeah, and then we've decided that if we had a girl we'd go after a name each for one of our grandmothers. And then a name each for one of our uncles. Ah. Because we are very proud of our uncles and he does not want a Daniel Peter 3.0. I see. That's fine. Because Dan's a junior. Ah, okay. So half the family calls him Pete. Okay. Because his dad is Dan. But not me. Professor Layton, they're setting him up for a lifetime of a student loan debt. I think... right. I should, just to clarify, they do spell Layton a little differently. L-A-I-G-H. No, I think there's an E in it in 7A or something like that. And so I don't think they actually named it off the video game character. I think it's just one of those things. Well, yeah, they don't want their son to get sued for copyright. I mean... Yeah, we'll talk about that later. I'm pretty sure Mrs. Loki probably said, what about this name? And then Loki probably went, yes, yes, that name will work. I do have to say though, and I've made this observation just as a Jewish convert, that while Mrs. Loki is not super observant, all of her children have had Jewish names. Yeah. So I have... that has not gone unnoticed. So there you go. And they sound like normal names to me. So two ways. I do not know when Loki will be back. He can take as much time off as he needs, and I'm sure we all understand. So that's that. We'll miss him, but we're all thinking about him and his growing families. That's amazing. Anyhow... Nellie, I'm sorry, is gonna be... Go ahead, quickly. Is gonna be... tired. Yeah, well... Like I said... They all are. He better be rubbing her feet. They are all gonna be tired. He better be getting her whatever she wants, and he better be waking up a baby. So anyway, let's talk about our growing family. You guys in our chat room, the always present other panelists on the show. Live.vognetwork.com is where we tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And if you do happen to be listening to this show live, head on over to our chat. Again, that's live.vognetwork.com. And you may get your comments right on air. Sometimes epic debates on this program have started from a simple chat comment. So bring it, y'all. Go into our chat room. We'll let Locopoco start us off, commenting on the name. Daniel Layton. Locopoco says, you must solve this puzzle or else you get no dinner. That's cruel, but funny. Alright, Raginator says, so no tingle Layton then. I think Loki was going to stay far away from the name Tingle, that's for sure. Some folks talking about the Super Bowl, and Brad from Pod Culture reminding us it's going to be the Weed Bowl. And Rama's saying it's the Smoke-A-Bowl. I call it the, I don't give a shit bowl, how about that? I just, yeah. You know what, we've got our thing, video games, some other folks have their thing, football. Some people have both, which is cool. If next Sunday's a big deal for you, have fun with it. You know, just be safe, drink in moderation, don't drink and drive, all that stuff. Have fun with it. We'll still be here doing our thing though. So I did not finish last week's video because I was quite sick and quite busy this week. Fired! But, how have I never heard of Super High Impact before? What? You hadn't heard of that before? I have never played, seen, heard of it before, and I looked up footage for use in the video. And I just lost, pleasantly lost 30 minutes of my life watching the game being played. It's the game that growls at you. It was the most ridiculous, greatly ridiculous thing I've ever seen. Yeah, it's a fun game, isn't it? That's the only football game that we had at my house for the longest time, was Super High Impact. It was the other one for me, Tecmo Bowl, was the only one I could, you know. I think it may have been, just based off the name, I was maybe averse to it for like, fighting game reasons or something like that. But, I've played a lot of one-offs in my life, I've played a lot of alternative sports games in my life, missed that one somehow. I will be correcting this sometime soon. It actually was pretty fun, I mean, my brothers and I would play it. And I just liked that it would growl at you every time you picked a play. You'd go, grrrr, make that noise. So, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight. We have several, actually, tonight, because I kind of hit a creative block tonight when I was trying to put together the show role. I was like, what are we going to talk about for the kickoff topic tonight? So, I did what I sometimes do when I hit a creative block and I crowdsourced. I went to my Twitter feed and I said, guys, you must be a social media expert. Apparently, right? I went to my social media feed, I went to my Twitter and I said, hey guys, what should we do for a kickoff topic tonight? And so, I got a few answers and I got some really good stuff. And so, I want to just quickly, I don't want to have any long 45 minute kickoff topics like we had last week, right, Jason? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, funny enough, my buddy Ian, or AtariBarbie on Twitter, actually said, Nintendo financials. And I said, you should probably go to last week's show, buddy. Thanks, though. But I understand. It's a three hour show. He's probably behind. But AtariBarbie sent me another one that I thought was a really good kickoff topic. So, let me start with this one. So, quickly, asking everybody here in the room, what does game of the year mean? You know, this is January. You've got a lot of podcasts, a lot of media outlets catching up on there. What was my 2013 game of the year? And, you know, and I even talked about this a little bit on last week's show because I said, damn it. You know, I mentioned my top five games of the year in the last show of December. But then I played Guacamelee. And I was like, you know what, Guacamelee, whatever. That really should have been, wait, didn't we find out that in Spanish, I'm pronouncing it right, anyway. I played that game and it was like, shouldn't that have been one of my top five? It very well probably should have been. I probably actually would rank that higher than Spelunky at this point. So, although Spelunky is very good too, but my point is, you know, these things change. So, what does game of the year really mean? What does it mean when, I don't know, IGN does their big game of the year or, you know, Koopa Club podcast, which Ian is a part of, does their game of the year? What does game of the year really mean? Game of the year means to me that it has that sort of association for fond memories. It's something that you'll come back to actively or passively. If you're in the mood for it, great. If you're just looking for something to do and it seems to kind of, you know, fill that need for being able to take in artistic or otherwise meaningful detail, that you'll go back to it for that. As we said in our top three, it does not just have to be this year. It just has to be something that you played in this year. And with the ever-growing size of libraries, you can miss things. Like, I just found out that I missed something for two decades running. It's a game that resonates with you in whatever way that's meaningful to you. It's as simple as that. I really think that, you know, game of the year, and we kind of talked about this disclaimer before we did ours, it's really, there's no right or wrong answer, clearly. It's whatever game to you had the biggest impact on you for that year. Or, you know, the game that you look back and you say, dang it, that was my best gaming experience. And everything I did the entire year, that game frickin' just smacked me with a two-by-four, either with emotion, with beauty, with gameplay, replayability, whatever it is. So mine would be Mass Effect every year? Possibly, honestly. When you look back on 2013, what video game are you going to say, man, that game defined 2013 for me. That was a great year for gaming. That was practically all I played was fractal. Is that a bad thing? No. Just because she didn't go with the artistic choice of Gone Home? Or she didn't go with the mainstream choice of The Last of Us? Well, I think I picked Stanley Parable as one of my games because it made me giggle. But here's the thing, when you're talking to you as an individual versus, you know, you've got, I know Polygon did their list and had some interesting feedback because they chose to name Gone Home their top game of the year, for better or for worse. Or GameSpot, which I believe also named Zelda, Link Between Worlds, just like I did as my game of the year. When you have an organization, it's a little bit different because now that list represents your company, your organization. It's part of your branding. Yeah, it's part of your branding. It really is. It's part of your editorial and so forth. And I'm going to take, look, I'm going to take a lot of shit for what I'm about to say, but I'm just going to tell it like it is. This is honest, Rob. I'm just going to tell it like it is. Polygon's choice of Gone Home as game of the year makes a lot of sense for that organization because both those things are kind of, well, you know. Quirky, quirky. Yeah, all right, yeah. You know where I'm going with this, right? A little bit, you know, whereas, you know, you got something a little more mainstream like GameSpot, you know, picks a little bit more of a mainstream choice or whatever. You know, it's just, it kind of does match the branding of the organization in some ways. So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com. Black Wolf says, I remember getting crap from a listener because of what I chose as my game of the year did not move the industry forward in quotes. Yeah, but Black Wolf, you are your show. You have every right to whatever the hell you want to pick as your game of the year and nobody can really refute that. That is your game of the year. That's my opinion anyway. Well, because it is an opinion and opinions aren't wrong per se. It's opinions are something based from feeling which actually can't be necessarily quantified. So he's right to pick whatever he wants. Black Wolf in chat says, I liked Gone Home and I also like Polygon. Don't get me wrong, I like both those things too. Gone Home was a great experience. Not my game of the year necessarily, but that's just because there were so many great games last year. That doesn't mean Gone Home was not a great experience. It was. And I gave it a positive review and I talked about it the first time. It's just the, it's kind of come to be accepted as the, how do we say it, pretentious choice? I mean, I'm sorry to the developers of the game that worked very hard on it, I'm sure. But I'm just saying it kind of has that reputation right now of being the pretentious choice. So, you know, it makes sense that a pretentious news organization. Anyway, let's see. I'm just telling it like it is tonight. I've been sick all week. I don't care. Well, Biologist calls him like a season. Locopoco says, my game of the year of 2013 was Killer Instinct and not The Last of Us. Why? Because Killer Instinct is the type of game I love most and The Last of Us just doesn't. It's just personal preference. And you know what? If you're a fighting game fan, I fully expect that a game like Killer Instinct would top your list. That game is gorgeous. Right? Like from, you know, I, I don't think I still have my Killer Instinct cart, but for the fighting games that I got in, that I actually got into, Killer Instinct ranks up there. I was never particularly any good at it, but I still have concrete memories about it that I know exactly what the game was, how it played, what it looks like. Not so much the N64 because I never owned one, a little bit maybe, but the SNES and the arcade versions 100%. Booting it up on the Xbox One blew me away. It was, you know, I, just knowing the progression of fighting games. The fact that Street Fighter IV went in a slightly different direction where Tekken and, holy crap, what's the other fighting game series? Um... Soulcalibur? No, there's an, uh, something, something alongside Tekken that's been frequently updated. I want to say King of Fighters. Yeah, the King of Fighters series has been. It's very obvious I'm missing it, but like, as many fighting games with a continued series that have come out and have been more realistic and more realistic. Street Fighter went more exaggerated and cartoony. Fucking unbelievable. I'm thinking Virtua Fighter. Mortal Kombat and Injustice is what I'm thinking of. Um, um, and so as all those games got more realistic and, and I want to say dark, but you know, just these, just these really serious tones. Street Fighter went super cartoony and then Killer Instinct with all of these fake creatures still has so much depth and detail that is 100% gorgeous. Um, shifting to another topic here, Kaishudo in chat says, my game of the year is Grand Theft Auto 5. You know, I believe that was Loki's pick for game of the year. And believe? Right. And we all kind of sat here and went, duh, we could have, we could have named Loki's top three because his top three was what? Like Saints Row 4, uh, Grand Theft Auto 5. I mean, it was the, the, the Loki games you would expect, right? Absolutely. Just like the fighting game fans, you know, are going to pick and so on and so on. So anyway, a pinball fan probably really enjoyed a pinball arcade, you know, whatever. Anyway, good topic. And thank you. And everybody should listen to Koopa Club. It's a fun, fun show. By the way, I should have also added the Metallica pinball table to my list. I didn't realize there was a Metallica pinball table. It's kind of rad. Yeah, they had it at, um, uh, California extreme last year. Awesome. Had a big thing for it. It was actually really cool. Let me do a quick, uh, suggestion that came from, I love this username on Twitter. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-T. But the username says John. So I'll, I'll say John. John said, yeah, for Pokemon games, how come they don't have the Pokemon talk like in the show instead of the horrific chiptune growls? Well, maybe I should roll that question over to next week when Shane's here because Shane's a Pokemon expert. He'll, he'll be able to answer all that. But I, my understanding, it's just limitations of the hardware because you have to remember that series dates back to the original Game Boy. And that really, you couldn't do voice for 150 characters in the Game Boy. Well, and the fact, and I think I had covered it when I did Pokemon as classic game. Hint, hint. That, um, it was actually a big thing that he got the growling noises to go out by, um, using the, uh, the midi processor to have them make any of those. Yeah. That's the other thing about that series is that with all of the core games being on portables on, you know, non optical media, it's kind of at a disadvantage for storage space. So to fit the entirety of the world, the entirety of the textures, the entirety of the items, all of the other data that goes into making up those games. They, and not to mention relying on, um, synthesizers, synthesizers instead of samplers or mixing those up. Uh, the, the limitations and the capacity is not exactly at a premium in the Nintendo mobile world. Uh, I will say Pokemon XY though does have the actual Pikachu saying Pikachu, which is the most recognizable one from the cartoon series, obviously. I wish they would have done more, but I, they crammed a lot of stuff into that little 3DS card. All what, 650 or something like that? Yeah, right. So, you know, when you start to get that many, I think they kind of had to pick and choose which ones they're going to give voices to. So there you go. Alright, two more kickoff topics here from Twitter. Uh, this next one comes from my pal Ronnie Talbot on Twitter. Uh, Ronnie was on Horde House, uh, a while ago, and he was actually, a lot of people have known him because he was on, um, uh, a reality show called Big Brother here in the US. So we're, we're Twitter friends after that. Cause when he was a nerd on big, I like trashy reality TV shows and he was a nerd. So it was like, Ronnie, what's up? We should be friends. And now we are. Um, so Ronnie sent me a suggestion and I know he was bitching about this on Twitter the other night. Ronnie says, how about why is the gaming community so cannibalizing in games like League of Legends? They are so rude to each other. They never consider the concept of everyone sucks in the beginning. They expect auto awesomeness. Hashtag not gonna happen. That is so true though in so many online games and you know, I don't know, maybe this is more of a Horde House topic, whatever. Let's bring it up here. There's oftentimes really toxic communities if for new players, you know, like if you're not good GTFO, right? And I'm always kind of like, well then why do you play in public rooms if you don't want to play against all skill sets? If you want to play against people that are good, find the good people and set up private matches or something like it always just kind of blows my mind how mean people are. But especially in a game like League of Legends where teamwork is so important to success, like people get really ticked off when they get a new player because they'd rather throw their hands up and say, oh, I quit than trying to teach somebody how to play. A reason is probably the fact that games like that are quantifiably skill based and when they face someone of noticeably lower skill then it's considered a waste of their time. And when those games more or less have a minimum of 20 to 25 minutes, that's a reasonable chunk of time. Yeah, you can steamroll them more often than not, but Starcraft, I don't know that I've really seen it so much in Starcraft. You get those attitudes, but usually at the end and not at the beginning, not that that's different from the point that he was making. But quantifiable multiplayer games and yeah, I don't know where to go beyond that. I think it's as simple as when you don't have to look that person in the eye, it's much easier to be a dick to them. Well that defines every single game ever, which is probably also quite a bit of truth too. That's just the freaking internet. That's the internet. When you get in one of those hyper competitive things where your success is dependent on your team, when you get somebody that's going to quote bring you down, a lot of people get frustrated and throw their hands up and quit and they don't want to take that patience. I remember watching you stream Final Fantasy XIV one night and you guys were shaming your party. They don't know what they're doing! You have to teach this tank! What the hell man? I guess we're no better, I don't know, but another big difference is that we didn't say it like you're terrible. And you legitimately were teaching them so that they would actually be able to get through the instance or whatever was actually going on that night. The Titan fight was what we were doing that night. I'll take your word for it. Anybody who's played XIV knows the thrill of the Titan fight, so anyway. I'm just nodding my head right now because... Smile and nod, smile and nod. The anonymous internet kind of sucks sometimes for that and I really wish those people who are not going to have any patience for new people would go find their little team and go play with that and nothing but that. Because there's going to be new people and you just have to deal with it. Like in Final Fantasy XIV, which I play an awful lot of, if I'm going to use the Duty Finder, I'm going to probably get people that are new. Because they're using it too to find the people. So I've got to wait for cutscenes, I've got to explain fights, and sure I might get frustrated but I'm not going to take it out on said person because everybody's got to learn somewhere. I also remember... It was a little different, E3 2004, I was wandering around with you when they had the Final Fantasy XI... Oh, the year I won the computer? Yeah. And you were... Because you were... I'm waiting to see what words... choose your words carefully, Jason. Yeah, because I've been doing that so well tonight already. It wasn't like... Hand skin ball. Thanks for the reminder. It was not nearly as bad as what I just referenced with Final Fantasy XIV. You were still... you were disappointingly frustrated because the collective of people... You didn't have a lot of confidence in your team, sir. You were just like, I want to be able to do this because I know what's actually going on. I want you guys to be able to keep up with me. And so it was that excitement. I wanted to win, dammit. Absolutely. It was the frustration born out of eagerness, which is completely legitimate and always happens. And again, with that slant of, you actually know what the hell is going on. You're a fan on the floor that's here because you enjoy the game. You already have experience with the game. But by no means did you boss, take over, browbeat anybody else you were playing with. Yeah, I didn't walk up to a total stranger on my team and go, why do you suck so fucking bad? You lost this round for us! Just kill yourself! And that's what people say in online games. You know, I would never do that. I might roll my eyes when they're not looking, but you know, that's the extent of it. I want to say I remember that you kind of threw hints to whoever was closest next to you. Maybe? I could be making that up. I would hope, because helping them would help me win. If I'm like, alright, cast this. Go find that guy, cast it. Hit the buttons. Do it, do it, do it. No, the other buttons. No, no, the other buttons! I know there's a lot figured out! Let's do it! Look, if I knew Ronnie's topic was just going to get me called out by Jason, I would never have read it. Damn it, Ronnie. Alright. Love you, Ronnie. Never met you, but love you already. Moving on, one more little kick-off topic here from Flocko Jones. If you visit VoGnetwork.com and ever read the comments, you know Flocko Jones. He's the number one fan of Hoard House. He's a great guy. We love Flocko Jones. Flocko says, because it's Grammy night. Oh yeah, that. Award show. Yeah, award show. Really though, I like this topic. Maybe a discussion of your favorite video game music since it's Grammy night. Or to be more topical, music from this year's games that should have been nominated like Journeys was last year. Let's go with kind of, what soundtracks have you discovered recently that are really frickin' good? I'm going to kind of generalize it in that way. What soundtracks have you discovered lately? I saw Frozen on Friday. I meant video games, damn it. Alright, that'll work though, I guess. Alright. Anybody? I would say again, Guacamelee was a great... To tip the coffee out of your hand. Was a great, great soundtrack. I love that one. Hotline Miami. Hotline Miami did have a great soundtrack to it. Oh, and Drunken Robot Pornography. No, it really did have good music. That name makes me giggle, how can it not? What about you guys in chat? Live.vognetwork.com. And Fractal, if you just want good background ambience. Jason? I know I just added a bunch of soundtracks to my library. I don't know that I've had something... I've been very into a lot of... I hate using the word traditional, but you know, composed music for public consumption and not just for the medium of games. It's been a while since I've had something in gaming that has been that specific for me. I've been listening to an awful lot of rogue legacy music lately, and that's fun and it fits the motif. Beyond that, it's fine. I wouldn't call it the experience on the level we're talking about, though. We've got a couple of people in chat, including Rama and Awesome Unicorn saying Link Between Worlds. Of course, of course, it was great. Let's see, Rama also says DuckTales Remastered. That was a really good soundtrack. It was really good. SG100Matt says Broken Age has a great soundtrack. And Tal says Banner Saga. So those are all some really good picks. Good job, you guys. Thank you for picking up the slack, chat room. Thank you for picking up the slack, because I was blanking a little bit on that question. I was like, what if I played really recently? I mean, I keep thinking back to older games and so forth, but I can't think of a lot of recent stuff. Yeah, it's hard, because it's very much a secondary thing, and the easy cop-out is something where the music makes the game, whether the obvious answers that we all know here are something like sound shapes or anything else along those lines. Music is secondary, which usually helps to float the obvious ones to the surface. Ooh, TigerClaw says, what about the Bioshock Infinite soundtrack? Yes. I've been listening to the Minecraft soundtrack a lot lately. That's really good, too. Chiptune artist C418. Great stuff, great stuff. I know this is really cliche of me to say, but the music in this game really, really, really is good. Final Fantasy XIV is so good. It's so good. So good. One would hope. All right, thank you guys for your kickoff topic suggestions. Those were all really great. So thank you, Internet. You helped save the show. All right, thank you to the folks there that I read. Let's get into our gaming week, so specifically, what types of video games have you been passing the time with this week? DarkSakura. I played some Final Fantasy XIV, because I actually had a few minutes one night instead of doing everybody else's stuff that I still have other stuff to do. Wow. I've been checking up on my village at work during lunch, and that's really about all the time I've had. I've just been way too tired when I come home and having to catch up on all the stuff that I thought I had an entire month to do. Tumblr will take like three hours to catch up on. It's totally true, though. That's not really what I'm catching up on. Tumblr is what I do in the 30 minutes I have when I'm trying to wind down. Learning is exhausting. Expanding your brain is very difficult. I think just getting your body back in the habit of going to work. Well, I just want to be on my new schedule already, because it means I get to sleep in and stay up later, because that's my normal. But because it takes so long to drive to work and back, I'm just completely worn out by the time I get home. I haven't even been to the gym last week, but then again, I've still had this cough. And thank heavens you won't be working Sunday nights, so you can still do OLR. Oh, no. I had an arrangement made. Oh, good. Because we could trade our schedules. We had a day to trade schedules. Oh, nice. So I said, hey, and he raids. So I was like, hey, if I get Saturday off and you get a Sunday off, we can trade like that. Got it. But then it turned out he gets off in time to get home for a raid, and I have a weekend. Yay! So because I was like, dude, I know maintaining, and he's in whatever guild he's in is like their top ranked. Oh, nice. On their server. Like they are going for progression and getting firsts. They have a bunch of firsts. Nice. So I'll have to have him call in on Horde House one day. That'd be fun. He's a cool guy. But yeah, I know I did play something else, because I was trying to, oh, yeah, I was playing fractal to veg out, because what happened is when I tried to move over all my saves from my old Steam install, and my fractal saves for some reason never showed up. So I have to start over, which sucks, but oh well. All right. If that's it, we'll go. That really is. That's fine. You've been busy. We've all been sick too, which is very funny. Well, not funny. Jason, what have you been playing this week? We've been sick. Every time I laugh, I start coughing hysterically. It's awful. As you just said, and as I said previously, between my obligations from work this week, like I knew were going to happen, and then the fact that I was completely out on Friday, I started putting together the video for 536 last night, and my brain was just saying that it wasn't going to happen. So I decided instead that I wanted to stop talking about making some progress on a game, and I wanted to finish it. I sat down, and I beat Rogue Legacy, which means completing the final two bosses and story clearing the game. I am now at the point that I'm new game plus-ing and can continue through with the Nioh versions, whatever the term is for the alternative form of the main bosses, and then just stat whoring and continuing to gather new upgrades, which I'm perfectly fine with because Rogue likes and I love them. That's pretty much it. Literally just about two to three hours last night. Beating a game is a pretty good accomplishment. That's more than I usually do, so congrats. My gaming week. Pretty much more of the same stuff like Final Fantasy XIV. It takes up a lot of my time. I don't usually review games based off the demo, but I feel like this demo is big enough that I should mention that I did play the Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns demo, because I was very curious to see where this is going. No, because you can't use the Ares costume in the demo. It comes with a new costume that I guess carries over to the game, but otherwise you have like six costumes you can switch between in the demo. There is a point to the costume thing. That's what I learned. There actually really is a point to that because the little twist on the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns is that your party is lightning, lightning, and lightning. That's your party. Basically you have three lightnings. I'm not making this up. You have lightning, lightning, and lightning. It's just that you use this, I don't want to call it the dresh fear, but it sure feels like it to me. You use the L1 and R1 to flip between the different lightnings that you have programmed. So you might have like red mage lightning, dragoon lightning, and like paladin lightning or something in your party, and you can flip between them using L1 and R1. And then you have like a meter that measures stamina, I guess. So like you can use, let's say I flip to my warrior and then attack, attack, attack, attack, blitz, attack, attack. Well then she runs out of stamina, so I have to flip really quick to my black mage. Now fire, fire, fire, fire, blizzard, button mashing, those. And while I'm playing as my black mage, my warrior is recovering stamina. So it's like you play as one, run the stamina bar out, flip to another, run the stamina bar out, flip to another. So it's an interesting little twist on the battle system. The demo is like really, really short. Really short. It's like five random encounters, a boss fight, you're done. And then, oh yeah, 25 minutes worth of cut scenes, because this is Final Fantasy 13 after all. Because it's Final Fantasy we're talking about. Yeah, especially Final Fantasy 13, right? So they do try to push a little bit too of their more connected type of thing they're doing with Facebook and Twitter and kind of like an online thing. Like you're supposed to be able to send like pictures and things online where people will be... It's kind of like a Miiverse-style integration to me, except like items can be attached to the posts. That's really what it felt like to me. And you can put these posts on Facebook, because like I played through the demo twice, because it's so flipping short. So the first time I played through it, and I figured out, oh, the boss is very vulnerable to blank. I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who want to figure it out yourself. But I figured that out. So the second time I played the demo, I knew how to five-star that boss. Because I was like, oh, if I pick up a blank from this guy, I can do nothing but blank and purposely being vague, try not to spoil. But you'll figure it out when you play this demo. So I was able to five-star the boss. So I uploaded that to my Facebook, except I made it shared only post-privately. But it's supposed to unlock something in the real game, because I did that. So it's kind of interesting how it all ties in. It sounds like they fixed Final Fantasy XIII's battle engine. Just from what I was watching of... From what I've seen of people playing Final Fantasy XIII, just the... Yeah, you could stop the gauge early, but setting everything up in advance and really letting it just play itself... I get the difficulty and especially the rating system, but if I take a backseat to gaming, I lose interest. So it sounds like they did a fair amount of work to work around that. Awesome Unicorn says, Rob, you get one costume for getting the demo and another for posting your battle score on the last boss to social media. Make sure you do that. See, I did that, but I didn't see anything unlock. So now I'm worried I didn't really get it. Even though I created my name and everything, and I think I did it. Knowing me, I probably screwed it up. Oh well, so there'll be one stupid costume I won't be able to equip in the game. I mean, it sounds like there's going to be 5,000 costumes, so whatever. That'll eventually just unlock for you anyways. Right, right. Or I could pay 50 cents. Thanks for your support! Everybody gets the costume! Yay! Alright, so that was the demo. Otherwise, I can't review the game, because I got to play... Well, I can say I got to play 40 minutes of it, but really, 10 of it was playing. 30 of it was watching. So anyways, to be continued, because I will pick up the full game later. Minecraft. I don't know if I mentioned in Minecraft, I am playing on the Vaga Network server, and I completed a project of mine this week, and that was I built a tunnel with an underground railroad that connects my old house to my new house, or where my old house used to be when the server first started, right under the giant orange on radio sign that somebody made. There's now a secret passage that will connect to an underground railroad that goes all the way to my house. The only thing I haven't figured out how to do yet is get the mine cart to work, because I don't understand how the power and all that stuff works, and I'm still trying to learn that. I know some of you Minecraft experts are probably sitting there going, God, Rob, it's so easy, but I haven't figured that part out yet, so I'm still figuring that all out. So I'm hoping by next week I'll actually get the mine cart that actually runs between the two. And the cool thing is, I didn't use world edit to do it. I built it by hand. I figured out my coordinates, and when I was building the tunnel, I figured out, okay, here's the point I want to build to, and then here's how I'm going to connect it from the other side. So that was actually a lot of fun. I was actually very rewarding. And a friend on the VoG network server offered to use world edit to build the tunnel for me really fast, and I was like, you know what, thank you, but no, because this is actually very therapeutic for me. Like building this little three by three tunnel is like popping bubbles on bubble wrap or something. It's very therapeutic to just sit there, mine, mine, mine. I see why people get sucked into Minecraft. It's fucking bubble wrap. Why do you think my house descends like 50 levels into the core of the planet? Because I'm like, oh my god, I found lava! Where did this water come from? Descending into the deepest, darkest nether regions. Anyways, I actually downloaded, because it's been forever since I've used Minecraft, I don't know if the auto-updater would even work correctly, but I actually downloaded an updated client, and I don't think I asked Loki to add me to the whitelist, but I will check this out soon. Even though he's had the baby, he popped on the web chat when I was finishing the railroad the other night, he was trying to tell me how to fix my railroad, so he'll be on there once in a while. I just haven't asked and considered what I already said about last week. There will be a chance I will do it. I want to figure out how to build a ferris wheel. I bet it's possible. You know what's funny is that everybody freaking loves railroads and minecarts in Minecraft, which is fine, I understand, but it's really funny because when I built the underground one, somebody actually built, or is building, an overground one, because I went out on my front lawn, and I was like, hey, somebody put a minecart here, and it said, it had the guy's name, I'm sorry, I forgot who it was, but it had the guy's name, and it said, I'm building a connection between Rob's house and DarkSakura's house. So somebody, yeah, without asking, is building a minecart race that gets from my house to your house. That's kind of fun. It's like our own, it's our light rail, it's our monorail. We have minecart monorail. Eff yeah, monorail. Alright, quickly, what else do I want to say? Oh, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, free on PlayStation Plus right now. Check that out, and if you have PlayStation Plus, you really owe it to yourself to check out this game. It's really a gorgeous game, and a very simple, yet great puzzle mechanic, where you control each brother, one thumbstick is each brother, so that can really kind of mess with your mind when one's on the left and one's on the right, but it's the other way around, and then one button that does action, and it feels like an old-school PC game. It really, really feels like an old point-and-click type of game, except it's just you're using thumbsticks, and the click is the R1 and L1. So yeah, I love that. That's great. Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, check that out. Queuing it up right now. Ron Chan says that Underground Railroad is racist. It is a railroad that is underground. Should I flip? Stop being all Tumblr, Ron Chan, seriously. Should I flip it around? It's a railroad underground? All right. It's a subway. You know what? Yeah, it's a subway. There you go. Fine, I'm building a subway. You know what I'll do? I'm going to paint all the walls in rainbow colors, and it'll be the gay Underground Railroad. You can't stop me. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. Anyway. Will you build one under my house, too? SSG100Matt says instead of the Freedom Train, it's the Fabulous Train. We'll see. All right. Dungeon Buster's warning me. Be sure to have a box of Kleenex next to you. I'm only probably about halfway through the game right now. I hear it's short, but I don't know. I've been playing it for a couple hours, and I'm probably only halfway through it. But I'm also the type that would seriously like, oh, there's a bench. I should go sit on it. Check out the scenery. I spend way too much time in that Brothers game. All right. Let's move on. Let's get into some housekeeping. Add us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR. We're also on Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio. I already mentioned it earlier in the show, but Shane will be here next week. That'll be a lot of fun, so tune in for that, our Puppy Bowl Sunday episode. Also, I want to give a big congratulations to our friends over at Critical Myth, which is another show you can hear on the Voice of the Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com. They are hitting episode 400 this week. They taped it over the weekend, and it's debuting for the live audience. That's tomorrow, 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern. For those of you guys listening to this on the podcast through Stitcher Radio or iTunes Podcast or what have you, be sure to check that out in Critical Myth's own podcast feed. You can find all the links over at voggenetwork.com. If you like nerdy, cult-type of TV shows, they talk about all of them. They talk about all of them, and they do movies, too. Fun show. Check that out. By the way, speaking of shows, because it has to be said, I finished season three of Sherlock. Did you? And I was like, ugh, the whole time. And then Dan comes in while I'm at the end, he's like, why didn't you wait for me? Aww. So he's been watching Sherlock today. Aww. Alright, he's catching up. Alright, let's get into some gaming news for this week, and Jason's going to start us off tonight. And Brothers has been purchased from the web. Good job. I just bought Universe Sandbox. I saw something- That Rageinator suggested. That Rageinator suggested now. What is Universe Sandbox about? Colliding galaxies? You're God. No. Alrighty then. Sounds fun. Yeah, you can change gravity and mess with planets and stuff, so. Actually, the game I have to get, because somebody alerted me to this on Twitter, and I forgot who said it, so thank you, and sorry I forgot who advised me of this, but Sid Meier's Covert Action is on Good Old Games, and I've got to get that, because that is one of my favorite 90s games, even though, yeah, Sid Meier, of course, did Civilization, a lot of those great games. Covert Action was kind of a game that even Sid Meier, I think, doesn't like in retrospect, but I loved it, and I played it all the time as a kid, so I've got to get that this week. So, since we're talking about buying games. Anyway. Well, when I edit the show and come across it again, I'll message you and make sure that you got it. Alright, thank you. Thank you. Over the last week to a week and a half, there was a bit of a kerfuffle, because Microsoft was reportedly paying Machinima, and their affiliates that are part of their YouTube network, extra rates for positive Xbox One reviews. These were being indicated by a tag, XB1M13, which apparently has been taken over and used by a number of people, much like Virgin Mary Grilled Cheese and every other eBay hilarity product that has ever crossed paths on the internet. The going rate was that Microsoft was tacking on for partners an additional $3 per 1,000 views. For people who get, you know, at least five digits, but more often at least 100,000 views or more, yeah, that's pretty big. It was seen as a bit controversial, because the terms were considered that it had to be a positive review. There would be no payout if an individual gave any kind of a negative critiquing review against the console for its release. I assume it extends to titles, but we actually don't know that for certain. A statement provided both by Machinima and Microsoft was that this was a typical marketing partnership to promote the Xbox One. Microsoft bought ad space, as one does on keywords and any other ad network, and Microsoft also followed up again additionally to say, Microsoft was not aware of individual contracts Machinima had with their content providers as part of this promotion, and we did not provide any feedback on any of the videos. We have asked Machinima not to post any additional Xbox One content as part of this media buy, and we have asked them to add disclaimers to the videos that were part of the program, indicating they were part of paid advertising. This isn't a new thing. A lot of people saw it as astroturfing, the term technically is, not that Microsoft is the underdog by any stretch of the imagination, but ad buys are very much a thing, and with content networks going the traditional route as they have to do in order to have enough content under their wing to ensure a healthy surge of content, this kind of thing, somebody pays to be able to be featured as part of that incoming content. I was really surprised at the amount of flack that this whole thing got, and the amount of shock that people were expressing in the community. It's not that I necessarily supported or whatever, but it's one of those things where it's like, didn't you all know that this was already going on? Like, isn't this, I thought this was common knowledge. I know we all use ad blockers, but have we ever seen a YouTube ad before? It's exactly the whole thing. Is product placement a new concept? I don't think so. This is, well, yeah, American Idol's a great example. A show I just watched last night, which I'm sure a lot of you are following too because it is the nerdy content, King of the Nerds, new reality show, right? Our friend, Asuka, is on that show, right? Member of the O.L. Army, Nicole is on that show. So I had to tune in to see how she did, and I was very relieved at the episode. Let me just put it that way. I was at a sports bar last Thursday, and that happened to be on one of the many TVs that was playing. Well, the reason why I bring up King of the Nerds is because I just watched it last night, so it was fresh in my mind. They had a Radio Shack TARDIS where they actually go in the little TARDIS. It's really funny because the way they have it set up is it actually does look like it's bigger on the inside. It's really cute. But they go in, and it's like, oh, gosh, it's like all these great mechanical engineering things. I'm a mechanical engineer, and everything I could ever want is in here. The whole thing was a frickin' ad for Radio Shack, but I didn't feel like, oh, my God, I'm so offended at this. I feel like I'm being used. Where is the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen that Radio Shack sponsored this message? How dare they? No, I just accepted that, oh, Radio Shack paid for this spot because that's what they do now because you all fast forward through commercials on your TiVo. Saw another TV show on Friday, which has literally made this the whole point of the show. Price is Right. Oh, yeah? First time I've seen that show in like six years. Oh, God, what a great example, though. Oh, my God. Everybody's, you know, they call out all these brands by name. They have to for market price. Ooh, what a great idea. And you see all their logos and everything else at the end. And everybody loves the Price is Right. Oh, my gosh. Everybody wants to win shit. Yes, and every time they talk about the cars, they describe the car. It's beautiful four-wheel drive. You know, they're talking about all this stuff. The new Ford Fusion with stylish interior and deluxe seats. What a great, oh, my gosh. And you'll have to pay taxes on it if you win. But even in the gaming industry, you guys, didn't you know that like positive reviews can break embargo days and, you know, certain big websites pay for, you know, the exclusives first and vice versa when it's positive. Like this is not something new. I hate to be rude, but y'all are being a bit naive. I think where y'all went wrong, and again, I'm in that mood where I'm just telling it like it is tonight. I don't really care. You all thought Machinima was an independent thing. That's the problem, because Machinima brought on all these indie people into their corporation that exists to make money. I think you all feel like that trust you thought you were going to get out of an indie has been breached a little bit. I kind of think that, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, feel free, live.vognetwork.com. But I think that's what this boils down to. You thought you were getting one thing, you're really getting another. Sorry about it. And this actually, we're actually going to revisit this topic a little bit later tonight, but it also ties into something we talked about last week, which the point just completely slits. Oh, when we were discussing the Wii U last week, Dark Soccer brought up the point about the difference between a startup company and an established company with a reputation and product to protect. You do something new, you get popular for it, and you use it to grow. You use it to balloon in reach and popularity and everything else. But then if you try it again and fail, what happens? Unfortunately, probably bad things for your company. So you hold on to what's working just until you can find something new that works. Kind of sucks to say, but this is literally the cycle of business. I don't, there are exceptions because some people can reinvent themselves, Amazon. But it doesn't always happen, Barnes and Noble. I don't know. There are exceptions, the devil is in the details, but this is how it works. You get popular for something and then you either cling onto it for dear life, much like Bobby covered just before us, or you finish and close down your company, which who wants to do that? RageNator in chat at live.bognetwork.com says, Skye, actually not everyone loves The Prices, right? I don't, therefore your statement isn't valid. You're a terrible one, Mr. Grinch. Right? Don't just kind of look at that comment and you're like, well... There's so much happiness and cheering and applause. Even the people that lose are still so happy. I want to know how that's relevant. What? He's entitled to his opinion. We did bring up The Prices, right? It's fine. No, I was... All right. MM2K says my favorite comment, the best phrase in the entire English language. I think you're right, Rob. Thank you. It's also Y-O-U apostrophe R-E. Seconded. I'll still allow it. I'll still allow it. All right. Not Y-O-U-R. Brad from Pod Culture says Rob gives no fucks. Yeah. I'm going to pay for my mouth tonight, but I just... You're right. I actually had one of those weeks and one of those weekends where it's like, I don't give a fuck right now. Your body and mind have already worked hard enough to overcome sickness tonight. It's just... Without getting too introspective here on our little podcast, I'm learning in life that you really need to do the things that you enjoy. And if there's something in your life that you don't enjoy so much and you continue to do it, you're going to start to associate a lot of the negative feelings with it. You might start to feel trapped. You might not to know like what the escape is. And there's that like fear of like letting people down or whatever. But the reason why I bring all that up, doing this show over the past 12 years is one of those things that gives me a lot of joy. It really does. And the fact that you all show up and listen to it, you know, sure there's what, 50 of you guys in chat right now listening live. You're still here to listen to what I have to say. And I'm like flattered. I'm honored. And I get such a reward from doing it. So thank you really. And those of you who are listening on the podcast feed and everything, thank you. I do appreciate it. Sorry, I didn't mean to get all deep on you, but like I guess I kind of did because of that comment. So let's see, where was I? Because there was something else I was going to say. And it had to do with the whole... Oh, I wanted to say to be devil's advocate because I don't want people thinking like I'm just like kicking machinima while I have the opportunity or whatever. I'm sure there's a variety of broadcasters on the network who said, you know, if I don't have anything nice to say, I'm not going to say it at all. So I think there's probably people that maybe they don't agree with Xbox One or maybe they don't like Xbox One for whatever reason or, you know, they have a Sony related channel or whatever the thing is. It's not like you had to do this. This was not mandated. Nobody forced somebody to do this. But it was just like, hey, here's a product placement campaign that you can participate in and get paid. And, you know, there's a lot of people out there that want to get paid. And on the heels of YouTube, there was actually yet another thing. We covered content ID changes and all that kind of stuff in depth. And there was even before that, I remember some broadcasters that I follow were talking about YouTube's changes, Google's changes to YouTube notifications for new videos and something like that that everybody noticed. Like, I don't want to overstate this, but they made it sound like at least a 10% and possibly more just straight up drop off of views that they would expect to see. Just one release to the next, just pfft. And then with these broadcasters that put out one video away, that's pretty damn obvious. Something changed. And then they got the technical details, figured out what it was. I don't have all of the details in front of me right now. But it's like, you know, you take... It's not that they take money anywhere they can get it, but if somebody was going to... And I hate to say this too, but if somebody were gonna... If one of these companies were going to give me money to pay their consult, I would take it. And that was a job I would have loved to have for the better part of my life. Still, not entirely sure about that, but certainly for the majority of my life, I would have, you know, done ORLAR like a full-time job. I would have done this for many, many years of my life. Would I have done it and, you know, the implicit, done it for favors, done it for positive reviews? No, that's not the intention. I like gaming, so I'm gonna talk about what I like about it. I've kvetched about things that I don't like with the Xbox One, and it has some problems, but the games look fucking astounding. When I've been playing the games, they have been incredible amounts of fun. The controller feels right, and for a company with three gaming consoles to their name, to get it that right and continue to drill it in that well, it means that I like the console, and I'm gonna say nice things about it. How much did you get paid for that? $1.50? I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. All right. I'm sure some of you guys have feedback on this. I know we've given some very blunt opinions that you may not agree with. I welcome feedback as long as, you know, it's tactful. Instead of, you know, I don't like emails that say, fuck you, you fucking fuck. But if you've got, you know, the opinions, backed-up, thought-out statements, then I welcome them. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those. All right. Let's move on. I've got the next story here. And, you know, since, again, it's one of those nights, I'm gonna tell y'all I think this story is absolute bullshit. But it's something that people are talking about this week, so I'm gonna bring it up anyway. Running around the web this week that Nintendo has got a new system in the works. Let me start out with this. Of course Nintendo has a new system in the works. Surprise goes to nobody. Sony. Because all systems are made in just the year before they come out. Sony has a PlayStation 5 in the works. Microsoft has a new system in the works. Yes, already. And the new Kinect. These systems do not come out overnight. We know this. So, yes, Nintendo has a new system in the works. But is it called the Nintendo Fusion? Just like the Wii was called the Revolution. Dolphin Wii U was the Revolution. No, I had that right the first time, didn't I? Code names are hard. If this report from Nintendo News is to be believed, then, yes, Nintendo is working on Nintendo Fusion. Now, to be fair, this is an independently produced site, and they even start off this article saying, hey, if it's your first time here, we have an impeccable reputation when it comes to delivering information. Look, I understand. They believe in this. It's coming from their trusted source. That's cool. I'm not trying to shade this site because they believe in it. I just think, no. Because I think, A, they're basing it off a domain registration because Nintendo registered NintendoFusion.com, except that they actually purchased this domain back in 2003 because there used to be like a festival. I guess Nintendo did a music festival back in the day that was called Nintendo Fusion. I don't even remember that festival. But, God, we would have been doing the show then, so we would have heard about it. But, yeah, it was a rock music video games festival that was in 2003. But apparently, Fusion is a new console that is supposed to bring a little bit more synergy between the Fusion DS and what they're calling the Fusion Terminal. And I'm not going to spout off all these specs here, but it is just basically, as you would imagine, it's a stronger DS and it's a stronger terminal that I imagine is out there to compete with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Do I believe Nintendo has something in the works that is on the level of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One? Yes, absolutely. The big problem they're having with Wii U is that third-party developers don't want to go the extra mile to do stuff for the Wii U game pad. That takes development hours and so forth. That's one of the big problems. Even though the Wii U was supposed to be like an Xbox 360 for developing for, you have to be able to think differently with the whole game pad. It's not working out with the third parties. Whether we like it or not, the third parties don't feel like it's a worthy investment because of what's being sold. If a new Nintendo comes out, it's going to be much more attractive to third-party developers if their console is maybe just a slightly better PlayStation 4, Xbox One type of thing, where if somebody builds a PlayStation 4 game, it's super easy to port that over to this Nintendo device. And I think that's a little bit like, duh, that's coming as well. But as far as these specific specs, of course they're going to change before this console's actually out. And I think it's a bit too easy to be able to say, oh, they were right. Yep, yep, it looks like the next Nintendo system, it did fuse the DS and the base is a lot stronger. This is like saying, I'm going to wake up tomorrow, and the sky is going to be blue. These are very safe bets, is what I'm saying. These are all things that we're kind of expecting out of Nintendo. I think the only way this goes wrong is if Nintendo really comes out of left field and says, hey, we've got this whole new way to play games that we believe in, and we're going to take a risk one more time, which is not outside the realm of possibility. They took the risk with it with the Wii, and they won. They took the risk with the Wii U, and so far they're losing. So it would not be out of character for Nintendo to come out and say we have a whole new way to play games. This is crazy. Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided a little bit of a topic back, but Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided early exposure for then, 2003, like you said, for then-developing bands such as Evanescence, Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and Berlin, and Panic at the Disco. Wow. Wow! That's a killer fucking lineup. I think Evanescence was a bit prominent quite a bit before that, but my mental timeline with the rest of those bands, damn. That was actually a pretty good grab. And this does sound kind of familiar because they demoed games. 2003 bands Evanescence Cold, Revice, Finger Eleven, Cauterize. Games that were featured, 1080-degree Avalanche, Madden NFL 2004. Nintendo GameCube, it's not just a kid's machine. F-Zero GX was debuted at 2003, was demoed at 2003 on Nintendo Fusion Tour. Sonic Advance 2, Game Boy Advance, Donkey Kong Country, Game Boy Advance, 007 Night Fire, Rogue Squadron 3, Rebel Strike, 2004 bands, Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance, Lost Prophets, Letter Kills, 2005, Fall Out Boy, The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack, Boys Night Out, Panic at the Disco. You see a trend in these genres, of course, but at the same time, these are pretty, like, this is not exactly anything to snuff out. Is it outside the realm of possibility that maybe Nintendo's gonna bring this tour back? I mean, I know that sounds like the crazy thought, but, I mean, what? This festival would have happened two years into the GameCube's life when GameCube needed more of a boost with that 20-something audience. They are taking the tack of being their own media outlet. By which I mean, Nintendo Direct. And then, prior to the Wii U's release, they had the Nintendo, I don't remember what the specific name for it was, but they had the Wii U media tour. I went to that in Denver, where instead of, you know, like, advertising in the common areas, they rented out Office Space, whatever venue they could get, and they set up everything for people to play. I had quite a bit of fun. I rather liked it. The fact that Nintendo is being their own endpoint for all of this media to do something like this again, that wouldn't surprise me in the least. Just a couple comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. Rama says, whether this rumor is true or not, if the hardware isn't on par with the Xbox One or PlayStation 4, it will fail. Kaijuto says, I think that Nintendo caters to kids. That's their demo, and right now kids are into small gaming devices. They don't get the console stuff like us adults do. That's why the 3DS is doing so well. But it's not like the Wii was 20 years ago. That's the only issue I have with that comment is that, you know, Nintendo did have great success with kids and adults with the Nintendo Wii, and it's not like it was that long ago. I don't know. That's the only thing I'm thinking. I don't think we can write Nintendo off as a kids-only company when they just are writing the wave of that success, you know? They do the kids thing well, don't get me wrong. 2DS, I don't think any adult understands what the 2DS is for unless they have kids. But the 2DS is a great kiddie device. All right, anyhow, we could debate Nintendo all night once again, but we're going to move on with more stories. Yes, once again in the dark saga. Well, this is a rumor that was going around, and it was also perpetuated by the K-word. Oh, the site that shall not be named? Yeah, that GameStop in the US was going to be canceling Wii U pre-orders of Watch Dogs, that the game was supposed to have been cancelled by Ubisoft. Now, what actually came out is that a spokesperson for GameStop actually heard from Ubisoft, and basically what the big problem is, is that they actually had an error on their system that took out their pre-orders. Three people that replied to the article that I found this on actually said that they went out and had no trouble with their orders. So, it's still there, but as we know, how the K likes to get on the bandwagon. Well, I think it also says a lot that I think a lot of us look at a story like this and go, it wouldn't really be that surprising. Well, and also, an Italian gaming site called Witalia said that the game was going to be out on everything but Wii U, but maybe it's not getting a Europe release, maybe? Who knows? It would be nice if Ubisoft would comment on this. Well, it looks like that... Yeah, Ubisoft actually just declined to comment, but it was a problem with GameStop. See, when they declined to comment like that, I hate to give a K article that kind of clout, but when Ubisoft declines to comment, that almost says more than a comment would. That's the only thing, again, I'm not trying to freak out or get tinfoil hatty, I'm just saying. Yeah, but it also could be that it's GameStop, and GameStop had already put out a statement or something or the other. Alright, well, we'll see if they make an official comment or what happens with the game in the coming weeks. They declined to comment because there's nothing to say yet. The game's not out, there's nothing to talk about. The comment, look forward to Watch Dogs on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U this April. I bet you anything they had employees going in, because guess what I just read online? Is that true? Yeah, right? And if it gets delayed? Though it is a sad thing when employees have to hear it from the news before they hear it from work. I think the Ubisoft comment, I would have expected, is exactly what I just said. Look forward to Watch Dogs on all these consoles coming April, get your pre-order in now. That would have been the comment that I would have said, oh, okay. It's a nice comment. Absolutely. But the fact that instead they chose to say no comment? That's where I go, hmm, that's all. Next story! Owners of Dead Rising 3 will have seen that they got a massive title update last week, clocking in at 13 gigs. This is on top of the base install of Dead Rising 3 itself already being 19.9 gigs. 13 gigs?! Ain't nobody got bandwidth for that! Not in some states of the US, for sure. Dead Rising 3's base install is 20 gigs as is. Of course, with the Xbox 360, you don't have to install the whole thing before you play. But this title update clocked in at 13 gigs, and it was suspected to be linked to DLC. A couple days later, there was confirmation from Microsoft that the 13 gig update is in fact linked to Operation Broken Eagle. The update also does incorporate some bug fixes, add-ins, additional smart glass features, so on and so forth. The kicker is that Operation Broken Eagle, my assumption when I read the first two, the hint and the confirmation article, was that, oh, it's required for everybody, it's compatibility DLC so that if somebody else buys it, you can still play with them in co-op. Operation Broken Eagle is single-player DLC only. So enjoy your diminished hard drive space and the fixes that incorporate 1% of it. But that download is just gonna be there, chillin', and if you buy Operation Broken Eagle, great. If not, well, you lose the space anyways. Wow. Yeah, that's a hefty one. It's funny to think about this now, now that the Xbox One has a Blu-ray drive. We're legit talking double-digit figures of capacity instead of a possible max of 9.7 gigs. DVD 4.7, DVD 9, 9.7, Blu-ray 25 or 50 gigs, where the majority of it is sent to the hard drive. We're dealing with some big shit now. I just need to say, I'm really concerned about this, coupled with the whole net neutrality thing. I'm really worried about the size of some of these patches, which makes sense and so forth, because these are full HD games with really 1080 textures. This is gonna be big stuff, no matter what the game is. 4K is right around the corner, even though we know PlayStation 4 and I believe Xbox One as well, they're not gonna play 4K games. They're not built to play 4K games. That'll be PlayStation 5 and Xbox 2 or whatever. Because it can't get any more confusing with those frickin' console names. It would be hilarious. The most hilarious name would be the Xbox 4, because it plays 4K. So it'd be the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, and the Xbox Four. Anyhow, I worry with this whole net neutrality thing. If Comcast is talking 300 gigabyte cap or whatever, that's not gonna be enough. They're not moving at the rates they need to be. I don't know. I do serious shit online, but while they don't enforce the cap, they still have the tools in there for me to see my usage. I am always above 250, 300, whatever they've labeled it as. We actually somehow end up below. Maybe I'm complaining too much, but then again, we just got the PlayStation 4, so we'll see. But with all your MMOs and all of this Skype and broadcasting and all of this online interactivity you have, it is pretty surprising that you of all people would be on there. It's not as much traffic as you think. It's not like it's streaming the visual aspect of the game back and forth, sure. But you do a lot of it. And then Skype and Twitch streaming and everything else at the same time, it adds up. I mean, yeah, I'd send whole system backups, but whatever. Differential. Anyways, one last note for people who did not know is that Operation Broken Eagle is the first of four DLC packs. First one to come out, well, that much is obvious. Operation Broken Eagle is the first. Buy the season pass, as everybody seems to love to do, and you will get three more as they get released over the year. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase ANSWER. Locopoco wants to make sure an important clarification gets out here, saying, well, the thing is, Capcom put DLC on the disc, people are pissed. And now Capcom wants you to download the DLC and people are pissed. I think that the 13 gigs are a bit much. Well, it sounds like you have to download it whether you're going to buy it or not. That's the problem, right? Yeah, absolutely. This was a title update for the game itself, completely regardless of whether or not you buy the DLC. It will happen as long as you have installed the game itself and booted up. Well, let me do a quick story here about, since we're talking next, now we're saying next gen, except it's not really, now it's current gen. This gen. Along those same lines, when you asked Jamie what her best game of 2013 was, and she answered, I wanted to chime in and say, but there's still 11 more months to figure that out. Fucking not 2013 anymore, right? Jesus. Alright, so anyway, this gen, or whatever you want to call the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One gen, is that, what is it, 8th generation of games? 9th? I believe so. Where the hell are we now? Whatever. Current games, big games. Resogun is a big game on the PlayStation 4. Latia getting Resogun for free because of PlayStation Plus, although I'm sure some of you did, you know, who aren't into the monthly subscription thing or whatever, a yearly subscription, probably bought the game independently. But a lot of people getting Resogun for free. So how's the Resogun developer gonna really make money? I mean, I know they get some from PlayStation, I'm sure, and they were funded. But, Resogun developer is working on some DLC. Have you noticed, by the way, that the games they tend to give away on PlayStation Plus have DLC or have expansions coming, things that, you know, they'll get some money off of. Like Borderlands 2, yes, the game is free, but it has- 4 DLC packs? Oodles of DLC, yes. Not to mention all of the 360 avatar enhancements and other customizations you can get. Bioshock Infinite has an expansion, right? Not that- I'm not complaining, I'm just saying there is a science to this. Give away the razor to sell the blades. Ooh, very good comparison. I've used that a number of times. Yes you have, yes you have. Alright, anyway. So anyway, the Resogun developer, they did confirm in a Facebook post of all places, it was a very innocent reply on Facebook. But now everybody's running with it, they are working on DLC for Resogun and an unannounced PlayStation 4 project. So, could literally be anything. So, yeah. But Resogun was a very popular online title, you know, for the launch of the PlayStation 4. No surprise at all to hear that those guys are very busy. So I look forward to seeing what the DLC will be and what their next project might be. Hopefully it'll involve more particles flying everywhere! Pew pew pew, explosions! That was particle. Particle man, particle man. Aw, they might be giants. We love you. Shaking my head. No. Well, how about we go into some- Shaking my head, shaking my head. Meanie woman, meanie woman. Doing the things that mean girls can. I need to see that movie, you know. Yes you do. Moving on! Okay. So how about some legal news? Since we've been in a legal stew already. Haha, I went there. So, a while back I mentioned about the Madden programmer, Robin Antonick, who sued EA and won like 4 million plus bucks because they used his code. Well, apparently that whole decision was just reversed by US District Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco. And said, no you don't get it, and no you don't get the interest, and no. So- You get nothing! You leave! Good day, sir! Yes. And so his lawyer says, girl no. I actually said, the evidence showed that they used his source code without permission. So yeah, they're gonna appeal. So basically what they said is that the jurors had no basis for their consultation because they were never shown the game side by side, which is what's necessary for copyright infringement. So they actually had no basis for their verdict. So does this mean we're headed towards a Supreme Court showdown over Madden? Because that could be very interesting. If they even decide to take it up. But this could set a precedent for programming code. I'll never forget when one of the Supreme Court judges referenced Mortal Kombat in one of his decisions. And that was the whole Schwarzenegger ESA thing that happened here in California, right? Remember that? I was like, wow, the Supreme Court knows what Mortal Kombat is. That's so weird. Well, it's only 20-something years old. They're catching up. Slowly. Yes, but the image you have of the Supreme Court is, with all due respect to our government, the image of the Supreme Court that we get is old fuddy duddies with wigs. You know, and so to hear them talking about- Hey, in some countries they still use wigs. They should use wigs here, to be honest. But anyway. See, now I've got this Monty Python thing running through my head with the two judges taking off their robes to reveal lingerie underneath and going off on a date. Only at OLR could we turn a story about a lawsuit into wearing lingerie underneath your robes. It was Monty Python sketch. Whatever. If you referenced it. Alright. For the record, by the way, I do have to make a little side note about Cool Job. Oh, wait. Tangent on OLR? Get out. When people at lunch start breaking out into Monty Python songs too, you know you're at a cool job. Just saying. Alright, let's travel around the world and see what lingerie- I mean video games are coming out in a store near you. I ain't showing, I ain't telling. I don't know that I'm capable of reporting on this information. Well at Fredericks they have this lacy red thing. Starting in the US. Starting in the US. On January 28th, the whole heap and helping of everything, Broken Age Act 1 drops on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Droid, and the Ouya. Which is the first Ouya release of this year. Very good. The Ouya gets a game. Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z. I think this is the first title of any particular status. There have invariably been other smaller, small time releases that have landed just because they were finished and got published. At any rate. Also on the 28th, Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z drops on PS3, PS Vita, and Xbox 360. Recoil with a K drops for PC. Tomb Raider Definitive Edition hits for the PS4 and Xbox One. Getting that one. December 20- Jesus Christ. Increment everything by one Jason. Please. January 29th, Recoil Liberator, Xbox Live Arcade. On the 30th, Octodad, Deadliest Catch, Windows, Mac, Linux. Yeah, I was like, what's that? Octodad? Did you not, have you not played this? No, I think about Octomom. I hate that name for her because she sounds like a Superman villain. So Octodad released as, Octodad was a game, I don't know if it was basically supposed to be a demo or not at this point. But Octodad was a game that was released, holy crap. This looks weird. Three months ago, where you control a dad in a family who's an octopus. And you- The hell am I looking at? You're looking at Octodad. He's carrying groceries. He squirms around, it is entirely, it's not entirely mouse based. You still use the keyboard to decide whether you- He's wearing a suit. Clasp things or let go of them. If you're controlling him moving or controlling like extension, he's an octopus doing daily life tasks. It is completely insane. He's wearing a tie. Yes. And he has kids. He has a wife and he has two kids. Girl and a boy. He is Octodad. Are they Octopi too? No. They are all humans. Except for Octodad. They must be adopted. Bobby Black Wolf says, I played Octodad at PAX East. It was in the indie game Pavilion. And as Joe and her mat says, yeah, I also played Octodad at PAX East. So basically he's chicken boo. Black Wolf says Octodad is basically an octopus trying to fool everyone into thinking he's human. And the antagonist, the primary- He was a disguise to look like human, guys. The primary antagonist of the game is a sushi chef. Who- Taco is tasty. Who intends to reveal Octodad to his family. Wasn't that a scene in Monsters Inc? Like wasn't the sushi- There was a sushi chef that was the octopus. Yes. But you know what? You know what? Taco is tasty. All right. All I know is I'm getting this game for absolutely certain. So good. I want takoyaki now. I just want a taco. It came out at the same time. Just don't go to Taco Bell and we'll be fine. That's not food. Exactly. Exactly. It came out like around the same time of these other ridiculously exaggerated control games, Surgeon Simulator. And it plays very similarly because there's no precision to speak of. He is squirrelly, some might say inky and just loose. So it controls like queue up. It controls like shit. But it's so much fun. Tigerclaw gave us a link in the chatroom that you can play the original Octodad for free at Octodadgame.com. Yes. And now this game has much more content in the same environments. It's going to be very good. Highly recommended. Let's go to Japan and check out the releases there where you would expect to see the crazy stuff like Octodad. But no, that's not a release in Japan this week. There are games that include octopuses that are a little bit different. Settle down. On the Playstation 3 this week, they get Diablo 3. It comes out in Japan this week on the Playstation 3. Also out. Yeah, the console versions are pretty good. So I'm sure there will be some people checking that out. Also coming out on the Playstation 3 this week, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Full Boost because you can't have a week in gaming in Japan without a Gundam game. Also, Rosen Maiden. Ooh. They're doing a Rosen Maiden game? Apparently. It's coming out this week. Can you see? You sure can. Let me bring that up. It's regular and limited edition, actually. Oh, that's cool. And trying to see. There's no screenshots, sadly. Just the box art. Rosen Maiden is a story about dolls. It's actually pretty good. On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan? Nothing. On the Playstation Vita this week in Japan, however, Rosen Maiden is released there as well. Maikai Senkai Disgaea 4 Return comes out as well this week on the Vita. Ibikore plus Amagami comes out as well. So a few games on the Vita this week on the 30th. On the Wii U this week, the Wii U Fit Meter, the Balance Board and all that, that all comes out on February 1st in Japan. So you have that to look forward to. Lastly, checking the 3DS, you have Toshintoshi. Girls' Gift RPG comes out this week in Japan. I've got to see what this is all about. Girls' Gift RPG. I've seen this before somewhere. What in the hell is that screenshot? These are like up. This is not a G-rated game. Tell me you're surprised. Look at that. I can see her taint in that picture. She's pointing at it. Is she fucking a bug? I don't know what she's doing. That is disgusting. Of course, this is where everybody's like, I wish this wasn't a radio show. Google this, I guess. I'll put a link in our chat room there. Maybe Jason can put it on the video. We'll see. I don't know. That might get us banned from YouTube. You know where I saw it was J-list. Toshintoshi Girls' Gift RPG. I don't want to know if she's pointing at her gift in that picture. There you go, chatters. Of course, on the app I'm in. Oh, no, that's her leg. The app that I'm using, it just pops up the image. Oh, nice. Wow, I just saw Cooch. There's definitely a gift for some people. Moving on. Your gift goes squish. It's a fleshy gift. Alright. Lalalalala. Not attractive. So, on the 30th of January in the UK is Octodad, Deadliest Catch. And... Rymdkapsel? Rymdkapsel. R-Y-M-D-K-A-P-S-E-L. Something vaguely German. Rymdkapsel. On the 31st we have Loadout on PC, Naruto Shippuden, Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst, extra, extra names, more names added for business. And then that's Xbox 360 and PS3. And then Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PS4 and the X-Bone. And that's it. Do we need to start screen? There's a game coming out called Ultimate Gay Fighter. Really? Well, it's one of those undated games listed down there. For January in general. Ultimate Gay Fighter. Which means somebody said at one point it would be out in January. It's not actually, probably. I'm trying to see if there's actually anything on it and there's nothing here. Maybe somebody added that as a troll. Who knows. Alright. Let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week. It's me, isn't it? It is you, Jason. Xbox 3606 got released for Android in the last... Was it just this last week? It's pretty recently. And an article went up talking about the Turnerization of video games artistic legacy. Basically, in short, it's the fact that Turner would buy up cheaper properties and then automatically colorize them to the best of their automatic ability so that they have some additional value that they can add which led to very exaggerated and unrealistic color tones being applied to certain things in the background or what have you. For you younger folks that are listening you may or may not be aware of this so I'll just let the old man tell you for a minute that back when cable was a lot newer like in the 80s and late 80s I remember when the Turner classic movies came out it was very controversial because they would colorize the old movies. And so yeah, that's what he's talking about. He's talking about the Turnerization is that you colorized black and white movies to make them look modern and some people think it's cool, some people hate it. And for what it's worth, I'm staring at this screenshot of It's a Wonderful Life and we actually had a rotation of Christmas movies, holiday movies playing in the office for around the holiday around the Christmas week and they were all Christmas life and a Christmas story and Die Hard randomly I don't exactly know why but a whole bunch of black and white movies in black and white on rotation. And when I read this article I was like, yeah I get it I know what it means to for all intents and purposes port something like this but now that I'm actually looking at the screenshot of It's a Wonderful Life in color it's actually a little bit weird and this isn't the same thing as like It's a neat comparison I think it's a very neat question to be asking, I like this article a lot I gotta say because when you look at a game like Final Fantasy VI on iOS it is kinda like, why did they do this? The argument, I haven't even gotten to the point yet Well I know why they did it In the context of Final Fantasy VI you look at comparative screenshots of the original SNES version and then you take the Android version and all of the sprites, all of the characters all of the enemies, all of the backgrounds the overworld, everything was meticulously crafted to the limitations of the platform every single pixel counted and we're talking about what, 320 by 240? that's not even that's not even 100,000 pixels on screen assuming that was even the resolution we're talking tiny, tiny, tiny that whole era of gaming, Game Boy, NES, SNES that's like what a watch does for resolution these days seriously, the pebbles are actually a little bit better than that, I think until the optical media generation began to be polygons and objects and depth of that kind of stuff basically Playstation, Saturn, etc back in the cartridge generation small factor cartridge generation everything, we just covered this with Pokemon and towns everything is so specifically meticulously crafted to get all of the detail possible in, you know as much size as you can do it's a fucking wonder that Resident Evil ever fit onto an N64 cartridge with voice acting and the characters and everything else, but you're looking at these screenshots of Final Fantasy 6 SNES and Android and SNES is for those of us that played it familiar, and especially very definitive of Square of the saga, of the era but then you look at the Android version and it's muddy it's a little bit washed out there's a little bit more vibrancy to it but at the lack of any single pixel discernible detail that was, you know, making the point that they were trying to convey the water is a bit murkier and calmer actually in this particular shot it looks like, honest to god, it just looks like I think there's a certain look they're going for, but it looks like bad Photoshop filter throughout the whole game I mean, it's really what it looks like and it's interesting, because this kind of thing does not happen all the time there's three different things that can happen it can either be completely unchanged like all of the Final Fantasy re-releases on the Playstation, it can be done for the sake of moving it to another platform, a poor port like we're making the point of Final Fantasy 6 and it's not a port of an existing game, but Final Fantasy 4 DS was actually really impressive in what they did with it to still keep the motif of the original game and bring the quality up three generations four generations, one of the two but it's it's interesting to try to consider what the actual process was of redoing all of these assets because you can on a different platform, not to mention you have to, to fit just the technical differences of resolution and everything between the SNES and Android but presumably because you're just doing it to make it look like it was and slightly better when you lose you're basically losing culture, you're losing design, you're losing the point of the reason that these games were created in the first place yeah I think there's a lot of people reacting to Final Fantasy 6 like wow this is a cheap cash grab cash in game, I'm not pleased with this, because you know Final Fantasy 6 is kind of sacred text to a lot of people, that is like the best video game of all time to a lot of people certainly the best in the Final Fantasy series to many people a friend of mine posted something I don't know if it he's the master at lack of context yet stunningly good timing the greatest benefit of modern consoles is their ability to emulate the old ones so if this kind of thing is as big of a turn off as it is to you rightfully so there's still the opportunity to play the original version if you don't have the original medium yeah it's gonna be a little bit different but you can still get so much of that specific detail back she's saying that she still has all the original consoles and the original carts and everything to play this on we just got plastic protectors for our games that were in the box and one of the games in the box says Final Fantasy quote 3 unquote and you can find a way to do this kind of thing and it is a shame that the waters are a little bit muddied it's it's how the company has decided to take the game forward into this new era literally two decades later awesome unicorn in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says it's the same way that Theatrhythm and the Kingdom Hearts browser game looks they must have some artist at Square Enix who just loves that style and I'm saying this comment but I imagine by some artist at Square Enix you mean their outsourced vendor in China just saying Simpsons is animated by a studio in Korea 100% anymore anyhow let's move on one other story here because we're going to get into we're going to get into what Jason just talked about again a little bit later but I want to quickly talk about this a big announcement from SOE Sony Online Entertainment not to be confused with the folks that are behind the Playstation 4 Sony's entertainment division but SOE does a lot of their online things EverQuest, DC Universe Online and so forth well SOE is going to be doing this all access plan they've just announced this and the all access plan will include top tier membership level in all SOE games that includes EverQuest EverQuest 2, DC Universe Online Planetside 2, Vanguard EverQuest Next and EverQuest Next Landmark and that will be one low monthly rate of $14.99 there will be of course more savings if you do 3, 6 or 12 months at a time that's custom for most MMOs this is kind of interesting that they're doing this one all access pass now it probably should be noted that I believe all these games are free to play anyway so it's not or they are now, they may not have always been like EverQuest used to have a fee with it and so on and so did DC Universe for a short while but they're all free to play now so you're really paying this fee to have basically top level access you know which is going to be the extra perks and inventory and character slots and so forth that you would expect for all these games so this is interesting that you have that one excuse me, that one subscription fee there so ah yeah, it's going to happen about April 2nd they say any existing membership will be automatically upgraded to the new plan that's good news for people that might be paying separate fees right now for top level access and say EverQuest and EverQuest 2 and so forth, so pretty cool so, alright anyhow let's take a moment to travel back to when, you know, there was no online entertainment that was, that wasn't you couldn't call in online unless you had Sega Channel that's how you had online X-band, which was hilariously bad only the rich kids had that stuff not me, or if it was like the very close to early 90s you had AOL, you know in DOS so alright, here it is, your classic game of the week for all this fancy online connectivity crap you'll need it go outside, DarkSocker's going to dive into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey you should be playing this game, or you're you're dumb and stuff well, to keep up with my theme of using games that have been represented in Namco High, and I'm getting a little tired of Namco games, this might be the last one for now, I love you Namco I love you Namco, but still, I've done a bunch Dragon Spirit it was a 1987 scrolling shooter game that was released by Namco it was very loud, sorry, we have a dragon shooting fire over here, sorry about that I'm not sure if I'm attached to it, but no, I didn't have an intro for some reason but it was released by Atari Games in the US and it runs on the Namco System 1 hardware that was later ported to the Amstrad CPC Commodore Amiga, Commodore 64 DOS, Atari ST, X68000 the PC Engine and TurboGrafx and the ZX Spectrum platforms so basically kind of the story is that there was a serpent demon named Zawel that escaped its imprisonment after a thousand years and kidnapped Princess Alicia, so a soldier named Amul has to rescue her and destroy Zawel oh, there's the intro I just thought it was, it's really pretty, pretty epic it's a dragon taking off from a cliff, and the music in the game is pretty good, I mean oh it takes a minute to get into it, so anyway, so basically you have to, you can collect up to 13 additional powers, apart from what he comes with which is breathing fire and dropping bombs he turns into the blue dragon, by the way I forgot to say that, cause anyone who turns into a blue dragon and isn't in the game blue dragon is pretty cool so he can burst flames, drop bombs, which I guess would be dragon poop, dragon poop has to be pretty flammable and Amul is pretty big when he's just doing the flying through the screen he takes two hits before losing a life, and three in some versions, the power-ups give you extra heads that may double or triple your firepower but they also increase your exposure, so while you were stronger, you were also a bigger freaking target, and bless this game for doing that even though it made playing it really freaking frustrating so yeah, there were other releases there was a sort of sequel on the Famicom that came out as Dragon Spirit the new legend which was a port that took place a generation after the original game, there was an arcade sequel called Dragon Saber that came out in 1990 that allowed for two player simultaneous play, Dragon Spirit was released on PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 and it was very close to the arcade version and the sound quality of that I must say, since this is a game that I do own it's really freaking good and SSJ-100 Matt in chat says that I always thought those were Dragon Vomit yeah, because Dragon Vomit is flammable and kills people so there was also an emulated version that came in the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary and Namco Museum volume 5 for the Playstation also the PC Engine version was added to Nintendo Virtual Console in 2007 and on December 8th, 2009 the arcade version came out as part of the Virtual Console arcade in Japan and on November 4th 2008 came out on Xbox 360 with the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade Playstation Network does have a release, it's a downloadable game for PS3 and that's under Namco Museum essentials and as part of the Pac-Man 30th Anniversary in 2010, Dragon Spirit was released as part of Pac-Man's arcade party, 30th Anniversary arcade machine along with Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga and a bunch of other games so there you have it, Dragon Spirit and it's a really fun little arcade shooter, it's just not quite the the usual thing one expects yeah, I like this game a lot, it's in that Namco collection on Playstation 3 that's got some neat games in it I've played this a lot on there I almost wonder if this partly didn't inspire other there's another game that involved writing I want to say it was Psychic Storm but maybe not but I honestly think that this just added such a unique feel to a genre that's been out for quite some time and we don't maybe have as many shooting games like this that survived, you know, anymore we still get some of the Raiden games but I would love to see a new Dragon Spirit there it is, your classic game of the week, Dragon Spirit an arcade game I'd like to add, actually, Dungeon Buster made a good point that it had a health bar which was pretty unusual for the time, but like I said it was a two hit you know, two hits you die but that was your health bar and a lot of life alright, well, that is going to do it for the first half of our show but we've got plenty more show to come including the FUGO Question of the Week talking about the Turnerization of Games opinion piece, which website was that from? BAV Club? I just want to make sure they got credit we're going to talk about that big that big name lawsuit that everybody's talking about this week we're going to get into that fuckery it's such a sweet story, love gross I see what you did there we also have your mails, FUs of the Week, your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio where we are having episode number 537 in progress for this January the 26th of 2014 myself, DarkSakura, and voice of the show Jason here with you guys tonight not here tonight Loki, if you missed our announcement in part A, Loki and Mrs. Loki welcomed Daniel Layton their new son to the world earlier this week on Tuesday, so Loki will be off until he decides he's ready to come back which knowing Loki will probably be next week but we won't hold him to it he'll come back when he's ready alright, we still got plenty of news to take care of so let's get into it some rapid fire news Jason, if you wouldn't mind starting us off today oh yeah, I guess I did a really good job of distracting myself and not paying attention to the fact that I'm starting this okay following the discussion of Final Fantasy 6 on Android Final Fantasy 6 on Android has a major freezing glitch it was released last week to the Google Play Store and the new version comes with graphical improvements yeah, we knew all that spoilerific, maybe possibly, but to cut a long story short and to obscure any of the details the glitch prevents gamers from completing the game play if you want, it happens it happens man, I I'm unfortunately kind of running out of my knowledge with Final Fantasy 6 and I really don't want to give away any kind of a key plot point the game freezes in Thamassa if you're there and you don't want to have to redo the game stop playing there wait for an update to become available update it, the problem will be fixed Square Enix recently registered the seeds of salvation in the US as the speculation continues to abound the current theory is that this is a western localization for Dragon Quest to be used for, this trademark could be the Nintendo 3DS remake of Dragon Quest 7, or maybe even for the suite of smartphone remakes like the Unity powered Dragon Quest 8 Journey of the Cursed King we'll see a trademark a trademark may not go anywhere, just like a patent or anything else we'll see what they wind up doing with it when the game becomes available more hints towards a re-release of Majora's Mask are being dropped from Nintendo in A Link Between Worlds director Hiromasa Shikata has teased in an interview with Game Informer that the remake could be coming because having Majora's Mask in Link's house was a special request from Aonuma's production team now why would they ask us to do that? well we'll just have to wait and see and this can't possibly be a surprise hello Ocarina of Time 3D it's a matter of getting the game to look correctly and since I missed it the first time around I am very much looking forward to playing Majora's Mask 3DS on the 3DS if it happens if it happens gee let's think about this something that finally happened after months and months and months and months and months and months of waiting is that Blizzard made Hearthstone in open beta I installed it and didn't play it wrong company after pretty much everybody who wanted to play the beta was already in the closed beta Blizzard finally opened the super special secret club of people playing Hearthstone namely everybody to the world so yeah Blizzard has opened up Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft so for whatever reason you just forgot you wanted to play it at some point you can actually download that and check that out fun it's only available however in North America right now so when will the game officially launch knowing Blizzard it will probably be in 2017 I didn't know Blizzard and Valve were so similar Blizzard does things soon which again I just don't care tonight so I'm just gonna tell you big reason I cancelled my World of Warcraft account is because that expansion is not happening in the next few months there is gonna be nothing to do in World of Warcraft for about six months until that expansion gets here no no no no rep rep grinding Rob rep grinding oh yay and the raids that aren't really that much fun anymore but anyway I digress didn't mean to turn it into a hate fest I don't hate hate is a strong word it's just Warcraft and I are seeing other people right now that's all it is you're seeing other MMOs that's right moving on I did not realize this was a Steam feature I'm using my little quotey hands feature because I've never preordered a game on Steam but apparently if you were to preorder a game on Steam you would actually have to contact customer support to cancel that preorder you couldn't just like click a button that's like wait never mind or cancel well no more will you have to do that as the refund an item button is now displayed on Steam so if you wish to cancel a preorder you can do so just as easily as you can place the preorder which I always thought was the way it should be but whatever so there you go well now it is hooray hooray one thing that I'm sure many of you didn't order because this would cost a lot of money I think this actually ended up going for over $90,000 it was a copy of the super rare Nintendo World Championship NES cartridge and this cartridge really looked like shit there's no other way to put it but this thing looked like it had been in a dumpster somebody had scratched the label off and written in a Bic pen Mario because I guess the first game in Nintendo World Championship was Mario you can tell like mom or dad did this it's Mario but anyway so it was found and there's only 116 of these cartridges in the world so they always go for a crap ton of money even when they look like such garbage like this game did on the outside it's a pearl on the inside because it's a very rare little tournament game so yeah let me see if I can find the final amount right now here on eBay oh it went for $99,902 I want to know who paid that you know what do you want to bet they're not going to it was just a troll bid it was probably 4chan that placed that bid let's be honest alright there you go Dark Sakura sorry the moment you pass it over to me and my lungs protest alright yeah yeah well there is something that was and I was very impressed by this when I saw it today in my browsing is that there is going to be a preview for Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 but this is specifically going to happen in Australia and the reason being is that it's also a blood drive so if you are in Sydney on Thursday the 30th from 5 o'clock onward if you go to the Elizabeth Street donor center at 20 Elizabeth Street you can not only play Castlevania Lords of Shadow 2 you could possibly save up to 3 lives for every pint of blood you can it's usable by up to 3 people so eat a lot of spinach and you know steak that morning and make sure you pass your hematocrit and give blood and let us know how the game is does Australia allow the gays to donate blood? I don't know I don't live there I think that's stupid it is stupid well in other news there is something showing up on the Wii U Virtual Console this week and that is Mighty Bomb Jack the NES game also known as the scourge of Game Center CX GX? CX whatever well basically you just use bombs as a weapon and you jump and look for treasure and do stuff so hooray it's 5 bucks which is about what you'd pay for it at the flea market and then I want dammit Rob why do you link me stuff because when it says these two magic words I automatically know oh this is a story Jamie wants to see there is a mod for the Starbound beta that has elements from Mass Effect so now it's Starbound Mass Effect edition and it is officially my favorite mod on the Citadel just saying but it actually adds in the Biotics so you can lift and slow down things and I guess singularities and what not and it converts your ship to the Normandy to the original SR1 from the first Mass Effect so you have all kinds of different races showing up there and you just need to use the Kawa's Xbox mode character creator and the simple extend the character creation mod and the stuff is up on the Starbound forums so let me know if it works I may or may not be trying this tomorrow hahaha alright uh dar2 is in our chat room saying I thought the Mass Effect fans on OLR would like that yeah I saw that too and I said very yes was my response alright let's go to the Foogle question of the week you take Facebook, you take Google Plus and you slam those words together and you get what we call Boogle as I promised this week's question on Foogle relates to the Turnerization of video games article that Jason read earlier from ABClub.com so we decided we would ask our listeners what do you think about remaking classic games do you think it's a good thing for the classic games or would classic games be better left untouched and resources spent on new games I'm going to read just a few of these answers from Facebook so I'm going to tell you guys please go check out facebook.com slash orange launch radio to read all of the answers on the show but I'm so happy to see Princess Irene answering the question this week our good old friend Princess Irene is back and she said so succinctly in her very Irene style her reply is it's total bullshit which I can't do in her voice because I haven't heard her voice in years it's total bullshit is what Irene said about remaking classic games Daniel S says they can remake games all they want it won't take away from what they made long ago I just wish devs would pay more attention to the consoles they're porting to that and support the game post launch stupid Chrono Trigger IOS port is stupid I vaguely remember there being some series of bugs or just like the selection or something I forgot there was a Chrono Trigger port I'm pretty sure we covered it I stopped downloading those IOS remakes I just stopped, I couldn't I threw up my hands and said I can't and that was it Moving on to Awesome Unicorn who says I support remakes and reimaginings that offer significant changes or improvements over the original a la the Final Fantasy 4 DS remake or the Lufia 2 DS reimagining Mobile ports of Final Fantasy 5 and 6 just feel like they've been changed simply so new artists can list the games on their resumes Want to put a significant work into improving the graphics and gameplay experiences? Please feel free to do so Want to make a quick buck? Save yourself the time and effort put your game on Virtual Console or Playstation Network and start working on something else I like it, that's an order Our good pal Jeremy from Koopa Club answers the question and says remaking a classic game is totally fine if done correctly A good Square Enix example is the DS remake of Final Fantasy 4 or Dragon Quest 5 Pretty much everybody is making exactly the same point I did The Final Fantasy 4 DS remake is absurdly good Which really started with the 3 remake and I think a lot of us were hoping I think a lot of us were hoping for that with 6 and then we get this and we're like cash in Ziba replies and says I love remakes especially ones remade for IOS because I get to play them on the go SSJ100Matt says when a game is remade for the right reasons and the right way it can be great When it's used as a quick, half-assed cash grab then it only hurts the legacy and image that game once had A great way to remake a game is with the help of the community Chrono Trigger resurrection had a lot of promise made by fans and independent people wanting to share the favorite game with a new generation Sadly it was stopped before it could be finished Well because they were going to do that IOS port that we all forgot about My friend Shane who's going to be here next week says I think it's okay to remake a game if it's stupidly hard to get your hands on a copy and you've already given up hope of a straight up port coming to some device Something like C code in 2 or whatever could benefit from such a practice The graphics was super dumb to do though It's already on a lot of different platforms and they made it look worse with odd script changes So bad I'm hearing all of that in Shane's voice So bad Gamergirl says I don't see anything wrong with redoing some games because it gives people who haven't played the original nor can they find them a chance to play Looking at a few of the answers from Google Plus Let's see ActDeft gave us a haiku version, we love haikus Remakes are okay but if the devs are lazy the port will be bad Flaco Jones Remakes are okay No it's fine Don't make me police the police Flaco Jones says I'm fine with remakes but I think the original version should be bundled in there as well so the classic game can still be experienced and appreciated That's a good way of doing it I like that idea AJ Twist lastly on Google Plus says Remakes are good as long as there are no significant changes that change the gameplay or story. Changes to the story that make it better to understand are always welcome in my opinion. I think some remakes should include an original port so we can better appreciate the new and old versions. Kids need a reason to play some classics Flaco Jones answer is actually pretty interesting because Cave Story has really epitomized this. It doesn't exactly have the lifetime and the multiple generation. It doesn't span multiple generations to see what's gonna happen but Cave Story started as and still is an indie title but its groundswell has just continued to grow and grow and grow over the last I don't even know when it originally came out. I want to say two years now I want to say 2012 but there's like three different versions of the game There is the original pixel art and very crude synthesized music and then they kind of refined it and upgraded it and made it look less blocky but still a motif of that style Yep They improved everything, made it, added yet another depth of detail, gave it more style, improved the soundtrack and really brought it up and apparently there's even a third tier where the music I've heard the music, it's more it's more full production fully featured production instead of like little synthesized designs and then the graphics are fully fleshed out but still kept in a blocky style Three very distinct styles in two years is pretty crazy but every version lets you select from any combination of them both independently graphics and sound Alright Those were some of the answers from Facebook and Google Plus I read about half of them tonight just for time's sake to keep things moving so I'm sorry I didn't read all the answers, thank you to everybody that took the time to answer and I encourage all of our listeners to read what people had to say over at facebook.com slash orange launch radio and google.com slash plus orange launch radio Alright, let's travel on with some more news Loki Loki Sorry, I'm so used to seeing it on the show roll Alright, not Loki Loki imposter Bigger beard Loki As spotted on LinkedIn from the profile of Rob Stokes, the senior level designer at Harmonix an unannounced Kinect game for the Xbox One has allegedly been cancelled. In mid-2012 Harmonix originally announced that they had several projects in the works that were not related to Rock Band or Dance Central or Fantasia Music Evolved but no further details were given on any of these outside of a spotted job listing looking for a combat designer in 2012 to be used for next generation hardware. Last year Harmonix stopped dropping DLC weekly for Rock Band and went through two waves of layoffs. The only comments provided when asked about changes to their upcoming lineup were responsible for the highest rated Kinect titles for Xbox 360 with our Dance Central franchise and we're very excited by the possibilities of the new motion sensing technology for Xbox One. Right now our Kinect development is focused on the already announced Disney Fantasia Music Evolved a title which we believe further innovates in both the motion gaming and music space Nothing else to confirm today other than a heads up that we've got a lot of stuff happening that you'll hear about soon and by soon they probably mean six months from now at E3, five months from now An unknown game gets canned Well rest in peace game we never knew you I mean but I don't know I I'd hate to be all like doom and gloom but I kind of worry about Harmonix like you know the Rock Band bubble kind of burst we haven't really seen a lot from them lately I know there's this Fantasia thing which is gonna be a big deal but it's it's still not here and now they're canceling projects we've heard about layoffs like and it's not like Harmonix makes a bunch of stinkers it's just like you know the Rock Band bubble kind of burst like They don't They don't make a bunch of stinkers but I don't think they get the critical acclaim like we would all hope that we would all prefer that they did Let's be honest frequency and amplitude were amazing games they weren't exactly the biggest sellers But Rock Band was huge Rock Band was an absolute run away And Activision really screwed that whole thing up but anyway it's neither here nor there Yeah Well good luck with whatever Harmonix is working on maybe they'll be able to blow us away at the next E3 We love you Harmonix and we look forward to seeing everything you do for now and as long as you continue to be able to do it Which we hope is a very long time I somehow doubt that Harmonix's next game would be called Music Saga Because Thank you I'm bowing Because as I'm sure many of you have heard this week King Is it king.com or king? I guess they're king and they're located at king.com but anyway This company, you know what they're Zinga2 I'm gonna call them Zinga2 Because that's what they are to me Zinga2 Has decided to Trademark the word candy They now And they got it So they basically own the trademark on the word candy When it comes to video games I mean if you want to sell Candy in the grocery store that's one thing but you will make a Video game with the word candy in it that's another And by the way they also Got the word saga So if you want to make a game with the name Saga in it you will have to Answer to king The makers of the banner saga learned in this the hard way When king sent them a cease and desist In king's defense King came out and said well We're not really like we really We don't really think the banner saga is like Trying to infringe on our trademark We have to do this because if we don't Defend it then people are gonna come Along and you know Will lose the trademark and then people Will try to make their you know Clone games And to be fair On the iOS marketplace and the Google Android play market There's a lot of shitty clones To try to ride the success of these games But where do we draw the line people? I've even seen those at 3am shitty advertising too And you all I know you're all sitting there expecting me to say LOL Square Enix, Saga Frontier LOL, 7th Saga LOL, Candy was a song In DDR, etc, etc I mean yeah I mean it's Ridiculous that they own the trademark on Those words because Especially in the case of Saga There's so many other games That have nothing to do With a game that was ripped off Fucking bejeweled in the first place Again I'm just keeping it real tonight It's a little silly that when their game is a rip Off in the first place they get the Right to these words I think I I played Candy Crush A little bit I couldn't even tell you how much I'm pretty sure I thought it was a Zynga game and I stopped Only for Not only for lack of interest but also in the The great Zynga But Not petition Boycott? Thank you the great Zynga boycott of 2013 And the previous fucking 3 years 2 anyways The thing about Them saying that they have to go through Due process and they don't actually want it to happen Is that it doesn't work out that way Either they Either the The person they charge follows the cease and desist And makes a name change or Cans the project out right Or the person they charge with it rebukes And King loses the Trademark Only if they Only if the Party doesn't like Countersue or whatever the appropriate Motion is will the whole Process just get settled and dropped But if anybody balks at this They're gonna lose the trademark That's what happens They shouldn't have been given this trademark in the first place Oh absolutely, everything else about this Is fucking absurd They should have been given the trademark for Candy Crush Saga Because Candy hasn't Existed for I don't even know How many decades Candy Land How does Who owns the Milton Bradley suite now God they've all changed hands so many times Somebody should have a yell it out Is it Hasbro? They have every right To make the game Candy Land As a pour on iPhone If they want I fucking double dog dare King To go sue the makers of Candy Land Yep And then it'll throw the whole thing Honestly what I would like to see happen Is Milton Bradley Or whatever holdings Go after them Just to prove a point I would love to see that Hasbro you were correct I would love to see them prove a point Just to go bitch please Um You know it's Weird though because in a roundabout way It's actually given a lot of additional exposure For Banner Saga which is um you know That's a good thing for them But yeah it's just so ridiculous Like those people that are working hard Making the Banner Saga they should not have to deal With this fuckery That's the real problem it's a waste Of resources This is not their fucking problem It's really gross That they're having to even deal with this The only silver lining is that the entire Internet community backs them And so it's a great amount of exposure For their game at least take solace In that a lot of people heard about Banner Saga That wouldn't have heard about it otherwise Let's be real So that's the positive So what are they going to change it to like Banner story or But here's the other problem with Zynga 2 Is just like the mother ship Zynga They have a history of fucking copying Games Candy Crush Saga is a copy of Jewel Quest Which in turn is a copy of Bejeweled So yet they want to prevent Other people doing what they did Anyway in my opinion Allegedly just throwing those words out there Just in case But it is on record that King Supposedly Copied another game And they called it Pack-a-void They tried to go after another developer Back in 2009 because they wanted to Basically buy their game and put it out But King put out a statement this week Because you know Reddit's going to find it 4chan and all the internet community people They're going to find it and they're going to bring it to light There'll be a NeoGaf post and then everybody goes Yeah take them down, take them down, show King Stick it to the man and so forth And that's exactly what happened is that it came out This developer said hey King tried to buy my game In 2009 then they just copied it And put out Pack-a-void instead So King had to put out a statement King does not clone other people's games King believes that IP Both our own IP and that of others Is important and should be properly protected Like any prudent company we take all appropriate steps To protect our IP in a sensible and fair way At the same time we are respectful Of the rights and IP of other developers Sorry just letting that comment sink in for a minute Before we launch any game We do a thorough search of other games In the marketplace as well as review of Trademark filings to ensure that we are not Infringing anyone else's IP However for the avoidance of doubt in this case The game which was coded by a third party Developer five years ago has Been taken down Let's see I believe What happened is that The developer who made this Clone actually Came out and said yeah King kind of hired me To do this and I had to do it quickly And I had to get it out before the Original game Scamper Ghost was set to be Released essentially So What happened is that they came out and said King contracted the third party To make the game he made it at their Request to their specifications so King is Responsible I'm fairly certain 99% Of people everyone except King Would agree that Pack Avoid is a clone Of Scamper Ghost and that was a statement From Matthew Cox Who was the developer who Made Scamper Ghost Essentially so I mean it's Ridiculous that they were given this trademark in the first Place The old laws are not Working when it comes to intellectual property In this country I'm gonna say In this country a bunch of the laws aren't Working when it comes to anything Well seriously I think Well at least we're not in an all out full blown War I mean there are some things that are Working but you're right there's a lot of Fucked up shit period There's a lot of broken things that need to just be completely Thrown out and revamped No one wants to Alright Ah There you go I think we all agree it's Fuckery does anyone want to try To take the devil's advocate position even if I'm having a hard Time in this circumstance I mean I understand there is a lot of clones There's a lot of people and there's some guy that Spoke out that made A game and get a load of this name What was the guy He made a game call and he's been contacted By King's legal team the creator of Quote all candy casino Slots jewel craze connect Big blast mania land Yeah that's not SEO bait Look girl You're the reason why Zynga 2 has This leverage To be like those types Of games are the reason why even though A slot machine game may have nothing to do With candy although I'm surprised candy crush Saga is not you know rip that off too But Like you know even though the the slot Machine game may be kind of different let's Be real that name is Fuck you're fucking baiting people with that name That's why they got that trademark Is because of you Just think about that for a minute I guess that's as far as the devil's advocate Position I can go Let's move on let's do something happy I need happy news dark soccer give me some happy news Happy is like me I don't have any Oh yeah I do have happy Well you know we talked about Ubisoft in Part A well how about some more Ubisoft news They are going to be adding Roughly a hundred Jobs for their Quebec City studio They're planning on investing 25 million and About 460,000 Of that is from the government of Quebec That's going to strengthen The company's infrastructure So they Are they already have about 360 employees and they're going to be Bringing on about another hundred so Yay for boosting Canada's job market Because they've been hit hard too Right yeah so I Just think when we have a story about that there's jobs Being added as opposed to taken away that's a good thing That's good news Like hearing that so congrats To Ubisoft that means things are going well over there Indeed And you know I I honestly hope to see I mean clearly Ubisoft Is running kind of you know Strongly right now so I'd like to see what You know the spells for the future I'd like to see you try to say you don't have the resources To port things to Wii U Yeah Oh burn Had to Alright Jason what do you got Minecraft's sales have exceeded One million in just A month It's first month of life on the PS3 Um Since its release As an overall recap since its release Eleven million units of the PC version Have been sold as of last June So even that figure is Probably pretty grossly out of date At this point The Xbox 360 version has another Ten million sales Ten million players which I think Is a bit of a misnomer Attached to sales but at any rate The Xbox 360 version has another Ten million players Has another ten million Players joining that number There's a lot of people that own both or all three Like I own the 360 version and the PC version But Notch still says that it ain't gonna make it To the Wii U So we continue to cry But eleven plus ten plus one and invariably I would throw out very Like another four million or something like that Just PC sales alone Not half bad for the For the survival Blocky create everything Yourself kind of adventure I'm looking forward to seeing those crisp Graphics on the Playstation 4 when that Version is released Pixel art like you wouldn't believe It'll look exactly the same Of course that was a joke Well I would imagine some of those limitations When it comes to you know the space you have to work with And so forth like that's gonna change but I was reading something I don't know if this Translates to the console versions I'll save I need I wanna Read more about it I'll save it till the end of the show Okay good sales for the PS3 It's gonna be a powerful source again Powerful force against the PC and Xbox as well Ummm You think it's not Gonna jump up to the double digit millions? Oh on the Playstation 3 and 4 The only reason it wouldn't is because I think most people that are interested in it Have already bought it on PC or Xbox 360 But I mean don't Underestimate what a huge flipping game Minecraft is I am always surprised I think I talked about this in a prior week but I overheard One of my co-workers talking Like you know the middle-aged Ladies that I work with one of them was talking about how She was playing Minecraft got addicted to it over the holiday And like not the type of gal I usually expect to be playing video games when I heard She was playing Minecraft I was kinda like that's kinda rad She was talking about the creepers and you know Trying to dodge and she's like you gotta build houses I was explaining it to another person you gotta build these houses And stay away I was You know this game is huge I was actually gonna wear a different shirt tonight But the fact that I had this on Is pretty coincidental Two three weeks ago I was at Wells Fargo And the lady that I was working with Asked me about my shirt I'm wearing If anybody has checked out the GitHub shop I'm not gonna go too crazy with it But GitHub has a bunch of themed shirts The shirt that I'm wearing right now Is a pixel art version Of the Octocat The GitHub mascot and it's in a 8-bit pixelated version And so the person that I'm working with Sees this and she's asking me If it's Minecraft and I had to kinda I had to kinda dance around the issue Because I was like It's that kind of a style It doesn't have anything to do with Minecraft But they were both inspired from the same thing And you know Of all of the things that 8-bit would mean something to someone The fact that Minecraft Can kind of be that common Thread of understanding Is reasonably interesting And to notch And to notch's credit It is very Obvious, very definitive And it is very well done When you're seeing Minecraft stuff at Walmart Yeah right? Yeah That says a lot right there Well I don't go to Walmart But that's the course that Angry Birds took So yes, I agree with that statement completely I don't like to give them my business But I was there helping Becky Find stuff for her son for Christmas That's fair I ended up there too for something It was the one place in town That supposedly had a Playstation 4 camera Because I've been trying to get that one Oh my god, it is impossible Sorry for the tangent train It is fucking impossible to find a Playstation 4 camera They are all gone I was on a tip On Twitter, I went to Fries.com To order a Playstation camera which they said would ship January 26th And I was like, alright, I'll wait the week, whatever So I placed the order, you know, 70 bucks or whatever New update, 2015 No, I get an email, we're sorry We're not going to be able to ship on the day We'll hold your pre-order if you want to cancel Call such and such a number I was kind of irritated Why did you advertise something you knew you couldn't Uphold? I was a little irritated at that Anyhow I mean, I don't need it I want it for broadcasting That would be fun and doing other things But it's not changing my opinion It's a little frustrating They're so flipping hard to find Anyhow, let's talk about something that will be Maybe a little easier to find When it comes out Sanity? Sanity 2? This game is Slightly punishing Some people see it as, you know, it's like The Dark Souls of 2D platformers But anyhow They first announced the Sequel for WiiWare and PC And now they're going to raise $200,000 to try to get this It looks like it will probably, actually I'm kind of Curious where they're at right now 120, nope, go away 127,000, 26 days to go 26 days to go So four days they've already Comfortable funding Now that I've mentioned it here They'll get another 100,000 But anyway Yeah, if you like The retro adventure games You're going to get a kick out of this For $15 you get The Steam and DRM free copy Of the game on release So it's basically pre-ordering a game that will be done in a year If they get certain stretch goals They're looking at 3DS and Vita versions At 1.15 million Wii U, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Versions at 1.65 million Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 At 2.35 million Those stretch goals are quote Subject to negotiation Be interesting to see how that goes So yeah Pretty cool Fans of La Mulana like Dark Tetsuya I know are very happy about that Alright Pretty happy to see it's a new character too Sugi, fun stuff This game is really In the same vein of everything that we've talked about before This game is so incredibly Meticulous as well From when it was originally released in 20 Shit Before 2010 it was originally like 2007 Or so And the PC remake That they made is The Wii version was rather tame But the PC remake that was released last year Or 2012 I can't recall I remember the Wii one was delayed Dramatically improved And yet another game with a storied history Of something that has just been Refined and refined and refined For the better And now they're continuing forward with new content Perfect, wonderful Alright Well let's look at the wonderful content that sits inside our mailbag Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails Every week Dark Sakura dives in the Mailbag head first And pulls out a couple emails that she Believes are worthy of repeating Here on this program How many emails do we have tonight? Three Three emails I haven't checked for anything else and I'm only going to read these three Probably just a bunch of spam Howdy gang stars Howdy I'd like to expand on the thoughts that I tried to express In the FUGL question of the week from last week I was unable to do so due to the confines of an outdated Artform that only exists in the modern world For the purposes of nostalgia QQ more Also known as Haikus Haikus For people who didn't catch that Like I didn't catch that mic Just now By the way Haiku is not outdated It is still in use Nintendo has a unique place in the marketplace But only But one only also held by Sony and Microsoft In addition to being a video game developer Nintendo is As is well known a console creator While their role as a video game developer Allows them to be much more unique In how they approach the market Nintendo's role as a console creator is much different In that role Nintendo must not Offer a product That is tailored for any specific use Or function They must instead provide a product that allows for A wide variance Of products and services A narrow focus on specific tasks And function serves to only limit The products the company other than Nintendo Can utilize on their console If not incentivize companies To avoid the console altogether For that reason Nintendo should work to broaden the kinds of products And services That companies other than Nintendo can put on their Current console the Wii U One of the ways they can do this is by providing A decent stable and safe online environment That can be utilized through the Wii U And I need to renew my chat room Because it's not working Where was I? It doesn't have to be a robust service Like Xbox Live or PSN I help my nieces spend hours a day Playing games on the Disney website They don't have to sign in or provide any Information in order to play My nieces can just call up the Disney games website Click on whatever particular game they want to play And enjoy Perhaps Nintendo could come up with something like that Also boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, additionally boobs Stay black, Redertainment For history's sake January No, January 19th Last week's Fugu question of the week Redertainment's haiku was Create a better platform For online gaming Also boobs, boobs, boobs At least his email His email did truly expand on that Because he added more boobs No I don't necessarily disagree with what he's saying At all They've got to figure out how to get those third parties back The thing about The very last point about Creating a safe environment Is what the definition Of a safe environment Is going to be What you just described Your nieces being able to go on Disney and play games I don't know this for certain But I'm pretty damn sure that yes Games become available just like Getting a disc into the Wii U Or downloading something from the shop and going to it That's an online environment Kind of Super Mario 3D World and the Miis Gravitating around That is an online environment That those online aspects come into your game Xbox Microsoft and Sony provide a Robust messaging and communication system Alongside matchmaking Multiplayer, etc, etc, games Um As soon as you allow Two people to communicate It is inherently unsafe Period, that's why every single game has Online interactions not rated by the ESRB Because people will say Type, gesture, do whatever They can possibly do Based off whatever they want to do Indeed true So it's difficult, that's all I'm saying It's quite difficult Yes, let's But thank you for the email, it's very Very pointed considering the Lengths of the debate we went to last week Thank you and I agree with the boobs Seconded This email comes from Andy R Hey OLR First time writers who forgive me for any Grammar mistakes, okay Just wanted to say that I agree with Jason About the Wii quote failing As a game console, it didn't succeed On the strength of its library at first It succeeded at being The Tickle Me Elmo of Insert Year Wii Came out Even my parents bought one and there's no way They would have bought any other video game console It was a runaway success because It managed to strike a chord With a casual crowd who tend to be more Fickle about what catches on and what doesn't Wii U has failed to capture That market again, myriad of reasons In my opinion And I don't think it ever will at this Rate, it's now the more hardcore gamer Crowd feels scorned after How the Wii was largely marketed To a different crowd Anyway, just my two cents, I don't think Nintendo Is necessarily in dire straights Mario Kart and Smash Still have a chance to turn things around And at least get the gamer crowd back On board, they'll keep cranking out Their first party games and I think they'll be Fine by the end of the generation Can I just, I just want to say real quick While you cough up a storm there, the whole Tickle Me Elmo comparison, like I Get that angle, like the Wii was kind of like The hot thing that year, so like I get the position There, but could you kind of say the same thing about The Xbox One and the Playstation 4 this year? Nope. Why? Because what's the There was nothing really to rival Sorry, there was nothing really to rival the Tickle Me Elmo When it came out, I'm just saying In terms of that type of toy and things that Had that much hype, but now we've got First of all, direct competitors So there's two of them Offering comparable deals And each with their dedicated fanbases It's really An It's like Comparing Apples and oranges To a A potato Well, but To be fair, the Wii and the Playstation 3 Came out the same year, yet the Wii dominated the conversation based off The strength of Wii Sports and the other launch titles This generation's consoles are still on the shelves Maybe not so much the PS4 Because of stock for the overseas For the overseas launch But this is exactly the point that I was trying to make Is that the Wii was gone For so long Yeah, you could pre-order You'll get stock when you get it Like the 360 had been the year before? Gotcha It's really hard for me To have a mental A particular map of this Because I've been a latecomer to every single console I've never done it on launch day I've never tried to get it on launch day Failed and had to Continue to follow up to actually Take physical stock Of when this stuff is available Yeah, they work out Supply issues They ramp up, people buy them with less frequency And they start to show up again Jamie just made the point That their dedicated camps Are responsible for these Millions of sales in the first month Yep 100% true But the Wii persisted The Wii was the perfect storm Because it had this huge up front Rush that had an incredibly Long tail and incredibly long wind down And Something I came up with Listening to last week's episode again They had good Late Late life releases Galaxy was absolutely phenomenal Uh Fucking Every single Wii game I have on the shelf literally just Erased from my mind Nintendo had a good late life library Which is Stereotypically Nintendo These releases keep going the entire time Which only boosted its numbers But that initial surge of Everything Was all because of a new audiences And Wii Sports Carried over to Wii Fit Let's move on with the rest of the email Oh yeah we didn't finish that did we No we did not Also quickly on the topic of the Magic the Gathering movie You guys were comparing it to Battleship Or Clue or other board games But there's already a strong narrative in the game There have been a ton of books and comics that flesh out the story And they've even got an entire team devoted to making sure That all the properties stay true to the world That game has created Pausing here I did read a lot of the Magic the Gathering comics When I was really into playing it And I just Wasn't that interested in the backstory It was just a fun game to play Piggybacking on your pause here I get the whole It's not Battleship or Clue Okay I get that angle I kind of think about Dungeons and Dragons Obviously there's a very rich story there There's the books and everything else And then the movie came out and it was kind of This crap And I wanted to like it because Tom Baker was in it And a lot of times those books And everything else they kind of get ignored I mean the World of Warcraft movie is going to Face this problem, you know how much of the books Is it really going to pay attention to it There is a rich story For the Warcraft stuff too Star Trek and Star Wars, this new Star Wars Movies, it ain't going to follow any of the books Well they already said that the books are pretty much Now Apocrypha To finish this up Almost all the blocks Magic term for three consecutive Expansions tell a story And while it can be tough to figure That out just through individual cards It is there Just pointing it out because I doubt this will be like A Yu-Gi-Oh type thing And definitely not something like Battleship I know we're being cynical Because a lot of video game movies turn out like garbage I think it would be awesome if the movie Turns out really well Like if they can actually pull it off It would need a freaking Lord of the Rings treatment To make it good Honestly What does that say about all the negative critique Of The Hobbit though Yeah but then again The Hobbit is a children's book Therefore it was actually A relatively short story Did not need Stuff pulled from The side books and short stories And every other little doodle Tolkien happened to put on paper It needed to be one fucking movie I love this comment from Bobby in the chat room Land will be tapped in a theater near you Love it I get it I just keep having flashbacks Of how many hours of my life I wasted Playing Magic Finally Rob Why so much hate for the non indie podcast I listen to a ton of podcasts each week Some indie and some not Even the ones that are affiliated with the company I listen to people who love video games And talk about video games Thanks and keep up the podcast As Andrew are Thanks for asking that actually So I can kind of set the record straight On some things here Hate is a strong word Hate is a very strong word I don't hate non indie podcasts I don't hate them I really like to support indie podcasts And my fellow people that go out there And really work their butts off Because indie podcasters Have to work ten times as hard To achieve something that A corporate backed podcast Can achieve very easily Whether the quality be good or not And that's just the way it is I'm not saying that out of a jealousy thing But it really irks me in the indie scene When I see people Striking each other down Why are you fighting with each other And having these silly little wars When we have to fight There's so much to get noticed anyway Amongst these corporate backed things And look to the story we talked about earlier With the whole Paying off Paying for the plugs Product placement and so forth It kind of gets into some of the other things You really have to consider are a factor When you talk about corporate games Does that mean all the people That work for these corporate companies And work for corporate podcasts are shrills No no no That really pursued their passion They do it for a living, I applaud them There's a lot of very talented people that do Happen to do it for a living I don't necessarily need to be Plugging them because they've got their audience They're easy to find, you know where to look But I will say Again, having a night where I'm just going to Tell it like it is, there are also Some people out there in the industry That are doing these shows That don't have that level of passion On some shows That's been very obvious to me As a listener, maybe I'm just Old or picky, I don't know I definitely have heard those corporate based Podcasts where somebody was only there Because they had to be And that just When we Put so much effort into this And do it for nothing That really stings sometimes When you hear people talking up This particular podcast where people plainly And obviously don't want to be there That's the really tricky part However, granted, that is the minority So I think that's great that you have your shows That you support and listen to And there are some great corporate based shows Out there, but I just I choose to support those that have to Work a little bit harder to get noticed I would add to that that The situation is getting A bit more diverse and by the same token A little bit muddier because The rise of YouTube and It's the same story over and over and over again You affiliate, you partner, you whatever But these You know, corporate backed Networks that Pick up individual I don't quite know the business Details of it, but corporations That pick up Indie producers Because their content is Engaging and they have an established base And they Do so so that they can provide Um So that the Said originally Indie can start doing things For the company, for the corporation But it also The theory is that it's a two way street The individual is able to Continue doing what they're doing Take on additional responsibilities with the company But also do events Personally taking advantage of company Resources And also literally Legal protection, YouTube fuckery To some extent, that kind of thing There's a lot of interesting Indie organized Networks on YouTube And various other locations right now And it's It is really hard To figure out On what side of the coin These people lie Sometimes But the point is that Be there for the content that you enjoy And that you can tell the people enjoy as well That means, that probably means You're having a good time listening to it It's really the whole point There are some people out there very passionate about Games who are gamers and Are very good at what they do And have a lot of good things to say Unfortunately, not everybody's in the game industry for those reasons And that's a harsh reality That You know, you'll find out for yourself If you go to some of these press events And see it first hand That's all I'm going to say That individual lives in Arizona Or did by the area code Thank you Andrew Well, last email Give away his home address while you're at it Jason, jeez Well that's not in the email I would if I, no no no I did want to say thank you for the email Because the beginning said it was a first time emailer So I love those whole long time listener first time callers First time writers? And your grammar was excellent What's up gang? So funny enough I just got done posting On the Frugal Question And my email is kinda sorta about the same thing I'm playing through Devil May Cry The 2013 one And I've come to realize I love the raw gritty and cocky new Dante And the game itself as a whole I was wondering what your thoughts were on the game Haven't played it, that's just me I remember when the game released And it was, cool topic of the month Was to hate the new Dante Do you think that gaming in this generation Has an unfair advantage Due to the internet negativity I remember when the only gaming news I would get was just for magazines Oh well I guess we were just getting old It was a P I have to admit I have not Played the new Devil May Cry It went cheap on Steam, I was thinking about buying it It's free on Playstation Plus right now actually Let me, he's gonna hate me Alan! Alan! Help! Help me! Cause he has played it Can you hear us in there? Do you know what we're talking about? We're talking about the new Devil May Cry game And none of us have played it But I know you have played it And what did the emailer want to know about the Dante First question was I wonder what your thoughts were on the game And he said that he liked the new Dante It has Like Everything is super edgy And grim dark And the new Dante Drops the F bomb a lot And it's very try hard in that regard But as far as the play style Like the art direction And the settings, I really enjoy that The new Dante, he's cute I mean you get to see him naked I'm downloading this I don't care I will say it does do a very good job At bringing a quality to, well you know somewhat To objectifying the man I would like to see him objectify some more And There on the PC version There are mods, not nude mods Damn! But I think there's a shirtless mod How do you know about this stuff you perv? Cause when I got it on Steam for like 17 cents, I googled Devil May Cry mods And there's a site for it I think you might have googled More specifically than that Just saying! I think a lot of the original franchise Devil May Cry fans are upset About the reboot It's because there was no real resolution To the original franchise The new Dante is a lot He's different from the original one In kind of shitty ways So there's some anger there It's a fun game Thank you for letting me pick on you, appreciate it I just like that the whole Devil May Cry thing Actually came from a Resident Evil Type thing My last experience with Devil May Cry Was playing Devil May Cry 3 Failing so hard That I unlocked easy mode And I have not played another one since Not because Not out of personal scorn or anything like that But because I didn't get a PS3 For two or three years And still to this day My PS3 library is Literally nothing compared to the 360 Devil May Cry 4 Eventually came out on the 360 But not until after it's PS3 Oh my god, it's still 50 bucks on Steam It's free right now on PS3 Yeah, but I don't I don't play my consoles My hand hurts At any rate, PlayStation Plus I picked it up I will definitely pick this series back up I don't know, I've loved this series I don't remember much of the second one But I'm sure I enjoyed it I definitely love this kind of play style Terrible at it, obviously Easy mode But I now have Devil May Cry reboot And I'll pick it up As soon as the opportunity presents itself But it's in my library So I can, in theory, do that Whenever I want Yeah, whatever I'm paying 50 bucks for it There'll be an Uber sale soon enough Oh, there was more to that email Yeah, Rob, geez PS, on a side note I just finished Brothers A Tale of Two Sons earlier this week If you've not played this game, pour yourself a nice glass of wine Sit down and prepare to play One of the most beautiful games you will ever play It is three hours of an amazing score Gorgeous graphics And one hell of a memorable story Congrats, Loki, on the new edition And that comes from Travis Not our Travis D, but a Travis H The same one that we answered on Google earlier, right? Yes Thank you for the email, Travis, appreciate it And another recommendation For Brother A Tale of Two Sons Yeah, but oddly enough His name just like sent a song Sailing through my head Because for the moment I first read his name I actually read Trevor So now I have the magical Trevor song stuck in my head So thank you, Travis Alright, thank you to all our emailers Mailbag at orangesontrated.com This is the place to send your thoughts for a future episode Alright, in the meantime We got to get to our FUs of the Week Let's do it Why do we do the FUs of the Week?

I don't know I felt like it Everybody knows what day April Fool's Day is And if you don't, well You'll find out what, you'll find out when it happens The cast members as announced I'm just gonna go, I'll do it all John Cleese as Cadwell The cheery and endearingly mad lost soul who is not afraid of anyone Bill Nighy, High King Emmerich A merchant prince whose determination won him the throne Kate Beckinsale, Queen Iryn Leader of the Ald... Man, I'm very good at pronouncing these, aren't I? Leader of the Aldmeri There's some real garbage words in The Elder Scrolls They're classical Leader of the Aldmeri Dominion and Queen of the High Elves Alfred Molina as Abner Tharn A wily old wizard who is head of the Empire's Elder Council Linda Carter as Azura The Daedric Princess from Skyrim who is a popular part of the lore Fuck yes Wonder Woman These are, these are, these are A celebrity cast exactly as they said Michael Gambon, The Prophet A blind man who guides the player through their journey Can we talk about this? I get it, mystical history and all that kind of shit But a blind man who guides the player through their journey Come on! Sorry I don't understand, what's the... A blind man who guides people Well, why not? I'm in one of those moods Malcolm McDowell as You think it's fine? What about, like you see the blind fighters Yeah, it's possible There's the stories, people, echolocation I've even heard of blind people riding a bike I get it, I don't know We've got blind people who listen to the show And do the video game Like the crazy video game clears Like on Killer Instinct and stuff I'm trying to think of the games that are out there Where they do everything It's so impressive Okay, I'm being an idiot, I accept that argument I don't know, something about these descriptions Something about these descriptions The way they worded it The way they worded it They worded it, they got to you Malcolm McDowell as The Daedric God who schemes to Enslave the mortals of Tamriel Some extras Peter Stomer The Skulled King, a monarch who led his people Into an unlikely alliance Jim Ward as A renegade high elf wizard Exiled from the realm for raising the dead Jennifer Hale as A Nord high giant who Along with the prophet, aids the player Michael Richardson, Sai Sahan A noble martial artist and Master swordsman Getting it, I don't care what it is This is a pretty amazing cast And then the mosaic of all of the actors And actresses, voice actors and actresses At the bottom, even if you don't recognize the names You're gonna recognize these faces Good for them, Bethesda Fucking awesome work, thank you Akuma JP is talking about You see it in almost all Chinese movies What's wrong? Yeah, it was Hold on, cause you got support here in the chat SSG100Matt says, I think Jason just feels the notion Of a blind prophet leading someone is cliche And overused These are all completely valid I Distilled into its simplest Form, it seems hokey Predictable and typical But that's also what makes it the best possible Thing, because the fact that without sight You can do anything of this nature is Absolutely stupendous and Amazing of the individual You're all correct, thank you It's true A white flag, I surrender I surrender Alright Well, one thing We need to wrap up the show cause we're dying over here One thing we can all agree on Is that the Super Nintendo is rad And Super Nintendo is still having Games made for it, which is pretty cool Super Fighter Team Is a retro publisher And they are shipping a Super Nintendo Run and gun platformer named Nightmare Busters And if you pre-order the game you will be Seeing this shipped to your house very very soon This game was originally supposed to launch In 1994 You thought Duke Nukem Forever had a long development Two decades in the making That's quite a bankroll No more Duke Nukem jokes Anyhow, it never happened And yeah, a completed version Was discovered years later And Super Fighter Team started taking the pre-orders Of the cartridge If you want it, it'll cost you just $70 Plus shipping How many years is $70? Well, keep in mind that if you inflate the cost Of what the cartridge used to cost back in the day It was about $70 in today's money It's very strange, I don't remember I still have some very beat up SNES boxes I don't really remember the cost A new SNES game Probably because my mom and dad bought it But that was my age When I had my SNES Oh, when Street Fighter 2 And Mortal Kombat with those complex Chipsets that were in them They were like $69 or even I think it might have been $79 I remember exactly how much the killer instinct Cost when I got it It was exactly $60 I got it at Montgomery Ward If that doesn't age it Didn't Phantasy Star IV on the Genesis Cost like $99 or something Like really expensive? I don't know that it was that much, was it? I don't know, for some reason my mind goes Tigerclaw, look it up for us Every once in a while I just hear These figures and it's It's outrageous by today's Standards, yet it seems somewhat Expected and also you account For the fact that cartridges aren't in mass Production, which means they're more expensive To produce It's a strange conflict of trying to Figure out where exactly My mind is in regard to How appropriate this cost is But it looks fun, looks like a fun game Good on them Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line It's open now, 1877 Game OLR Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio If you want to give us a call and talk about any of tonight's topics Or anything else we might have discussed tonight Please go ahead and give us a Call, it is the show after all Where every gamer has a voice Let's see I'm going to try and pull up any tweets I didn't see any earlier though Remember how I said I was going to save an Article for the end of the show? Oh yeah, I do Gee, thanks In my defense Two days away from being sick I'm not at 100% yet, not that I remember Thought you were going to help to bridge things together Alright Let's go to the phones Because we do have a call coming in, hooray Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? It's DJ Ronimaz, how is everybody in the studio today? Hey good, good to hear from you buddy, what's up? We are all equally recovering I feel that I feel your pain I just finished rebuilding my entire machine after my hard drive crash Late last night Oh Yuck But it's okay, all my important data Including the porn, was saved Yay Okay I got a couple of things I want to get off my chest Then I'm going to get up on out here and let other people call in Fair enough Now, I was trying to call in last week And get in this whole Wii U Debate and debacle And Granted, the Wii U is Not a disaster According to what some people are saying Because people forget For every console that Nintendo sells They make a profit Compared to other manufacturers In Microsoft, they take a loss So whether people think that Wii U Is an abysmal failure Nintendo is still laughing all the way to the bank I thought that wasn't true anymore after they did the $50 price cut I could be wrong Well, maybe after the initial $50 price cut But then as parts get a little bit cheaper I mean, in the beginning they were losing money Off the 3DS when they did the initial price cut But now They're making profits off the 3DS Because Parts become cheaper, make your money back Alright, I'm with you So I am saying When Nintendo gets their next console out It's gotta have that hardware power Of what's out there now They can't be like Skimming on the cheap and be like Well, we'll be the budget console For everybody Well, wait a second If they match the current generation by the time the new one rolls around What will that have bought them? Well, what I mean is they need to Not match, but make it to the next level I mean, you see what I'm saying? They have to add a little bit of hardware prowess To make them step above everybody else That's what I'm saying Got it Alright, fair enough We've got to come in our chat room Over at live.vognetwork.com AkumaJP says, I'm so sick of this topic Why do we keep debating the Nintendo stuff into the ground? Even when people Like, love to get People out there that really get pleasure out of just Kicking Nintendo when they're down, I think, sometimes People like to see the giants fall I guess Very much Well, why don't you tell us more about that porn collection Well, there is a reason why I had to go get a 3TB hard drive Any cons coming up that you're getting excited for? Yes, I will be Going to Katsukan next month And I will be debuting Dr. Luigi Oh god, Katsukan, oh man Man, it was years ago when I went to Katsukan I had such a good time though Yes, and somehow, mysteriously, the picture of you as the Black Mage disappeared So I have to go digging for it Oh no Well, it's probably for the best, let's be real I've got to work on a cosplay for Dragon Con Because Travis Donovan is fully expecting That I'm going full on cosplay this year I've got to figure that whole mess out I don't know what I'm going to do I'm going to lose a little weight first It will determine if I'm going to do sexy cosplay or not You need to do Joker Joker? Oh, I was like My mind went to Batman Joker Oh, Joker from Mass Effect Yeah, I guess that would be pretty mean We can get you the SR2 hat That might be something Especially when Donovan and Jenna Do the whole Miranda and Shepard thing I guess the Joker would fit right in with that crowd So, why not Awesome I said hi Will do Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG Network Listen in, kids It's what's good For LG, you know Alright, take care, buddy Alright, take care 1877 Game OLR Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio If you want to give us a call And comment on whatever's been going on in the news Bobby Blackwolf, I forgot, had sent me Some messages earlier saying I should And I thought this was really funny He noticed that earlier in the show Guitar Hero 3 Was trending on Twitter Isn't that weird? Guitar Hero 3 is years old Yeah, it's depressing The reason why Because Metallica just played One at the Grammys And all the little kids were going Hey, this is from Guitar Hero 3 Even though It's like one of the biggest Facepalm right now Is like of epic proportions Oh no You're talking about songs that like Defined the No No, no It's sad But it's hilarious at the same time Do I need to get the I mean, at the same time, that's not a surprise And It's great that they're saying Guitar Hero 3 specifically I don't know if it was on that, but I'm surprised you could unstick your hand From your face with that Alright, I gotta go to the phones Quickly, quickly Hold on, hold on Just one thing You be quiet, I hung up One thing that has to be said Is that If anyone ever doubts that Metal music isn't Music music You need to listen to that whole fucking Metallica album It's black album, isn't it? No, I don't Was one all black? Oh, Ride the Lightning Alright, Zaku's calling back Are we ready for Zaku this time? Yes, it's all working Alright, here we go Hi Zaku How's it going? Because I'm too lazy to turn on my PC at night That's fine, what's up buddy? Ah, nothing much Just kicking back What is that you're playing over there? Is that Forza? No, Gran Turismo Oh, Gran Turismo, okay What's up? Ah, nothing much Just, you know, as I said Still playing, getting through my PS3 as usual But, other than that I managed to pick myself up a Pretty spiffy racing wheel that I'm gonna pick up tomorrow From eBay Yeah So, figured I may as well get used to Like, the last throws of playing On a controller But other than that, it's like I'm still kind of like Still kind of shocked That the patent office Would go so far as to give A single company the trademark For an entire word That's like giving Crayola the patent Or the trademark for the color blue I mean, for King To get that much, wield that much power You know there's gonna be other people Obviously Hasbro Or anyone who's already Had products with the word candy on it In the past and want to target mobile Or pretty much They're pretty much in the crosshairs Because once they do, they'll get the C&D's immediately Well, I would actually like to see I think Hasbro would fight that And I would actually kind of like to see that happen I think a lot of us would be Rooting for that kind of throwdown to happen Well, Dark Soccer had joked During Bobby Black Wolf's show earlier That Disney should do a game based on King Candy I like your macross shirt by the way From Wreck it Ralph Doing a King Candy game And I was like, yes, Disney should do that Because Disney's legal team Is a force to be reckoned with And that would be a fun little court case To watch go down But who's hand King ended up greasing In the patent office? There has to have been some sort of Backroom deal Of sorts Definitely a little bit of hand skin ball Going on over there at the patent office Thanks Ralph There's no way You would be able to get The trademark for a single word That's so common in Universal Well Even English There's no way you would have done that Without having to grease someone's palm over there Well, Bethesda Bethesda trademarked the word There went my dreams Of making the boob scrolls But still it's like Candy Which is something that it's really Really delicious honestly Not just delicious It's a noun Of something that's already common How could you Trademark something That is so ubiquitous That even candy makers Are in danger because if they try To promote their They try to create a promotional app The technical answer The literal reason why that's allowed Is that they don't have carte blanche On anything that has the word candy They have carte blanche on video games And interactive media That uses the word candy or saga Well there goes Any hopes for Hershey's Doing promotional games on mobile I'm gonna ask the real tough Questions here at Orange Lounge Radio How did they not Get the trademark on the word crush Why are we not hearing about the word crush Because that makes me think if that's the unsaid thing Because you know they tried it So why are we not hearing about them getting the trademark On the word crush I really hope it's because of grape crush I really hope The people that made crush soda were like nope More of an orange person myself But I digress Isn't crush already Not already a trademark So it kind of conflicts So I think they would have to give them candy Because no one else has trademarked Or let alone used it as a brand As a single word I mean it's getting to that point It's almost bizarre That they gave them Something like that That could easily be invalidated As long as They try to go after the Wrong entity Like Disney But it goes to show that Our patent system Is completely broken It's where you can I mean the point is that If you have software patents And then you have trolls going after you For having certain features that are Obiguous to all other Mobile phone platforms Like barcode scanning Or even sending Communications like network calls Someone must have You know that process Even sending secure calls Zaku Since I'm asking the tough questions here tonight How do we fix it? We all sit here and say it's broken How do we fix it? Well I mean this is something that Congress would have to Enact laws for But it's not The same one that got us in Is going to get us right back out Out of the frying pan And into the fryer It's gotten paid for by Special interests So there will be people, there will be certain entities Certain software companies that wouldn't want The status quo to change It would benefit from having To patent software Ideas Instead of the whole Instead of actually building something Or creating a single idea That can be patented as opposed to actually Creating the code Alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show It is broken And I'm gonna complain some more Take care buddy Have fun with your steering wheel All new way to play Take care buddy I think that it's gonna do it for calls tonight Cause we're well past 9 o'clock Here and we only gotta work tomorrow So we're gonna Quickly I think I saw a tweet come in here At the last moment It was a story I wanted to address And I should have Mentioned it earlier in the show but I didn't Cause you know I was too busy ranting about something When I said I prefer Orange Crush I was actually talking about the R.A.M. song Playing at drums on Rock Band Also I was thinking about Pineapple Crush was really Actually the superior brand of Crush Pineapple Crush was amazing We do have a couple quick tweets here Let me get to it Tigerclaw tweeting us saying So we brought them up earlier in the show Because they're gonna have that online The subscription pass that works for all their game But it's gonna come at the cost Of Free Realms Closing down That game was pretty shitty anyway It's on the PS3, it's awful Star Wars Clone Wars Adventures Vanguard Saga of Heroes And Wizardry Online All shutting down Most of them on March 31st But Wizardry will be last to close On July 31st Rest in peace SSG100Matt says What? Oh yeah there was something about this They conspired to sell Counterfeit game packs for the UltraCade Unit It also involved global VR And MAME developers He reached a plea deal with the state of California And the sentencing has happened 41 months in prison How about that I don't even remember why we were so mad at him In the first place Because they were replacing our legit old machines And they were making people pay for MAME I just want to give a shout out though Because we had some nice people pimping our stuff tonight So I just want to give a nice shout out To some people that were pimping our stuff tonight Pixel Pacas Said not interested in watching the Grammys Listen to the video game podcast OLR Thank you Pixel Pacas That was quite kind It was very kind, so did Koopa Club Said almost the same thing, forget the Grammys and listen to OLR Live instead, though if the Grammys Were like best grandma awards Then we totally watch it You know what though, I do have to say And thank you to Tumblr for keeping me in the loop Daft Punk Did they win stuff? Best Album Oh did they win Best Album? Good for them I know they were nominated They won 4 Grammys and Paul McCartney won a couple Actually There was an amazing tweet earlier That can sum up my thoughts on Macklemore Perfectly This is my personal opinion What was the retweet?
