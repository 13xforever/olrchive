7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	Happy 2014 to everyone. That sound you heard was contracts sending consumers weeping over their favorite games being delisted from various services. Could this be a sign of strained relationships to come in 2014? All this and more on tonight's episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	45000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. This is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 534 for this January the 5th of 2014.
46000	64000	My name is Rob Roberts here to talk with you about what's going on in video gaming with all of you guys participating be it live at the Voice of Geeks Network, live.vognetwork.com or via the podcast feed be it on iTunes podcast or Stitcher or TuneIn or YouTube or however you choose to listen to the show.
64000	72000	My name is Rob Roberts which I believe I already said but I have not said her name. She is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
73000	77000	And since you deserve to have your name said twice too, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
77000	79000	Double fuck.
79000	83000	How does one, no let's not go there. Are you cursing out your iPad?
83000	88000	Yeah because of my auto correct that I still leave on because fuck it.
88000	97000	I've had a rather off day myself because I normally do my big Tumblr post everyday and I didn't until I got here.
97000	104000	I'm having a super off day today like and I'll tell you in a minute after I've introduced any but everybody but just like oh my gosh.
104000	105000	I went to the gym today though.
105000	106000	Yeah.
106000	113000	Which also set off my day because I normally go on Monday but I went today since I've got plans tomorrow because oh my god I'm employed. I only have two weeks of freedom.
113000	114000	Congrats.
114000	115000	Thank you.
115000	119000	And now we're just praying that you're not going to have to work Sundays because that's going to cause a real interesting monkey wrench for.
119000	124000	I'm gonna, it's one night I think I can, I'm pretty sure I can get that off.
124000	125000	Good.
125000	128000	I can get that night off with my eyes closed.
128000	133000	Vog is going to get real interesting if she doesn't get Sunday nights off but we're all crossing our fingers.
133000	142000	Anyway so yeah it's just been and I left the house because of sports ball. There's nothing that motivates me to leave the house and go to the gym like sports ball.
142000	143000	Now here's what.
143000	146000	I got back and it was still on.
146000	148000	Yeah sports ball goes on for a very long time.
148000	154000	But how crazy is the gym right now because you have everybody that's like oh my new year's resolution is to go to the gym every day.
154000	159000	Now I imagine there's a good percentage of already puttered out after two days or it's like fuck this and fuck that.
159000	163000	But you, you went today. How was it today?
163000	164000	It was really dead.
164000	165000	It was super dead.
165000	170000	Well I went at 1230 and I stayed until close to two.
170000	175000	No I left the house more around one and my workout only takes about an hour.
175000	184000	So I had no trouble. There were a few new faces but I think that the biggest crowds are the ones that come after work.
184000	185000	After work yeah.
185000	190000	And so until I know what my schedule is I'm keeping on my regular you know.
190000	193000	I'm usually either a Monday Wednesday or Monday Thursday.
193000	198000	Since it is a video game show have you been working in any of the exergaming stuff in your routine yet?
198000	210000	No and I'm meant to play DDR. I need to actually take down my, the other dance pads because I told you I've got a whole bunch of those thick ones.
210000	211000	What were the good ones called?
211000	212000	The metal pads.
212000	213000	Not the metal ones.
213000	214000	Oh the red octane or whatever?
214000	215000	Yeah.
215000	216000	I bought like.
216000	219000	I was thinking informer. That was a Canadian rapper song.
219000	220000	That was snow.
220000	222000	But that was a song, informer right?
223000	224000	Informer.
228000	229000	Ignition.
229000	230000	Ignition thank you.
230000	236000	There he is. Techmaster Loki here to save the day via Skype. You were just dying over there wanting to scream it out huh Loki?
236000	238000	I was gonna wait.
238000	240000	Well you didn't. That's fine. How you doing Loki?
240000	242000	That's why I said I was going to.
242000	244000	How are you doing Techmaster Loki?
244000	246000	I'm doing okay.
246000	247000	Good good.
248000	266000	And for those that missed the memo a couple weeks ago because I know we've had some folks that have been out of the habit of listening because of the holidays and everything. Loki is joining us via Skype for about a month or so. He is on baby watch because Mrs. Loki is due before the 20th so that could literally be any day now.
266000	267000	Yeah any day now.
267000	270000	Yep. So Loki is there just in case he has to.
270000	272000	And I bet she wishes it was five days ago.
272000	274000	Get the call. Yeah.
274000	276000	She's hoping by next Friday I think.
277000	282000	Okay. Is there like is there a particular reason is there like you know a sale on Monday or something or I'm kidding.
282000	283000	I'm kidding.
283000	285000	No one knows.
285000	293000	I think it's mainly just so that you know she can get more time off I guess because then you know it'd be the weekend and that kind of thing.
293000	295000	See see there's a trick to it.
295000	300000	This this country is so screwed up because in other countries like there's paternal leave.
301000	306000	So we get like the least amount of maternity leave of practically anywhere in the world.
306000	307000	So stupid.
307000	308000	Yeah.
308000	309000	But thank you capitalism.
309000	313000	Well Loki don't expect to get paternity leave from this program because you heard what Dark Soccer said.
313000	314000	No I'm kidding.
314000	320000	You take all the time you need but I know you you'll be you'll be back here ASAP because you'll be like I need a break.
320000	322000	Yeah. Yeah.
322000	323000	All right.
323000	324000	Sounds good.
324000	331000	Also joining us here in studio say hello to the one and only voice of the show VX Jason X V X Y Z element of me.
331000	332000	That's me.
332000	333000	How are you doing.
333000	334000	I'm doing pretty all right.
334000	337000	How long do we get your deep baritone voice for here at our studio.
337000	339000	As long as you want me.
339000	340000	Well not seriously.
340000	342000	I was going back to Colorado at some point.
342000	343000	Yeah.
343000	345000	I have duct tape.
345000	350000	Well the running inside joke between me and Seattle has been that I've just been chill and just sleeping underneath the table.
350000	351000	So you know.
351000	352000	Well that works.
352000	353000	Arrangements could be made.
353000	363000	No I have my work obligations are wrapping up at the end of this month so we'll probably be driving for the first show of February.
363000	364000	OK.
364000	365000	I imagine.
365000	366000	There you go.
366000	367000	Current plan anyways.
367000	368000	I feel like we have to have like a goodbye.
368000	369000	Goodbye show.
369000	370000	Bye Jason for now.
370000	371000	In parentheses for now.
371000	374000	That all that that's sounding like it'll basically be happening.
374000	375000	So you know we'll see.
375000	376000	All right.
376000	382000	Well and for those that don't know Jason does commute like 90 minutes just to be here on the show Sunday night.
382000	383000	So he does a lot.
383000	384000	He doesn't do that.
384000	385000	He does the whole YouTube thing.
385000	398000	So I mean my God over the years Jason really got us set up with the Web site and everything like I know deep man did a lot of the coding in the setup but you did all the like making sure we have a place to host him and all of that and helping him out.
398000	400000	You guys have been working on that.
400000	406000	And although we are in due need for an update maybe that's that's a new year's resolution a little bit this year.
406000	411000	But yeah you've just done so much for the show and I don't think people realize because you're not always here.
411000	415000	Talking but the last few months we've been able to get you here talking.
415000	416000	That's good.
416000	421000	Now at least at least I'll have a 13 seconds of speech in shows continuing for the foreseeable future.
421000	422000	There you go.
422000	423000	Great.
423000	424000	Well plus 30 seconds for the outro.
424000	431000	So I will have I will have my standing minute on this show for for as long as I would as long as I can continue to do so.
431000	434000	Rama said that you're our answer to Barry White.
434000	438000	So I'm wondering how many children are going to be conceived to your voice.
439000	445000	I will take that as an incredibly flattering compliment and picking up on Twitter to let me know.
445000	448000	And that comment coming from live.vognetwork.com.
448000	450000	Maybe I should have Jason say that.
450000	451000	Live.
451000	452000	Yeah.
452000	453000	When I can say it straight.
453000	454000	So hot.
455000	463000	We do tape live Sunday nights 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern and you can join the festivities at live.vognetwork.com.
463000	464000	Well I'm fired.
465000	467000	I see that was the trick the whole time.
467000	469000	You guys brought Jason here because you want to replace me.
469000	470000	I see how it is.
470000	474000	You're looking at me because Loki I can't look at him.
474000	475000	He's on Skype.
476000	477000	You could be.
477000	478000	You told me to turn off the camera.
478000	479000	That's true.
479000	480000	That's true.
480000	481000	I was worried about bandwidth and everything.
481000	482000	All right.
482000	483000	Anyhow.
483000	484000	Welcome.
484000	485000	Welcome back Jason.
485000	489000	And Jason's also helped helping me stay grounded tonight because OK.
489000	493000	So we're talking about this a little bit before the show that like I'm just a total like space cadet today.
493000	499000	And if you were to ask Alan my partner he would say that I'm already like the most forgetful guy anywhere.
499000	500000	And it's totally true.
500000	502000	But like today was just like especially bad like OK.
502000	506000	So we're sitting there for those that have never participated with the show live.
506000	513000	We always do a quick call at the end of Bobby Black Wolf show because he always is of course the show life before us here at Vogue Network.
513000	522000	And you know so after that calls done we usually sitting here in studio for about seven minutes while Bobby wraps things up does a transition song so we can take over the feed and do our thing.
522000	525000	So we're just kind of sitting here in studio la la la la la la.
525000	529000	And Jason kind of pipes him and goes Hey Rob are you are you going to call Loki.
529000	531000	I'm like shit.
531000	533000	So I like less than two minutes.
533000	534000	Yeah.
534000	535000	I get started.
535000	536000	Our song was already running.
536000	537000	Yeah.
537000	539000	And it's like we're missing the fourth.
539000	540000	Exactly.
540000	541000	Is he out tonight.
541000	542000	I forgot to fight.
542000	543000	I forgot to ask.
543000	544000	No.
544000	545000	And then.
545000	548000	And then after that he says is there anything else you need me to remind you to do.
548000	550000	And I just look at him and I go.
550000	553000	How do I put on pants.
553000	560000	And then the most hilarious part of all while the little the little thing and the podcast listeners don't usually hear this.
560000	563000	So I'm going to play this just for the podcast listeners.
563000	565000	Here's something for the live experience.
565000	567000	You're listening to the Vogue Network.
567000	569000	Up next the show where every gamer has a voice.
569000	572000	Orange Lounge Radio Live.
572000	573000	Right.
573000	579000	So that's playing and while that is playing literally the opening theme song comes right after that song right while that song is playing.
579000	583000	I said oh shit I don't have my voice recording program up.
583000	588000	So I'm like launching quickly Adobe.
588000	591000	So yes Jason did need to remind me to do something else tonight.
591000	594000	It was a very good first five minutes of the show.
594000	597000	Meanwhile I was sitting here reading the chat room in Tumblr.
597000	598000	Yes.
598000	599000	I don't.
599000	600000	Well that's what you do every week.
600000	601000	Hey.
601000	602000	All right.
602000	603000	I participate.
603000	604000	Rageinator says.
604000	605000	Mostly.
605000	606000	I know why Sky's forgetful.
606000	607000	Dude it's called Alzheimer's.
607000	608000	At 35.
608000	609000	Ouch.
609000	612000	Like I know 35 is old to some people but let me tell you a couple things.
612000	613000	A.
613000	614000	It's not.
614000	615000	B.
615000	616000	Start eating your blueberries.
616000	617000	It's really not.
617000	618000	Eating more blueberries.
618000	619000	I could eat blueberries.
619000	620000	C.
620000	621000	Get off my lawn.
621000	632000	Actually I will say this when I was studying nutrition one of the research papers that I wrote was about how blueberries are good for improving memory capacity and preventing memory loss.
632000	633000	So just saying.
633000	634000	Excellent.
635000	638000	And I promise we'll get to games after this.
638000	640000	Act Def says Jason the assistant.
640000	642000	You know in some ways it's kind of true.
642000	649000	Like I would say he's the intern but he's you know obviously because we haven't had Drew in forever so he's basically fired.
649000	657000	So I could say Jason is kind of the intern or the assistant but the assistant is a good term because the assistant really does all the work and then everybody else takes credit for it.
657000	660000	So I think this is a very fitting title for Jason.
660000	662000	Because he's the administrator.
662000	663000	He is.
663000	665000	He could ruin us real good if you wanted to.
665000	667000	I could ruin us too.
667000	672000	I have the power that I will hopefully never exercise.
672000	673000	Bring it down.
673000	674000	Bring it down.
674000	675000	What?
675000	679000	I was going to say though that I owe Drew because Drew helped me get my job.
679000	680000	Yes.
680000	681000	So thank you.
681000	682000	So Drew is still working with us.
682000	683000	Yeah.
683000	684000	Kind of.
684000	685000	Keeping me in money.
685000	687000	Just don't let him knock over any tables at your work.
687000	688000	All right.
688000	690000	Thankfully they're rooted to the ground.
690000	691000	Good.
691000	692000	OK.
692000	693000	So I have a couple of bonus games.
693000	695000	I have a couple of things I want to talk about at the top of the show.
695000	697000	Two mini kickoff topics tonight.
697000	704000	And one of them tying into we brought up Bobby a minute ago and on his show tonight they were having what I was calling a wank fest.
704000	706000	And I mean that in the most loving way.
706000	708000	But not too much love.
708000	709000	About the Oculus Rift.
709000	713000	They were talking about the Oculus Rift a lot and you know I've tried the Rift.
713000	714000	I played that at Dragon Con.
714000	716000	I thought it was awesome.
716000	721000	I thought it was good in like 15 minute chunks because I started to get a little.
721000	722000	I'm old remember.
722000	725000	So yeah I liked it in small doses or whatever.
725000	729000	But that got us to a conversation here in studio where we were talking about peripherals.
729000	738000	And Jason said you brought up a game that you were talking about the Rift or something and we were talking about how this game was awesome in arcades.
738000	739000	What game were we talking about?
739000	740000	Prop Cycle.
740000	741000	Prop Cycle.
741000	743000	Who remembers Prop Cycle in the arcade?
743000	744000	Hands in the air.
744000	746000	I worked an Amco arcade when it was new.
746000	750000	For the listeners that may not know Prop Cycle, Dark Soccer, what is Prop Cycle?
750000	752000	It's something annoying.
752000	758000	It's a giant exercise bike hooked up to a huge monitor.
758000	768000	And basically you pedal it and steer around trying to pop balloons and do tricks and go through holes and try not to burn your legs off.
768000	771000	And some people hook them up to Addams Family pinball tables.
771000	773000	Oh yeah that's true. I've heard about that.
773000	779000	The reason why I bring that up is because arcades have sort of been sunsetting a little bit.
779000	780000	As we know them anyway.
780000	785000	Arcades are more turning into Reno for little kids.
785000	788000	And I say Reno because it's a little more busted than Vegas.
788000	795000	So these arcades are turning into busted little places for kids to gamble their money away and get tickets.
795000	796000	Does that mean they're ReNets?
796000	798000	They're little ReNets.
798000	800000	That's what they are.
802000	804000	The biggest little quarter munchers in the world.
804000	809000	But with this, obviously you have all these ticket spitting games and so forth.
809000	815000	But we're starting to see these games that were very unique experiences in the arcade slowly go away.
815000	818000	Or when they do have arcade games, it's all I see.
818000	825000	It's either driving games for an excellent example like Mario Kart where you actually sit in the freaking cabinet.
825000	827000	But I'm thinking back and I'm going like, you know what?
827000	833000	No child is ever going to get to experience, unless they go to a retro gaming event or a convention center.
833000	841000	No child is ever going to get to experience playing Star Wars in one of those freaking cabinets that move to the left and right as you sat in it.
841000	843000	Oh.
843000	845000	Now there I go being old again.
845000	849000	But seriously, for those that haven't experienced it, you poor bastards.
849000	850000	You're really missing out.
850000	854000	Like being old rules for no other reason than getting to play the Star Wars motion cabinet.
854000	857000	There were more. Remember the Space Harrier cabs in the After Burner?
857000	859000	The After Burner would go completely upside down, wouldn't it?
859000	860000	Uh, no I don't think so.
860000	861000	Almost.
861000	862000	And then Star Blade.
862000	867000	Which we had a deluxe Star Blade at the Dollar Theater and the guy would just be like, oh it's you.
867000	869000	Infinite credits.
869000	871000	So, Mike, Jason go ahead.
871000	874000	I was going to say there are different classes of cabinets of course.
874000	881000	There's just the standard stand up, there's sit down and then there's, I don't think I've ever been in a moving Star Wars cab before.
881000	885000	But I've definitely been in a sit down, non-motion version.
885000	889000	But I remember seeing that After Burner cabinet.
889000	891000	There's Daytona USA for example.
891000	903000	You get a little, the range of machines is anywhere from a bucket seat to a damn near full sized car that you get into and jolt around as you run into things and people run into you.
904000	907000	And that still happens.
907000	921000	Gameworks in Arizona has really, really nice Initial D 5 machines when I was there and Time Crisis keeps getting bigger and then smaller to save money and then bigger when the new game comes out.
921000	931000	I think I agree that the flashy, huge level of it is dying down in terms of how much you'll see it.
931000	934000	Just in general, you go in an arcade you've never been before.
934000	940000	And just to be clear, that is my question in all of this, so if you guys over at the chat room want to answer this, live.vognetwork.com.
940000	945000	Is the day of the giant pompous what the fuck peripheral done?
945000	952000	I think the day of innovation in the arcade is done.
952000	956000	Heck no it's not done. That's the whole reason they have certain games in the arcade.
956000	960000	For example, Tetris with a giant fucking controller.
960000	968000	That is pretty cool. Like even me, again I'm 35 and when I saw that big Tetris machine in the arcade I was like, ooh shiny!
968000	973000	And I ran over to it and fed it all my money to play with that giant joystick because it was, you know, kind of funny.
973000	975000	That is freaking annoying.
975000	980000	It is a little bit. But it's a ticket spitter at the end of the day. You get tickets depending on how well you do.
980000	985000	As is Super Monkey Ball, as is, well, Fruit Ninja isn't.
985000	987000	There's Doodle Jump.
987000	993000	Yeah, Doodle Jump, Infinity Blade, Fruit Ninja, Rerave pretty soon if not already in certain arcades, yeah.
993000	998000	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com just to catch up on some comments from the live participants.
999000	1004000	Tigerclaw says, which Star Wars? The one from Atari in the 80s or the Star Wars trilogy arcade?
1004000	1009000	Now that you mention it, they were both pretty cool because the trilogy one had that giant lightsaber battle with Darth Vader, right?
1009000	1011000	But I was talking about the old school 80s ones.
1011000	1012000	The vector.
1012000	1014000	Yeah, the vector games.
1014000	1019000	Let's see, and some folks talking about the Power Glove because it's like peripherals on a smaller scale.
1019000	1021000	Not all of them work.
1021000	1028000	Think about it, this show exists because of one of those pompous peripherals in the arcade that got people moving, right?
1028000	1031000	Dance Dance Revolution, that's how Dark Soccer, myself, and Loki all met.
1031000	1034000	And met you too, Jason. It was all through DDR.
1034000	1043000	I still remember the day that we actually really, really hung out was the day that we took the trip to Milpitas.
1043000	1045000	And played Para Para.
1045000	1047000	Which was also Pompa's peripheral.
1047000	1052000	Orange Wright says, didn't F-Zero's AX cabinet move too? Yes it did, that's one of my all-time favorites.
1052000	1059000	Let's see, also, SJ100Matt talking about a big convention from this weekend that I know a lot of my friends back east went to.
1059000	1066000	SJ100Matt says, I went to MAGFest this weekend and there were a ton of people who brought their kids to the show and had them play a bunch of the classic games there.
1066000	1071000	For example, I saw a dad play classic Oregon Trail on an old Apple II with his six to nine year old kid.
1071000	1074000	I later saw that same family playing classic Gauntlet together.
1074000	1076000	That happens at an Atari party though.
1076000	1078000	Well there's little things like that everywhere.
1078000	1081000	And Penny Arcade Expo, that's one of my favorite places, is the classic game room.
1081000	1082000	Yeah.
1082000	1092000	I was gonna make the point that playing it after the fact is not as strong as when it is the culture of what you're doing when you're growing up.
1092000	1099000	But then again, I have missed a ton of games and gone back to play them to really understand what was going on.
1100000	1113000	Not to mention, whenever I talk to friends that have been computer geeks their whole life, they'll talk about their VX Spectrum and their Trash80 and their Apple IIe, Apple IIg, Commodore 64 and the whole lot.
1113000	1120000	I don't even remember what my computer was, my first computer, but it was an IBM PC running DOS.
1120000	1129000	I have quite literally never owned a computer that was not a classic Macintosh or an IBM PC DOS slash Windows.
1129000	1140000	I knew a friend with a Commodore 64 and I took in a fair amount of knowledge and got used to the sound and the feel and how you actually use that machine.
1140000	1149000	But all of these other systems, I never owned a console before on SNES, but I still know a pretty damn good amount of games from back then.
1149000	1150000	Reasonably so.
1150000	1156000	So will six year old kids today not understand an Apple IIe?
1156000	1158000	Of course they will.
1158000	1162000	How they adapt it depends on how they want to play it.
1162000	1168000	Let me steer us back on path a little bit because we're veering from the original topic here with good reason.
1168000	1173000	The six year old certainly can still experience the Apple IIe and all that.
1173000	1179000	We had a story last week about how Archive.org is bringing back old games and we all know what emulators are and all that.
1179000	1182000	Even so, those old machines are going to exist and so forth.
1182000	1188000	Steering us back to where we were, that experience of sitting in a moving Star Wars cabinet while playing Star Wars.
1188000	1194000	There might be a couple of those machines still in existence, but it's not something a lot of people are ever going to get to play.
1194000	1203000	I do know of one afterburner that was in working condition that was at Scandia.
1203000	1211000	I don't know if it's still there, but it was there a year and a half ago, which was the last time I went.
1211000	1215000	It's not every arcade. You're talking about one arcade happens to have this machine.
1215000	1218000	It's not nearly as prolific as it once was.
1219000	1228000	Now, Loki, let me go back to you a minute because you were saying that yes, we still have the pompous peripherals, but they too have shifted to ticket spinning.
1228000	1237000	Well, yeah, some of them. There's a lot of games, especially I think in arcades now, that's all you see is the big flashy games.
1237000	1245000	It's either going to be a driving cabinet for a game or it's going to be a game with some elaborate weapon attached to it.
1245000	1256000	Or a Dance Dance Revolution machine. It's got to be something flashy to get your attention because you're not going to play just a regular game in the arcade.
1256000	1261000	And little kids love flashing lights. Boy, do they ever.
1261000	1262000	Oh yeah.
1263000	1275000	So I don't know. For me, I kind of see it transitioning. I do see a lot of the ticket spitter, but it really bums me out to think like when I talk about Prop Cycle, there's going to be a lot of people that just don't know what that really is.
1275000	1278000	Or the snowboarding games, the skateboarding games, Alpine Racer.
1278000	1285000	Yeah, those games are fun. Or even like the old skeet shooting games where you had the giant gun. No arcade is going to have a gun in it like that anymore.
1285000	1290000	Unless it's the Cabela's hunting redneck game.
1290000	1292000	Or it's the thing you put 50 cents in at Disneyland.
1292000	1304000	I don't know. Some people make really bad decisions when it comes to their arcade stuff. Remember, Scandia in Sacramento here, they replaced all their skee-ball machines with a giant fucking shooting gallery thing.
1304000	1305000	It's still there.
1305000	1306000	Is it really?
1306000	1307000	Yes it is.
1307000	1308000	How funny.
1308000	1309000	It's silly.
1309000	1310000	It's strange.
1311000	1318000	Alright. So anyhow, if you have some thoughts on this, you can always email us. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1318000	1329000	I want to move into our second kick-off topic. This one will be really quick. This is more of a follow-up of sorts, but I wanted to come clean on the show because I'm sure some folks are going to have something to say about this.
1329000	1341000	But I did something over the weekend, and because of this something I did, there's going to be a PlayStation 4 showing up on my porch on Tuesday from Amazon Prime.
1341000	1345000	So I finally took the plunge and bought a PlayStation 4.
1345000	1352000	And I posted this on Twitter because I was, I don't know what I was talking about. Something else nice was like, oh yeah, I bought a PlayStation 4.
1352000	1358000	One of the first replies I got was, of course you get sassy replies. Everybody likes to be sassy on Twitter.
1358000	1371000	And one of the first replies I got was from Flaco Jones, who said, oh, Rob must have really wanted to play Don't Starve because the system is only as good as the games that are on it, and Don't Starve is coming out for PlayStation Plus in January.
1371000	1376000	So, you know, going back to the OLR golden rule, that must be what finally broke Rob.
1376000	1379000	Clearly that's not the case since I bought that for you on Steam.
1379000	1383000	Exactly. It's like, no, I already have that on Steam.
1383000	1386000	But no, well, it's a couple things.
1386000	1397000	A, when the PlayStation 4 first, first came out, I didn't quite have the finances that I did after, you know, now that we're past, you know, the holidays and everything like that.
1397000	1400000	I had better finances, so I was able to finally get one.
1400000	1408000	And also, I think what pushed me over the edge, obviously, I would like to play Resogun and some of this other stuff that's on the download.
1408000	1415000	Like, you know, I'd like to at least try Contrast, and, you know, even though I already have Don't Starve on PC, I'll probably play it on console, too, because I tend to do that.
1415000	1423000	But then also, I still want to really play Need for Speed, and a friend's able to get me a sweet deal on Assassin's Creed 4, so I'm like, all right, I'll try to play those games, too.
1423000	1432000	And the other thing that's weighing on my mind, I'm going to get judged for this, but the Final Fantasy XIV beta test starts next month, so I have to be ready for it.
1432000	1435000	So that's what finally pushed me over the edge and I got my PlayStation 4.
1435000	1441000	Now I got to find one of those stinking cameras. The cameras are totally, like, nowhere.
1441000	1442000	Best Buy.
1442000	1443000	Really?
1443000	1444000	Order it on Amazon.
1444000	1445000	Nope, nope, it's not on Amazon.
1445000	1449000	Sold out through their partners for $120.
1449000	1450000	GameStop Online.
1450000	1454000	Maybe. I'm going to have to dig around a little more to find it, but yeah.
1454000	1456000	So I got my PlayStation 4.
1456000	1461000	So I will have more to say on that next Sunday when I actually get it all set.
1461000	1462000	Steph is judging you.
1462000	1463000	Is he?
1463000	1464000	I'm kind of judging you a little bit.
1464000	1465000	Why are you judging me?
1465000	1467000	Because I judge you all the time.
1467000	1469000	I'm getting mine after I'm working.
1469000	1472000	I can bring a controller and we can actually play two player games.
1472000	1474000	I'm getting mine after I start working, so.
1474000	1475000	Yeah, there you go.
1475000	1478000	And Loki will probably get one as well.
1478000	1479000	Oh, come on.
1479000	1482000	Everybody in chat's like, slash me is judging, judging.
1482000	1483000	Shut up.
1483000	1486000	A dark Tetsuya, where's our eye of judgment?
1486000	1488000	Shut up.
1488000	1492000	Breakman in chat.
1492000	1494000	I got drunk and bought songs on iTunes.
1494000	1496000	Sky gets drunk and buys a PlayStation 4.
1496000	1498000	He's way more hardcore than me.
1498000	1501000	I was surfically pober, ossifer.
1501000	1507000	And all I did was buy a technologically fancy deadbolt.
1507000	1510000	You know what the second sassy tweet I got?
1510000	1513000	So I got Flaco Jones tweet was the first sassy tweet.
1513000	1514000	You want to know what the second sassy tweet was?
1514000	1516000	One of us. One of us.
1516000	1517000	No, I got plenty of that.
1517000	1522000	No, the second, I think one of my friends who works for Sony actually tweeted that one.
1522000	1523000	One of us.
1523000	1531000	No, the second tweet I got was from the first mate Slidekick over at gamebuoy.org
1531000	1535000	who just replied with hashtag Team Xbox One.
1535000	1537000	And I'm like, just fuck.
1537000	1539000	Don't start that shit with me.
1539000	1542000	Do not start that fucking war with me right now.
1542000	1545000	I'll get an Xbox One as well, but probably over the holidays.
1545000	1548000	I'm not buying them the same month. It's too expensive.
1548000	1550000	But the holidays, I'll have enough saved up.
1550000	1555000	We're probably not getting an Xbone if we do until much, much later.
1555000	1558000	Yeah, I'm like, but then there'll be that new Halo or something.
1558000	1563000	I don't know what games you guys are really into, but there'll be something that you're going to be like, I need it.
1563000	1566000	Well, I think our opinion now is just we don't give a fuck.
1566000	1567000	Mm hmm.
1567000	1570000	Sort of. I mean, we're sort of like, what are we doing?
1570000	1571000	How much stuff do we have on Steam?
1571000	1572000	And we have new computers.
1572000	1577000	Is that a weird place to be, though, because you guys were such collectors before?
1577000	1579000	I mean, your vault and everything.
1579000	1583000	I think that we've really turned our hearts back towards our classics.
1583000	1590000	You know, and we love all the new stuff, but I mean, there's hardly anything now that comes out on the console
1590000	1595000	that we can't find either the same game or something as good on PC.
1595000	1600000	And, you know, we just sunk 900 bucks into both of our computers,
1600000	1603000	which granted, it would have been a lot more if we need to do graphics cards,
1603000	1605000	but our graphics cards are already great.
1605000	1608000	And now I'm playing everything without a hiccup.
1608000	1613000	I didn't even think about wanting to go back in the other room and, you know,
1613000	1617000	out of my warm computer room and into the cold, cold, cold living room.
1617000	1619000	See, for me, it's kind of the opposite.
1619000	1622000	Like, I like to get away from the computer in the office once in a while
1622000	1624000	and, you know, sit on the couch and watch.
1624000	1627000	Well, because I turned up the heat for all our friends coming over.
1627000	1631000	But, you know, I like to plop on the couch and enjoy a game once in a while, you know?
1631000	1638000	Well, you know, I don't really like usually if I'm gonna leave the room,
1638000	1642000	like I'll take my DS in the front room and was that me or you?
1642000	1644000	I think it was you.
1644000	1646000	No, mine's on mute.
1646000	1651000	But I sorry, it's iPhone time, everybody.
1651000	1656000	But I'll take my DS into the front room while Dan's doing something
1656000	1659000	or, you know, I like to sit in there and crochet,
1659000	1664000	but I haven't really had too much of an urge to sit down and play anything on the console.
1664000	1667000	The last controller I picked up was an Xbox controller to play Skullgirls.
1667000	1673000	And I'm probably gonna be starting Rekt here, but other than that.
1673000	1678000	All right, well, I will be enjoying my PlayStation 4
1678000	1682000	and I'll tell you more about it next week after I have it and all.
1682000	1686000	But for now, let's talk about what we have been into this week in a segment we call
1686000	1689000	How Was Your Gaming Week? What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1689000	1690000	Dark Sakura.
1690000	1692000	Well, I played Skullgirls.
1692000	1697000	I'm playing Final Fantasy XIV again, just trying to get on there a little bit more active.
1697000	1702000	I'm gonna do that stupid quest that I hate.
1702000	1705000	And I'm stuck in a dungeon.
1705000	1711000	So I'm also playing Mass Effect 3 again because I had to fix Becky Shepard.
1711000	1715000	That's usually... Becky will give me her Xbox save.
1715000	1718000	I go in, you know, modify it and give it the right color hair
1718000	1722000	because the red, the default red hair in that game sucks.
1722000	1724000	So I fix it.
1724000	1729000	And then Locopogo asked me who I maimed in Skullgirls.
1729000	1734000	And I used, oh God, what's her name? Who's the Princess Lady?
1734000	1738000	Well, by saying Princess Lady, hopefully that closes the chat.
1738000	1739000	She's cool.
1739000	1742000	I've not played it, so...
1742000	1747000	And I'm about to, I actually tried to start Rekt here last night,
1747000	1750000	but I didn't get very far.
1750000	1752000	And, oh, what else was it?
1752000	1757000	Because I bought something and now for the life of me, I cannot remember.
1757000	1762000	Parasoul, by the way. Parasoul is who I was trying to remember.
1762000	1765000	And Dan, and Queen Semia just reminded me too.
1765000	1771000	And Dan and I are supposed to be starting back on...
1771000	1773000	Borderlands 2 again.
1773000	1776000	I don't know why I can't remember the names of stuff today.
1776000	1778000	Good, it's not just me.
1778000	1780000	Well, no, I told you I've been like this all day.
1780000	1784000	I've just been kind of, maybe more coffee. Rob coffee.
1784000	1786000	You really want more coffee? I can make that happen.
1786000	1787000	Actually, yes.
1787000	1789000	No, you don't have to...
1789000	1791000	Same one, please. It was good.
1791000	1794000	Yes, ma'am.
1794000	1797000	Oh, Rob.
1797000	1803000	And I actually, and then for New Year's actually, we did not do our rock band thing.
1803000	1806000	We actually had Epic Cards Against Humanity.
1806000	1812000	With the holiday cards thrown in that had the...
1812000	1818000	I got a whole set of cards that all of the responses on them were about semen.
1818000	1820000	And those came up in three people's hands.
1820000	1824000	I think everybody's New Year was Cards Against Humanity, just judging from Facebook.
1824000	1826000	And that's what I did too.
1826000	1827000	And Trivolo.
1827000	1830000	Literally, yeah, it was Cards Against Humanity and alcohol.
1830000	1833000	I think that's like how 90% of America reigned in the New Year.
1833000	1835000	Because that's exactly where I went, what happened.
1835000	1837000	I made coffee vodka and chocolate vodka.
1837000	1840000	We literally did nothing but that game for three hours.
1840000	1844000	And then by the time it was like, you know, and it was like, oh shit, it's 1158.
1844000	1846000	Turn on the TV, put on the thing.
1846000	1848000	And don't forget Animal Crossing.
1849000	1852000	I crossed those animals, they are quite cross.
1852000	1855000	And Zelda and Pokemon.
1855000	1858000	I'm playing Pokemon X instead of dance playing Y.
1858000	1860000	And I'm still playing some Zelda.
1860000	1862000	Gender appropriate.
1862000	1864000	Well, but I wanted the...
1864000	1868000	The whole reason I'm playing X is not because of any of the legendaries or anything.
1868000	1870000	I want the damn Houndoom.
1870000	1872000	I don't care, I want the evil dog.
1872000	1874000	I want Houndoom.
1874000	1876000	I don't know these Pokemans anymore.
1876000	1878000	I need to play. I've been meaning to pick it up.
1878000	1881000	It's a dark dog. He looks like an angry Doberman.
1881000	1883000	I love it.
1883000	1885000	Thank you for the coffee, Rob.
1885000	1888000	I gotta go dress it up now, so it's Loki's turn.
1890000	1896000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Land Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, brand.
1896000	1901000	So yes, this week I played...
1901000	1905000	I don't know what I really played other than one game in particular.
1905000	1913000	Okay, so as I had promised on the show before that I was like, okay, okay, let's set that Minecraft server up finally.
1913000	1921000	So I went to check because our friend Gally had actually allowed us access to his server.
1921000	1923000	But apparently his server's gone.
1923000	1928000	So I was like, well crap, you know, how much is it gonna cost to actually run a server now?
1928000	1932000	And thankfully I found it for a very cheap amount.
1932000	1935000	It lessened my Netflix subscriptions.
1935000	1943000	So I went ahead and bought a server or rented a server and imported our map back in there.
1943000	1946000	So our Minecraft server's up and running again.
1946000	1948000	Yay, thank you, Loki.
1948000	1953000	And that's what I was doing this week, was setting that up and messing around with that.
1953000	1960000	And I even messed with some new plugins and stuff and had an NPC builder that I spawned last night.
1960000	1963000	And he built Normandy for Dark Sakura.
1963000	1965000	Yay!
1965000	1967000	It's gigantic.
1967000	1969000	It's fucking huge.
1969000	1972000	You reposted all the information again right on the forums?
1972000	1974000	Yeah, it's on the forums.
1974000	1977000	Everything's been updated, how to log back in there and stuff.
1977000	1981000	And you just may need to redownload your client if you haven't played in a long time.
1981000	1987000	Because they have a new client now that updates within itself instead of having to redownload it each time.
1987000	1991000	And so if you haven't gotten that new one yet, you have to redownload that.
1991000	1993000	That's what I had to do.
1993000	2002000	On top of that, my old copy's gone anyway because I upgraded my computer and didn't copy over my Minecraft because I knew I could redownload it.
2002000	2005000	The new Minecraft has streaming integration too, which is pretty cool.
2005000	2007000	That's pretty cool.
2007000	2012000	The last thing I remembered is that someone put a huge N7 in front of my underground bunker.
2012000	2015000	I think that's huge.
2015000	2018000	Wait until you see what they fucking did to your house.
2018000	2020000	I'm gonna move into the Normandy.
2020000	2024000	I lit it up on the inside. Yes, you can very well move into the Normandy.
2024000	2026000	It's very possible.
2026000	2031000	I don't follow Mass Effect that well, so it's the Normandy 2, I guess.
2031000	2038000	Isn't there a map that they can access online that shows them where all the landmarks are?
2038000	2042000	Yes, there's also a link to that.
2042000	2050000	I don't have the landmarks marked yet because everything's brand new again, but you can track people on the map.
2050000	2055000	I do that a lot, even at work, and I'll talk to people while they're doing stuff.
2055000	2062000	Now, it is a whitelist server, so it causes people some aggravation because you have to wait a bit to get access to it.
2062000	2069000	But if you just go to our forums at vognetwork.com and let Loki know in the official Minecraft thread that you want access to the server, he'll grant it for you.
2069000	2073000	You have to agree not to be a dick and ruin people's things.
2073000	2081000	Don't ruin people's things, but that doesn't mean people haven't decided to still do weird shit.
2081000	2088000	I'll just say real quick, when I logged back in, and sorry to get into my week a little bit, but I played Minecraft for the first time in a long time.
2088000	2092000	I was like, okay, first things first, I should probably finish this stupid house.
2092000	2095000	So I finished my house, and then I made a mistake.
2095000	2101000	I was digging underneath my house because I think I wanted to write my name in clay or something.
2101000	2105000	And as I was digging, I was like, wait, what the hell, there's more brick under here. I didn't put any brick in here.
2105000	2110000	Somebody built a copy of my house directly underneath my house.
2110000	2111000	That's great.
2111000	2116000	So I was like, what the fuck? And then I guess it turns out, I think it was Hitstun that did it.
2116000	2119000	I might be misblaming somebody, but I think he took responsibility.
2119000	2128000	So Hitstun said what he was hoping to do is to rig my front door so that when I go in, I would be transported to the copy of my house and be like, what the hell's going on?
2128000	2134000	So that's about the limit of fucking with people that you can do in the server and not get in trouble, which I actually thought was pretty funny.
2134000	2138000	But you know what? I showed him, I said, fine, I'm going to turn this into my basement sex dungeon.
2138000	2140000	So I've built...
2140000	2142000	So that's where the dungeons have come from.
2142000	2143000	Yes.
2143000	2145000	Complete with stripper pole?
2145000	2150000	I'm very limited by Minecraft's resources. In fact, it's not much of a sex dungeon.
2150000	2152000	Just build a fence straight up. There you go, stripper pole.
2152000	2155000	Yeah, all I can really do is just have a really big bed so far.
2155000	2161000	But that is the plan is that the house that Hitstun built for me, I will make my sex dungeon. I'll show you.
2161000	2166000	Well, I need to, as I said in chat room, I need to have dead fish in my Normandy.
2166000	2169000	There better be an aquarium with dead fish in it. I'm just saying.
2169000	2173000	All right. So anyway, sorry, Loki. I didn't mean to derail your segment, but go ahead.
2173000	2179000	No, that's it. And so I actually, I chopped down the size of our map and stuff because there's a lot of extra space.
2179000	2183000	So they'd regenerate some new terrain and I got to say that new terrain is really fucking boring.
2183000	2194000	So I don't know what, you know, unfortunately they changed the way that like their algorithm or whatever on how like stuff spawns and like how terrain is generated.
2194000	2201000	There's some interesting stuff, but man, like I was originally going to, I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get our map imported in there.
2201000	2207000	So I was like, okay, well I'll just see what our map looks like now with the same seed and stuff. And man, it was fucking terrible.
2207000	2214000	It was just like swamps everywhere. Just swamps for as far as you can see.
2214000	2216000	Nice.
2216000	2224000	But yeah, it's, it's, it's working now and you know, there's horses and stuff and actually I may go through there and take up the monsters.
2224000	2232000	Cause right now I just have it as a, you know, we still can do creative, but I have monsters walking around and stuff just for the hell of it.
2232000	2234000	They kind of annoy me.
2234000	2239000	Well I like seeing the random Slenderman showing up in my basement, you know. It's cool.
2239000	2247000	I thought at one point, maybe you can't do this financially or whatever, that's fine. But I thought at one point we were going to have like a creative server and a survival server.
2247000	2249000	Or is that, that's, I thought you could like...
2249000	2256000	We can still do that. But I just, I don't know. There's not a lot of people playing right now. I just stick it on creative for now.
2256000	2262000	What I'm going to do is build stuff into it like the mob arena and that way we have things to do.
2262000	2268000	Okay, that works. That works. So if we get the participation there, then maybe we'll look at doing that. But for now it's just the creative mode.
2268000	2273000	But I've been having a lot of fun with creative mode. I didn't think I would, but I've been having a lot of fun with it. So it works.
2274000	2279000	Anyway, okay, so to piggyback on the rest of the Minecraft story, I have also played a ton of Minecraft this week.
2279000	2282000	And Robert M. in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com says,
2282000	2288000	I don't know what house the sky is. I saw Loki's throne room, the Zero Mega Man stuff, and the dungeon.
2288000	2291000	I was at least aware enough not to lock myself in a cell.
2291000	2296000	Here's the deal. Okay, so originally my first house was like right in the center of the map.
2296000	2298000	And people...
2298000	2300000	You notice a giant snowman next to it.
2300000	2305000	People really were fucking with me in that house. So I got really mad and I was like, fuck this, I'm packing my shit and leaving.
2305000	2311000	So I bulldozed that house and I went really far south on the map, which at the time was really far south on the map, although it's not that far.
2311000	2314000	So if you go south, you'll see a brick house eventually and that's mine.
2314000	2322000	But you can also tell now one thing I did this week is I did that very cliche Minecraft thing where I built 8-bit sprites into Minecraft.
2322000	2327000	So I now live on Black Mage Beach. So I live on top of this giant cliff that I...
2327000	2335000	And I had to clear out a huge mountain to get it. I live on top of this giant cliff and on the back side of the cliff is a giant 8-bit Black Mage sprite.
2335000	2339000	And what I did, because I had to do some tricky things with the water so that the whole thing wouldn't get...
2339000	2344000	Because stupid me was like, oh shit, the cliff's not big enough to build the entire sprite.
2344000	2350000	So I had to kind of... So it's now Black Mage Beach. So I put all sand down there and that's where I live now is Black Mage Beach.
2351000	2359000	So come say hi, but stop fucking with my house or I'm gonna move somewhere where you won't find me. That's for sure.
2359000	2360000	Alright.
2360000	2361000	Oh, we'll find you.
2361000	2366000	Yeah, I know, right. They'll build another nether portal right at my front door. When did this show up?
2366000	2371000	Well, hey, that's part of the network system we have to go around to each other's houses.
2371000	2376000	No, it is very cool. Like, somebody spent a lot of time to make that so I don't want to sound ungrateful.
2376000	2379000	It's just I'm always like, damn, like...
2379000	2382000	Yeah, I think that was also Hitstun. He's been doing a lot of stuff.
2382000	2387000	Well, props for you, Hitstun, even if you were trying to mess with me. Alright.
2387000	2393000	For the record, the other thing that I did see was Minecraft on an Android tablet.
2393000	2399000	And promptly saw Julian lining up about ten blocks of TNT and blowing stuff up.
2399000	2401000	So I learned that you can blow stuff up on the...
2401000	2403000	Yes you can. Yes you can.
2403000	2409000	Okay, so other games I've played this week. I did play an extraordinary amount of Final Fantasy XIV, as I usually do.
2409000	2413000	I finished the 2.1 patch story.
2413000	2419000	And what I'm going to say might be a little bit spoilery, so plug your ears for 30 seconds.
2419000	2423000	If you don't want to hear this, okay, so I'm going to say something that is borderline spoilery.
2423000	2426000	So just... I don't think it really is. Okay, plug your ears.
2426000	2431000	I'm convinced more than ever that we're going to find out that this game is an Ivalice Alliance game.
2431000	2434000	And that's going to come out probably in the first expansion.
2434000	2438000	There's just... there's too damn many clues that tie into...
2438000	2443000	And there's a big one at the end of the 2.1 patch that ties into Final Fantasy Tactics.
2443000	2448000	And I'm like, this is a freaking Ivalice game. That's what the first expansion is going to be.
2448000	2451000	I bet. I'm putting my money on it. So we'll see.
2451000	2454000	But I think that's really exciting. It's super cool if that's the case.
2454000	2456000	Well timed. 30 seconds just now.
2456000	2458000	Alright, awesome. Okay, then I'll shut up and talk about something else.
2458000	2461000	How about I'll talk about another game that takes like 30 seconds to play.
2461000	2464000	Okay, I'm going to talk about Divekick.
2464000	2467000	In Divekick, you do two things.
2467000	2469000	You dive and you kick.
2469000	2472000	There is literally two buttons for Divekick. I'm sure a lot of you have seen this.
2472000	2474000	So Extfer and I played a little bit of this.
2474000	2479000	Brad from Pod Culture was kind enough to buy me the game when it was on the Steam sale and what have you.
2479000	2483000	So thank you very much. He picked that up for me so we could screw around with that.
2483000	2485000	And so Extfer and I were playing that the other night.
2485000	2487000	Unfortunately we were suffering a little bit of a lag.
2487000	2489000	Like it was really kind of laggy online.
2489000	2491000	Now to be fair, I was video streaming.
2491000	2493000	Probably not the best thing for ping time.
2493000	2497000	But I was a little bit like, ah, this is kind of a bummer to play online.
2497000	2500000	But when it worked, it was kind of silly fun.
2500000	2502000	I think I described it on the stream as this.
2502000	2508000	This is the type of game that is great for like conventions or anytime you get 20 people drunk in a room together.
2508000	2510000	And you just want to play this.
2510000	2512000	Because obviously there's not a lot to it.
2513000	2515000	It's not like Ultra, Street Fighter, 4, Turbo.
2515000	2518000	Your barrier to entry is literally three buttons.
2518000	2520000	One button, two button, both buttons.
2520000	2522000	Oh yeah, yeah. One button, two button, both buttons.
2522000	2524000	You're right. So there's that.
2524000	2526000	So I'm like, oh no, Jason. There's only two buttons.
2526000	2528000	And you set them at the very beginning of the game.
2528000	2530000	And yeah, even to move backwards.
2530000	2534000	If you hit the kick button without hitting dive first, then your character will hop backwards.
2534000	2537000	And if you want to move forward, you have to just dive, kick, dive.
2537000	2540000	And then you hit both buttons to do special moves and all this stuff.
2541000	2544000	Yeah, it's silly, but it's fun.
2544000	2547000	Some of the characters are a little crazy.
2549000	2551000	But I guess that's part of the charm of the game.
2551000	2555000	And yeah, I had fun when it was just like the normal...
2555000	2558000	Instead of Ken and Ryu, you have dive and kick.
2558000	2561000	And so those were the best matches where it was just dive versus kick.
2561000	2563000	So we had fun with that.
2563000	2566000	Yeah, the abilities and the movement differences of some of the characters.
2566000	2570000	Whatever the psych ward, patient, dragon thing guy is controls.
2570000	2571000	Yeah, one of them teleports.
2571000	2572000	Really weird.
2572000	2575000	One of them turns invisible when he dives.
2575000	2577000	And that's good and bad.
2577000	2581000	It's good because you're invisible, but it's bad because he's invisible for everybody.
2581000	2586000	Locopoco said in chat, you know they played a dive kick tournament at EVO.
2586000	2589000	Oh, I'm sure they did. I think this is a huge thing now.
2589000	2590000	I think that's when it debuted.
2590000	2592000	Maybe. Possibly. Not sure.
2592000	2595000	Alright, so anyway, that was dive kick. I had fun with that.
2595000	2601000	One other game I played this week that I'll talk about now is a game I think I talked about about a year ago.
2601000	2603000	And last week was our best of show.
2603000	2608000	And I completely neglected to name this game, even though I remembered to say something on Hoard House.
2608000	2611000	But probably because Hoard House is a show about online games.
2611000	2617000	But silly me, really should have put this game in my honorable mentions or even in the number 5 slot on last week's OLR.
2617000	2621000	Because I think I actually did name it number 5 on Hoard House, but you know, minds can change.
2621000	2624000	But for seriously, this is one of the best games that came out last year.
2624000	2627000	Path of Exile I played quite a bit of this past week.
2627000	2634000	I hadn't played it in a while and just randomly was like, oh I should see what's going on here because you know it's on Steam and so on.
2634000	2640000	So I loaded it up. And they're having like a contest right now. By the way, Path of Exile, free to play.
2640000	2645000	And it's like one of the best. Oh, you just loaded up the picture of your Normandy, didn't you?
2645000	2646000	Stop derailing me, Darcyra.
2646000	2647000	Oh god, it's awesome.
2647000	2654000	Path of Exile, probably one of the best free to play things that's out on PC right now because it doesn't try to nickel and dime you to progress.
2654000	2658000	You can do the whole story without paying for it. All the paying stuff is cosmetic.
2658000	2664000	Although, if you want to do like guilds and get a bigger bank, they do try to charge you for that stuff.
2664000	2668000	But I think it's very reasonable. You get a lot for nothing in this game.
2668000	2674000	So I think if you like roguelikes or Diablo clones at all, you should try Path of Exile.
2674000	2676000	You really have nothing to lose. And it's fun.
2676000	2679000	Well, you just said two magic words.
2679000	2681000	Roguelike? Well, think...
2681000	2683000	Considering all my nominations.
2683000	2685000	Jason, what is Diablo at its core?
2685000	2687000	Well, I mean, Diablo...
2687000	2689000	It's a roguelike.
2689000	2696000	Good point. It has its, you know, 3D advantages, but it's very much a dungeon crawl, which is all those games are.
2696000	2699000	And that's exactly what Path of Exile is, too.
2699000	2707000	With an insane, fucking insane talent tree that reminds me of the Final Fantasy X game board where you just could move anywhere. It was crazy.
2707000	2712000	The crystal... chrysanthe... I don't remember.
2712000	2713000	Crystalarium or something, yeah.
2713000	2714000	That sounds right.
2714000	2719000	But anyway, so yeah, Path of Exile, great. Oh, so what I did this week, they have these regular tournaments.
2719000	2727000	So right now, they're having like a one-week tournament to just, you know, get as much experience as you can on this character in one week.
2727000	2734000	But the game's on hardcore mode. And there's these other features, too, that I don't fully understand because I haven't played the game in a while.
2734000	2739000	But something called Nemesis, which I don't know if that makes the enemy stronger or what, and something where the shrines can affect you or the enemy.
2739000	2745000	But for me, I'm just like, it's hardcore. Meaning if you die, you die. Game over and you're done.
2745000	2756000	So far, my character's still alive and she's level 11. So for somebody who hasn't played in like a year and didn't really play that much to begin with, I'm very happy with my progress.
2756000	2761000	So I'm gonna see how far I get on that. So yeah. Love the soundtrack in Path of Exile as well.
2761000	2768000	Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, not everything is a roguelike.
2768000	2774000	Correct, not everything is a roguelike. Mass Effect is not a roguelike. Final Fantasy is not a roguelike.
2774000	2776000	No. No, but I do like roguelikes.
2776000	2784000	Honestly enough, though, you know what game I've kind of had this urge to play is Venture. I want to hook up my Colecovision.
2784000	2787000	That is old school. Is Minecraft a roguelike? I guess not.
2787000	2789000	It's a sandbox.
2789000	2797000	Yeah, it's more of a sandbox. Okay, anyhow, let's, okay, that's enough about my gaming week. Oh, Jason, I don't want to miss you, though. Jason, how was your gaming week?
2797000	2808000	My last week was incredibly lazy. I know I opened up a couple common things and played, like, literally less than five to ten minutes of, and just stopped. I don't know why.
2808000	2812000	That's okay, because the news in gaming is the same way this week.
2812000	2822000	Easy week, catching up on sleep more than anything else, and a couple of legitimate days of work, but that's it. Last week was terribly unexciting.
2822000	2836000	All right, fair enough, fair enough. All right, excuse me, let's get into some housekeeping real quick. I always plug the Twitter and the Facebook here, so twitter.com slash o-l-r and facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and we're also on Google+.
2836000	2842000	If you'd like to prove to us that people are still using Google+, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, all one word.
2842000	2867000	Also, we're at youtube.com slash orange lounge radio, where Jason will post the orange lounge radio enhanced edition, I don't know what else to call it, so it's the orange lounge radio enhanced edition, typically about a week after the show airs, and, you know, the first week was just nothing but the show on YouTube, but now you really have been enhancing it, so Jason, tell us a little bit about, because you just posted last Sunday's show today, it's great.
2867000	2896000	I finally got it up with upload and everything else like that, it was literally like 1230 in the morning, local Pacific time of course, but I want to start being able to actually feature some of this stuff visually, so the fortune cookie message of the week, podcast listeners trying to see if there's something else we're gonna do, but the show always ends with a fortune cookie message of the week that Jamie comes up with, and so I throw the video in in the outro, because it's just a way of sending you
2896000	2899000	something fun to depart the show with.
2899000	2920000	Yeah, it was always, and the reason why that was instituted in the first was just because the podcast listeners were like, I have no idea what this man is talking about, it's something we do live only because it's so weird to say, okay, well, we're gonna just hit disconnect now and dump all our listeners, so we always kind of just end with a little, like a song or something, she does a lot of stand up comedians and things like that, so.
2921000	2948000	Last week was Brental Floss, Super Mario 3D World with Lyrics, Christmas Week was Night Santa, no no, Christmas at Ground Zero, Weirdo Yankovic, and plenty of other fun random stuff to go with, but last week I put the visual representation of Listless in the video, when we were talking Mighty No. 9, Call's designs, as one of us referenced individual one, put that on top.
2948000	2961000	YouTube doesn't allow you to link to anything, so a creative solution is gonna have to happen for figuring out how to give appropriate attribution to a lot of these articles and whatnot now.
2961000	2979000	I would also like to extend a very special thank you to Dungeon Buster and ActDeft for giving me chapter timestamps for episode 532 and 533, so if you go to youtube.com slash orange on radio, expand the description and then you can hop straight to a chapter just by clicking the little timestamp in the description.
2979000	2980000	That part's awesome.
2980000	2989000	Wonderful, incredibly helpful, that's what I wanted to do from the get go, and it's time consuming as all hell, so thank you so much both of you for doing that.
2989000	3001000	That's great, thank you guys for doing that, and yeah that's awesome, because if you're just like, oh I want to hear that Listless from last week again, because I just remember Alan's answers were so bad, because they were so mean, you could just go back to the Listless.
3001000	3002000	You could just say that because he's not here.
3002000	3018000	Well, and I know he's listening and making a stank face at me right now as I say that, but no, for real, you can go click on the number there and it will actually take you right to that section, that's really cool, so thank you Jason, thank you to your helpers, Dungeon Buster and ActDeft who all made that happen, that's great.
3018000	3019000	Very cool.
3019000	3021000	I'd like to thank our team of AV Techs.
3021000	3025000	I know right, we have a whole team now, Team OLR, it's great.
3025000	3027000	But I would not like to thank Jesus.
3027000	3030000	Stop, stop Kathy Griffin.
3030000	3033000	Alright, anyhow, so that's it for housekeeping, yes?
3033000	3034000	Sounds like it.
3034000	3038000	Alright, then I think we are finally ready to start the news. Loki!
3040000	3042000	Sorry, it's fighting the cat off of me.
3042000	3043000	Oh that's okay, I was like, uh oh, Loki's AV Tech.
3043000	3044000	Kitty!
3045000	3048000	Yeah, she was trying to be in my face and stuff.
3048000	3049000	That's what cats do.
3049000	3060000	Anyways, so this is I guess why we can't have good things, and that would be people exploiting stuff in the name of cheating.
3060000	3065000	And this happened with, I guess, NES Remix.
3065000	3074000	They had a time attack contest that was going on, and apparently people figured out, hey we can exploit this by pausing and unpausing.
3074000	3077000	You know, the slow-mo and the original NES.
3077000	3082000	Apparently the gameplay would start before the timer would start.
3082000	3091000	And so doing that, you'd be able to finish a certain level or something with a very low time that wouldn't exactly be accurate.
3091000	3101000	So because of that, they said, in the interest of being as fair as possible, we decided to terminate the event without recognizing the fastest time.
3101000	3108000	We sincerely apologize for this matter, and particularly because the vast majority of people played fairly.
3108000	3110000	That's too bad.
3110000	3114000	Way to go, bad apples ruining it for everybody.
3114000	3119000	But at the same time, I mean, here's the thing that gets me.
3119000	3124000	These games are supposed to go through this long quality process, which maybe NES Remix was a little more rushed.
3124000	3125000	I kind of think it was.
3125000	3132000	So maybe it didn't go through some of that, but I always think the pause-unpause trick was huge on the NES.
3132000	3135000	So nobody thought to try that.
3135000	3138000	I mean, granted, maybe not so much in the games that are included.
3138000	3141000	Like, pause-unpause was more like Gunsmoke was synonymous with that.
3141000	3143000	That was the infamous game for that.
3143000	3146000	So maybe they didn't think to try it in the games that they included.
3146000	3150000	But I was just kind of like, I was just surprised that.
3150000	3154000	I mean, yes, I want to blame the bad apples, and they do take the blame.
3154000	3156000	But you also kind of have to go, really?
3156000	3158000	It's not like they hacked it.
3158000	3165000	They just found a problem that you guys didn't find yourself that really anybody could use to get their times better.
3165000	3169000	Yeah, that's the really interesting part about this, is that it's not malicious, technically.
3169000	3172000	There is no falsifying information.
3172000	3175000	This is a legitimate quirk of the game that people took advantage of.
3175000	3177000	That's fucking amazing!
3177000	3180000	We don't have awesome games in the show world, do we?
3180000	3181000	I don't think so.
3181000	3188000	Quick shout-out to Awesome Games Done Quick that was taking charity for cancer?
3188000	3192000	Yeah, for cancer research that was taking place over the course of today.
3192000	3193000	And these people...
3193000	3195000	I think it's more than just today.
3195000	3197000	It was yesterday and going on and on, yeah.
3197000	3202000	And these people, they don't break a game in a malicious sense.
3202000	3207000	They know the game inside and out to actually take advantage of these little personality quirks
3207000	3212000	and put it towards making the game doing better at the game than other people could with straight-up skill.
3212000	3218000	That's a thousand times different because those publishers are not currently running a contest for speedruns.
3218000	3225000	But even like speedruns, though, a lot of times people exploit glitches to go faster through games.
3225000	3229000	If it's in the game and they're not actually hacking, I don't see a problem with it.
3229000	3231000	There's not a problem with that.
3231000	3235000	But the whole start, stop, start, stop, start, stop thing, that's a problem.
3235000	3243000	Because NES Remix is not programmed to really recognize that the way it should, which is a fault of the game's design.
3243000	3246000	But then it's also a fault. That's why it's called an exploit.
3246000	3248000	Because they're exploiting that bug.
3250000	3254000	There are certainly numerous interpretations of the word exploit.
3254000	3258000	I understand that it makes the contest difficult.
3259000	3266000	If you were to actually see people perform this live and one person's screen is just flickering uncontrollably
3266000	3268000	because they're taking advantage of stuff, yeah, that sucks to watch.
3268000	3270000	But that's not what's going on here.
3270000	3273000	These people found something to make them better at this game.
3273000	3276000	It's the frickin' DDR bar argument all over again.
3276000	3279000	Look at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
3279000	3286000	Tech2030 says, Nintendo Lately, some people are bad, so we're taking everything away from you.
3286000	3289000	Oh, isn't that the truth? Hello, Swapnote.
3289000	3293000	I mean, obviously, a point I'm gonna make.
3293000	3299000	King of Kong, this harkens back to a time where games didn't phone home and they couldn't just have the results come back automatically
3299000	3301000	and be sorted, tallied, everything else.
3301000	3307000	But the fucking world record for Donkey Kong was 100% horseshit to begin with.
3307000	3311000	And that's why... fuck me, I'm gonna forget his name. I already forgot his name.
3311000	3313000	Not Weebie, what was other dude's name?
3314000	3316000	Other Donkey Kong world record holder.
3318000	3319000	Barbecue.
3319000	3322000	Oh, Mitchell. Billy Mitchell.
3322000	3333000	He, knowing what he knew of the game, his lawyer buddy, he knew that the score that was put forward in the world record was terrible.
3333000	3336000	So he sat down and blew it out of the water.
3336000	3339000	Thus begun the great Twin Galaxies.
3339000	3341000	And the King of Kong.
3341000	3343000	And now there's Hank Chen too, let's not forget.
3343000	3345000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
3345000	3356000	But my point being is that, you know, the fact that this can be done and verified via mechanism in the game really sucks for the contest
3356000	3363000	because to put the time into figuring out this stuff, it shows how dedicated to the game these people are.
3363000	3372000	And if there is no mal-intent, if there is no malicious, like, deliberate changing, it just sucks that people wouldn't be, you know,
3372000	3381000	that they wouldn't be recognized for being able to pull this off instead of just, oh, you didn't play the game the way we wanted you to play it, so everybody loses.
3381000	3382000	Eh, kinda sucks.
3383000	3386000	Yeah, but a pause-unpause thing isn't really a part of the game itself.
3386000	3392000	Like, it's kinda one thing, like, again, to talk about the awesome games done quickly when people exploit Mario Land.
3392000	3398000	Exploit Mario levels. It gives them no advantage that is not already immediately present to them.
3398000	3399000	Right.
3399000	3401000	So what's wrong with it?
3402000	3412000	I, when you're screwing with the timer when it's about time, I just, I don't know, it's totally different to me because, again, you have a current contest going on
3412000	3421000	and somebody's bending the rules using a feature not everybody knows about, whereas, you know, obviously people don't know the fastest way to beat a game.
3421000	3424000	That's what this competition is about.
3425000	3433000	Yeah, but if you were to, okay, let's say you're to watch, let's say you watch a speed run-through of NES Remix and it's just the dude pause-un-pausing, pause-un-pausing.
3433000	3439000	Are you gonna be really impressed by that? Or are you gonna be like, no, this guy's just pause-un-pausing to get his time left, that's cheap.
3441000	3446000	And that was the very first point that I made, is that it does not make for good watching, but that's not what happened here.
3446000	3448000	I agree with that point, 100%, absolutely.
3448000	3454000	Whereas the awesome games done quickly is great watching, because, like, people actually look at that and go, well, A, it's for charity, I'm not gonna knock a charity event,
3454000	3460000	B, a lot of people watch it and go, oh, sweet, I never knew I could do that in Mario, I'm gonna try that myself.
3460000	3471000	So, the first answer is that they curate the best-looking, you know, the games that come together well that are the most attractive to watch.
3471000	3482000	That said, I watched something from summer last year, possibly even 2012, where somebody speed-run-ed, speed-ran, speed-ran Super Meat Boy,
3482000	3491000	and one of the tactics with Flywheel, Fly, the little line character that, uh, I'd never played his horse game,
3491000	3497000	one of the tactics was to use up your double jump, pause-un-pause, and then get a third jump.
3497000	3507000	Just once, not repeatedly, but it was a quirk of the game's engine that even blew away Team Meat that were on the phone at the time that it happened.
3507000	3514000	And, uh, I believe it was Edmund, you could just hear him, he's just like, what?
3514000	3521000	So, it doesn't make for good watching, it's legitimate, it's not malicious.
3522000	3527000	Possibly. That is something else that we can have in this day and age.
3527000	3528000	That's that.
3528000	3534000	Yeah, but Nintendo understands patches, I mean, come on, this is online, we're talking about here, I mean.
3534000	3538000	Alright, any final word on this, Loki? This situation?
3538000	3544000	It's just disappointing that, you know, it got exploited like it did, especially for a contest.
3545000	3548000	Alright, well, moving on, talking about something a little different,
3548000	3554000	one of the games that came out right before the end of the year, over in Japan anyway, is Lightning Returns Final Fantasy XIII,
3554000	3557000	or as others have called it, Final Fantasy XIII-3.
3557000	3564000	The game is not out here in the States yet, but it will be out in February, question mark, I think it's the end of February when we get it.
3564000	3569000	Well, the game's out in Japan, and of course there's a lot of DLC, and I don't know if you guys have seen the DLC,
3569000	3575000	some of it is really ridiculous, like a lot of it is outfits for Lightning, and it's the type of shit she would never wear,
3575000	3582000	but whatever, it prints money, so they have it out there, like you can get like a moogle dress and stuff too.
3582000	3583000	Good lord.
3583000	3589000	One of the things, and I'm sure Dark Sakura's gonna choke on this, you can actually dress her up as Aerith from Final Fantasy VII.
3589000	3590000	Can I stab her?
3590000	3591000	With flowers.
3591000	3592000	With the flowers and everything.
3592000	3595000	I'll stab her with the flowers. I can do that.
3595000	3598000	And no, you cannot play as Sephiroth, I'm sorry Dark Sakura.
3598000	3607000	Well the only way to get this in Japan is to purchase the V-Jump strategy guide that Square Enix bundled the DLC with,
3607000	3614000	but actually that didn't happen that way, in theory that's what it was supposed to happen, it was supposed to be exclusive DLC,
3614000	3622000	but oops, it didn't work that way, because what happened is that the DLC was accidentally pushed out to the marketplace with everything else that came out,
3622000	3631000	such as the Final Fantasy VII DLC for Cloud was supposed to be there, being able to dress up like Yuna from Final Fantasy X was out there too,
3631000	3638000	another one of Jamie's favorite characters, you can actually dress the character up, that DLC was supposed to be there,
3638000	3643000	but Square was actually in breach of contract by putting the Aerith DLC out there.
3643000	3648000	Somebody's gonna lose a lot of money. Way more than what they're gonna make on this DLC.
3648000	3654000	The DLC was yanked on December 20th, an apology tweet went out saying, sorry we had to pull this because the strategy guide,
3654000	3657000	and they had to apologize to the makers of the strategy guide too.
3657000	3663000	They did note that Cloud and Yuna would return, because I guess they pulled everything, and then Cloud and Yuna outfits returned,
3663000	3667000	but they did not say anything about the Aerith costume, so yikes.
3667000	3673000	But you know at the same time mistakes happen, like I can think of games have accidentally been set for free,
3673000	3678000	like didn't that happen with Fable III at one point, I mean I know they gave that away eventually for the games for gold thing,
3678000	3683000	but at one point didn't they give away all of Fable III online accidentally for free?
3683000	3684000	Yeah I believe so.
3684000	3689000	It was two or three, one of them, they gave it away online, you know these things happen,
3689000	3697000	Steam Sale, Don't Starve, and Borderlands 2 both had the wrong price at one point, people were getting them dirt cheap.
3697000	3700000	Yeah I may have done that.
3700000	3707000	Yeah exactly, so you know these types of things happen, but it does kind of, I mean when it's the game being priced that way,
3707000	3711000	I kind of look at it and go okay that really sucks for the makers of that game,
3711000	3714000	because that's kind of essentially money out of their pockets or whatever.
3714000	3722000	With this when I look at it and it's DLC, like especially cosmetic, silly DLC, which is what this is,
3722000	3728000	it's a little harder for me to go, oh this poor strategy guide company, I'm just like this is stupid.
3728000	3734000	Why are we giving strategy guide companies exclusive DLC, I mean I guess that's to sell strategy guides,
3734000	3739000	but I know they did that with like Saints Row, and it was terrible DLC,
3739000	3745000	like the one for Saints Row IV is just some gun skins, that's it.
3745000	3750000	It's really just more of an incentive for people who like to collect all this stuff,
3750000	3754000	and you know to buy the strategy guide, I mean really that's the incentive.
3754000	3759000	And I mean I have a friend that works for one of the strategy guide companies,
3759000	3765000	and he's like yeah they pay all this money to get these exclusives and to get these type of things to go out.
3767000	3772000	I guess the hardcore fans of the game, I mean you know a Final Fantasy VII Aerith costume,
3772000	3777000	you know Jamie might not be Aerith's biggest fan, but there's a lot of people that would want to grab that,
3777000	3780000	but it's just a costume.
3780000	3785000	Hey well since you know that Square Enix is basically running Eidos now,
3785000	3790000	maybe we can get an Aerith skin for Tomb Raider, like the original one, so she can keep throwing her off a cliff.
3790000	3796000	One can only hope, I guess.
3797000	3802000	Be careful what you wish for, because there is that Tomb Raider, I forget the name of it,
3802000	3806000	the PlayStation 4 version, which by the way is another reason I bought the PS4, because I want to get that.
3806000	3807000	Legendary Ultimate?
3808000	3811000	Whatever. She's got new hair addition.
3811000	3812000	Definitive edition.
3812000	3815000	Thank you. I'm gonna call it the Tomb Raider, she got new hair addition.
3815000	3816000	She got her hairs did.
3816000	3822000	She got her hair done edition, and maybe, be careful what you wish for, there might be some of that DLC or something,
3822000	3829000	that would be so silly, but I love the idea of Dark Sakura getting Aerith DLC for that game for Tomb Raider,
3829000	3833000	just so she can keep killing her in mysterious ways.
3834000	3840000	You know that I still have my very first memory card with my save file at the Jenova fight,
3840000	3845000	because first of all, the Jenova fight is freaking awesome, and second, I get to see the bitch die.
3847000	3850000	I cheer every time, it just makes my heart warm.
3850000	3853000	So how about some other news?
3853000	3860000	Dave Roberts, who is the CEO of PopCap, is retiring on the 8th,
3860000	3872000	and the one replacing him is John Vecchi, who's basically going to be taking over.
3872000	3877000	And as we know, PopCap is a division of EA now.
3877000	3888000	So yeah, he's also leaving around the same time as Jason Kapalka, and they're like, bye, we're done.
3889000	3892000	I mean, I'm sure they've earned their retirement, yeah.
3892000	3896000	But if I worked for EA, I'd want to retire too.
3896000	3903000	You still have to, and that's the whole thing, you still have to wonder, because this is a very odd trend we see,
3903000	3907000	is that, didn't the same thing happen with BioWare? Those guys left, right?
3907000	3911000	Now we see the PopCap guys left, it's just-
3911000	3914000	What if they started their own company called BioCap?
3914000	3917000	Plus, I mean-
3917000	3918000	PopWare?
3918000	3923000	What has PopCap been doing? I mean, I remember they used to crank out the game-
3923000	3924000	Plants vs Zombies 2.
3924000	3929000	Yeah, I know, I know, there's Plants vs Zombies 2, there's the Garden Warfare, and then there's Pagle 2, right?
3929000	3932000	But that was kind of all they did this past year?
3932000	3935000	Licensed all of the Bejeweled offshoots on various platforms.
3935000	3940000	Yeah, I mean, you could even play, for a while you could play Bejeweled and Pagle on WoW.
3940000	3941000	I missed their website.
3941000	3944000	And the Plants vs Zombies level in WoW, that was fun too.
3944000	3947000	I realize the website's still there, but it's probably not the same.
3947000	3949000	I haven't checked- admittedly, I haven't checked it out in a while.
3949000	3954000	But I used to like to go to PopCap.com and just play all their little free games that were in the Flash,
3954000	3956000	because they had some funny stuff in there.
3956000	3962000	There's a lot of games that people don't really talk about, like Big Money was one of them,
3962000	3968000	and sometimes they'd have these little gem games in there, but I don't know if that's just kind of not what they're about anymore.
3968000	3972000	I don't know, I stopped playing Bejeweled because of Doctor Who.
3974000	3978000	Were those games continuing to be made and published even after they were under EA?
3978000	3982000	Oh, I'm sure if it'll make money it does. Yeah, the iPhone store has a lot of those games.
3982000	3985000	No, I mean on their website specifically, little freebies like that.
3985000	3988000	Did those continue to be produced and come out after EA?
3988000	3992000	I'm gonna be honest, I haven't looked, but they're probably all Facebook games if nothing else.
3992000	3994000	That's probably what it is.
3994000	3996000	They need to be able to track it and prove that it's worthy.
3996000	4001000	They can't rely on feeling and intuition, it has to have metrics.
4001000	4005000	I rely on feeling and intuition. All the time.
4005000	4010000	Previously the Freebie Flash games were just essentially demos.
4010000	4019000	They were episode 1 demos of, for $15.95 you can get the full version that has extra puzzle levels and full...
4019000	4025000	They did the Peggle thing on Steam, the Peggle Extreme, that was basically just crossover with Valve games.
4025000	4027000	The Portal level was really fun.
4027000	4029000	And they had the Warcraft plug-in one too, it was awesome.
4029000	4035000	That's what I talked about earlier, because I used to just sit waiting for the pug or whatever,
4035000	4041000	because I was always DPS, and play Peggle for an hour until I finally got picked up.
4041000	4047000	Alright, well I think we should probably go over to Loki's story, right Loki?
4047000	4057000	Yes, speaking of people leaving, Criterion, the two co-founders of that studio have now left to form yet another studio.
4057000	4066000	And Criterion may remember them for the wonderful, awesome racing games Burnout, and some of the more recent Need for Speed games.
4066000	4075000	But yes, so now they are going to form a brand new company, and I don't know what they're naming it yet.
4075000	4079000	Maybe they're going to join the PopCap guys! That'd be pretty cool.
4079000	4093000	But yeah, they're saying, you know, news breaks along with Fiona Sperry at I Have Left Criterion Games, welcome to the real future.
4093000	4095000	Whatever that means.
4095000	4099000	But I guess they're going to form their own company or something.
4099000	4101000	The futures!
4101000	4105000	Well, there you go. We'll just add that to the list.
4106000	4110000	So it's going to be Criterie Popware?
4110000	4112000	Crit Pop.
4112000	4113000	Crit Pop.
4113000	4114000	You never know.
4114000	4125000	Let's see, okay, so here's the thing, I went to PopCap.com just because I was curious, and the first thing you see is kind of like an ad for all the stuff on iPhone, and then you go to more games, and it shows you more games.
4125000	4127000	Bookworm Adventures!
4127000	4132000	Yeah, like, you know, in San Aquarium, that game was the shit. I love that game. They even have like an arcade version of that, right?
4132000	4143000	Okay, but you can learn more PC download, and then all the way at the bottom, online games, little tiny link that leads you to online games, and I think, yes, this is where you can play.
4143000	4151000	Okay, then it's like here's the featured games, and then you can all get, so four clicks later, finally.
4151000	4153000	And they still have their most popular games on top.
4153000	4156000	Do I just hit learn more and I can play in San Aquarium?
4156000	4158000	Download free.
4158000	4160000	Okay, but it's not playing the browser like it used to be.
4160000	4161000	No.
4161000	4164000	So they've definitely changed the site a little bit. That's too bad.
4164000	4167000	Because EA likes to fuck it all up.
4167000	4186000	Certain personalities just don't, you know, you reach a point where, you reach a point where your company changes, you either turn into EA or you join them, and then you get to the point where you want to start all over again, because in a big corporation, you're limited in what you can do.
4186000	4198000	Well, also I think kind of, you know, the direction that EA's going with a lot of their games is definitely focused on monetization, and maybe that's not necessarily something that these guys want to, you know, deal with.
4198000	4199000	Perhaps.
4200000	4221000	I understand that the point of a corporation is to make money, but what happens to, you know, the only reason I think that we have such a big indie community now is, first of all, the technology is easier to come across, and second of all, that we have more people who are willing to make games that people will like, just for the love of it.
4221000	4231000	You know, and I think that a lot of people are being driven more towards the indie game scene rather than going for these big, you know, publications.
4233000	4234000	Fair enough.
4234000	4238000	All right, well, I think we're going to shift gears here a little bit with our next story, right, Jason?
4239000	4264000	Yeah, so, as perhaps a small little addition to us reporting last week about various network services, online services, having outages during the holidays, which was due in large part to an influx of gamers, but there was another interesting story that happened in the last couple of days, that a Twitch and YouTube streamer by the name of PhantomLord caused a humongous stir,
4264000	4272000	wound up apparently making the record for the most-watched livestream on Twitch at any single time.
4272000	4289000	The numbers were up over 140,000 consecutive people, something along these lines, and basically what it boils down to is that he's a League of Legends player, League of Legends, Dota, invariably various other games that was touched on in the incident,
4289000	4300000	but basically what happened, and this is his livelihood, this is how he makes money, so livestream, ads, monetization, Twitch subscriptions, he was doing what he normally does and starts playing Dota.
4300000	4320000	When I first read this article, basically the gist of what happened was that, whether by monetization or some other reason, he started becoming the target of an attack by DDoS griefers, essentially, apparently this is being attributed largely to a collective known as Derp.
4320000	4343000	And the way that I heard the story when this happened last week is that PhantomLord was going about his routine, playing Dota, playing League of Legends, playing Dota, playing whatever else he wanted to, and this collective, indeterminate number of people was watching what he was playing, watching what he was streaming, and would target that game, that network, bring it down.
4344000	4367000	So much so that it happened with a game, so it'll happen to the big individuals, League of Legends, Dota 2 again, but also affect smaller, something I'd never even heard of before, Disney, for crying out loud, Disney's Club Penguin, that's what it was, I knew I had to bring it up, I've never heard of this before.
4367000	4372000	I only know because they sell the little shit things in the Disney stores.
4372000	4373000	They are shit.
4373000	4374000	And I love penguins.
4374000	4378000	It's just like a little social network, like Second Lifestyles social network.
4378000	4380000	It's a Facebook game for kids. It's Disney.
4381000	4383000	But that was brought down too.
4383000	4405000	So the culmination of this result was that PhantomLord's stream went, he changed it to a static image instead of webcam based, and basically just disappeared for, until the stream wound up being taken down, and the claim was that a police raid happened on his house.
4406000	4433000	He was the target of a police raid, as a hoax, meaning that individuals called the local police for him, his address got leaked out on the internet, and then people phoned in a hostage situation to police, and then, you know, damn near SWAT team, but just the serious guns of police came to his house, put him in handcuffs, they stopped short of arresting him because there was nothing going on,
4433000	4447000	but the claim was that his house was searched, he was in handcuffs, placed in the back of a squad car, you know, being interviewed by individuals, rifles, guns drawn, pointed at him, you know, the works.
4448000	4466000	That was a couple days ago, and I watched, he, PhantomLord posted an hour long explanation of the day's events, apparently there's been like 30, 40 pizzas that have showed up at his house, and you know, the normal nonsense that happens whenever a high value target appears.
4466000	4491000	Which, by the way, this whole act of swatting or whatever is illegal in California now, and it was a huge thing because people were doing it to like Tom Cruise and Miley Cyrus and all the Hollywood people, right, so I don't know where this particular individual is, but if that had been in California, where the guy lives, that would have been illegal to call, or actually, if the, if the phone-er was in California, that person could go to jail for that, I mean, that's, that's how serious it is, and it needs to be.
4491000	4520000	Let's, I mean, let's be real, that, just, people should not fuck around with things like that, like it's, it's one thing to take down an online service, which I also don't agree with, because you're ruining the fun for everybody else, or what have you, you know, if you have a squabble, you work it out intellectually, or whatever, you have a discussion, a debate, you know, you don't, this is just going to bad places, but calling the cops on somebody is, that's especially, that could like screw somebody's life up, you know?
4520000	4522000	That's not okay.
4522000	4535000	Especially, too, you know, like, there's this picture that's just posted in chat, I mean, there's some scared-looking people there on top of that, too, you're also decreasing manpower from legitimate crimes going on.
4535000	4546000	Yes, yes, that's, that's, that's one of the awful things, too, so, I mean, the punishment needs to be swift and severe for this type of fuckery, so, anyway.
4547000	4565000	Just to expand, the colloquial term, if somebody was swatted, or swatting someone, means that you phone in a hoax to the police, and get a swat-level response enacted on an individual, an individual home address, just an individual's, that you know their location, their whereabouts.
4566000	4589000	I, so, I watched the video an hour long, I read this article, it turned, as it turns out, this, this was likely not a blatant, like, I don't, I don't think that this whole attack was fabricated just for money, but it wound up working out in Phantom Lord's favor, because, as reported by various outlets,
4590000	4605000	Phantom Lord agreed, he was having a private conversation with the individual or individuals that are the collective derp, and he said that, if my team starts losing, you can start taking down, you can take down the server so that we don't get a registered loss.
4605000	4613000	They start, they start out the, they start out the round, the Phantom Lord's team is doing okay, they start losing, the attack begins.
4614000	4630000	My understanding, my assumption is that derp just said, oh, we can take him down, let's continue to do that, you know, raising the ante, so not only do they take down the one game he's playing, but they continue to do so across multiple networks.
4630000	4643000	The controversy that's happening is that Phantom Lord, because of the influx of users, he enabled subscriber-only mode in chat, which means if you are going to chat with him on Twitch, you have to pay $5 to do it.
4643000	4650000	And he raked in six figures, and, like, another five figures of monetization on YouTube with ads.
4650000	4653000	So the whole thing could have just been an elaborate hoax to make fleece money?
4653000	4659000	I don't think it was a pre-precept- what's the right word here?
4659000	4660000	Premeditated?
4660000	4674000	I do not believe it was premeditated, and I, there's a lot of fault to go around, people are even blaming Twitch for not taking down a stream as soon as the influx was just affecting five or six networks outright.
4675000	4688000	It does bring up an interesting point, at what point does Twitch need to be like, this stream is not about gaming at this point, and pull the plug, because in some regards, I think that is an element to blame.
4688000	4698000	The argument is that how could Twitch possibly watch as much live content as on their network, but they can certainly pay attention to the most important, because that's where this scale of attack tends to happen.
4698000	4703000	If this is the largest stream that's ever happened on Twitch, somebody saw it.
4703000	4711000	Yes. And apparently he also broke rules that he continued to show ads on the entirety of the stream, even to subscribers that aren't supposed to get it.
4711000	4715000	So there are a number of legalities that are happening here as well.
4715000	4728000	But it was- swatting is not a new thing, it's not a gaming thing, I've heard it happen to pundits and other prominent tech individuals at least a year or so now is when I first kind of heard of it.
4729000	4732000	But it's not a fucking joke either, and that's something to emphasize.
4732000	4734000	When police come to your house, it's never a joke.
4734000	4748000	Well no, and I'm talking like the person, the coward making the call, it's not a fucking joke for them to be doing it either, because just like Jamie said a minute ago, you're taking them away from real issues, and the person making that call is going to get in a lot of trouble.
4748000	4752000	Because, you know, if I were the guy, I'd sue him.
4752000	4755000	But, you know.
4755000	4757000	America!
4757000	4763000	It's the internet equivalent of a bomb threat, and we've all been high school and have dealt with those numerous times for sure.
4763000	4765000	But it's not a joke.
4765000	4767000	Yeah, it is not, by all means.
4767000	4772000	There's the I'm older than you, because for me it was pulling the fire alarm. Somebody would always pull the fire alarm.
4772000	4780000	Oh, we had those too. My high school, the first week of school, what's the short version of the story?
4780000	4785000	There was a bomb threat at one o'clock in the afternoon, we didn't leave the school grounds until five.
4785000	4792000	You know what they started doing though is that they built paint sprayers into those things so that when you pulled the thing it would spray you with paint and they would know who pulled it.
4792000	4798000	Like die exploding money bags that are persistent for a fair amount of time to find the culprit.
4798000	4800000	Yep.
4800000	4802000	Alright. Well.
4802000	4804000	Fun.
4804000	4808000	I know, right? Let's shift the topic a little bit and talk about some upcoming games.
4808000	4811000	I am so excited about Cuphead.
4811000	4828000	Oh my god, this is great. Cuphead is a run and gun video game that's being done by Studio MDHR that is, it's sort of set like a one on one fighting game, but with different levels as you progress through it.
4828000	4839000	And there's definitely some kind of a, well I guess it is a run and gun element, but it made me think a lot of Mega Man 2 with just how the main character is going.
4839000	4845000	The big thing about this though is the aesthetics to the game. It's based off of the old 1930's cartoons.
4845000	4858000	So it even seems to have this degree of older film grain on it. And the characters look like they are straight out of early Disney and early Mary Melodies.
4858000	4861000	You know, free World War 2 era cartoons.
4861000	4866000	One of the movies in the Bioshock Infinite viewer things that you can look at.
4866000	4878000	But I mean, even the Captain Silver thing sort of makes me think of the early Betty Boop and Popeye that I used to watch.
4878000	4888000	But it's really neat and I hope that the music in the trailers is some of the music that's definitely in the game because I really like just the overall feel that it gives.
4888000	4894000	I'm super excited by this. I'm probably more excited about this than just about anything coming out.
4894000	4900000	Also, the other character if you play in co-op is called Mugman. So you have Cuphead and Mugman.
4900000	4911000	It's so adorable. It's super adorbs. And it's supposed to be out on PC first, then Mac and Linux, and then consoles.
4911000	4914000	I want this game.
4914000	4919000	Yeah, it looks really cool. I want to check this out too. I just love the visual aesthetic behind it. What a great idea for a game.
4919000	4925000	It's so cute. I just want a shirt with Cupman on it. Or I want like a cup hat.
4925000	4932000	Locopoco in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Skullgirls had a character named Peacock that had the same aesthetic.
4932000	4943000	Peacock is kind of creepy looking. And honestly, I think a lot of Skullgirls, I would want to put more in the 40s and up sort of that noir period.
4943000	4956000	Because the music is some of that same type of jazz big band style. And definitely the scenery harkens back to some of the film noir.
4956000	4962000	I don't know that it's related to Skullgirls. The styles are completely different.
4962000	4967000	Alright, well let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some games that are coming out very soon.
4967000	4972000	Although I have a feeling this week is pretty dry, but we'll check in anyway with Loki with the US.
4973000	4980000	Well, if you don't own a Wii Fit balance board, now you can.
4980000	4990000	As part of the Wii Fit U disc versions that are coming out, they have one that's just the disc game and the balance board.
4990000	4997000	And one that is, I believe, just the game and the pedometer.
4998000	5001000	Well, the one with the balance board of course has the pedometer in it as well.
5001000	5006000	So if you don't want to download it digitally, you can pick it up this way.
5007000	5013000	And technically not a game, but some more Disney Infinity figures are coming out this week.
5013000	5017000	Wreck-It Ralph, Vanellope, and Rapunzel.
5017000	5020000	Well, those are all good characters. That's cool.
5020000	5022000	Wreck-It Ralph doesn't have their own stage or anything though, right?
5022000	5028000	No, they've kind of gotten lazy with some of these. They don't have any more playsets coming out.
5028000	5031000	So all they have is just these toy box characters.
5031000	5035000	And even they're going to have these toy box sets coming out later on.
5035000	5044000	But it's basically just the two characters and then a background and a skin for the toy box mode.
5044000	5046000	It's kind of, I don't know.
5046000	5048000	Alright, fair enough.
5048000	5050000	Alright, well is that it for the US?
5050000	5051000	That's it.
5051000	5055000	We're heading to Japan where there is one game out this week.
5055000	5058000	We don't really get back into a regular release schedule until next week.
5058000	5062000	But there is one game out this week on January 11th.
5062000	5064000	And if you're act-deaf, you'll care about this game.
5064000	5071000	Because on the Nintendo 3DS, Hoshi no Kirby Triple Deluxe comes out this week in Japan.
5071000	5073000	Yes, that is the Kirby 3DS game.
5073000	5075000	Makes its way to Japan this week.
5075000	5077000	That's the only release on the 11th.
5077000	5081000	So it's a bummer the 3DS isn't region free or act-deaf could import that.
5081000	5083000	But you'll just have to wait.
5083000	5085000	Unless you happen to have a Japanese 3DS.
5085000	5087000	Then check that out.
5087000	5088000	Time to import.
5088000	5089000	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5089000	5091000	Only one game on the 9th.
5091000	5094000	And that's Metal Gear Solid Rising for PC.
5094000	5096000	So, no.
5096000	5097000	Alright.
5097000	5099000	Alright, just a few more stories before you guys.
5099000	5102000	Before we get to the classic game of the week.
5102000	5103000	Loki.
5103000	5106000	So Fallout, and this is kind of ironic.
5106000	5113000	Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics have been removed from good old games or GOG.com.
5113000	5124000	This is basically in regards to the expiration of Interplay's franchise rights as of the 1st of this year.
5124000	5130000	And because of this, now I believe Bethesda is going to be the new owner of that.
5131000	5137000	I actually have this from GOG because they were giving it away.
5137000	5140000	I was going to say it was a giveaway at one point, wasn't it?
5140000	5142000	Yeah, it was free.
5142000	5144000	Now we know why they gave it away.
5144000	5146000	They knew it was coming.
5146000	5148000	So they gave it away.
5148000	5155000	And this of course is also going to lead into Bethesda trying to get these games onto Steam.
5155000	5158000	Which I'm sure they're going to be able to do that.
5159000	5164000	Not sure when though, but they're going to probably have it up at some point.
5166000	5169000	So the games are going to end up on Steam?
5169000	5171000	I think so, yeah.
5171000	5172000	They basically said no.
5172000	5178000	They'll have a look at other options once they've taken care of the Steam portion.
5178000	5181000	But they may have it on other services as well.
5181000	5185000	Well, especially if the rumors are true that we're getting a new Fallout this year.
5185000	5188000	And that's going to be a big E3 reveal from Bethesda.
5188000	5189000	There's a new Fallout game.
5189000	5191000	It was in Listless, it must be true.
5191000	5195000	Well, I just think logically Elder Scrolls was the last game.
5195000	5199000	So the Fallout will go back to that series unless they're going to do something new.
5199000	5202000	Not to mention they finally own it and have full control of it.
5202000	5204000	Yeah, that's true.
5204000	5209000	So it would make sense to have the old games out there available for people to catch up.
5209000	5214000	Well, one thing you won't be able to catch up on are some other games that got removed from Steam.
5214000	5219000	Usually we wouldn't talk about every game that gets delisted from a service.
5219000	5221000	But A, it's a slow news week.
5221000	5225000	B, the caliber of what we're talking about here is pretty big.
5225000	5231000	Activision actually removed some Marvel licensed games from various digital storefronts.
5231000	5233000	Obviously Steam being the most notable.
5233000	5236000	Including Deadpool, which has only been out for six months.
5236000	5243000	But it has now been delisted from Steam, which is interesting because it came just a day or two after the game had been on sale as part of the holiday sale.
5243000	5244000	So that was very interesting.
5244000	5249000	Other games removed Spider-Man games, including Edge of Time, Shattered Dimensions, Friend or Foe.
5249000	5255000	X-Men games, Destiny, Origins, Wolverine, and the official game.
5255000	5264000	Apparently don't know the real reason why these games were delisted from Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.
5264000	5268000	But the Amazing Spider-Man still there on all the storefronts.
5268000	5272000	And Activision still has the rights to do the Amazing Spider-Man 2.
5272000	5278000	No reason was given by community manager Dan Amrich, who actually confirmed the removal of the games.
5278000	5279000	Didn't talk about why.
5279000	5284000	Some people are thinking it has to do with the whole Disney-Marvel deal going on there.
5284000	5287000	That something's going to happen there.
5287000	5291000	The expiration of the licensing agreement between the two companies.
5291000	5294000	Being cited is probably what happened.
5294000	5300000	Disney is going to move towards self-producing and publishing their own games for these franchises in the coming years.
5300000	5301000	I don't think that they are.
5301000	5306000	Actually, I think that at least it was with Star Wars that they were only going to franchise this stuff.
5306000	5309000	I don't think that they're developing anything in-house.
5311000	5313000	I'm trying to remember back to those stories.
5313000	5317000	I seem to think that, well, think of it this way too.
5317000	5319000	They're probably going to sell it to a lower bidder.
5319000	5320000	You know what I mean?
5321000	5322000	Or a higher bidder?
5322000	5324000	Yeah, sorry, a higher bidder.
5324000	5326000	They're going to make the most money possible is what I'm saying.
5326000	5327000	Well, yeah.
5327000	5328000	That wasn't with Activision.
5328000	5333000	Maybe a studio that Disney maybe has a stake in would be a better thought.
5333000	5341000	Or maybe it's kind of for the better because a lot of these games at Activision, especially their licensed games, are kind of shit.
5341000	5348000	So it's probably a good thing that they kind of try to wipe these out of the digital marketplaces as best they can.
5349000	5352000	Get some fresher games in there that might not be so terrible.
5355000	5360000	Alright, let's see what comes.
5360000	5363000	This E3 is going to be a big one to see what types of announcements.
5363000	5372000	Because if there's a new Star Wars game coming, we'll see it by 2015 because you're going to have the movie coming out and they've got to get it out by then.
5372000	5377000	Anyway, let's travel back in time to a time when games were a little more simple.
5379000	5381000	It's the classic game of the week.
5381000	5383000	Back when Star Wars were vector games.
5383000	5384000	Take it or leave it.
5384000	5385000	You took it.
5385000	5388000	Back when you had regular panty shots in video games.
5389000	5390000	What?
5390000	5391000	That's what this game is all about.
5391000	5393000	Oh, that's what I'm like.
5393000	5395000	Dark Sakura, you're going a little crazy today.
5395000	5398000	Alright, it is the classic game of the week.
5398000	5402000	Dark Sakura, what is this week's classic game of the week, which apparently involves panty shots?
5402000	5403000	Wonder Momo.
5404000	5411000	So, again, I'm going through my list of Namco games that have characters involved in Namco High.
5411000	5415000	Amazonia from this is included in Namco High.
5415000	5420000	So, this game only came out in Japan.
5420000	5422000	I have actually played it though.
5422000	5426000	It came out in 1987 and it was a beat-em-up arcade game.
5426000	5429000	It's supposed to be kind of the parody of the Ultraman type games.
5430000	5440000	Basically, you play as a girl named Momo who is, you know, instead of actually playing her as a superhero in the world,
5440000	5443000	she's on a stage like she's performing for people.
5443000	5447000	And she's at the Namco Theater.
5447000	5452000	And so she's an actress who's playing the role of Momo or Wonder Momo.
5452000	5455000	And it has a digitized voice in it.
5455000	5460000	And it's basically just a fun little, you know, beat-em-up.
5460000	5463000	It came out, like I said, in 1987.
5463000	5467000	It also came out on PC Engine in 1989.
5467000	5477000	And on the Wii Virtual Console, both the arcade version and the PC Engine version came out in 2007.
5477000	5479000	And 2009 was the arcade one.
5480000	5483000	So, going back though to the gameplay itself, she can only kick.
5483000	5489000	And then she builds up her Wonder Meter and then has a cyclone animation.
5489000	5495000	And then can attack with the Wonder Hoop, which she can use as long as she's Wonder Momo.
5498000	5503000	But when she throws the hoop, she has to wait for it to bounce back to her sort of Captain America-like.
5503000	5507000	And then she has, you know, energy beams and, you know, kind of the Ultraman thing.
5507000	5511000	And then she has an attack called the Wonder Typhoon that's a big energy wave.
5511000	5517000	It also has some fan service. When she jumps, you can see her underwear.
5517000	5523000	And she has to dodge a photographer in the audience who's trying to get a peek up her skirt.
5523000	5528000	And if he gets a peek up from her skirt, she's stunned. Or embarrassed.
5528000	5536000	So, and then, of course, one of the images that's on the curtain at the beginning of the game is Momo wearing a towel.
5537000	5544000	So, like I said, there have, there were other versions. There was a PC Engine version, which is actually the first version that I played.
5544000	5546000	And I have played an arcade version too.
5546000	5555000	It came out, the Virtual Console version came out on, sorry, the PC Engine version came out on Virtual Console in 2007.
5555000	5558000	And like I said, the arcade one followed in 2009.
5560000	5562000	And this...
5562000	5565000	What the? She just did like the splits or something. It was very awkward.
5565000	5566000	When she jumps, right?
5566000	5568000	What the hell is this game? No, she did something on the ground.
5568000	5569000	Oh yeah.
5569000	5570000	I think it was when she got hit.
5570000	5571000	That's her turning into Wonder Momo.
5571000	5573000	There we go.
5573000	5575000	It's a very strange game.
5575000	5583000	Well, it is a weird game. The other thing too is that there, she's had other appearances.
5583000	5588000	She was in Namco Cross Capcom, partnered with Bravo Man.
5589000	5592000	She was on a card in Batten Kaitos.
5593000	5596000	She was in Tales of the Abyss as a doll.
5597000	5600000	And thank you for posting the picture in chat.
5600000	5602000	The picture in chat is the PC Engine version.
5604000	5614000	She is on a float in Marvel Land and her Wonder costume is in Tales of the World Radiant Mythology 2 and in the Idolmaster.
5615000	5626000	There's actually an album done by a J-Pop singer named Haruko Momoi who did a Wonder Momo new recording basically based off of Wonder Momo.
5626000	5630000	There's also a gachapon figure of Momo that you can find for the Namco Girls collection.
5630000	5634000	And her final appearance, if you're not counting...
5634000	5641000	Well, I mean, of the character Wonder Momo herself is in Queensgate Spiral Chaos.
5641000	5646000	However, another character, like I said, is in...
5649000	5652000	Her rival is in Namco High, which is Amazonia.
5656000	5659000	Alright, there it is. I'm just entranced by watching this gameplay.
5659000	5662000	She just kicked a velociraptor in the face in the video.
5662000	5684000	The other thing too is that more of this actually went into sort of a bit of a post-Namco apocrypha from Shifty Look who does an online webship called Wonder Momo Battle Idol that brings back basically Momoko who gets the Wonder Momo power and that's where Amazonia came from.
5684000	5690000	It is so weird to see this 80s, 90s anime manga style just because...
5690000	5701000	Like, I don't watch too terribly much, but all the old classic series that everybody knows from TV that actually made it to America or showed up in video stores.
5701000	5707000	And then just the change of what it's been ever since 2008 forward.
5708000	5716000	Playing these old games, it hits you real hard. It's a very definitive style and seeing it again is always fun.
5716000	5723000	You know, I still have to go in and play some of those really quirky games from the late 80s or the mid to late 80s.
5723000	5731000	Like, God, I just had it in my head. Psycho Soldier, which I've done as a classic game before.
5731000	5738000	I don't think it's an anime, but Blue's Journey seems to make me think of similar art styles but more like bumpy 3D special stuff.
5738000	5746000	Well, it was just that whole level of 80s anime style where it was really into the big eyes and that whole aesthetic.
5746000	5755000	I mean, look at Ranma, Inuyasha follows the same aesthetic. Dirty Pear, old Dirty Pear. I love Dirty Pear.
5755000	5763000	Old Bubblegum Crisis. Dominion Tank Police. That was more 90s, wasn't it?
5763000	5771000	Interstellar. Finding Crossover. That was Matsumoto Studio.
5771000	5775000	What was the old one that sci-fi- Oh, Lotus War. Record of Lotus War.
5775000	5779000	Record of Lotus War. Do you know that actually started based off of a tabletop game?
5779000	5780000	Did not.
5780000	5783000	Which I would love to find the original game.
5783000	5791000	Alright, so I believe that's it. Your classic game of the week. The very strange but somewhat charming.
5791000	5793000	It's a fun little game.
5793000	5799000	Wonder Momo. She needs to buy a Wonder Moomoo with all those photographers trying to-
5799000	5807000	I just think it's fun having the sort of limited stage, literally the stage, and then having to interact with the audience watching you.
5807000	5809000	Even if it's the crappy photographer.
5809000	5811000	Alright, I'm gonna close that up.
5811000	5813000	A funky little game.
5813000	5828000	Alright. Alright, well, when we come back, there is plenty more Orange Launch Radio, including the FUGO Question of the Week, rapid fire news, and your emails, FUs of the Week, Twitter topics, your calls, hopefully tonight.
5828000	5834000	We didn't get a lot of calls last week, but we're thinking now that people are getting back from their holiday breaks and so forth, we might hear from more of you tonight.
5834000	5838000	So be ready for that at Orange Launch Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5838000	5843000	But first, we're gonna take a quick break. We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
5851000	5854000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5854000	5864000	We are live, of course, with episode 534 already in progress for this January 5th, 2014, the second half of our episode.
5864000	5869000	If you missed the first half, well, the good news is, on the podcast, you can just hit rewind and listen all over again.
5869000	5873000	But if you're live, you'll have to check that out on the feed a little later this week.
5873000	5878000	We still have some fun stuff coming up, including your calls, the FUGO Question of the Week, and mailbag and all that stuff.
5878000	5881000	But first, some rapid fire news.
5882000	5884000	Loki, joining us via Skype. You there?
5884000	5885000	Yes, I am here.
5885000	5886000	All right, take it away.
5886000	5893000	All right, so let's talk real quickly about a game that I don't think they've really talked about in a while.
5893000	5903000	So it's like E3, maybe 2012? The Devil's Third, which was a game that was gonna be put out by Itagaki.
5903000	5916000	And it's in progress still. Originally it was gonna be published by THQ. Now that's changed, of course, and still on its way.
5916000	5921000	I guess it's gonna be coming out this year. So that's pretty cool.
5921000	5927000	Not sure what type of game it is, but probably good breast physics will be involved in there somehow.
5927000	5929000	All righty then.
5929000	5930000	Without a doubt.
5930000	5931000	Huh?
5931000	5932000	Without a doubt.
5932000	5935000	Yes. It is a trademark.
5937000	5944000	Next, there is a brand new game coming out on Xbox Live Indie Games from Ska Studios.
5944000	5952000	You may remember them from such games as I Made a Game with Zombies in It.
5952000	5959000	And this is kind of a follow-up. It's called Time Viking and Space Raptor.
5959000	5962000	And it's ridiculous, much like I Made a Game with Zombies in It.
5962000	5964000	That sounds great.
5964000	5972000	Yeah, and it has an awesome song, which obviously I can't play, but it's pretty sweet. So check it out.
5972000	5978000	And actually it's only 80 Microsoft, oh I'm sorry, not Microsoft points, $1.
5978000	5980000	So can't beat that price.
5980000	5988000	And last but not least, I'm not sure if this is just to get more people to try it out or to get those people that are like,
5988000	5992000	Hey, you know what? I really do like Jago.
5992000	6000000	Now the free character instead of being Jago is gonna be Saberwolf in Killer Instinct for the Xbox One.
6000000	6006000	If you would like to play as Jago now, you have to pay $5 to unlock him.
6007000	6011000	So I guess it's cool that they're kind of rotating that stuff around.
6011000	6016000	But at the same time I kind of feel that this is maybe a way to get those people that weren't paying money
6016000	6021000	because their favorite character happens to be one particular character that they're offering for free,
6021000	6025000	now to try to get them to pony up $5 for it or to buy the full game.
6025000	6030000	Well, to be fair, a game like League of Legends rotates through various characters too.
6030000	6035000	So, I mean, it wouldn't be out of character for a game to offer a handful of their characters for free.
6035000	6037000	If that makes any sense.
6037000	6039000	I guess it does.
6039000	6044000	It's an interesting consideration for people that may have had a slightly late start to get into that game.
6044000	6048000	They're just getting used to Jago and now they literally have to relearn the game.
6048000	6053000	They literally have to relearn a character and if they don't pay, they have no other choice.
6053000	6056000	LocoPoco in chat says Spinal gets released this month also.
6056000	6061000	It's kind of weird to me how they trickle out the fighters in these games now.
6061000	6064000	And I realize it's not like Killer Instinct is the first to do it.
6064000	6066000	Even Mortal Kombat had their DLC characters.
6066000	6071000	But at least in Mortal Kombat, you had like 30 characters in the game already.
6071000	6073000	Whereas Killer Instinct didn't really have a lot.
6073000	6075000	It's weird to me the way this game works.
6075000	6076000	It's super fresh, I guess.
6076000	6080000	But, you know what, I haven't really played it myself.
6080000	6084000	I know a lot of people I talk to and follow on Twitter seem really into it.
6084000	6086000	Some people have said it sold the system for them.
6086000	6089000	So I can't hate. It's just weird.
6089000	6092000	So now is Spinal included with the full game price?
6092000	6096000	Or is that something that they're making you buy in addition to the game?
6096000	6100000	My assumption is it's part of the Season 1 subscription or whatever.
6100000	6101000	Season 1?
6101000	6102000	Yeah, right.
6102000	6103000	Oh boy.
6106000	6109000	Alright, well let's move on with some more news.
6109000	6111000	Some of the rapid fire news here.
6111000	6116000	Now, if you heard Bobby's show tonight, he talked a lot about the Oculus Rift.
6116000	6118000	And there's this Tumblr post.
6118000	6121000	You know it's a slow news week when we're getting news off Tumblr.
6121000	6125000	But there's this Tumblr post going around, which is really based off of YouTube, I think.
6125000	6128000	Where somebody is playing Metroid Prime.
6128000	6130000	Apparently they got working with the Oculus Rift.
6130000	6136000	Now, I seem to recall when I played Oculus Rift at Dragon Con.
6136000	6141000	Bobby had a copy of F-Zero GX, the GameCube version running on Oculus Prime.
6141000	6142000	Which was a lot of fun to play.
6142000	6145000	So this isn't too much different than that.
6145000	6154000	But that's still really cool that somebody is running a game that I think a lot of us would want to play on Oculus Rift.
6154000	6155000	Metroid Prime.
6155000	6156000	So that's very cool.
6156000	6158000	There's a video floating around out there.
6158000	6160000	Of course you can't really get the full experience.
6160000	6162000	You can just kind of see what you would see through both eyes.
6162000	6168000	But I will tell you this, having played the GameCube on Oculus Rift.
6168000	6171000	It's like the TV is right in front of your face.
6171000	6175000	Looking around is more like looking around that giant TV.
6175000	6179000	And so it creates a good sensation in racing games like F-Zero and so forth.
6179000	6182000	And I guess it would kind of be neat in Metroid Prime.
6182000	6188000	But when the game isn't natively built for an experience like Oculus Rift, it's really going to be losing a lot.
6188000	6197000	It still has some benefits because it still shifts your focus so that some other portion of the screen is primarily what you're looking at instead of just being peripheral.
6197000	6210000	But it's not going to be Team Fortress 2, A for the awesome, all this kind of stuff where you look to the left and you can see completely original landscape as far as you can actually turn your head.
6210000	6217000	So here's something really funny is that apparently, because I tweeted to Bobby that this is going to be on our show tonight.
6217000	6221000	Well apparently the guest on his show knew the guy that was on that Tumblr.
6221000	6224000	And so this is the funny way that Twitter works.
6224000	6234000	So he's just the guy that's in those Tumblr pictures here, Symatic Bruce, just tweeted at us and Bobby and Reverend Kyle who is on Bobby's show tonight,
6234000	6236000	Oh Lord, I've been Tumblr'd.
6236000	6237000	Tumblr'd.
6237000	6238000	Tumblr'd.
6238000	6244000	You know what, if you want to get very meta Dark Soccer, you should screen cap that and Tumblr it again.
6244000	6246000	Blink me.
6246000	6249000	I'll do it. I'll do this shit.
6249000	6250000	I'll have to do it when I get home.
6250000	6251000	Tumblr-ception.
6251000	6252000	Bong.
6252000	6256000	Alright, are you in chat? Where are you? Why can't I see you in chat?
6256000	6257000	I'm in chat.
6257000	6258000	Optio.
6258000	6260000	Oh, you're not an op. You're not an op for some reason.
6260000	6261000	Really? Weird.
6261000	6262000	I don't know. Alright.
6262000	6265000	Anyway, all that aside, let's move on with some other rapid-fire news.
6265000	6267000	ToeJam and Earl 3.
6267000	6269000	I seem to remember talking about this before.
6269000	6271000	ToeJam and Earl 3, it didn't finish.
6271000	6273000	It was supposed to be on the beta, but it didn't finish.
6273000	6281000	But I think what happened here is that somebody actually got this on eBay and was able to get this available now for public download.
6281000	6286000	So it is emulation, technically piracy, but the game never came out, so you know what?
6286000	6287000	It's there.
6287000	6297000	They did do a version on Xbox, but ToeJam and Earl 3 was originally supposed to be a Dreamcast game, and this game never got finished for it.
6297000	6303000	So I guess you see relics of the Xbox version in this, but obviously this is kind of a unique experience here.
6303000	6310000	So yeah, getting a Dreamcast development kit from eBay, the kit actually had a playable beta of ToeJam and Earl 3 on it.
6310000	6313000	So the guy did the right thing and put it on the internet for all of us to play.
6313000	6322000	The article you're thinking of is that he was considering some kind of a fundraiser to either continue development or just to what extent it was going to be released.
6322000	6332000	Probably for the better that it looks like it was just straight up released and made essentially public domain, even though it takes a very specialized system to be able to actually play it.
6332000	6333000	There you go.
6333000	6339000	And then also rapid fire news tonight, and again, it's a slow news week, because I'm just going to keep it real here.
6339000	6343000	What the fuck kind of news is this? But it's going around the internet.
6343000	6350000	So I admittedly say, what I'm about to report on is really stupid, but since it's what people are talking about, I'm going to bring it to the table.
6350000	6356000	There's a rumor going around that an unannounced third-party game is apparently being developed for Wii U.
6356000	6364000	The project will launch in 2014 exclusively on the Wii U, and this is coming from a French gaming website called Gameblog.
6364000	6368000	And it's supposed to be similar to Bayonetta 2.
6368000	6379000	I don't think that means similar in play style, I think just a similar score in that same, not necessarily an A-list game, maybe like a B-list game like Bayonetta, is a score like that.
6379000	6383000	It isn't related to the Bayonetta franchise, however, making it crystal clear.
6383000	6386000	So I'm like, well, that's a wide fucking net.
6386000	6392000	There's going to be some type of third-party exclusive Wii U game.
6392000	6393000	It's not going to be a huge game.
6393000	6394000	Yeah.
6394000	6396000	Wow, man, I could come up with that kind of news.
6396000	6398000	I know, right, but whatever.
6398000	6400000	The next DDR will have an up arrow.
6400000	6405000	This is just for everybody to wank off to with their predictions and so forth.
6406000	6409000	See, there's some guy supporting the Wii U.
6409000	6411000	Exactly, exactly.
6411000	6420000	I would think, though, if I'm going to bring this wank to climax, so to speak, I would assume the third party is Sega.
6420000	6424000	Because Sega's been pretty good to Nintendo.
6424000	6429000	And I don't know, Sonic exclusive, that's already kind of happened.
6429000	6432000	I mean, for this to really be news, it would have to be a bombshell.
6432000	6436000	Could you imagine Shenmue 3 only on Wii U?
6436000	6438000	Could happen.
6438000	6440000	No.
6440000	6441000	Why not?
6441000	6443000	Why not? Because they won't make their money back.
6443000	6445000	That's exactly why.
6445000	6448000	It has to be something that Nintendo pays for, basically.
6448000	6450000	Why did Sega put this on at games?
6450000	6464000	And supposedly Wii U, again, this is wank, but there was that article out there on VG charts or whatever that the Wii U outsold the Xbox One in the last week or two leading up to Christmas.
6464000	6472000	And that in Japan, it made some recoveries in December, that the new bundles they put out over there actually really helped with sales of the Wii U.
6472000	6474000	Now, I'm not, obviously...
6474000	6479000	Well, fantastic that they outsold the Xbox One after having a whole year to sell systems.
6479000	6481000	Well, congratulations to them.
6481000	6489000	I'm not saying that Nintendo is suddenly like OMG, like just blew everybody's panties off and, you know, has made this full recovery.
6489000	6495000	But at the same token, I think to throw it in the trash is a little premature as well.
6495000	6505000	All I'm saying is they need all the help they can get because, honestly, as stuff goes along, we're going to see less and less games being multiplatform on the Wii U.
6505000	6510000	I mean, there's going to be a lot more games that are just PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
6510000	6516000	And even though the Wii U looks like it should be capable of running that stuff, it just isn't.
6516000	6521000	Alright, well we shall see what happens next. Anyway, in the meantime, Dark Sakura.
6521000	6525000	Uh, some stuff that may or may not be wank.
6525000	6531000	So, if, gosh, stupid iPad. I'm going to throw this thing in the toilet.
6531000	6534000	Next to Loki's Wii U?
6534000	6536000	Yeah, next to Loki's Wii U.
6536000	6538000	I don't have a Wii U.
6538000	6540000	That's because it's in the toilet.
6541000	6551000	So, um, there was, uh, it had been mentioned before that a developer of an arcade game, it was called Tobii Technologies.
6551000	6555000	They had a game that could be controlled by eye tracking.
6555000	6563000	And now they are bringing out eye tracking hardware that's going to let you use your eye movements to control other games.
6563000	6567000	They're already working with Amnesia, The Dark Descent, Skyrim, and StarCraft.
6567000	6570000	And there is video online that you can check out.
6571000	6584000	In other news, there is a new character joining the Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed for iOS and Android.
6584000	6587000	Um, that is going to be, um, Ryo Hazuki.
6587000	6593000	And, uh, he is going to be, uh, apparently, um, in a bulldozer.
6593000	6598000	No, it's a car. Um, a boat and a plane for all of them.
6598000	6606000	And it looks like his, uh, his, uh, stuff is actually looks like old Sega machines.
6606000	6610000	So, one of them looks like an afterburner. There's an outrun car. That's kind of neat.
6610000	6614000	Um, and then, last but not least, um, there is...
6614000	6616000	That's a space area on it.
6616000	6620000	Oh, space area. I couldn't see it very well on my, on my iPad. Sorry.
6620000	6627000	Um, Free Comic Book Day is coming up on Saturday, March 3rd, which we all, all of us comic book fans love it.
6627000	6634000	There will be a special Archie, um, comic that's going to be a Mega Man X edition.
6634000	6636000	And it looks really nice.
6636000	6642000	And it's, uh, being done, uh, let's see. It's a flip comic.
6642000	6646000	So, take advantage of Free Comic Day. Get your Mega Man on.
6646000	6648000	That's it.
6648000	6650000	Sounds good.
6650000	6652000	Uh, when is Free Comic Book Day?
6652000	6654000	March 3rd. I mean, May 3rd.
6654000	6656000	I was like, yeah, I thought it was a little later than that. Alright.
6656000	6662000	Yeah, and, and, and then you get the Free Comic Book Day, um, uh, bags.
6663000	6668000	Um, for like the rest of the year. Advertising the one that's already passed. Whenever you go get your comics.
6668000	6671000	Awesome. Alright, uh, let's go to the FUGL question.
6671000	6674000	It was May. I screwed up. Thank you, chat room. Whatever.
6674000	6676000	Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.
6683000	6688000	Take Facebook and Google Plus and slam those words together. You get FUGL...
6688000	6690000	No, we call it FUGL.
6691000	6696000	Yes, you do. We call it FUGL just because it has a ring to it. I don't know.
6696000	6703000	Uh, the FUGL question of the week where we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we read some of our favorite answers here live on the show.
6703000	6707000	Maybe all of them tonight. We had 11 answers on Facebook. I could probably read all those.
6707000	6711000	Alright. Uh, ooh, some of them are long. Maybe not. Spoke too soon.
6711000	6716000	Alright, uh, here it is. Tonight is a building off a game we talked about earlier.
6716000	6726000	Uh, Dark Sakura talked about the, uh, Cuphead game, which was, um, the game... I keep wanting to say fighting game, but it's not. It's like a...
6726000	6733000	It actually has fighting game elements in it and they're one versus one fights, but it's a running game.
6733000	6739000	Okay. Well, I called it a fighting game because I thought that's what it kind of looked like, but I thought, alright, well, it led into this question of the week.
6739000	6740000	If you were to design...
6740000	6741000	It's a fighting gun.
6741000	6746000	Okay. If you were to design your own fighting game, what would inspire you?
6746000	6751000	And I imagine most people were thinking of Street Fighter S type of game. We'll see what we get into with some of the answers here.
6751000	6756000	So what would inspire you? Just like the 30s cartoons inspired this game, what's your inspiration for a fighting game?
6756000	6765000	Uh, Fifth Dream replied and said, I only want to make a fighting game if I could get Tim Burton or Edward Gorey to hand draw the whole thing in black and white.
6765000	6766000	Anybody have a time machine?
6767000	6775000	Uh, Jove Dea says something wacky like the concept of Clay Fighter 63 and a third, which I always loved that title by the way,
6775000	6784000	but with the gross or non-PC cartoon or gaming character like Ren and Stimpy, Conker, Chowder, Jake the Dog, Bender, The Tick, and so on.
6784000	6789000	Uh, Codeman says, I think what would inspire me more are the crazies at Walmart.
6791000	6792000	People of Walmart in the game.
6792000	6794000	You like Walmart in the fighter? Oh.
6794000	6800000	It would have a dive kick type feel and clothing customization. You would have the tackiest clothing options possible.
6800000	6805000	One of the characters have a special attack where they send a horde of kids to scream and beat up the other fighter.
6805000	6807000	I really haven't thought about this at all though.
6807000	6815000	I think one of the super attacks should be called a CPC so that, you know, Child Protective Services will show up.
6815000	6818000	Call one of them Black Friday on Christmas Eve.
6819000	6824000	Ed B says, I want another Power Stone with four player combat local and online. That's a good-
6824000	6825000	I am behind that 100%.
6825000	6826000	Co-signed.
6826000	6834000	Ragenator says, I designed a game that's over the top, absurd, that's equal parts Beavis and Butthead, Ace Ventura or The Mask, and Animaniacs.
6834000	6837000	Not those characters per se, but the feel of them, their style of humor.
6837000	6838000	Uh, Locopoco-
6838000	6839000	Still a slapstick game.
6839000	6840000	Yeah.
6840000	6850000	Locopoco replied and said that my dream would be to make a fighter with the same three versus three mechanics of Marvel versus Capcom 2, but all the fighters are drag queens.
6850000	6855000	Tagline would be serving up fierceness to some other hoe's face. Bam.
6855000	6862000	You know, that's almost my dream game too, would be a RuPaul's Drag Race game where they actually throw shade.
6862000	6865000	Just saying. That's their special attack, they throw shade.
6866000	6871000	Andy R. replies and says, I'd love to see PlayStation All-Stars 2.
6871000	6880000	Uh, the game was really fun for me, having been a long time PlayStation fan, but I felt like most people either wrote it off for being too similar to Smash Brothers or being too different than Smash Brothers.
6880000	6887000	Uh, Elliot B. says, I'd be inspired by my own lack of ability and make a fighting game with a very accessible tutorial mode.
6887000	6893000	Despite enjoying Street Fighter Tekken and so forth, I'm absolutely hopeless at pulling off anything beyond a Hadouken.
6893000	6912000	Wasn't Killer Instinct's tutorial, like, it was expansive, but it was still detailed to the point that if you don't understand fighting game mechanics between the frame counting and the combo learning and the hitboxing and everything else, it was my understanding that Killer Instinct is like one of the best intros in this kind of thing you can have.
6912000	6917000	I think one of the DOA games had stress relief mode in it too.
6917000	6919000	I've actually played none of the other games.
6919000	6920000	Where it was super easy.
6920000	6922000	All right, Tech 2030.
6922000	6928000	Pokemon would be a great inspiration for a fighting game. Huge roster of monsters to choose from with all elemental specialties.
6928000	6932000	Leveling up, move sets, and evolution would play a big factor.
6932000	6936000	An arcade mode with all your challengers as gym leaders with their own specific monster specialty.
6936000	6940000	I think a lot of the systems in Pokemon have the potential to cross over to the fighting genre.
6940000	6946000	Uh, Degenerate Johnny says, my type of fighting game would be a Mortal Kombat-like game featuring Dr. Seuss characters.
6947000	6951000	The reason for the Mortal Kombat system is because Dr. Seuss characters have great finishing maneuvers.
6951000	6957000	Imagine Sam-I-Am's finisher being him force feeding his opponent green eggs and ham that will cause him or her to explode.
6957000	6960000	Or the cat's hat devouring his opponent's hole.
6962000	6963000	Okay.
6963000	6966000	SS 2100 Matt says, picture this.
6966000	6974000	Fantasy characters from classic literature and fables, Alice vs. Big Bad Wolf, done in the art style of American McGee and developed by NetherRealm Studios.
6974000	6978000	Not really an original idea, but getting those two together would only lead to greatness.
6978000	6983000	So, taking it to some dark places with those last couple Facebook answers there.
6983000	6986000	Let's uh, let's see how dark things got over at Google+.
6986000	6996000	Uh, we had ActDeft reply and said, um, my ideas either exist already, like fighting is magic, or in their development, Pokemon fighting game teased in video or Pokemon rumble.
6996000	7000000	So I'm gonna go the easy route and say, Capcom vs. SNK 3, dammit!
7000000	7002000	And SVC chaos doesn't count.
7003000	7005000	That is a fair answer.
7005000	7015000	Uh, Redertainment, lastly, here over at Google+, says, I remember playing a game on the Genesis as a kid that had a single player experience, but when it came time for battles, did so like in a fighting game.
7015000	7020000	I haven't been to remember what game it was or happened to come across it anywhere, but I think I would make a fighting game like that.
7020000	7024000	Either that or use my project as an excuse to bitch slap politicians.
7024000	7027000	So, didn't they make a fighting game out of politicians? I see it was kind of controversial.
7027000	7028000	I'm sure.
7028000	7029000	I'm sure they did.
7029000	7035000	But, uh, any idea what he's talking about there? Genesis is a kid that was a single player experience, but during battles was a fighting game.
7035000	7039000	That does sound shockingly familiar, but I can't put any details in mind.
7039000	7043000	I can't place my finger on what game he's talking about. It's a little too... not enough details for me.
7043000	7044000	Chat room? Anything? Chat room?
7044000	7047000	Yeah, we'll see what the chatters have to say over at live.vognetwork.com.
7047000	7052000	Uh, any, any fighting game requests here in studio or Loki on the Skype line?
7052000	7062000	Um, I would say, like, uh, I don't know. I was just reminded to watch Salty Bet, so...
7062000	7065000	Maybe bring back Eternal Champions.
7065000	7072000	Because it's weird. Holy cow. But yeah, that'd be a perfect, uh, you know, Moogan.
7072000	7079000	I mean, any of that stuff is just, you know, that would make the perfect fighting game and just watching how ridiculous things could get and, you know, on the website, Salty Bet.
7079000	7088000	Um, yeah, that. I would love to see that. Hell, I'd love to see an app for Salty Bet in, like, you know, on consoles. That'd be fantastic.
7088000	7089000	That would be kind of fun.
7089000	7098000	I think it would be kind of fun even though I, you know, I give EA shit all the time. Wouldn't it be fun if they did a, um, fighting game with their major players?
7098000	7102000	I mean, that would be kind of fun.
7103000	7111000	I don't know. EA's done some really terrible fighting games. I mean, they had... they did the really awful Marvel one, like, a while back.
7111000	7118000	Um, Rise of the... what was it? It was Rise of the, um, Imperfects or something like that?
7118000	7119000	No, I didn't bother.
7119000	7126000	And then there was, um, the Def Jam, um, fighting game that they had that was terrible.
7126000	7131000	Well, see, they just licensed an engine that works. There you go.
7131000	7133000	I guess.
7133000	7142000	Alright. I already gave my answer. I went to RuPaul's Drag Race where they actually throw shade and just kick the crap out of each other, but then hug it out at the end of the day.
7142000	7150000	And maybe, like, instead of a finishing move, they lip sync for their life. And that would be, like, that's how it ends. So that's my fighting game fantasy.
7150000	7153000	Uh, Jason, you're awfully quiet over there. What would be your fighting game fantasy?
7153000	7166000	I... I don't know that I really have one. I like fighting games as they stand, and, um, I don't know. That's not really a genre that I've ever had... had, uh, fanciful dreams about, we'll say.
7166000	7170000	I want a fighting game to smack some sense into Jason. Play more fantasy.
7173000	7176000	Apathetic fighter, where they just... they don't really move.
7178000	7179000	What did you say to me?
7179000	7187000	They think... it's just two characters lying in bed, and they might get out. Alright. Anyhow.
7187000	7188000	Job.
7188000	7197000	Uh, let's... but it's cold outside. Alright, let's move on with some more news. Loki, I think you're gonna start us off with some news here.
7198000	7206000	Yeah, so apparently, um, DayZ did really well for, um, you know, the first week that it's been out.
7206000	7215000	And now this is the alpha client of the standalone version of DayZ, not necessarily the same plugin for Arma 2 that, you know, has been out for a long time now.
7215000	7225000	But, um, they had 400,000 copies sold in the first week. Um, their server, um, was hit... was actually with, uh, 40,000 people at one time at the highest.
7225000	7233000	And, um, they're doing pretty well. They're actually gonna roll out some new updates, um, soon throughout, I guess, 2014.
7233000	7243000	Some of this stuff includes, like, um, better security against, you know, hacking and exploits. Also, uh, cooking and the ability to hunt animals in the game.
7243000	7259000	So, um, I had bought, um, or had gotten, was it the DayZ, uh, you know, mod for Arma 2, but I still haven't gotten a chance to actually play it. Um, but it looks interesting.
7259000	7269000	I don't know a lot about this game, honestly. I've seen it all over Steam, and I saw it during the sale, but, you know, again, I don't have time to play everything, and it's probably a good thing when it comes to sales and so forth.
7270000	7279000	But, yeah, this is just kind of a game I've missed out on. So, roughly, like, why would I want to get it? Why is this game doing so well, Loki? What void does it fill in gaming?
7279000	7306000	It's basically a zombie survival game, but it's incredibly realistic, because Arma is, you know, kind of a military survival, a military sim, and so it has everything from, like, you know, you carry all of your equipment, you have to go scavenge buildings for, you know, stuff, but mostly, um, you don't have to watch out just for zombies, you have to watch out for the other players, which, you know, there's all sorts of crazy stuff that goes on with the other players, you know, kind of taking that whole survival mentality.
7306000	7310000	And it's basically permadeath, so any time you get killed in the game, you're gone.
7310000	7322000	Because I was gonna say, I was like, oh great, just what we need, another zombie game, because I've never seen one of those before, but I get it, so it's, like, hyper-realistic, and it's more like the hardcore, it sounds like, not like Dark Souls in that regard.
7322000	7344000	I've taken it to understand that it's basically a first-person shooter, well, third-person, you see your character running around, third-person action paired with Minecraft, because crafting and combining and cooking, smelting, all that kind of stuff, plays a big role in getting the supplies that you need to survive.
7344000	7354000	It is survival taking advantage of a lot of really modern and popular concepts in gaming. They've looked pretty fun, not entirely sure it's my type of game, but they've been fun to watch.
7354000	7366000	Tech2030 in our chatroom at live.vagnetwork.com, and I'm not, he might be referring to this, or he might be referring to something else they're talking about in chat, because they're talking about a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game and so forth, but Tech2030 says...
7366000	7368000	He's talking about a Pokemon thing.
7368000	7376000	Oh, okay, well he said, I wanna bring this up anyway, Tech2030 said, yeah, that didn't seem like it was an actual game to me, it just looks like some CG filler or something.
7377000	7395000	So, I guess that's not about this particular game, but it does kind of get me thinking, like, sometimes I kind of wish, like, in Steam or whatever, when there's a game, you can get the TLDR, didn't version of the game, you know, too long, semicolon, didn't read, like you can get, or didn't watch with a trailer, like, what is this game all about?
7395000	7407000	Super realistic zombie thing, like, just like Loki described in, like, two sentences, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know, is it, am I just that lazy American guy who can't be bothered? I guess I am, it's fine.
7407000	7422000	But there's so many games, I can't keep track of them all. It's tough, I guess that's why I have lovely people like you to talk to in this show, and blogs to try and keep tabs on all of it, because it's pretty crazy out there.
7422000	7424000	Don't cry, Rob.
7424000	7426000	I might cry, I might cry a little bit. Alright.
7426000	7427000	Bitter tears?
7427000	7443000	I'll cry tears of happiness over this, because this is pretty cool. Video games crossing over into the GLAAD, or the GLAAD, intriguing LGBT characteristics of 2013.
7444000	7452000	And if you don't know what any of these, I just threw, like, all this alphabet soup at you. If you don't know what GLAAD is, it's the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, is that what that is?
7452000	7453000	I think so.
7453000	7471000	Basically, when, you know, they're trying to, sometimes they're a little bit militant, but for the most part, they do a lot of good stuff for, like, just trying to make sure that people are aware, like, you know, for example, in gaming, you shouldn't call other people something that rhymes with maggot.
7471000	7479000	They had really good information at the Castro Street Fair a few years ago. I remember running into some of their people there and actually having a really good conversation.
7479000	7493000	Right. And LGBT, of course, you've probably heard that before, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered. So GLAAD puts out this list, I suppose, every year, and I know they've done this for television, but they put out a list of the most intriguing LGBT characters of 2013.
7494000	7503000	And most of it is, of course, about television. Let's, I'm trying to think about some of the other stuff that they actually put in there.
7503000	7508000	I haven't seen the list, but I think, like, Modern Family, maybe, that's more...
7508000	7520000	Probably the year it came out. Oh, okay. There's that French film, Blue, I actually pulled up the list from GLAAD.org here. Blue is the Warmest Color is, like, this huge French film that's about these two younger girls that fall in love and so forth.
7520000	7530000	Let's see, Fox has a comedy called Brooklyn 99, which has a deadpan, I've never seen this show. I guess it's the Andy Samberg Fox show, which I don't...
7530000	7538000	Okay, I mean, I know Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live, but I didn't know he had a show now. Captain Ray Holt is apparently a gay character and, you know, kind of does deadpan.
7538000	7544000	I think it's... Let me phrase it this way. I'm gay myself. I think you all know that now if you've listened to this show.
7544000	7546000	No. I know, right? I was surprised.
7546000	7548000	I only talked about my partner, Alan, earlier in the show.
7548000	7550000	It's coming out, your 2014 resolution?
7550000	7553000	Right. Okay, so if you didn't know, okay...
7553000	7555000	He went back in for five seconds so he could come back out again.
7555000	7565000	So, I like video games and I'm gay. Gasp, shock, awe. It's 2013, or 2014. I'm still writing 2013 on my checks. It's 2014, this shouldn't shock people anymore.
7566000	7579000	My point is, as a gay man, I don't like when we see these stereotypes on TV. I realize sometimes they're fun. Like, you know, Jack on Will and Grace, he served a purpose and that show was years old and at the time.
7579000	7585000	But you know who my favorite gay character on television was? Like, my favorite portrayal of a gay guy on TV?
7585000	7588000	Neil Patrick Harris from Hello, I Met Your Mother?
7588000	7592000	No, but he is great in general. Who doesn't love Neil Patrick Harris? But no. Well, he's not a gay character on the show.
7592000	7594000	He's playing a straight character.
7594000	7604000	But anyway, my absolutely favorite portrayal of a gay man on TV is the ABC comedy Happy Endings, which unfortunately isn't on anymore. There was a character named Max.
7604000	7613000	And Max was this slobby video game playing guy who was into dudes. He was me, basically.
7613000	7614000	You're not slobby.
7614000	7620000	But, I mean, like, he was my spirit animal. That's why I liked that portrayal. So he was probably on this list in one year.
7620000	7628000	You want to know one thing that's pretty fucked up? I was watching an interview with John Barrowman and he auditioned for that role in Will and Grace.
7628000	7629000	Oh, yeah, I heard about that.
7629000	7638000	And was rejected for it because he wasn't gay enough. After having, what, married his partner a couple years ago?
7638000	7640000	Irony.
7640000	7641000	Irony. Anyway.
7641000	7643000	They need the stereotype instead of the normal frickin' human being.
7644000	7650000	If you've never seen Happy Endings, I'm almost positive it's on Netflix. It's got to be on Hulu, but I think it was on Netflix, too, and that's my favorite portrayal.
7650000	7658000	But anyway, why did I bring this all up in the first place? Because it does have to do with games. I didn't just go on a random tangent about gay things in the media.
7658000	7666000	What made this important is that amongst this list of movies and TV and so forth, they actually called out here, and you actually can see here on the site, number five,
7667000	7676000	they actually called out The Last of Us, which, you know, was a huge PlayStation 3 game. And unfortunately, it's one of those games that's on my list to play, but I'm behind.
7676000	7677000	I love that game so badly.
7677000	7690000	I know. It's in my rental queue list and I really want to play this. And just reading more about this makes me want to play it more because there is a character in the game named Bill that's kind of like a loner in one of the towns in the game that you learn through a backstory.
7690000	7703000	He had a partner named Bill. They were in a relationship, but because of the plague, the partner, I guess, I'm assuming, turned into a zombie or whatever the deal is in that game, and so it kind of gets into a story about that relationship.
7703000	7719000	But again, Bill, not a stereotype. So that's, you know, but that's really cool that we're seeing video games really kind of penetrate the mass media in all these sorts of ways where it's not just, you know, how do I phrase it?
7719000	7738000	Like, it's not just video games kind of, oh, you can sit at the table too because, you know, my kids play Pac-Man and so forth. But no, like in this very political organization's list of acknowledging representation in various art forms, they include video games right alongside movies and television.
7738000	7739000	That's really cool.
7739000	7745000	I believe they also named a comic book character in this as well.
7745000	7746000	Is it Batwoman?
7747000	7755000	No, it is shape-shifter Benjamin Deeds came out as gay, leading his teacher Emma Frost to immediately reply, I don't care.
7755000	7761000	I think it actually gets into the whole, this is just kind of all the LGBT characters in comics. It's one, like, kind of blanket.
7761000	7766000	Of course, they bring up Wiccan and Hulkling, but they're actually like, I ship them so hard.
7768000	7772000	So, Prodigy, and so forth. So they include comic books in this too.
7772000	7780000	And there was also North Star got married in comics, I think last, the year before, I would say.
7780000	7794000	But there was also, though, I wasn't a big DC fan, but there was a whole big shitstorm around Batwoman being able to propose to her girlfriend and not get married because no one was getting married.
7794000	7802000	Yes, and then there was that whole ugliness too when that story came out about the art that they wanted people to draw for, like, an audition.
7802000	7804000	The Harley Quinn naked, dead in the bathtub.
7804000	7805000	Yuck.
7805000	7807000	Sexualizing suicide, that type of thing.
7807000	7818000	Anyway, let's focus on the positive, and that is gaming media and a powerful story like The Last of Us sitting right alongside these other, this is a good thing.
7818000	7819000	You know what, I have a goal for this year, Rob.
7819000	7820000	What's that?
7820000	7822000	John Berriman on the show to do a bumper.
7822000	7823000	That's my goal.
7823000	7824000	That's a lofty goal.
7824000	7827000	Dear John Berriman, will you please do a bumper for O.L.R. because I love you.
7827000	7831000	If he's at Dragon Con this year, I will make it my, because now you know I'm all about Dragon Con.
7831000	7833000	I'm going to be on a plane to Atlanta come Labor Day.
7833000	7834000	Thank you, Bobby.
7834000	7837000	You better fit me in your overhead compartment because I need to see my man.
7837000	7839000	When you say it that way, it sounds so sexy.
7839000	7840000	I want to be his hag.
7840000	7841000	You can be my overhead compartment.
7841000	7843000	Ew, no, it's gross because you're a friend.
7843000	7844000	All right.
7844000	7847000	I wasn't even thinking of Rob.
7847000	7850000	Rob, you're a horrible human being.
7850000	7851000	Yes, I know.
7851000	7852000	That's why you love me.
7852000	7853000	That's why you love me.
7853000	7854000	All right.
7854000	7856000	Speaking of horrible human beings, Dark Sakura.
7856000	7859000	Do you love or loathe?
7859000	7861000	Speaking of horrible human beings, Dark Sakura.
7861000	7863000	No, I'm not saying Dark Sakura is the horrible human being.
7863000	7865000	I'm saying the story is about what horrible people are doing.
7865000	7866000	It's about fuckery is what it is.
7866000	7868000	Yes, it's a story about fuckery.
7868000	7874000	I'm kind of glad that now I have a new computer that never had WoW touch it.
7874000	7880000	Blizzard sent out a big warning for World of Warcraft players saying that there's a dangerous Trojan
7880000	7884000	that they should be on the lookout for that could steal their account information,
7884000	7888000	information even if they're using an authenticator.
7888000	7895000	It's called you can actually find it by going by making an MS info file.
7895000	7902000	This is, of course, you know, PC, because I don't see anything about it affecting the Mac players.
7902000	7908000	But you look for a startup program that's either Disker or Disker 64,
7908000	7916000	and it will show up with Disker run DLL 32.exe, you know, the usual, or Disker 64.
7916000	7922000	And then they're trying to basically find out how to remove it, but none of the regular virus programs can.
7922000	7929000	I can tell you that there are ways of removing Trojans, but you need to completely disconnect from the internet
7929000	7931000	once you find out the how.
7932000	7939000	So you can get rid of them, you just need to be able to dig into your startup files.
7939000	7942000	And you'll probably have to do a registry clean as well.
7942000	7947000	Just a warning to those of you that want to play MMOs, don't let stuff like this scare you from playing MMOs,
7947000	7954000	but you've got to be careful because people really, they come after the golden games and stuff,
7954000	7956000	and people's accounts, like hardcore.
7956000	7962000	So if the game ever offers like a second level authentication, and almost all the big MMOs do,
7962000	7967000	WoW certainly does, in fact it's a universal battle net, Final Fantasy XIV has an authenticator,
7967000	7971000	Star Wars, The Old Republic had one, I'm assuming Rift has one too.
7971000	7976000	You know, if they have these second levels of authentication, take it, take it, take it, do it.
7976000	7978000	Because I'm always shocked.
7978000	7980000	But they're saying this is breaking through the authenticator.
7980000	7985000	Yes, this breaks through the authenticator because what they did, my understanding is it's like a fake curse client.
7986000	7991000	Is that they were putting it up there as the WoW curse client, which is a very popular add-on managing,
7991000	7994000	so people would Google it and they would get this, not the first time.
7994000	7997000	And you can't really get rid of curse that easily even after you've uninstalled.
7997000	8002000	I'm going to read though this paragraph that's a reply to this that was submitted by Hvok, I guess.
8002000	8007000	I would encourage anyone with the Trojan to seek help before resorting to a reformat,
8007000	8012000	and to make sure you're not getting help from one of those quote professionals who just reformat for you.
8012000	8019000	Everything available on the virus suggests it should be entirely removable by fairly standard manual removal methods, like I was saying earlier.
8019000	8024000	It does nothing special. There's no TDLFS file system, no alternate data stream files.
8024000	8029000	It doesn't even particularly protect itself except by a couple task scheduler entries.
8029000	8036000	And so, yeah, I've removed one of those annoying ones that keeps reinstalling itself every time you connect to the internet,
8036000	8038000	and I had to do a complete registry rewrite on mine.
8038000	8041000	Yeah, be careful. You will have to get the gun and shoot your computer.
8041000	8043000	And then burn the room.
8043000	8048000	But this will just be, this one seems super easy to remove from what I'm seeing on here.
8048000	8052000	I think it's more in there as kind of a half-assed kind of thing,
8052000	8059000	because if they really wanted to make it dangerous, then, you know, they could have done a lot more to it.
8059000	8064000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Bobby Blackwolf is in our chat saying,
8064000	8069000	remember, I got hacked by gold farmers in WoW, and I never played it.
8069000	8073000	That's right, but he had a Battle.net account, I'm assuming from playing like Starcraft or Diablo or something else over the years,
8073000	8078000	and they used that to make the WoW tune and get gold and all that.
8078000	8084000	And Brad from PodCulture says the only way to be 100% sure is to nuke and reformat.
8084000	8093000	That's not necessary. If this one isn't doing any file protection on itself other than task scheduler, that's not necessary at all.
8093000	8097000	Maybe with this, but I think it's important to say that what Brad is saying,
8097000	8101000	Blizzard, what they call BluePoster community managers were saying,
8101000	8105000	when they didn't know enough about this, that's what they were saying you would have to do if you got caught with this.
8105000	8109000	At this time, the only sure way we know is to reformat your computer, exactly what he said.
8109000	8116000	So sometimes in the early stages and they're still trying to figure out what the hell this virus, Trojan, whatever it is, that's how you get rid of it.
8116000	8123000	I do also suggest, and I'm normally not a big advocate of different programs,
8123000	8125000	but Hijack This is very useful.
8125000	8127000	I like the name, Hijack This.
8127000	8135000	No, what it does is it runs through all of your processes that are running so that you can get rid of any type of shareware, spyware, anything like that.
8135000	8144000	And I also run a program on my Chrome that, and don't enact it on our website because we need the ads, called Ghostery.
8144000	8146000	Or whitelist vognetwork.com, please.
8146000	8152000	But it's called Ghostery that basically stops websites from installing trackers and advertising detail.
8152000	8154000	And it works for Facebook.
8154000	8163000	In a crazy related story, I don't know if you heard about this, but Yahoo apparently got a huge hack over the past few days that where people,
8163000	8170000	you actually had to click on the ads, but when you click on the ad, it would install malware, like somebody hacked Yahoo in that regard.
8170000	8177000	And I have an app on my iPhone where whenever you open it up, the ad on the bottom automatically opens up a game to download.
8177000	8180000	And that is so irritating. I can't imagine that as per Apple's terms of service.
8180000	8184000	It's gonna kill that now, just literally. That situation, just get rid of it.
8184000	8185000	Yeah, yeah. No, seriously.
8185000	8187000	And they're resorting to nefarious things.
8187000	8188000	Yeah, it's ridiculous.
8188000	8190000	Stop rewarding them in any way.
8191000	8199000	That's ad networks, whether somebody actually manages to make it into a more or less reputable network.
8199000	8208000	That's what Drive by Malware and Drive by Downloads were all about, is that you're on a site that isn't technically illegal,
8208000	8216000	but can't get a prominent first-party ad network to allow them to monetize their content and get ad revenue off of web pages.
8217000	8231000	And in the era of constant Java vulnerabilities, constant Flash vulnerabilities, and even older browsers and just basic rendering exploits,
8231000	8239000	this is the argument for making sure that all your stuff is up-to-date and disabling as many third-party plugins as you reasonably can.
8240000	8246000	Java and Flash being the two biggest offenders. If you're that crazy, disable JavaScript and you will be that much safer,
8246000	8250000	but your internet browsing experience will also be much worse.
8250000	8261000	That's why I'm... There's another program I use, too, that's another type of ad blocker, but it also, again, blocks those little installs from advertising and tracking your...
8261000	8267000	Because Facebook tracks your web search data for advertising.
8268000	8271000	That way I keep seeing porn ads.
8271000	8280000	The Facebook one that I use is called Facebook Purity, and it removes all of the ads, all of the trackers, and you can even set it up to make Facebook look like it did five years ago.
8280000	8292000	But there's a number of trackers that keep from auto-installing stuff, tracking your data, and blocking JavaScript installs.
8292000	8296000	I love this comment, though, in our chatroom at live.vognetware.com, and then we'll move on to the next story.
8296000	8299000	Retertainment says malware, like the Yahoo toolbar.
8299000	8301000	No, the Ask toolbar, too.
8301000	8307000	Or, this always cracks me up. I mean, this is a little bit of a rant, but I'm sorry, I have to go there.
8307000	8317000	The Alexa toolbar, right? I mean, that was a big thing back in the day, and now that website, which I think they were bought by Amazon, it measures traffic, I guess, based on the toolbar usage and so forth.
8317000	8328000	That's one of the meters that E3 uses to see if your website is worthy, you know, of being blessed by the E3 pope, where your organization can come in.
8328000	8332000	Because believe me, I've been on both sides of it, where yes, my site was good enough, no, my site was not good enough.
8332000	8339000	And it always blew my mind. I'm like, really, Alexa? Like, most tech-minded people I know know to get that shit off their computer.
8339000	8343000	Like, that might have been cool in, like, 1998, but now, less cool.
8343000	8345000	It's like having Gator.
8345000	8350000	Yeah, right? Or Weatherbug. Or all the stuff my parents have on their computer.
8350000	8352000	Bonsai, buddy. Whatever the hell that is.
8352000	8353000	Rob.
8353000	8354000	Bonzi.
8354000	8358000	Rob. Why does your dad's computer take fifteen minutes to boot, Rob? I just bought it.
8358000	8363000	Rob, I bought him a new PC and he already broke it, Rob. Rob, can you come over?
8363000	8365000	The inevitable screenshot.
8365000	8367000	That's also, like, Dan's grandmother wanting to...
8367000	8375000	And it's like you load it up and literally the corner thing, where the time is, is like three rows high, fifteen icons. It's like, oh my god, people.
8375000	8379000	The inevitable screenshot of people's browsers with, like, fifteen or twenty search toolbars.
8379000	8385000	Yeah, then my dad's like, well, I was on this genealogy website and they had to install it, Rob. This is genealogy.
8385000	8387000	My dad's really into genealogy.
8387000	8390000	So is Dan's grandmother, and we, but she's...
8390000	8393000	There's something about genealogy and spybars.
8393000	8400000	But she's gotten really good about not installing any of that stuff. We basically said, if it asks you to install it, call us first.
8400000	8408000	So, she's actually pretty, gotten pretty computer savvy. So proud. She's so nice.
8408000	8413000	Alrighty. Uh, Loki. Is Loki there?
8413000	8415000	Yeah, sorry about that.
8415000	8416000	That's alright.
8416000	8417000	Have you been cat-butted again?
8417000	8418000	What?
8418000	8420000	Have you been cat-butted again?
8421000	8426000	No, she's sleeping right here. I've been salty-bedded again.
8426000	8435000	See, this is what I miss about having you in studio, because at least I can see you when your eyes are glazed over. Loki, over here! It's fine, it's fine.
8435000	8440000	I was watching Naruto get his ass kicked by one of the riders.
8440000	8447000	Unfortunately, it was the one that was like, oh yeah, there's no way that he's gonna lose. I'm gonna bet big on that. Yeah.
8447000	8462000	Didn't happen. Anyways, so speaking of betting and professional things, apparently there is an esports team, the Quadratic Gaming Esports team.
8462000	8470000	And the CEO, Simon, he has disappeared, because he owes a lot of people money.
8470000	8480000	Apparently he is owing, was it, won a pro Starcraft 2 player $23,000 in salary and prize money for months now.
8480000	8492000	And I guess they're even saying that upwards to $40,000 is owed in total across a bunch of other staff members.
8492000	8498000	And he has basically disappeared since middle of December. So that kinda sucks.
8499000	8508000	Yeah. You know, we just had a story a couple weeks ago about how esports is getting bigger and bigger. I mean, is this the dark side of what's to come?
8508000	8513000	Or is this not? It's just an isolated thing. What do you think? Is this something we're gonna hear more about?
8513000	8521000	Well, especially when more money's involved, I could see more of this type of stuff happening. But it's just kinda disappointing, I guess.
8521000	8527000	But I think this type of thing happens, it's not just isolated to esports, that's for sure.
8527000	8530000	That's true. There's bad people everywhere.
8532000	8539000	Oh god, what was the company's name? The Maryland? Rhode Island? Oh man, I'm not even getting any of the details anymore.
8539000	8541000	The Baseball Stars MMO company.
8541000	8542000	Rhode Island.
8542000	8543000	Curt Schilling.
8543000	8546000	Yeah, Schilling and Rhode Island and the back game.
8548000	8552000	And you wanna talk about raking up big money in a big hurry? Wow.
8553000	8558000	Alright. Well, let's move on. Jason, what do you have for us before we get to the mailbag?
8558000	8563000	Well, are you scared yet? Talking about money always tends to make that happen.
8563000	8576000	There is a new biofeedback-based horror game called Nevermind that attempts to detect players' fear and make the game harder as their fear continues to rise, provided that they're not able to calm themselves back down.
8577000	8595000	Basically the point is, find what breaks you, confirm that via the in-game monitoring of your heart rate variance via a chest strap that you wear when playing it, and throw similar kinds of scares or more or less scares just in general.
8596000	8610000	The plot of it is that you are a... I read this and my brain already reset. You are hired as a neuroprober at the Neurostalgia Institute. I don't like either of the way those words come together.
8611000	8626000	It's somewhat of an Inception-style plotline in the sense that you are living out other people's horrors and mental states to determine the cause of all of their suffering and all that's occurring in the first place.
8626000	8631000	It's intended to be a fully-fledged game, solving puzzles based in other people's fears and minds.
8635000	8645000	I want to know where this is actually being rolled out, because it has a very big barrier to entry in the sense that you actually need a couple of pieces of hardware to monitor what's going on in the first place.
8645000	8649000	But you want to talk about immersion and really finding the best game to play?
8649000	8652000	I would lose this game in five seconds. That's what scared me about that.
8653000	8654000	The Vitality Sensor.
8654000	8665000	Yeah, the Vitality Sensor. That was called the Wii was supposed to do. Whatever happened to that thing, right? But I think it disappeared, but I'm like, I would so lose. I get freaked out by games and so forth.
8665000	8670000	I could not do this kind of stuff on my own, but I love playing stuff like this in groups.
8670000	8678000	And even if I'm the one to do it and everybody else is there to watch, playing off of other people's emotions is so much fun.
8678000	8679000	Yeah, that's true.
8679000	8680000	That's true.
8680000	8693000	Yeah, I don't think I see. I think it's all just being teased right now. Developed as a part of Masters of Fine Arts thesis within the University of Southern California's Interactive Meeting Games Division.
8693000	8699000	Never mind, took about a year to build to its present source as a proof of concept game.
8699000	8707000	Reynolds plans to hold a Kickstarter project to launch the game with a variety of disturbed patients in late 2014.
8707000	8717000	You know, it's very interesting to see the places that gaming might be headed in the next 10 years, because think about how far technology has gone just in the past, you know, 10 years as it is.
8717000	8722000	We had head-mounted screens in the 90s, but they were just TVs three inches from our face.
8722000	8724000	And now we're in them with depth and motion and everything else.
8724000	8728000	Yeah, with, you know, it's kind of an Oculus Rift night here at VoG, but yeah, exactly.
8728000	8731000	You know, like you look at that as part of what could be the future of gaming.
8731000	8737000	You look at something like this that actually can kind of like feel your emotions, so to say. It's kind of freaky.
8737000	8746000	But of course, it's also important to say not everything always catches on, like the Vitality sensor or like 3D televisions have kind of fizzled out.
8746000	8748000	We thought it was going to be a huge thing. It's kind of not.
8748000	8750000	Especially for something that would be such a one-off accessory.
8750000	8758000	There's actually a lot of potential for this, because there is this alternative use to something that can also be put to use for exercise games otherwise.
8758000	8764000	Because people wear chest straps to monitor their heart rate and get a better sense of how they're doing on their workouts.
8764000	8775000	So if you couple application of these accessories with this and other complementary games, there's a lot of potential for, you know, a good base of games to take advantage of it.
8775000	8782000	And it won't just be a one-off purchase for something you'll play three times and then shove off to the land of misfit accessories.
8782000	8791000	All right. Well, yeah, I wonder if this is the type of game that will get demoed for me at a convention in the future, but we'll see.
8791000	8797000	All right. In the meantime, we're going to go to the segment where you guys email us every week.
8798000	8803000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. That is Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8803000	8810000	And DarkSocker is going to dive into the mailbag head first and find some emails that she believes are worthy of being read on the show tonight.
8810000	8813000	I was making this squish.
8813000	8815000	Not a lot in the mailbag. Relatively.
8815000	8816000	Two. There were two.
8816000	8820000	You know, y'all should have made New Year's resolutions to email the show at some point this year.
8820000	8822000	And I just want to put this out there real quick.
8822000	8829000	I'm always blown away when we get emails that are like, I've been listening to you for six years and this is the first time I've ever sent you an email.
8829000	8835000	And it's nobody I've ever heard of, but I'm always like, wow, there's like more people out there that I didn't even know existed.
8835000	8838000	So all I'm saying, don't be shy.
8838000	8845000	If it's your very first time ever emailing the show, I'll make DarkSocker give a buy on the spelling and grammar.
8845000	8849000	Just email us and say hello. We'd love to hear from you. Please comment.
8849000	8851000	And I only do that because it's hilarious.
8851000	8855000	Yeah, she isn't. She isn't. It comes from a place of love, not of hate.
8855000	8856000	Of love of grammar.
8856000	8857000	Love of education.
8857000	8858000	That's right. All right.
8858000	8860000	Unwelcome education.
8860000	8861000	All right. To the emails.
8861000	8863000	How goes it, O.L.R.? Grammar please.
8863000	8864000	Lol.
8864000	8866000	I say how goes it so.
8866000	8868000	I say how be.
8868000	8873000	Anyway, this is my first time hitting up the show as I'm always busy during the live show.
8873000	8875000	Perfect.
8875000	8879000	And I just wanted to thank you for the entertainment during my busy work weeks.
8879000	8880000	Don't stop.
8880000	8883000	Hope you all enjoyed the New Year.
8883000	8884000	Yes, New Year.
8884000	8888000	First time emailer IQ.
8888000	8889000	IQ.
8889000	8891000	You need to get rid of your galaxy and get an iPhone.
8891000	8893000	Was a.
8893000	8894000	Stop.
8894000	8899000	IQ was a PlayStation one game that's very hard to find now that had a great sound.
8899000	8900000	E-Y-E-Q-U-U.
8900000	8902000	Oh, you're thinking of Intelligent Cube.
8902000	8903000	Yeah, but it was IQ.
8903000	8907000	If you find the game, it's like I period Q period. Remember?
8907000	8908000	That game was weird.
8908000	8909000	I remember the game.
8909000	8910000	I don't remember the art.
8910000	8911000	It was a very good game.
8911000	8912000	It was a very hard game.
8912000	8914000	Wasn't it like a PlayStation release game?
8914000	8916000	It was like one of the first games I got for it.
8916000	8919000	Very close, but I don't think it was that early.
8919000	8924000	I didn't have a PlayStation until like a year or two before the PS2.
8924000	8925000	What the hell do I know?
8925000	8929000	I think that was the first game I ever rented on the PlayStation was Intelligent Cube.
8929000	8935000	I remember the only early, early PlayStation that I remember is the jam-packed demos.
8935000	8938000	And I remember playing irritating stick.
8939000	8941000	Irritating stick was...
8941000	8943000	I love those jam-packed demos were awesome.
8943000	8946000	Yeah, those PlayStation demo discs were the shit.
8946000	8950000	You know, we have like a pile of them, like two years worth of them.
8950000	8951000	Good stuff.
8951000	8952000	Those demo discs.
8952000	8955000	Anyway, thank you to the kind emailer who just wrote in to say hello.
8955000	8956000	Appreciate it.
8956000	8957000	T-Y-I-Q.
8957000	8960000	You must have a high IQ if you listen to this show.
8961000	8962000	All right.
8962000	8967000	The last email says, if you read this on air, use Turbo Lover as the name.
8967000	8968000	Okay.
8968000	8973000	Well, since you actually put your real name in the body of your email, I'm going to change that out for Turbo.
8973000	8974000	Okay?
8974000	8975000	Happy New Year, guys.
8975000	8980000	Just want to let Rob and the rest of you know that my Xbox Live account was hacked.
8981000	8987000	Found this out when my new Xbox One called me Jen instead of by his name.
8987000	8991000	Of course, nothing bad happened since I don't keep current information on there,
8991000	8994000	but an email from Xbox Microsoft would have been nice.
8994000	8997000	Hope the hackers don't learn to use the Kinect anytime soon.
8997000	8998000	Love your show.
8998000	8999000	Later, Turbo Lover.
8999000	9000000	Whoa.
9000000	9003000	So this, because we haven't heard of Xbox hacks happening really in a while,
9003000	9005000	but he's saying this is happening on the Xbox One.
9005000	9006000	Yeah.
9006000	9007000	Huh.
9007000	9009000	I mean, it's all an Xbox account.
9009000	9010000	Well, yeah.
9010000	9011000	No, it's Microsoft.
9011000	9019000	And there was the story from Bobby from Christmas Eve that the support reps didn't allow people to break in.
9019000	9024000	And so he just wound up getting the survey email from Microsoft after the fact.
9024000	9025000	Right.
9025000	9027000	But nothing changed on console or on account.
9027000	9032000	Something to consider is that I would like to know from this emailer,
9032000	9038000	do you share your Microsoft password with another site that possibly got hacked?
9038000	9041000	And maybe they reverse engineered, you know,
9041000	9044000	because that was a big thing going around about how they got into the last Xboxes,
9044000	9048000	although I remain somewhat skeptical if that's 100% true.
9048000	9052000	But it does happen with other like, and just just a general piece of advice.
9052000	9055000	I know I've said this on the show before, but please, please.
9055000	9057000	Your banking account password.
9057000	9063000	Do not use that password anywhere else but your bank, your email password.
9063000	9065000	Do not use that anywhere else but your email,
9065000	9069000	because what does everything come back to to reset your passwords on other sites?
9069000	9070000	Your email, your email.
9070000	9073000	And those are probably the two most important things are your bank account and your email.
9073000	9076000	Never, ever, ever share those passwords.
9076000	9080000	If you share those passwords with any other website, especially Xbox Live or something like that,
9080000	9083000	that's vulnerable and gets hacked a lot, change it right now.
9083000	9084000	Pause the show.
9084000	9085000	Change those passwords.
9085000	9086000	You'll thank me later.
9086000	9087000	Secondary piece of advice.
9087000	9091000	Don't share security questions and answers between them either.
9091000	9096000	You would be a lot, a lot of sites now are using really unique questions.
9096000	9097000	It's like mothers made a name.
9097000	9099000	That shit is easy to figure out.
9099000	9100000	And some of that stuff where you were born.
9100000	9102000	Hello, LinkedIn or Facebook.
9102000	9106000	Yeah, or because people will pass around memes on Facebook that are like,
9106000	9109000	fill out this survey and get to know all about me.
9109000	9112000	That's all the fricking password reset where those came from.
9112000	9113000	Those were a scam to begin with.
9113000	9115000	I used to do those on LiveJournal all the time.
9115000	9116000	All of us did.
9116000	9117000	All of us did.
9117000	9119000	Because we weren't thinking that far ahead.
9119000	9121000	Because it came from our friends.
9121000	9126000	I, this part of a reason why I, you know, say that my hometown is mobile
9126000	9130000	and I've mentioned where I was born, but I hardly ever do it.
9130000	9132000	There's a reason behind that.
9132000	9136000	And I don't tell people the hospital I was born at or the street I lived on.
9136000	9141000	I think only maybe a total of six listeners total have my address.
9141000	9142000	Right.
9142000	9143000	And that's because I've met them in person.
9143000	9144000	Right.
9144000	9146000	Well, that's, that's how I feel about my real last name.
9146000	9149000	Like, no offense, but it's just like, I separate my work life and my-
9149000	9151000	I want to be a famous artist someday, Rob.
9151000	9153000	Oh, but I'm staring at this envelope that says Rob Roberts.
9153000	9154000	Oh no, it doesn't.
9154000	9156000	See, I want to be a famous artist someday.
9156000	9158000	So as many people know, my name is possible.
9158000	9159000	Just makes me more famous.
9159000	9161000	Oh, uh, Bobby Black Wolf.
9161000	9162000	Good point.
9162000	9166000	Same with the, here's your poor name, street you grew up on,
9166000	9167000	plus your mother's maiden name.
9167000	9168000	L-O-L-O-L.
9168000	9169000	Yeah.
9169000	9170000	Yeah.
9170000	9171000	So I just make up something.
9171000	9173000	And so many people buy it, hook, line, and sinker.
9173000	9175000	And I was probably one of those people, honestly.
9175000	9180000	Well, I, I, I've always gone in and used, um, either I've,
9180000	9184000	I've used the stepmothers, even though I don't really tell her that much anymore.
9184000	9185000	I've used her maiden name.
9185000	9186000	I've used my grandmother's maiden name.
9186000	9190000	And I have a list of what I use where I'm kind of anal about that.
9190000	9193000	So be safe people, scary internet.
9193000	9194000	Sorry.
9194000	9197000	Random tangent that I don't think that email or intended, but it's a good,
9197000	9199000	just more education, more education.
9199000	9202000	Because like I said, like, I'm not saying all this to sound high and mighty.
9202000	9206000	Like I'm saying this to S to say, I have made these mistakes too.
9206000	9208000	And now looking back, I go, gosh, Rob,
9208000	9210000	I wish someone had smacked you upside the head.
9210000	9212000	I've had two email accounts hacked in my life.
9212000	9213000	Oh yeah.
9213000	9215000	My, my Yahoo account was hacked some time ago.
9215000	9217000	Yahoo one say well once.
9217000	9222000	I can safely say that I've never had my email, um, uh, hacked.
9222000	9223000	Lucky you.
9223000	9224000	Um,
9224000	9228000	but I don't know if it's because all of my passwords have been in a non-English
9228000	9229000	language.
9231000	9232000	All right.
9232000	9233000	Is that it for emails?
9233000	9234000	That's it.
9234000	9235000	Well, we need some more for next week.
9235000	9239000	So please consider mailbag at orange lawns radio.com is the place to send
9239000	9241000	those emails. In the meantime,
9241000	9244000	this is the part of the show where we get angsty with a segment we've been
9244000	9246000	doing ever since episode one. And you know what? Here we are.
9246000	9251000	It's the first show of 2014, which would mean our 12th broadcast year.
9251000	9254000	We don't officially have the 12th anniversary until, until June.
9254000	9258000	But I mean, with the show started in 2002 to 2014 is our 12th broadcast year,
9258000	9259000	if you can believe it.
9259000	9262000	And we have done this segment ever since episode one,
9262000	9265000	because sometimes guys, we just like to bitch.
9271000	9273000	Oh, this is bad.
9273000	9275000	Here is justice.
9275000	9277000	Here is punishment.
9277000	9279000	Here is...
9279000	9281000	This is fucked up.
9281000	9283000	FUs of the week time.
9283000	9287000	The bird that shat in the middle of my windshield while I was, uh,
9287000	9290000	going down, uh,
9290000	9292000	the 80.
9292000	9293000	FU birds.
9293000	9296000	Remember that time we were at Sizzler and some bird.
9296000	9298000	First off, that's funny in and of itself.
9299000	9301000	Remember Sizzler?
9301000	9304000	Remember when it almost killed my boyfriend from the food poisoning?
9304000	9306000	But then, just to add insult to injury,
9306000	9311000	a bird decided to take the biggest shit I've ever seen a bird take.
9311000	9313000	Right on my windshield.
9313000	9315000	We've seen the cars in Davis.
9315000	9317000	But no, uh...
9317000	9319000	It's like the bird ate at that Sizzler.
9319000	9321000	You know what?
9321000	9323000	Well, I mean, the runoff in the back is like...
9323000	9325000	And, and, and, and, and
9325000	9330000	FU'd in me because I have a present for your and Alan's anniversary.
9330000	9331000	Shucks.
9331000	9332000	That...
9332000	9334000	Well, I told you what one of them was already.
9334000	9338000	It's, you know, that sign that's in my house that says Dan and James and they both hate you.
9338000	9339000	Oh, that's nice. Thank you.
9339000	9343000	And I made you a typography present that's basically different nerd fonts.
9343000	9345000	Well, we're, we're trying to move in March,
9345000	9347000	so if nothing else, it'd be how I got a house for you.
9347000	9349000	Well, I'll, I'll just continue next week.
9349000	9350000	Yeah, can't wait.
9350000	9354000	Or we'll do dinner lunch prep for lunch.
9354000	9355000	Appreciate it.
9355000	9356000	Prep for lunch snack.
9356000	9357000	Prep for lunch snack.
9357000	9358000	All right.
9358000	9359000	Uh, Loki, your FUs.
9359000	9363000	Uh, my FU goes to Salty Bev because I just can't pick a winner.
9363000	9365000	Just can't pick a winner.
9365000	9367000	Um...
9367000	9369000	I don't know. I'm not super angsty.
9369000	9373000	Um, FU to, FU to all the construction on this street
9373000	9376000	that I know is gonna fuck up everything when I go to work tomorrow.
9376000	9377000	And I just, I just...
9377000	9379000	Because, you know, tomorrow's the day that everybody goes back.
9379000	9382000	I went back to work on Thursday, but everybody goes back tomorrow.
9382000	9384000	And I'm just not looking forward to the fuckery
9384000	9386000	that is construction on this street at 8 AM.
9386000	9388000	Happy New Year! Fuck everything!
9388000	9389000	Yeah, right?
9389000	9391000	So, I'm not looking forward to that.
9391000	9393000	Uh, Jason, last but not least.
9393000	9394000	Oof.
9394000	9397000	FU to sleep schedules, and mine especially.
9397000	9402000	Um, I don't think I've woken up before, like, 10 AM for...
9402000	9405000	probably three to four months now.
9405000	9409000	And I might have to be up at six in, like, three weeks.
9409000	9411000	And it's a horrifying thought.
9411000	9414000	Especially on the week after my team's meetup,
9414000	9418000	where there will be lots of late nights.
9418000	9421000	Late nights, I don't know if libations is the correct word,
9421000	9424000	but there will definitely be lots of celebrations and ongoing.
9424000	9426000	And to have only a weekend to recover,
9426000	9428000	which also includes coming up to Sacramento,
9428000	9431000	getting back into San Francisco at just a little bit before midnight,
9431000	9433000	and still having to wind down.
9433000	9436000	Waking up the next day that early is not going to be fun.
9436000	9438000	FU sleep.
9438000	9439000	I, I...
9439000	9441000	I've got to reset my schedule too.
9441000	9444000	Alan and I were, like, sleeping until, like, 11.
9444000	9445000	I think one day we slept until noon.
9445000	9446000	Like, during the...
9446000	9447000	Noon!
9447000	9448000	Noon!
9448000	9449000	I was up at 2 PM today.
9449000	9450000	Oh my gosh.
9450000	9451000	And yesterday.
9451000	9452000	Okay, you win.
9452000	9455000	I mean, I wake up multiple times, but, like, my, my sleep schedule,
9455000	9459000	because I don't have a commute, has changed everything,
9459000	9461000	for better or for worse.
9461000	9464000	I, yeah, waking up, I, I didn't, like,
9464000	9466000	I didn't wake up that early to get out here
9466000	9468000	when I took my road trip out to California.
9468000	9472000	I woke up at, uh, 11, because I wasn't exactly going to prepare
9472000	9479000	for 12 days of TMI stewing in your own filth on the road for 12 hours.
9479000	9481000	Um, you know what I mean.
9481000	9485000	You're sitting in one place, you're, you know, going,
9485000	9487000	well, it was kind of cold outside.
9487000	9490000	Anyways, I, yeah.
9490000	9492000	As long as you waited until you got to a rest stop,
9492000	9494000	because you make it sound kind of nasty.
9494000	9495000	I was making a sweat comment.
9495000	9496000	Oh, okay.
9496000	9497000	All right.
9497000	9500000	Not that you like, you know, you just, I'll just pee.
9500000	9504000	Not, not rat race on the police officer's car.
9504000	9508000	Anyways, yeah, I have not woken up early in a long time,
9508000	9510000	and I'm going to have to wake up insanely early
9510000	9514000	so that I don't get caught in peninsula San Francisco traffic.
9514000	9516000	It's going to suck.
9516000	9522000	I, I feel your pain, because I have to reset for my hour and a half drive.
9522000	9526000	The, the people, the people in training that actually do, you know,
9526000	9527000	have a set schedule.
9527000	9529000	You do actually have to be there in the morning.
9529000	9530000	Yeah.
9530000	9531000	Yeah, I know that.
9531000	9534000	Citrus Heights to Elk Grove.
9534000	9535000	Yeah.
9535000	9536000	I'm fighting the downtown traffic,
9536000	9540000	so that's why I'm leaving well before I have to.
9540000	9543000	Yeah.
9543000	9548000	Or maybe I just will stop sleeping and live on No Does and Red Bull.
9548000	9552000	Not that I advocate that, but I've done it before.
9552000	9553000	All right.
9553000	9555000	Just a couple more news stories for you guys,
9555000	9557000	and then we're going to get to your calls at 1877 Game OLR,
9557000	9559000	or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9559000	9561000	But don't call yet, because we have two more stories.
9561000	9562000	Loki.
9562000	9568000	All right, so there's a brand new iOS and Android app that's going to be,
9568000	9572000	I'm sorry, yeah, it's being made by Yuji Naka,
9572000	9576000	and it is a game where you photograph whales.
9576000	9580000	A little bit of a change from some of the other games that he's done.
9581000	9589000	It is, I guess, free on iOS with in-app purchases and five bucks on Android.
9589000	9592000	Is it called Porpoise Snap?
9592000	9598000	It's called Real Whales.
9598000	9599000	Yeah.
9599000	9601000	Slow News Week.
9601000	9603000	Darcy, did you run to the store to download this now?
9603000	9606000	No, I'm actually downloading another game that I saw a review for,
9606000	9610000	but I didn't understand that it was already out, called Dancing Russian Men,
9610000	9615000	by the guys that do Weebl and Bob.
9615000	9617000	The Badger Badger Mushroom Mushroom.
9617000	9619000	Oh, God, that.
9619000	9627000	And apparently, this game looks like, it plays like Vibraman.
9627000	9629000	All right.
9629000	9631000	Well, one more story for you guys,
9631000	9633000	and this will make some of our listeners very happy to hear about this,
9633000	9638000	because I know some of you out there really love your My Little Pony.
9638000	9640000	Rama, hi.
9640000	9641000	Where's Rama? Where's that guy?
9641000	9642000	Hi, Acta.
9642000	9643000	Where are my bronies at?
9643000	9644000	Put your hooves up.
9644000	9645000	Rob, by the way.
9645000	9646000	All right, what?
9646000	9647000	I actually watched some.
9647000	9648000	Did you?
9648000	9649000	And I didn't hate it.
9649000	9651000	You know what? I can't hate.
9651000	9653000	I've never watched it, but I just want to point out-
9653000	9654000	It was actually kind of funny.
9654000	9657000	I don't smoke weed either, but I don't have a problem with people that do.
9657000	9660000	Anyway, my real point.
9660000	9664000	Main Six is the group that made the My Little Pony fighting game.
9664000	9668000	My Little Pony fighting is magic, which, what happened?
9668000	9669000	This whole thing went back and forth.
9669000	9671000	Didn't they get cease and desisted, but then they came back,
9671000	9674000	and it was like, oh, the creator will make other things for you,
9674000	9676000	but it can't actually be a My Little Pony fighting game.
9676000	9678000	So, anyway.
9678000	9681000	Well, they have an engine they want to put to use,
9681000	9684000	but to be a pony-based game has first shut down.
9684000	9687000	Okay, so I guess here's the latest with that game.
9687000	9692000	With that game, the group went to their blog, which is at mainsix.com,
9692000	9696000	and they actually said they're going to launch a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo.
9696000	9697000	They haven't chosen what.
9697000	9701000	At some point early this year when the game development will really kick off,
9701000	9704000	and of course the game will use the Z engine,
9704000	9706000	which Skullgirls use the same engine and so forth,
9706000	9711000	and some of the- actually, it sounds like all of the characters in the game
9711000	9713000	will be created by Lauren Faust,
9713000	9716000	who made the My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic TV show,
9716000	9718000	and all those characters.
9718000	9723000	And obviously My Little Pony, they do conventions and shit for this,
9723000	9727000	so I don't see any way that they won't make their funding.
9727000	9730000	The sky's the limit for this thing, so there you go.
9730000	9734000	We're trying to raise $420,000 to make this happen.
9734000	9736000	No, I don't know what the amount is.
9736000	9738000	All right.
9738000	9740000	Anyhow, so there it is.
9740000	9742000	That is that.
9742000	9743000	That's it.
9743000	9745000	Let's open up the Skype line, you guys.
9745000	9749000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9749000	9750000	That's all one word.
9750000	9754000	Now, I'm trying the new thing with the Skype line that we started last week,
9754000	9757000	so I'm hoping it works okay.
9757000	9758000	But we'll see.
9758000	9761000	Your call's hopefully coming in very soon, 1-877-GAME-OLR,
9761000	9763000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9763000	9768000	Oh, we are getting a call, so let's go to the phones and take that call,
9768000	9770000	and let's get to it.
9770000	9771000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9771000	9772000	Who's this?
9772000	9773000	Hey, this is Def.
9773000	9776000	Oh, my God, video.
9776000	9778000	Are you just saying that because last week I ragged you because you called in
9778000	9780000	and you didn't even say anything about the new video
9780000	9782000	we had going during the calls?
9782000	9784000	Yeah, kind of.
9784000	9786000	My first thought when I saw the video was,
9786000	9790000	oh, my God, I got to set my video so you can see me too.
9790000	9791000	There we go.
9791000	9795000	And forgot about telling or at least saying something, but okay.
9795000	9798000	Which makes for great radio when we talk about all this video.
9798000	9801000	But seriously, though, what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9801000	9809000	Well, I was going to mention a mini-review of a game you talked about
9809000	9811000	or at least received in a Twitter topic.
9811000	9812000	Yeah?
9812000	9814000	That is Bike Rider DX.
9814000	9817000	Don't know if any of you got it or buy it.
9817000	9821000	The very last, one of the last news articles from last week
9821000	9823000	about it being the most downloaded game in Japan,
9823000	9825000	that said it looks trials-like on the 3DS.
9825000	9830000	You know, I will say this, that tweet that Aaron sent us,
9830000	9832000	YYRC, oh, maybe I shouldn't have said his real name, sorry,
9832000	9836000	but the tweet that he sent us actually got retweeted
9836000	9838000	by the people that made that game.
9838000	9840000	And, like, yeah, I was getting the emails on that, like,
9840000	9842000	because, you know, a tweet you were mentioned in was retweeted.
9842000	9845000	And so, yeah, that was kind of, I thought that was really cool
9845000	9847000	that his tweet got acknowledged.
9847000	9849000	So you actually downloaded the game and checked it out.
9849000	9854000	Yeah, I had some extra money on the eShop, so I got it.
9854000	9858000	And it's a pretty fun game.
9858000	9863000	Not that challenging and not that different all around.
9863000	9866000	It's basically the same game throughout all the levels.
9866000	9871000	It gets kind of difficult later on, but not that much challenging.
9871000	9873000	It's a pretty simple game.
9873000	9874000	But it's really fun.
9874000	9876000	For the $3, it's worth it.
9876000	9880000	I think it's a must-buy for the 3DS.
9880000	9881000	There you go.
9881000	9883000	And it has really great music, too.
9883000	9884000	The value is all there.
9884000	9887000	And so this is something you can get on the North American.
9887000	9888000	Because that was one thing.
9888000	9890000	When I saw that, I was like, oh, but I can't get the Japanese.
9890000	9892000	But it is available in the North American store.
9892000	9893000	It is.
9893000	9896000	I don't remember if I linked it in the description of last week's YouTube video
9896000	9901000	because YouTube doesn't let you link to any arbitrary URL and annotations.
9901000	9905000	But I'll double check and make sure that it's in the episode description.
9905000	9907000	More YouTube fuckery. Get out.
9907000	9908000	No, I can see.
9908000	9911000	There's a lot of dumb shit on those YouTube annotations.
9912000	9914000	Yeah, it sucks. Anyway.
9914000	9918000	Well, like I was saying, it's a pretty fun game.
9918000	9925000	So if you have $3 to spare for the eShop, it's a pretty fun, simple game.
9925000	9927000	I got it on Friday.
9927000	9929000	I almost beat it all.
9929000	9932000	It's, I think, 15 levels.
9932000	9937000	And each level has five different stages.
9937000	9941000	And I have almost beaten it.
9941000	9942000	That's right.
9942000	9946000	I have like two different levels missing.
9946000	9951000	And there's also Grand Prix mode that it's like an endless mode.
9951000	9956000	And that's pretty much where the replayability comes into play.
9956000	9960000	Because it's endless and you have many obstacles to dodge
9960000	9963000	and all that stuff that makes the game fun.
9963000	9965000	All right. I think you've got me pretty convinced.
9965000	9967000	I've got some Nintendo stuff to check out.
9967000	9968000	I have to check out that.
9968000	9970000	And I have to check out Dr. Luigi, which came out this week.
9970000	9972000	And I have yet to play that either.
9972000	9974000	I forgot that that game was coming out.
9974000	9976000	But yeah, that came out the past couple days.
9976000	9980000	So I noticed, just before I let you go, I noticed the story that I just did.
9980000	9982000	Because I know you're a brony.
9982000	9984000	Where's your hooves at?
9984000	9987000	I actually have my brony sister going on.
9987000	9989000	Of course you do.
9989000	9992000	Now, you tweeted us that story right before I read it.
9992000	9994000	This is just a funny coincidence.
9994000	9996000	The fighting is magic, Mane6.
9996000	9997000	Are you looking forward to this?
9997000	10001000	Is there something you'd like to add or clarify on what I talked about?
10001000	10007000	Well, if people know me and have listened to OR before
10007000	10012000	and listened to my calls and everything like that,
10012000	10015000	yeah, I'm pretty excited about this.
10015000	10020000	And I even tweeted to Mane6 that they have my full support.
10020000	10023000	And they tweeted me back, thanks.
10023000	10027000	And hopefully, and like I was saying last week,
10027000	10032000	hopefully their game is going to be popular and it's going to get a lot of support,
10032000	10034000	especially because of the bronies, the bronies.
10034000	10037000	The bronies are a force to be reckoned with.
10037000	10040000	They will get that game funded, I know it.
10040000	10041000	Yeah.
10041000	10043000	Alright. Well, act after I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
10043000	10045000	Thanks so much for the call.
10045000	10046000	Thank you for having me.
10046000	10048000	You're welcome. Good to see you.
10048000	10051000	Alright, take care, buddy.
10051000	10052000	Bye.
10052000	10053000	Ah, that's fun.
10053000	10055000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR.
10055000	10058000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word,
10058000	10059000	if you'd like to give us a call.
10059000	10061000	Did you notice his microphone?
10061000	10062000	No, I didn't.
10062000	10066000	It was a handheld K-Rev rock band microphone.
10066000	10067000	Oh, was it K-Rev?
10067000	10068000	I thought it was a rock band.
10068000	10070000	That style, meaning it wasn't like a headset,
10070000	10074000	but it was a, I love the fact that those things are dual purpose like that.
10074000	10075000	Like a USB mic type of thing.
10075000	10076000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10076000	10077000	Just handheld like us.
10077000	10078000	Alright.
10078000	10081000	While I wait for some more calls to come in, if anybody else is going to call in again,
10081000	10083000	that's 187, you don't have to send us a video.
10083000	10085000	If you're shy, that's fine.
10085000	10088000	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,
10088000	10090000	if you want to give us a call and talk about whatever.
10090000	10092000	Call us.
10092000	10094000	Loki, do you have last minute stories you want to talk about?
10094000	10103000	Real quick, I was going to mention that Nintendo has apparently lost a patent lawsuit,
10103000	10106000	and it was against a company called Tomita.
10106000	10113000	And this is for a patent for, I guess, some of the camera technology that's used in the 3DS.
10113000	10118000	They now have to pay 1.82% of the wholesale price on every 3DS sold.
10118000	10122000	Alright, we got another call coming in here, so let's go to it.
10122000	10123000	We're going to go to the phones.
10123000	10125000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10125000	10127000	Hey, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto.
10127000	10128000	Hey, Kaijuto, how you doing?
10128000	10130000	I'm alright.
10130000	10132000	I just want to give you guys some quick advice.
10132000	10135000	You guys were talking about the, well, what the hell do you call it?
10135000	10139000	The maiden name, what the hell is that called again?
10139000	10144000	When you forget your password.
10144000	10149000	Oh, the what?
10149000	10151000	I forgot, what is it again?
10151000	10152000	The porn name game?
10152000	10153000	I totally forgot, I'm drawing a blank.
10153000	10154000	What is it called?
10154000	10155000	The porn name game?
10155000	10157000	No, not the porn name.
10157000	10159000	You know, when, yeah, your security question.
10159000	10160000	Oh.
10160000	10162000	Yeah, okay, that thing.
10162000	10167000	Did anybody ever stop to think that you don't actually have to put any type of name, you
10167000	10171000	could just put like a series of just like random letters and numbers and codes like
10171000	10172000	a password, that's what I do.
10172000	10173000	You really could.
10173000	10178000	I never put like maiden names or street addresses or anything like that, I'm like, they don't,
10178000	10180000	you know, you don't need to put that in there.
10180000	10184000	I would be afraid that I would lose that, like that I would put in like the dummy information,
10184000	10188000	I would lose that, but if I had like an ultra safe way to keep that information, I think
10188000	10189000	that's a brilliant idea.
10189000	10193000	Like the whole, like my made up story about me.
10193000	10195000	This is the fake street I grew up on.
10195000	10198000	This is my mom's fake maiden name and just like going down the list, I think would be
10198000	10202000	actually like a pretty brilliant thing just as long as, see, my forgetful ass would lose
10202000	10205000	it, wouldn't it, Jason?
10205000	10209000	Yeah, like I wouldn't, yeah, like I wouldn't recommend it for like, you know, like any
10209000	10214000	type of credit card account, like nothing major like that, but like for video games.
10214000	10220000	What I do is, is after I have the questions in, I take a screenshot and I print that out
10220000	10224000	and I just put that in with the game, you know, like it's a PC game, you know, and I
10224000	10227000	have all my questions there with all my random letters and numbers.
10227000	10228000	That's smart.
10228000	10229000	That's how I do it.
10229000	10231000	You know, and I suppose I should say that at some point too, because I've heard of these
10231000	10234000	applications and Jason, you're, you're, you're a bigger nerd than me when it comes to stuff
10234000	10235000	like this.
10235000	10236000	Surely you've heard of this stuff before.
10236000	10239000	There's these applications out there that a lot, like it's like a wallet type of thing,
10239000	10243000	like that you store on your drive where it's like one password, but that one password generally
10243000	10248000	one password generates other passwords for whatever sites that is actually a prominent
10248000	10250000	name of one of those applications called one password.
10250000	10251000	Oh, there you go.
10251000	10253000	I just gave somebody a free plug.
10253000	10254000	There you go.
10254000	10257000	They have agile, agile bits, I believe is the company that produces one password.
10257000	10262000	I think I have a friend that works for one of those companies, but it's on mobile.
10262000	10266000	Um, the only the I've heard of a lot of them, you know, they're, they've been a dime a dozen
10266000	10270000	for years and years, and unfortunately some of them masquerade as the problems themselves
10270000	10271000	malware.
10271000	10272000	That's scary.
10272000	10277000	Um, but the big two that I hear about constantly are one password and last pass.
10277000	10279000	I, okay.
10279000	10282000	Yeah, I don't, I don't necessarily trust those.
10282000	10285000	Like, uh, you know, I just rounded have, I don't know.
10285000	10288000	I'm the type of person I'd like to have different passwords for everything.
10288000	10291000	You know, I'm just all over the place and I try to keep track of them.
10291000	10295000	I usually forget them and I always have to go back and like reset them, but I'm like,
10295000	10296000	I don't care.
10296000	10299000	I think it's a great idea and uh, I don't blame you whatsoever.
10299000	10304000	And I, I think, I think this is good to talk about ID alternatives and, and all these
10304000	10308000	things that people can do to, to make sure that their accounts stay safe, uh, quickly
10308000	10311000	because, you know, before I let you go, what else have you been playing lately?
10311000	10312000	What games you've been into?
10312000	10314000	Uh, I've been playing everything.
10314000	10317000	I was wanting to mention to you guys, um, there's a game that I started.
10317000	10321000	It's um, it's kinda like, I hate the game Terraria, but I can only compare it to Terraria.
10321000	10326000	I actually don't like that game, but, um, it's a game called Starbound, which has a
10326000	10327000	lot of potential to it.
10327000	10330000	It's one of the, um, what the hell do you call it?
10330000	10333000	The steam early access things.
10333000	10334000	And it's pretty much almost done.
10334000	10336000	It's like in beta mode right now.
10336000	10338000	And, um, you start off in the spaceship.
10338000	10339000	It's, it's 2D.
10339000	10343000	It's basically, it's Minecraft and 2D, but you're like flying through space and there's
10343000	10345000	like all these different planets that you can travel to.
10345000	10347000	Some of them have life in it.
10347000	10348000	Some of the life is hostile.
10348000	10349000	Some of the life is friendly.
10349000	10353000	It's a really cool game, but, um, it gets a little hard and you get a little burned
10353000	10354000	out on it.
10354000	10358000	And because it's an early access, there's a, you know, there's a few, like, um, a few
10358000	10362000	times it'll like crash on you to do like weird stuff, but, um, it definitely looks like it
10362000	10363000	has a lot of potential.
10363000	10367000	I hope, I hope that they able to like implement everything that they, uh, that they're talking
10367000	10368000	about here.
10368000	10369000	Cause they're talking about space battle.
10369000	10373000	They're talking about, you know, they, they're thinking big with this game and I'm just like,
10373000	10377000	I hope they can pull that off because, uh, there was an app that I was really excited
10377000	10379000	about called Star Command.
10379000	10380000	You guys heard about that game?
10381000	10385000	Well, Star Command, uh, real short is it was an app where, you know, these guys are like,
10385000	10387000	oh, we're going to make this thing like Star Trek.
10387000	10388000	We're going to have diplomacy.
10388000	10392000	You're going to be able to like travel to different planets and you know, basically
10392000	10394000	you're going to live out your life as a Starship captain.
10394000	10398000	You know, you're going to like go to planets and interact with people and you know, just
10398000	10400000	like Starbound, some of them are going to be friendly.
10400000	10402000	Some of them are going to be mean.
10402000	10407000	And, um, they got about 35% of that game done and they decided to release it.
10407000	10409000	You know, it's good.
10409000	10410000	I got it.
10410000	10412000	I just got to say, I wasn't super into Terraria either.
10412000	10413000	I can, I, I'm not knocking the game.
10413000	10414000	I see why people are into it.
10414000	10418000	I just couldn't really get into it myself, but Minecraft took me a while to, to wise
10418000	10420000	up to, but I love the idea of a 2d Minecraft.
10420000	10422000	So I'm going to have to check this game out myself.
10422000	10423000	It looks pretty cool.
10423000	10424000	Yeah.
10424000	10428000	One of the things I noticed real quickly, you might be like me and what, what I hate
10428000	10432000	about Terraria and what I love about Minecraft is there's slow down points in Minecraft and
10432000	10436000	Terraria is just all this hectic shit and you're constantly jumping over shit and shit
10436000	10437000	is coming after you.
10437000	10438000	And that drives me crazy.
10438000	10443000	That's one of the reasons why I didn't like, um, comparing, uh, what the hell is that game
10443000	10445000	with the, uh, it came out for, I think it came out for Xbox.
10445000	10449000	I think it was like, um, where you were like an alien and you were fighting the military.
10449000	10451000	It's supposed to be like open world.
10451000	10453000	You know what I'm talking about?
10453000	10455000	Where like you, you morphed into different guys.
10455000	10456000	Like you can take their body.
10456000	10458000	Are you thinking of Destroy All Humans?
10458000	10459000	What is it called?
10459000	10460000	Destroy All Humans?
10460000	10461000	No, no.
10461000	10465000	It was, it came out at the same time as a Sony superhero game.
10466000	10472000	Where you have like the electricity, somebody came out, you know, I noticed about that game,
10472000	10476000	uh, the two differences again between prototype is the slow down point.
10476000	10480000	You know, when you get older as a gamer, you kind of appreciate those slow down moments.
10480000	10483000	You know, you don't want to Loki's thinking the game was prototype.
10483000	10484000	That's it.
10484000	10485000	Yeah.
10485000	10486000	Prototype prototype was just constant.
10486000	10488000	They're just constantly shooting at you.
10488000	10490000	There's no break point, you know?
10490000	10491000	Gotcha.
10491000	10492000	And that's what I hate about Terraria.
10492000	10493000	And that's all.
10493000	10494000	All right.
10494000	10495000	Thank you so much for the call.
10495000	10496000	You take care.
10496000	10497000	Okay.
10497000	10500000	Thanks for the tip on the game.
10500000	10501000	All right.
10501000	10505000	That is going to do it for the Skype line because Dark Soccer, you got a thing that
10505000	10506000	you got to go, right?
10506000	10507000	So we got to wrap up the show.
10507000	10508000	Yeah.
10508000	10511000	My husband and I were supposed to have a date after the show and I was going to text him
10511000	10512000	when we were done.
10512000	10513000	Oops.
10513000	10515000	And he's like, um, I'm already at Cheesecake Factory.
10515000	10516000	Oops.
10516000	10517000	So.
10517000	10518000	All right.
10518000	10519000	Well now if you want to meet Jamie after the show, you know where to go.
10519000	10520000	Yeah.
10520000	10521000	And I'm not paying for you guys.
10521000	10522000	So there you go.
10523000	10524000	I didn't say which Cheesecake Factory.
10524000	10525000	There you go.
10525000	10526000	That's right.
10526000	10527000	There's a ton in the world.
10527000	10528000	All right.
10528000	10529000	Quickly, quickly.
10529000	10532000	I just want to do some tweets here before we wrap up and Jamie don't leave because I
10532000	10534000	have something I got to give you two.
10534000	10535000	Um, let's see.
10535000	10537000	Uh, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter.
10537000	10542000	Um, I know I saw our old pal who was on the show a while ago.
10542000	10547000	Oscar had tweeted and said, I'm currently tuned into OLR and that just reminded me to
10547000	10550000	say, I think I might've mentioned this a couple of weeks ago, but in case I didn't Oscar
10550000	10552000	is on season two of King of the nerds.
10552000	10557000	So not only was she on the Sony reality show, now she's on the TBS reality show.
10557000	10558000	Very happy for her.
10558000	10559000	Best of luck to her.
10559000	10560000	She's so fun.
10560000	10561000	Yeah, she's fun.
10561000	10563000	And uh, she's, she's a member of the OL army.
10563000	10566000	So if you don't know who to root for on this show, now you do.
10566000	10567000	Cause we endorse her.
10567000	10569000	An act of bullshit.
10569000	10570000	What?
10570000	10572000	I am not paying for you at the Cheesecake Factory.
10572000	10574000	Oh, I'm not, I'll put it this way.
10574000	10576000	I'm not even paying for me.
10576000	10577000	I have a gift card.
10577000	10578000	She's washing dishes.
10578000	10579000	Okay.
10579000	10585000	Uh, I want to give this shout out, a tweet, a shout out to a pod culture saying, uh, saw
10585000	10588000	something at a Kmart that they were pushing for the new consoles.
10588000	10592000	And my first reaction was there's a Kmart still open somewhere.
10592000	10594000	No, they're on the corner from my house.
10594000	10595000	I know they're here.
10595000	10598000	Well, you know, the one right over here on sunrise closed now.
10598000	10601000	So, but, uh, yeah, let's see.
10601000	10605000	It's a rent to own program, I guess is something that Kmart is starting.
10605000	10608000	And this is something that you could do for the new consoles if you want.
10608000	10611000	So they're being ghetto, like Renison or pass, I guess.
10611000	10613000	But you know what, Hey, you know what?
10613000	10615000	I just see it as there.
10615000	10619000	They got to do something that target and Walmart aren't doing because what they're doing right
10619000	10620000	now isn't working.
10620000	10623000	So, well, they are doing something that target and Walmart aren't doing.
10623000	10624000	They're failing.
10624000	10627000	Unfortunately, there've been a lot of programs like this that I've been seeing lately.
10627000	10629000	There was one from Best Buy recently.
10629000	10633000	There was basically like, you know, pay a little bit and be able to upgrade early.
10633000	10638000	It all revolved around tablets and mobile phones, smartphones, and probably TVs and
10638000	10639000	whatnot as well.
10639000	10641000	These programs are all bullshit.
10641000	10647000	And don't, don't do the research, find out how much money you're going to spend.
10647000	10650000	Weigh that against what you can be smart with your money.
10650000	10655000	The problem with rent to own like that too, is that you have to deal with investing in
10655000	10657000	repo people and people don't pay.
10657000	10659000	Ooh, what a mess.
10659000	10660000	All right.
10660000	10661000	We are going to wrap things up and get final thoughts.
10661000	10663000	I do have one other thing I got to get out here, Dark Sakura.
10663000	10664000	Fist?
10664000	10665000	Yes.
10665000	10666000	I'm going to punch you with it.
10666000	10667000	No.
10667000	10671000	Uh, this is, um, something that apparently you had expressed a desire in having.
10671000	10675000	And so, um, our friend of the show who was here about a year ago, Tim, Tim trip, wanted
10675000	10677000	me to pass this on to you.
10677000	10678000	Awesome.
10678000	10679000	I just opened it.
10679000	10681000	There's a DS cart in there.
10681000	10682000	It's my Japanese coach.
10682000	10683000	There you go.
10683000	10684000	Cause I've been wanting to practice.
10684000	10685000	Yeah.
10685000	10686000	The only thing.
10686000	10688000	And of course my forgetful ass forgot to give it to her.
10688000	10689000	So.
10689000	10690000	Thank you, Tim.
10690000	10691000	It's interesting.
10691000	10692000	Cause he texted me going, did you give her that game?
10692000	10693000	Thank you, Tim.
10693000	10694000	All right.
10694000	10695000	So there you go.
10695000	10696000	Thanks.
10696000	10697000	We need to hang out again soon.
10697000	10698000	All right.
10698000	10701000	Now we got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap up.
10701000	10702000	Uh, Loki.
10702000	10705000	Uh, thank you for being here tonight and good luck with everything.
10705000	10707000	Especially if the baby should arrive this week.
10707000	10708000	Best of luck to you.
10708000	10709000	Oh yeah.
10709000	10710000	I'll need it.
10710000	10711000	All right.
10711000	10712000	Sounds good.
10712000	10714000	Uh, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10714000	10715000	Go play the Minecraft server.
10715000	10716000	That's right.
10716000	10717000	Go play the Minecraft server.
10717000	10719000	We have two people already on there right now.
10719000	10721000	I'm spying on them.
10721000	10722000	You're spying on them.
10722000	10723000	That's awesome.
10723000	10725000	Uh, my final thought, I have two final thoughts tonight.
10725000	10727000	My first final thought is don't fuck with my house.
10727000	10729000	My second in Minecraft.
10729000	10730000	Well, in real life too.
10730000	10731000	You shouldn't do that.
10731000	10732000	Don't fuck with my Normandy.
10732000	10733000	Just, yeah.
10733000	10735000	Don't, don't fuck with me in general.
10735000	10740000	And my number two final thought is, uh, I need more people to play Path of Exile with.
10740000	10741000	So, uh, if you want to go.
10741000	10742000	It's Windows only.
10742000	10743000	I wanted to try it out.
10743000	10744000	Ah, bummer.
10744000	10745000	I didn't realize that.
10745000	10746000	And it's free to play.
10746000	10747000	It's free to play.
10747000	10751000	So if you want to come play a roguelike and crawl some dungeons with me, uh, let's, let's
10751000	10752000	play that.
10752000	10753000	Uh, hit me up on Twitter.
10753000	10754000	Hit me up on my Twitter.
10754000	10757000	Uh, Jason, thank you for being here as always.
10757000	10758000	Always.
10758000	10759000	You, you the best.
10759000	10760000	I the best.
10760000	10761000	You the best.
10761000	10762000	You are.
10762000	10763000	You really are.
10763000	10765000	Uh, your final thought for our listeners tonight.
10765000	10766000	Be safe people.
10766000	10769000	New year, new, uh, new wonderment and also new problems.
10769000	10771000	So be safe and play it smart out there.
10771000	10772000	Alright.
10773000	10777000	And, uh, lastly, but not leastly, uh, heading out to the cheesecake factory, which she'll
10777000	10780000	be signing autographs from 10 to 11 tonight.
10780000	10782000	Uh, two things.
10782000	10786000	One, I think it's hilarious that Shane just joined the chat room.
10786000	10788000	And number two, why is that hilarious?
10788000	10789000	He does listen to the show.
10789000	10791000	Well, yeah, but we're about to end the show.
10791000	10792000	Oh, cause we're ending the show.
10792000	10795000	No, he came in to send me a private message yelling at me about something.
10795000	10796000	That's usually how it goes.
10796000	10799000	Number two, I'm having cheesecake.
10799000	10801000	Sakura out.
10801000	10803000	Alright, that does it for another episode of orange launch radio.
10803000	10805000	Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show.
10805000	10810000	If you liked what you heard over the past few hours, don't forget guys support independent radio.
10810000	10813000	Um, we need, we need your help.
10813000	10817000	Word of mouth is all we've got because I'll tell you what, the major podcast award shows
10817000	10823000	out there, they ain't doing shit for us cause it's always some big show that's got tons
10823000	10827000	of advertising bucks and websites with millions of visitors.
10827000	10829000	They, they sweep everything.
10829000	10833000	So we should start our own award series called Indies rule.
10833000	10834000	Exactly.
10834000	10839000	Or you know, if you get more than like 10 bucks of support from any or like more than
10839000	10844000	a certain amount of support from a major facility, then you're disqualified.
10844000	10847000	Just just spread the word about your favorite indie show.
10847000	10852000	Be it us, be it, you know, some other, be it Bobby black Wolf show or pod culture, maybe
10852000	10856000	another show on bug, maybe another show on another network, maybe, maybe radio PlayStation
10856000	10858000	who sent us a tweet tonight.
10858000	10860000	My favorite show is anime jam session.
10860000	10865000	So go spread the love about your favorite independent broadcasting and uh, you know
10865000	10870000	what, if you think you want to do this yourself someday, I don't see you as competition.
10870000	10872000	I see you as a friend.
10872000	10873000	Let's help you podcast.
10873000	10874000	Get your word out there.
10874000	10878000	Have, have your voice and uh, just don't be a dick about it.
10878000	10880000	Don't fucking swat people.
10880000	10881000	Don't eat my cheesecake.
10881000	10883000	And don't eat my cheesecake.
10883000	10884000	Good night everybody.
