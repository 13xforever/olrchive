0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	It's a new year of growth, despite what the pundits are saying all about Nintendo.
17000	20000	New games are being created by the people we love, and new services are expanding their horizons,
20000	23000	and new updates are available to amuse and entertain us.
23000	27000	Join us for all the details on this episode of the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	35000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show,
35000	37000	where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this January the 19th of 2014, episode number 536 of our show.
45000	49000	Our program, about three hours or so, give or take like an hour,
49000	54000	dedicated to all things video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
54000	58000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week, and welcome back to the show this week.
58000	61000	Say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
61000	62000	Hello.
62000	63000	How are you doing?
63000	66000	As I said, Husky.
66000	67000	Husky, yes.
67000	69000	I'm about to take a cough drop for my Husky cough.
69000	73000	As she was telling me before the show tonight, not during the first take,
73000	76000	where maybe her mic wasn't on that I had to cut out.
76000	79000	I would never make a big mistake like that. I'm a professional.
79000	81000	Rob is a flawless goddess.
81000	83000	That's right, don't you forget it.
83000	86000	Anyway, so yes, you have a bit of the Kathleen Turner thing going on with your voice tonight.
86000	90000	Yeah, I was telling my friend, who I'm Tumblr pals with,
90000	97000	that I either sound like a 13-year-old boy or like a sex phone worker.
97000	101000	So, I can say, you know, what are you wearing?
101000	102000	And have it sound hot.
102000	106000	Other than like, bitch, I don't care what you're wearing.
106000	111000	Can we get you to say just once for the listeners, I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way?
111000	113000	I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
113000	115000	Great, now I have a clip for the next intro.
115000	117000	Alright, also say hello.
117000	122000	By the way, what you told the chatroom, all that sucking that they can do, join in.
122000	127000	They were, every single one of them was yelling at me after the mistake of not having your mic on for a little bit.
127000	132000	Alright, anyway, let's go over to the Skype line where, believe it or not, he is here this week.
132000	136000	I didn't think he'd be here tonight, but he is. He persevered. Here he is.
136000	138000	Say hello, everybody, to Techmaster Loki.
139000	143000	He just doesn't want to come out. I don't know. He likes it in there.
143000	147000	Well, you better be careful, Loki. I didn't want to come out until I was about 20 years old.
147000	149000	So, just saying.
149000	150000	How you doing, Loki?
150000	151000	Tired.
151000	152000	Tired, I bet.
152000	157000	So, what's going on? We have a baby delay, so it's no longer going to be Martin Luther King Jr. Day baby.
157000	159000	It's going to be Tuesday baby, right?
159000	169000	Yeah, we, Josh caught a cold on Thursday or Friday, and so we're just giving him an extra day to not be sick so that the baby's not sick.
169000	173000	Makes sense. Makes sense. Completely understandable. Makes fair.
173000	178000	That was like, I just totally did that thing from Mean Girls where the guy goes, gruel.
178000	181000	I meant to say great, and I thought cool, and it came out as gruel.
181000	186000	I did that whole sounds fair and makes sense. It makes fair. It makes fair.
187000	192000	I'm broken tonight. You know what I blame? Dark Sakura comes back to the show tonight.
192000	193000	Don't blame me.
193000	195000	You know, she was off last week. No, I'm going to blame you for this.
195000	199000	And she brings with her, what does she bring? She brings a flask because that's how she rolls.
199000	203000	And in that flask, she's like, I made my own liquor. Check that out.
203000	212000	To elaborate, I have this hobby lately that's infusing vodkas with different flavors.
212000	214000	And what a hobby.
214000	215000	And I did.
215000	218000	You know, some people crochet. I do that too.
219000	221000	I'm totally into hooking.
224000	226000	You've seen what I've made. Anyway.
226000	231000	You should totally infuse vodka with the flavor of vodka. You can call it yo dog.
232000	234000	That's a good one. That's a good one. No.
234000	240000	I did two batches. One was infusing a dark chocolate bar, and the other one was infusing coffee.
240000	242000	Right. Because you know me and coffee.
242000	245000	And I finally ended up mixing the two together, and it's so good.
245000	247000	It is pretty good. It's like mochas.
247000	252000	It is. It's mocha vodka. And I only use potato vodka because I hate grain vodka.
252000	256000	It just tastes not like vodka to me, you know? So I use potato vodka.
256000	260000	And also with the extra filtering, it comes out a little bit higher grade than when it started.
260000	261000	Right.
261000	266000	So I brought a flask over to share with some of my favorite dudes.
266000	269000	Well, always drink responsibly, kids. It's very important.
269000	272000	Unless you're me, you put it in your coffee, and then you drive for the show.
272000	274000	An hour later, an hour later.
274000	278000	Here with us tonight, who is drinking Mountain Dew Code Red,
278000	281000	because he's got to drive back to San Francisco a little later on.
281000	283000	So that's his hard course he's going to get tonight.
283000	285000	Say hello, everybody, to Jason.
285000	288000	Have to drive back to San Francisco on about two to three hours of sleep.
288000	291000	Did they win that game? Alan told me they were winning that game.
291000	293000	Broncos won. I haven't revisited 49ers game yet.
293000	297000	So as much as I don't really always bring up sports ball on the show,
297000	299000	and to be fair, I don't like to talk about award shows either,
299000	301000	because every single one of them gets in the way on Sunday nights.
301000	304000	Not that you're scorned or anything.
304000	309000	If they won the game, we may have to get out the inflatable bed.
309000	314000	Ooh. Yeah, I may not be able to make it back over that bridge back into San Francisco tonight.
314000	317000	They may have actually burned it down, Jason. You might be.
317000	320000	I will be checking the news legitimately before I go back tonight,
320000	324000	because if we win, we riot. If we lose, we riot.
324000	326000	So, you know, something's going down tonight.
326000	329000	I do have a spare bed. Just saying.
329000	332000	Wait, wait, wait. You're talking the Raiders or the Niners?
332000	337000	Niners. Raiders didn't make playoffs. This is a playoff championship.
337000	341000	Well, they'll still riot anyways. You know, they'll riot by proxy.
341000	344000	Loki, there doesn't need to be a contingency plan, because the Raiders never win anything.
344000	346000	We all understand that.
346000	349000	I understand that, but, you know, they want to get in on the rioting.
349000	355000	Not to mention I don't technically drive into Oakland, so I just skirt the danger zone.
355000	358000	You just clip by. You just clip by.
358000	362000	All right, Alan says right now it's 20 to 17 Seattle.
362000	365000	It is 20 to 17 Seahawks. Ten minutes to go in the fourth.
365000	367000	He might get a losing riot. You're right, that would actually be worse,
367000	371000	because a winning riot, people still have to save their energy for Super Bowl Sunday,
371000	374000	but a losing riot, they're going to get it all out tonight.
374000	378000	You know what kind of riot I'm having? A laugh riot.
378000	380000	Cough riot, actually.
380000	385000	You know, if only a certain game company would just let all their assets ride on the Seahawks.
385000	387000	You're doing okay.
387000	390000	Look, look, look. Bonds006 in the chat says,
390000	393000	The reason I am here is to avoid football. All right, look, I understand.
393000	396000	Except for Tecmo Super Bowl. That's the one exception we grant.
396000	401000	Yes, Tecmo Super Bowl. Super High Impact would be an exception as well.
401000	402000	NFL Blitz.
402000	405000	Yeah, NFL Blitz is acceptable too. All that would be just fine.
405000	408000	So, getting things back on course, if her voice drops anymore,
408000	410000	she's going to be rivaling my job all of a sudden.
410000	412000	I know, right? She'll have to do the intro.
412000	414000	You're listening to Orange On's radio.
414000	418000	Too bad I just did that intro for Hoard House a week ago.
418000	420000	You would have been perfect for that. Oh well.
420000	421000	Anyway.
421000	423000	Except a week ago I had no voice.
423000	425000	I thought you said you liked mine.
425000	428000	I do, I do. But you do all the intros.
428000	432000	I don't have a problem with that. You used to do all the intros.
432000	435000	To register participation for Orange On's radio.
435000	440000	Wait, wait, don't throw them off. I should plug that real quick while I have a chance.
440000	442000	Then we'll get into our kickoff topic.
442000	445000	But, you know, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
445000	448000	at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
448000	452000	And that's right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, which is another great show about gaming here on the network.
452000	455000	And lots of great geek programming throughout the week at vognetwork.com.
455000	459000	But one thing that makes us kind of unique is that you can actually check into the shows.
459000	462000	So if you're actually listening live tonight, head over to vognetwork.com.
462000	467000	You can actually click the little link, check in, you get five VoG points for checking into the site.
467000	471000	But if you are listening in the podcast, you still get a chance to get those points.
471000	476000	Because somewhere during the show, we're going to have a little, you'll hear a little noise.
476000	479000	It goes doo doo doo doo doo doo. And then it says to register participation, you get a keyword.
479000	484000	So you take that word, you go put it in the front page of vognetwork.com and it's just like you were listening live.
484000	487000	So for example, what if the keyword was vagina?
487000	488000	Yes, if the keyword was vagina.
488000	491000	You would type in vagina on the check-in site.
491000	493000	Yes, that's exactly how it works.
493000	495000	But it's never anything as sexy as vagina.
495000	496000	It isn't.
496000	498000	We did have ball last week.
498000	500000	We did have ball one week. Yes, we did.
500000	503000	Which we can say now because if you use that word now, it ain't going to do shit.
503000	504000	It has indeed expired.
504000	508000	I just want to know the day we get dongle because I want to record that shit.
508000	511000	Okay, but here's the good news. Here's the good news.
511000	517000	If you check into the shows, whether it be live, whether it be on tape or whatever it is,
517000	522000	if you check into the shows, then you are eligible for the raffle.
522000	524000	Now, it's an opt-in raffle.
524000	530000	You're not automatically entered because we don't believe in, unlike Google, we don't automatically opt people into things.
530000	532000	You have to elect.
532000	534000	Yes, so if you go to vognetwork.com, you can actually enter the raffle.
534000	540000	This month, we're actually giving away a three-month subscription to either Netflix Instant Streaming or Hulu Plus.
540000	545000	What a great little way to enhance your game console by catching up on whatever TV show you want to watch.
545000	550000	You can watch Scandal on Hulu Plus, you can watch Doctor Who on Netflix, whatever you want to do.
550000	554000	Orange is the New Black or any other myriad of entertaining original shows.
554000	556000	You choose, but it's got to be one of the two.
556000	560000	Last month, things got crazy because we gave away a gift card and everybody was like,
560000	562000	well, can we get a gift card for Google Play?
562000	564000	Okay, okay, look.
564000	566000	I want a gift card for Macy's.
566000	569000	Maybe next month. Here's the catch.
569000	573000	Sadly, it's U.S. residents only and I'm very sorry to the folks overseas.
573000	575000	We're not purposely trying to screw you guys.
575000	581000	The problem is that we're not allowed to buy here in the U.S. the codes for you guys overseas.
581000	583000	It's ridiculous, but it is what it is.
583000	586000	Hopefully, in future months, we will have more inclusive raffles.
586000	589000	Last month, I think we tried to do one all-inclusive.
589000	592000	I am not making the moon noise from Sherlock.
592000	596000	So I can't get a three-month subscription for like browsers or something like that?
596000	599000	No, you get Netflix or you get Hulu Plus.
599000	601000	You get A or B.
601000	605000	But the other good news is that you might be like, I already have both of them or I already have one.
605000	607000	You can actually use the code to just...
607000	609000	It's on us for three months.
609000	611000	It'll be on us for three months. That'll be really cool.
611000	613000	So that's one less thing out of your pocket.
613000	616000	You can use the money to buy, I don't know, like a $20 download game or something.
616000	617000	Here you go.
617000	619000	And if you don't win the raffle, you lose!
619000	621000	You get nothing! Good day, sir!
621000	624000	No, you get loot at vognetwork.com.
624000	626000	And what does the loot do?
626000	628000	It increases your EP.
628000	629000	What does the loot say?
629000	630000	One little bit.
630000	631000	Shut up.
631000	632000	Nothing. It's loot.
632000	634000	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
634000	635000	Let's move on.
635000	639000	We got to get into tonight's kickoff topic because some people are here wanting to hear...
639000	642000	Bonz006 tuned in because he wanted to hear video game chat.
642000	644000	He didn't want to hear football.
644000	648000	He didn't want to hear me talking about Netflix and Hulu Plus.
648000	652000	Live.vognetwork.com where you can have a voice as we talk about video games.
652000	657000	Jamie going to start us off tonight with quite the whopper of a story that's making its way around the internet tonight.
657000	666000	Yeah, and there is talk about the particular situation that Nintendo is in.
666000	672000	Especially in regards to their big leading console, the Wii U.
672000	682000	And it seems that the Wii U has underperformed by how they had anticipated it would.
682000	689000	And they have cut their sales forecast by about 70%.
689000	691000	Is it a flop?
691000	693000	Some say yeah.
693000	695000	Nintendo doesn't think so.
695000	699000	They're not going to say, oh no, we flopped.
699000	703000	Nintendo is fine and making money.
703000	711000	We've even said they have pulled up with the 3DS.
711000	715000	They're still holding treading water.
715000	718000	So Nintendo has not flopped.
718000	720000	But what about the system?
720000	723000	Also, and very important to say, I'm so glad you bring that up.
723000	728000	Because one of the particular articles that was going around, because it was right on the front page of Yahoo and so forth.
728000	730000	I think the site was TechCrunch or something said.
730000	734000	The headline was Nintendo admits Wii U has flopped.
734000	736000	They said nothing of the sort.
736000	739000	Well, TechCrunch did, but Nintendo said nothing of the sort.
739000	741000	I take a big issue with that.
741000	745000	You can't sugar coat these sales numbers, that's not what I'm trying to do.
745000	749000	Has the Wii U flopped from an opinion perspective?
749000	752000	It's not doing as well as it should be, that's for darn sure.
752000	755000	But to say that Nintendo said it flopped?
755000	757000	No.
757000	759000	Nintendo is a stubborn motherfucker.
759000	762000	They are not going to admit that their system flopped.
762000	764000	They're going to spin these numbers.
764000	766000	They're going to talk about new strategy.
766000	768000	They're going to do whatever they can.
768000	773000	Can you imagine Reggie Fils-Aime getting out there and saying, well, we flopped.
773000	775000	No, it's not going to happen.
775000	777000	That we fucked up.
777000	779000	Sorry guys, we fucked up.
779000	782000	No, it's not going to happen at all.
782000	784000	Sound the click whore alarm.
785000	788000	I would like to disagree with Alan saying the Wii U is the new Saturn.
788000	790000	Because Saturn was a lot fucking cooler.
790000	792000	Just saying.
792000	795000	And I got something to say as well about everybody that's saying,
795000	799000	Welp, it's time for Nintendo to jump ship and make a Mario game on mobile phone.
799000	801000	Nope.
801000	804000	Or Nintendo is going the way of Sega.
804000	806000	Nope.
806000	811000	It took Sega a good three consoles before they were finally throwing the towel.
811000	813000	One is not going to ruin Nintendo.
814000	816000	Oh yeah?
816000	823000	Iwata is saying that they are looking into smart devices to grow, as he says, the game player business.
823000	827000	His quote is, it's not as simple as enabling Mario to move on a smart phone.
827000	832000	Of course, Microsoft and Sony already did look into the game player business.
832000	836000	Because they both have second screen and that's the big hoopla this year.
836000	839000	Tablet and phone second screen to the console.
839000	846000	Honestly, in my opinion, Nintendo's biggest problem right now is they just need to get out of their bunker that they're in.
846000	851000	I mean, that bunker served them very well in the era of the Wii, but it's not working out so well.
851000	856000	And I think back to the story on Eurogamer, whether you want to take it or leave it, about the development of the Wii U.
856000	861000	Where the executive said, oh we've never tried Xbox Live. Really?
861000	866000	Nothing served Nintendo well with the Wii except for Circumstance.
867000	870000	Nintendo did not make the Wii a good console.
871000	879000	Honestly. Like, am I wrong in saying that the Wii was not exactly like you think of your favorite gaming console?
879000	886000	With the one single exception of a unique control method, the Wii was not exactly outstanding when it came out.
886000	888000	I got really bored with my Wii after a week.
888000	890000	Performance, titles, and everything else.
891000	896000	Well, no, because Super Mario Galaxy would like to say hello.
896000	897000	It was not a launch title.
897000	898000	No, it wasn't a launch title.
898000	899000	It was two years into the system.
899000	900000	Yes.
900000	901000	Zelda was.
901000	903000	And it was something that buoyed up the system all those years later.
903000	906000	But, I think I've made this point a couple of times on the show.
906000	908000	Wii Fit, Jason. Wii Fit.
908000	914000	I'll do, I'll, no, no, no, I completely agree with that, but I know I've made this point a number of times.
915000	919000	The Wii was not a successful gaming device. It was not.
920000	923000	It was a exciting entertainment device.
923000	926000	It was what you lend to your in-laws so they can play bowling.
926000	934000	I, I, I kind of can't with, I can't with that comment, Jason, because it is the highest selling system of all time period.
934000	936000	That is a fact you cannot dispute.
936000	942000	Because, because people that have never bought any other console now had a reason to do so.
942000	945000	Which is where the bunker served Nintendo well.
945000	951000	No. No, that was circumstance. That was not, like, Nintendo, Nintendo makes fun, easy, accessible games.
951000	954000	That is the truth of them in their entire history.
954000	957000	Going back to card games and everything else, pre, pre-digital games.
957000	961000	The Wii was not designed to find the success that it did.
961000	968000	It's just that Wii Sports using their mantra in style was exciting and benefited so many people because of,
968000	972000	you grab a remote, you push a button, you figure out how to play and you go to it.
973000	979000	Wii Sports, especially considering that Wii Sports was the top selling game of all time, was never sold.
979000	985000	That is the very definition of a system seller, but not to the regular purchasers of consoles.
985000	996000	Like, my, my, my biggest problem, tablets for all of their excitement are not exactly the things that, that people go to because they're tablets.
996000	1002000	They go for them because they're low maintenance and you just open it up, press a button and start tapping on the screen.
1002000	1007000	People don't give a shit that the Wii U has a, has a, has a gamepad. It's worthless.
1007000	1012000	The Wii found attraction, not gaming. That's why it took off.
1012000	1018000	And if they're going to map, if they're going to chart their course, their outlook for the Wii U based off the Wii,
1018000	1021000	they're going to fail miserably and that's where we are.
1021000	1026000	But I feel like you're trying to say that we did not have great gaming experiences on it.
1026000	1027000	Oh, of course it did.
1027000	1028000	It did, yeah.
1028000	1032000	And it was unable to do so because of the runaway response it got at the start of the generation.
1032000	1034000	But Zelda was a launch title.
1034000	1035000	If, if I may interject.
1035000	1036000	Yeah, sure.
1036000	1044000	There, there is something to say though for both Microsoft and Sony biting off the concept of the Wii.
1044000	1045000	LOL move.
1045000	1049000	Yeah, with the move, which was I guess okay.
1049000	1055000	The move wasn't that bad, honestly. I think it worked a lot better than the Wii and Wii remote did.
1055000	1059000	Which technically I would say bolsters my argument a little bit more.
1059000	1064000	Sony tried the same thing and they never reached critical acclaim with it because they had nothing to attract people to use it.
1064000	1066000	Because Sony didn't know how to make a game for it.
1066000	1070000	And the Kinect I think is more of an expansion of the same thing.
1070000	1078000	It's like how, you know, people sort of reversed the, uh, the Wiimote to do like the head tracking devices and similar things.
1078000	1085000	I think that sort of, you know, and Microsoft I think has had a history of being good at taking an okay idea that's out there.
1085000	1089000	And turning it around into something that's been a little bit better.
1089000	1093000	Um, so they did what they do best.
1093000	1095000	They, they bit and made it better.
1095000	1100000	Um, as honestly as what I think the Kinect in its true essence is.
1100000	1106000	It's sort of a reverse Wiimote where you're bringing the events of the outside world in instead of just affecting what's on the inside world.
1106000	1107000	Absolutely.
1107000	1112000	I don't know. So far the, like, Kinect enabled games that are coming out at launch for the Xbox One.
1112000	1120000	So far the only ones that are actually any good were Just Dance and, you know, the exercise stuff that's on Xbox Fitness.
1120000	1127000	So once again they're stuck in that rut where those are the only games that end up working out for the Kinect.
1127000	1129000	It's just basically a big old gimmick again.
1129000	1132000	Which coincidentally were the best games on the Kinect for the 360 as well.
1132000	1136000	And I also think that the selling point of the Wii is watching Rob play Just Dance Abba.
1136000	1140000	Okay. Our chat room is blowing up as you can imagine over at live.vognetwork.com.
1140000	1143000	I've got to get some of these other voices out there with some of the feedback.
1143000	1146000	WhatupG says Nintendo went after a different audience with Wii.
1146000	1148000	Agree with that for sure.
1148000	1152000	Alan Alchemy says as awful as mandatory Kinect. Jason's shaking his head over there.
1152000	1159000	Alan Alchemy says as awful as mandatory Kinect is and Microsoft refusing to let it go, I must commend them for working hard on making the technology be something gamers want.
1159000	1161000	Not that they're doing a good job.
1161000	1166000	Sony put out the move as an obvious the Wii but hardcore accessory and then immediately forgot about it.
1166000	1168000	Let's see.
1168000	1176000	WhatupG says Zelda on Wii was made for GameCube and Tech 2030 follows it up saying I feel like Zelda was a tacked on launch title.
1176000	1178000	The game was much better on the GameCube.
1178000	1181000	Yeah it was totally a GameCube port.
1181000	1183000	Sorry Logi.
1183000	1188000	Rama says the Wii was a successful console with one hell of a gimmick that Microsoft and Sony jumped on.
1188000	1195000	Akuma JP says I'm sorry but I have to say this since I never interested in the Wii, I was born with a Wii and I still use it.
1195000	1198000	Oh I see what you did there. It's still that damn name isn't it?
1198000	1200000	It's still that damn name.
1200000	1202000	Anyhow sorry Logi go ahead and get your thought out.
1202000	1207000	Oh I was going to say even though I still don't think people want the Kinect.
1207000	1210000	To be honest I think a lot of people just don't give a shit about it.
1210000	1213000	And at least Sony kind of tried something with the move.
1213000	1216000	They supported it with a lot of their first person shooters and stuff.
1216000	1223000	The only way that they supported Kinect with anything that Microsoft did was voice commands for Halo or something like that.
1223000	1225000	Or crappy head tracking of Forza.
1225000	1227000	It just doesn't work.
1227000	1235000	That being said I've been very very polite about the fact that this article came out.
1235000	1239000	I know it's very easy for me to make all sorts of jokes.
1239000	1243000	But honestly it's not that big of a surprise that their sales numbers are down.
1243000	1247000	Because one there's just no games coming out for the system.
1247000	1252000	I mean yeah there are some first party games but third parties have pretty much jumped ship for the system.
1252000	1255000	And it's not getting any better in 2014 I can tell you that much.
1255000	1260000	So it's going to be a big struggle for them to regain some of that console market.
1260000	1267000	My opinion was I say they just stick with the handhelds because they're rocking on the 3DS.
1267000	1269000	I mean there's tons of stuff coming out there and that's a great platform.
1269000	1273000	And hey why not play both fields. You can have the first party and third party.
1273000	1276000	I'd love to see some Mario games come to other platforms.
1276000	1278000	I think that would be pretty cool.
1278000	1281000	Just a couple more comments from our chatroom at live.vognetware.com.
1281000	1286000	Bonds006 says we got the big numbers because it was sold to people who were not regular system buyers.
1286000	1287000	I agree with that.
1287000	1289000	100% that is my only point.
1289000	1296000	And the very first comment you read about Nintendo targeting a different audience for the Wii is 100% incorrect.
1297000	1306000	But Jason the only problem with that idea that it was only sold to people that didn't buy consoles in the first place is that their software tie ratio.
1306000	1308000	Because that was going to be my argument.
1308000	1311000	It's like well only people bought it for Wii Sports or something.
1311000	1316000	Their software tie ratio was not that different than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for example.
1316000	1325000	The Wii software tie ratio kind of globally was 9% or I guess 9.05 maybe not 9%.
1325000	1332000	So 9 games per system were sold on average versus the Xbox 360 which is 10 and 3 quarters.
1332000	1336000	And the PlayStation 3 was about 9 and 3 quarters.
1336000	1338000	So it's not that different.
1338000	1343000	Let me shift gears here a little bit because it's only a 3 hour show and we could have this debate all night.
1343000	1347000	But I want to get this story out because I had a little bit of a moment of clarity today.
1347000	1352000	Because I think when a lot of people talk about oh Nintendo should go mobile, Nintendo should go online.
1352000	1357000	I think there's a lot of people thinking oh Nintendo should copy Xbox Live or PlayStation Network and have something that robust.
1357000	1360000	Or Nintendo should put Mario on the iPhone and so forth.
1360000	1362000	I think that's where people's heads go.
1362000	1364000	But I don't think that's necessarily true.
1364000	1371000	And you know especially tonight I'm usually the one that will defend Nintendo in these situations and so forth.
1371000	1379000	Because I do still I think it says a lot that yes Nintendo only put out a handful of games last year for the Wii U.
1379000	1385000	But at least one of them showed up on every single person's top 10 list and usually it was multiple games that showed up there.
1385000	1391000	So you can't deny Nintendo makes the games that hardcore gamers and soccer moms alike want to play.
1391000	1394000	So that's you know something big.
1394000	1397000	But they need to get out of this bubble is the biggest problem.
1397000	1399000	And here's the moment of clarity I had today.
1399000	1401000	It's not necessarily that they need to copy Xbox Live.
1401000	1403000	It's not that they need to copy mobile phones.
1403000	1410000	Here's an example where Nintendo not going online and going mobile phones I think did them bad.
1410000	1414000	And it's not the obvious thing but these are the types of things that Nintendo has to do.
1414000	1416000	Okay out with it already.
1416000	1419000	I spent $60 on a new device today.
1419000	1423000	And it's a very hip little thing and a lot of people have them.
1423000	1425000	And it's kind of the craze right now.
1425000	1432000	And when I bought it there was a part of me that said I feel like I've bought one of these before.
1432000	1438000	Like I feel like I've had something like this before that's supposed to do the exact same thing but yet here I am buying it again.
1438000	1439000	What is it Jason?
1439000	1442000	I have three of these in my pockets on me right now.
1442000	1446000	I have a different model. I have a Fitbit.
1446000	1453000	The new iPhone 5S has a motion coprocessor so it can act as a pedometer as well with the appropriate software.
1453000	1455000	And our 3DS's.
1455000	1456000	Right so okay.
1456000	1457000	Pedometers.
1457000	1460000	Exactly they're all pedometers but here's the thing in particular about Fitbit.
1460000	1466000	And even before the 3DS integrated that whole thing as well which is another great example where Nintendo could have had this.
1466000	1469000	They could have bottled it and they didn't and that's where they failed.
1469000	1472000	It's a little too large but make your point.
1472000	1474000	Okay remember back on the Game Boy Advance.
1474000	1478000	They sold this game and it was called something like Everybody Walks or something like that.
1478000	1480000	It was on the Game Boy.
1480000	1481000	No it might have been the regular DS.
1481000	1483000	It was either the Advance or the DS.
1483000	1488000	I apologize I can't remember which off the top of my head because there wasn't exactly really a game there.
1488000	1490000	All it was was a little pedometer that you carried around.
1490000	1491000	It was the DS.
1491000	1492000	It was the DS thank you.
1492000	1494000	It was a little pedometer that you carried around in your pocket.
1494000	1499000	And at the end of the day you turn on this game and transmit the data from the pedometer into the little system.
1499000	1503000	And you can track the number of steps you took in a day.
1503000	1506000	And the game is looking at this little chart.
1506000	1512000	You could connect online to see how much has America walked to the moon.
1512000	1514000	Oooh ahh.
1514000	1515000	Okay.
1515000	1517000	It's like Noby Noby Boy but with an actual return.
1517000	1520000	It was this thing that was like in and out in like a couple months.
1520000	1525000	But this all came at the height of Wii Fit Mania.
1526000	1529000	This was, everybody was crazy about Wii Fit.
1529000	1533000	And this was kind of like, this was Nintendo's attempt to bottle some of that on the DS.
1533000	1536000	Was to put out this everybody walks game.
1536000	1540000	My point is, Nintendo was sitting on Fitbit.
1540000	1542000	They could have had this.
1542000	1544000	If they would embrace online.
1544000	1546000	If they would embrace smart phones.
1546000	1548000	Because where did Fitbit succeed?
1548000	1550000	Fitbit tapped into Facebook.
1550000	1552000	It turned it into a game.
1552000	1554000	It turned it into something you want to motivate your friends to do.
1554000	1556000	It was more of a robust experience.
1556000	1559000	Where you have this website where you track your calories and get plans.
1559000	1565000	If Nintendo would get out of their bunker and open up their eyes to online and the things you could do.
1565000	1569000	They could have made everybody walks Fitbit.
1569000	1570000	That's my point.
1570000	1572000	Was everybody walks third party?
1572000	1573000	I don't believe so.
1573000	1577000	Somebody can feel, can correct me.
1577000	1578000	You're getting two games confused.
1578000	1583000	There was one that was actually a fitness game that was, or fitness application that was on the DS.
1583000	1585000	That was by Nintendo.
1585000	1590000	Then there was this really shitty game that came out from Konami that was on the Wii.
1590000	1592000	Where you walked in place.
1592000	1594000	I am not talking about the Konami game.
1594000	1596000	I am talking about the advanced game.
1596000	1598000	Do you remember what the name of that was?
1598000	1600000	I can look it up. I don't remember.
1600000	1603000	Nintendo Personal Trainer Walking.
1603000	1604000	Thank you.
1604000	1606000	Personal Trainer Walking or whatever it was.
1606000	1608000	You guys got the point of what I was talking about.
1608000	1613000	Now the 3DS, they liked this idea so much they built it into the 3DS.
1613000	1617000	I didn't know that on the original DS it actually came with an accessory to track that.
1617000	1618000	I had no idea.
1618000	1620000	See?
1620000	1623000	And the 3DS has this built in.
1623000	1627000	But can you go, why do you carry the 3DS in your pocket?
1627000	1631000	You get coins because you want to get higher kiddies and find me, right?
1631000	1632000	Which is okay.
1632000	1634000	That's a little bit of innovation.
1634000	1636000	But it's still within the Nintendo bubble.
1636000	1642000	Online leaderboards, motivation, cheering people on that can be pushed to people's 3DSs.
1642000	1644000	Just like it is with the Fitbit and the iPhone.
1644000	1646000	Nintendo could have that.
1646000	1647000	They don't.
1647000	1651000	Now that the 3DS actually has the Nintendo network and that's a little bit more flexible.
1651000	1654000	The horizon is broadening.
1654000	1657000	Nintendo seems more cooperative than competitive though.
1657000	1658000	Wow.
1658000	1660000	You know what would be even better with Fitbit?
1660000	1663000	Is if you could mine Bitcoins by exercise.
1663000	1669000	People have probably hacked the Fitbit to do that so I wouldn't put that out of the question.
1669000	1671000	But anyway, I guess that was kind of the point I was trying to make.
1671000	1676000	Is that this isn't necessarily about Nintendo has to put Mario on the iPhone.
1676000	1683000	But this is about Nintendo needs to be more aware with how they can work with some of these other technologies that are already out there.
1683000	1686000	I don't know if somebody wants, maybe somebody wants to refute my point which is fine.
1686000	1689000	Or add to something similar.
1689000	1690000	I don't know, Jason?
1690000	1694000	I, obviously they attempted to do so.
1694000	1701000	I keep glancing around Jamie's head and I'm staring at the lovely little Wii U gamepad chilling on your setup over there.
1701000	1702000	They obviously tried to.
1702000	1704000	Oh, tablets are the next big thing.
1704000	1709000	Let's give you a 4 inch screen that you can do, to their credit, very interesting things on.
1709000	1715000	You have been playing, my recollection of it is that you have been playing NES Remix purely on the gamepad.
1715000	1720000	And you had to switch it back to the TV only for the fact of me being able to actually see it.
1720000	1724000	They're doing interesting things.
1724000	1727000	All of them, no, not even by a long shot.
1727000	1733000	But they're doing interesting things, they have new technology, they are working on improving it.
1733000	1740000	The 3DS was improved to the point that it can access a reasonably modern network service.
1740000	1743000	You know, something new was backported to an old system.
1743000	1745000	They try.
1745000	1746000	Do they miss the mark?
1746000	1747000	Yes.
1747000	1750000	Is that rooted in Japanese culture versus American culture?
1750000	1753000	I want to say yes, but I don't actually know, so maybe I shouldn't say that.
1753000	1764000	But it's, it's not necessarily just a straight up gold mine because people have to know about it and understand it and be willing to make the investment to do it.
1764000	1771000	I really, I really feel, I don't mean to bring the conversation back to me, but I really feel that my point still applies.
1771000	1773000	Nintendo has been doing the same thing all along.
1773000	1780000	They just had a nearly viral runaway hit, and they're trying to continue that forward, but it doesn't work that way.
1780000	1787000	I want to point out, before we get the email saying, Rob, you forgot to talk about XYZ because I'm getting messages in chat and so forth,
1787000	1794000	is that Wii Fit U actually does have this pedometer thing with it as well, and it's the big thing where you can actually go in and do that.
1794000	1796000	I kind of think they're doing...
1796000	1798000	You mean syncing a 3DS to a Wii U and...
1798000	1800000	No, there's actually a little Wii Fit U pedometer.
1800000	1801000	Yet another accessory.
1801000	1809000	That's the whole little thing, is that now Nintendo's, excuse me, but I feel Nintendo is trying to copy something they should have had in the first place.
1809000	1813000	I feel like Nintendo's trying to copy the whole Fitbit thing, although that should have been theirs to own in the first place.
1813000	1820000	But I kind of feel like, A, they're not doing a very good job selling it that way because I plain forgot until you guys started sending me messages about it,
1820000	1826000	which says a lot that I do a gaming enthusiast show, and I didn't, I totally forgot that that thing came with a pedometer.
1826000	1833000	And B, I bet 10 to 1, the online experience with your Wii Fit U pedometer ain't anything like it is on Fitbit.
1833000	1841000	Not to mention the fact that you have to boot up a console and boot up a game to be able to do anything with it, where the Fitbit phone plus computer just happens.
1841000	1847000	Bingo. What was the first big problem with Wii U as a whole that they had to fix? It was too fucking slow.
1847000	1849000	And has that actually changed?
1850000	1857000	Well, it's not as fast as it should be, but to be fair, PlayStation 4 isn't instant either, but it's a lot quicker.
1857000	1864000	This is the same argument that we had with the handoff with Bobby about Netflix and Hulu versus On Demand in cable boxes.
1864000	1870000	The interface and the implementation are just completely different and serve the same goal in two very different ways.
1870000	1874000	One of them is terrible, some people put up with it anyways, one of them, in our opinion, is not.
1874000	1878000	More comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Akuma JP says,
1878000	1885000	Sky, big companies don't usually innovate. It's not that they didn't think about it, but it is the way big companies work.
1885000	1893000	I have to tell you also, my friend, I have a friend that works in Nagoya, who was actually just complaining on Facebook today,
1893000	1906000	that as much as companies need to innovate to grow, she's really disillusioned by the stagnant corporate cultures in Japan.
1907000	1919000	That there is such an adverse, this is what I'm trying to think of, that generally change is looked upon as dangerous and will damage the business,
1919000	1929000	when we've seen in practice that more companies that innovate tend to either be highly successful or suffer really badly for it.
1929000	1931000	It's that level of risk.
1932000	1939000	This is actually a very complimentary point. You cannot trust something new to maintain the level.
1939000	1943000	Companies have to grow. If they want more, if they want to do more, they have to grow.
1943000	1946000	They have to get more money, hire more staff, make more investments.
1946000	1950000	And a big company cannot rest on redoing everything.
1950000	1954000	So big companies cannot make these landslide changes to say,
1954000	1958000	well, we're done with this product because it's completely tapped out, let's come up with a new one.
1958000	1965000	It's not necessarily going to be successful. And then you're going to have to shutter 80% of your workforce and start all over again.
1965000	1969000	But great things in gaming do come from risks. I mean, let's look at Guitar Hero.
1969000	1971000	Tell that to Halo 4.
1971000	1977000	Well, here's the thing. With Guitar Hero, obviously part of our big history as music gamers, Konami should have had Guitar Hero.
1977000	1982000	Konami was sitting on Guitar Hero. They didn't want to take the risk to put out in the US and get the license that they needed to make it successful.
1982000	1985000	For the last six years, they've still barely done anything.
1985000	1988000	They literally have made their game look better.
1988000	1992000	Discounting Rock Revolution, as far as Guitar Freaks itself, they've had six years to do something with it.
1992000	1995000	And as far as I've been able to tell, they literally haven't.
1995000	1998000	Activision ruined music games for a good long while.
1998000	2004000	Activision pooped in the pool, and so it's going to take a while before music games.
2004000	2008000	Like, where's Disney Fantasia evolved?
2008000	2014000	Harmonix is waiting on it a little longer. It'll be out later this year when it can be distanced a little more from all the other music games.
2014000	2016000	Because Harmonix does make good stuff.
2016000	2020000	Well, it seems to me that this is a danger in letting a company get too big.
2020000	2030000	And having them become these all-encompassing giants where it stops being about the consumer market and becomes more about the bottom line.
2030000	2040000	So that's why I think it goes back to why we're seeing a bigger surge in independent developers that are making the games that people actually want to play.
2040000	2048000	You know, instead of, yeah, maybe they want to pool in enough revenue so that they can make the next big game or stay ahead of water or, you know, pay their bills.
2048000	2056000	But when it becomes all about greed, then I think that it's time to cut them in half.
2056000	2059000	I do want to get to our chat room for just a couple more comments.
2059000	2063000	And I do want to try to wrap this conversation up because, again, we can spend all three hours on this point.
2063000	2069000	I do invite, I know some of you are very passionate on this topic. Maybe you disagree with what we're saying and you want to send feedback.
2069000	2075000	Please do. It is the show where every gamer has a voice. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2075000	2080000	I want to also get into a few chat comments here because there's one in particular I really want to respond to.
2080000	2090000	Oh, here it is. Tiger Claw on chat says, Rob, what if Nintendo were to put out an app on the iPhone and Android that allows you to access the Miiverse like you do on your desktop browser?
2090000	2091000	Exists.
2091000	2095000	Well, it's coming. The Miiverse app, so to speak, is being made.
2095000	2098000	Miiverse is accessible on the web.
2098000	2103000	It is accessible on the web and it does have a mobile-friendly site, so you can bring it up in the mobile phone.
2103000	2111000	It's not all of the features of Miiverse by far, like the ability of the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, two. I bought this. Start downloading remotely.
2111000	2119000	Here's the thing. Miiverse ain't going to fucking fix Nintendo. We need to get, I mean, Miiverse does do some neat things. It's neat.
2119000	2125000	But it's not like, you know, I don't think that's the answer to Nintendo's problems.
2126000	2132000	Here's the iPhone-Android app Nintendo should make. I'm going to throw a crazy idea out there. Take it or leave it.
2132000	2146000	What's Nintendo big on? Nintendo's big on, you know, they resist online play because they want everybody to be in the same room and do the parties in the room and do, you know, playing with your friends in the same place.
2146000	2148000	Mario Party epitomized.
2148000	2161000	Something like that. I think Nintendo should do an app that helps you organize Nintendo parties, which could include maybe unlock things that work in the Wii U games or, you know, some type of interaction there to make people really want to download it and check it out.
2161000	2177000	But the real true functionality of the app is to like, oh, let me pull up my Facebook friends list and I'm going to have a Mario Party, Mario Kart 8 party on Friday at 8 o'clock and I want to invite these friends and it's going to send them a reminder, don't forget to bring your gamepad and all this stuff.
2177000	2191000	Like, you know, you guys might think I'm crazy or whatever, but that, I kind of think that's the thing where Nintendo needs to go is new ideas that interact with the technology that's out there, not just Miiverse on your fucking phone.
2191000	2195000	That invitation could include pictures of penises.
2195000	2200000	I was going to say two words. Pictochat pedophiles. Pictochat predators.
2200000	2201000	I agree with you.
2202000	2211000	Okay, but as my mobile phone as it is, Jason, I could open up my pants right now, take a picture of my penis and send it to you. I don't need an app to do that.
2211000	2223000	People don't care. And that's not the point. The point is that something that is largely targeted towards kids or families that have kids is unfortunately a common factor of attack.
2223000	2227000	I think if Snapchat can exist, Nintendo Party Planner can exist.
2227000	2230000	Parents don't open up Snapchat and give it to their kids.
2230000	2238000	No, I think that's the problem right there. Is this console, once again, remember with the Wii and, well, I don't know so much the Wii but like the GameCube.
2238000	2245000	At some point they decided, hey, you know what, we're getting the stigma of being like only a kid's console and that's it.
2245000	2250000	We need to really broaden out and have some more hardcore games and stuff like that to get people interested.
2250000	2254000	And that's what they promised, I think, with the Wii that ended up not happening. The Wii U.
2254000	2260000	And I just don't see that. And that's the problem. There's still a stigma that this is a very kid-safe console.
2260000	2266000	And they keep promoting that. But let's be honest. There's people that are dicks everywhere.
2266000	2273000	And honestly, it comes with the territory that when you're playing online games with people, they're gonna be dicks.
2273000	2276000	And guess what? Those dicks are kids.
2277000	2283000	Couple more comments here. Rama in chat says, what will fix the Wii U's sales? Decent fucking video games.
2285000	2292000	Mario 3D World would like to say hello. As would Zelda Twilight Princess HD. As would Pikmin 3.
2292000	2298000	That's awesome that they have first-party games. Where are the third-party games?
2298000	2303000	That's the problem with that comment. Nintendo doesn't need decent fucking video games. They have amazing fucking video games.
2303000	2310000	They need more fucking video games. That's the real problem. They gotta figure out how to get those third parties back.
2312000	2317000	And I really don't know what that is. I sorta think the online thing did a min.
2317000	2325000	I really truly think EA jumped ship because Wii U could not whore online the way they needed it to be hoarded.
2325000	2332000	I think that's 100% what it boils down to. Give me my tinfoil hat, please.
2332000	2335000	Numerous new titles that didn't have DLC on the Wii.
2335000	2341000	Well, that and I think that they switched over to running their games all pretty much on the same engine and that engine just doesn't run on the Wii U.
2341000	2348000	I mean, I think there's more politics involved with it, but it's not just EA that's not putting games on that system.
2348000	2351000	There's plenty of other publishers who are just like, eh, nah.
2351000	2359000	EA is still putting out pop-cap games like Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare on the Xbox 360. There's no reason that can't be on Wii U.
2359000	2361000	Kegel 2 is on Xbox One, guys!
2361000	2363000	There's no reason that can't be on Wii U.
2363000	2370000	Can Battlefield 4 be on Wii U? No, but is EA withholding things intentionally from Wii U? Yes.
2372000	2379000	Alright, I think that's about it for now. We could go on and on with this forever.
2379000	2381000	But I'm sure you guys have feedback.
2381000	2385000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com. This is a very contentious topic.
2385000	2390000	Quickly, before we get into our gaming ways and the types of things that we've been playing, let's go around the table real quick.
2390000	2395000	What do you think, quickly, Nintendo can do to turn these numbers around?
2395000	2401000	Because even the most hardcore Nintendo fanboy, it's really hard to sugarcoat what's happening with the Wii U.
2401000	2411000	So, what do you think Nintendo can do to, I don't necessarily want to say to make Wii U's, but what can Nintendo do to have a more favorable report next year?
2411000	2422000	I don't know. I really don't know. I can't see them doing anything new. So, I really don't have an idea.
2422000	2423000	Jason?
2423000	2426000	Don't gauge Wii U expectations based off the Wii.
2426000	2428000	Loki?
2428000	2433000	They're going to need to drop the price of that big time. Big time.
2433000	2438000	Because they just don't have the games to support it right now, so they can't promise more.
2439000	2448000	Like, for example, I looked at, you know, the IGN ran a thing, I think it was IGN, that had like, you know, the games of 2014.
2448000	2458000	And I gotta say, 90% of those games are TBA date games. Like, okay, Bayonetta 2, that should come out this year.
2458000	2463000	Does it have a date yet? Nope. Does that mean it's going to come out this year?
2464000	2476000	I hate to sound fanboy, but I honestly think this is the only way to save the Wii U, and I really think this is a cliche thing to say, but I really do think it's the answer.
2476000	2483000	Nintendo needs to drop the price of the Wii U to $149, and the way they're going to do it is they're going to cut the tablet.
2483000	2490000	The tablet is now an accessory and not a mandatory device. You don't need that tablet to play Mario 3D World, which is still a great gaming experience.
2491000	2493000	And a lot of people I talk to do.
2493000	2498000	I still think that, I'm the exception, unfortunately, and these numbers prove it.
2498000	2499000	I can agree with that.
2499000	2506000	So, I mean, it would be great that the tablet is optional for those that want it. I think Nintendo should still push a bundle that has it all included.
2506000	2516000	But they're going to, if they want to save the Wii U in particular, they're going to need to cut the tablet and really emphasize the, you know, $149 to really get these things moving.
2516000	2524000	Throw in Mario 3D World if you have to for free. I know that might be a huge hit for Nintendo, but they don't have a lot of options right now.
2524000	2534000	And the console could still flourish via Mario Kart 8, via Bayonetta 2, via Super Smash Brothers, via New Zelda.
2534000	2540000	All these games, I kind of have a feeling, aren't going to need the tablet that much either, and will still work.
2540000	2545000	Let the 3DS be a second screen if need be, you know, or whatever it takes.
2545000	2556000	Here's the thing too, also with that, like you mentioned Smash Brothers, that's another problem with them too, is these games that are coming out, they're not necessarily just on the Wii U.
2556000	2561000	Like Smash Brothers, I don't need to buy a Wii U to have that game, I could get a 3DS.
2561000	2565000	And I don't think that's helping.
2567000	2569000	Yeah, Jason, final thought on this.
2569000	2571000	I'm still going to buy a Wii U this year.
2572000	2574000	I've always meant to. I've always wanted to.
2574000	2577000	I think it's an important thing to note, despite what you said earlier.
2577000	2583000	I wasn't, nothing I said was deriding Nintendo. Not a single thing was anti-Nintendo.
2583000	2587000	This is how I see what they've done with their console.
2587000	2593000	I 100% plan on buying a Wii U, money permitting.
2593000	2595000	That's the only reason I don't have one already.
2595000	2598000	I wouldn't say I come from a place of anti-Nintendo either.
2598000	2599000	Neither of us were.
2600000	2602000	But I get fucking frustrated with them sometimes.
2602000	2605000	I get real fucking frustrated with them sometimes.
2605000	2607000	I'll buy a Wii U.
2607000	2613000	Rob, to go back to how you were saying there's games that EA could be putting on the Wii U
2613000	2615000	and one of those being Plants vs. Zombies.
2615000	2618000	As I figured, Frost sprite 3 is what it uses.
2618000	2620000	That can't run on the Wii U.
2620000	2622000	That's the same engine that runs Battlefield 4.
2622000	2624000	But it's on the Xbox 360?
2624000	2626000	And it's on the Xbox 360.
2626000	2629000	Those engines can run on the Xbox 360, same with Ignite.
2629000	2631000	But they can't run on the Wii U.
2631000	2633000	It's so underpowered, it can't run those.
2633000	2636000	And that's why you're going to see a lot of these games not coming.
2636000	2639000	It could be that they're totally fine with porting it over,
2639000	2641000	but they just don't have an engine that that game can run on
2641000	2643000	because it doesn't run on the system.
2643000	2645000	It's not enough power.
2645000	2648000	Even though they said that that thing was more powerful than the Xbox 360.
2648000	2650000	Get my tinfoil hat ready.
2650000	2652000	Get my tinfoil hat ready because, Loki, I'm going to be honest,
2652000	2655000	my reaction to that is that this is coming from EA.
2655000	2658000	And I'm sure that Frostbite engine won't run on Wii U,
2658000	2661000	just like SimCity won't be an offline game.
2666000	2667000	Done and done.
2667000	2668000	Very good.
2668000	2671000	Let's get into our gaming weeks.
2671000	2673000	And we're going to talk about the types of video games
2673000	2676000	that we've been playing this week, no matter what engine they use.
2676000	2678000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
2678000	2681000	Since I spent most of this week ridiculously sick,
2681000	2683000	I haven't done a lot of gaming.
2683000	2687000	I played Animal Crossing, which I even skipped.
2687000	2690000	I skipped my first day of Animal Crossing, Rob,
2690000	2692000	when I was doing nothing but sleeping.
2692000	2695000	And then I played a little Fractal.
2695000	2697000	That's about it.
2697000	2699000	Oh, and I started Bioshock Infinite.
2699000	2702000	Oh, what do you think of the Bioshock Infinite so far?
2702000	2703000	It's so...
2703000	2704000	It's per day.
2704000	2706000	Yeah, I love the environments.
2706000	2707000	It's so great.
2707000	2708000	Yeah.
2708000	2709000	Great little...
2709000	2710000	I'm pretty pleased so far.
2710000	2712000	I just have to play in small increments
2712000	2714000	because I get emotion sick.
2714000	2718000	So that's all I've done, mostly, like I said,
2718000	2721000	is just being sick and not, you know,
2721000	2723000	having a lot of energy to sit up and play.
2723000	2726000	I'm the opposite, because when I'm sick
2726000	2728000	is when I get my most gaming done.
2728000	2732000	Well, usually if I'm sick, I'm fine to sit up and do stuff.
2732000	2735000	You know, I'm really a push-through-it kind of person.
2735000	2740000	But whatever it is that I have, or got over, I should say,
2740000	2743000	Dan's got it now, has just been exhausting.
2743000	2745000	I'll sit up for a couple hours.
2745000	2747000	I'll sleep four.
2747000	2748000	I'll be up another couple hours.
2748000	2750000	I'll sleep another four.
2750000	2753000	And apparently other people who've had the same thing
2753000	2755000	have felt the same way I have.
2755000	2758000	You know, I think Victoria and Bobby both have it.
2758000	2759000	Not Bobby Blackwell.
2759000	2760000	Other from Bobby.
2760000	2761000	Yeah, Barbara.
2761000	2762000	Yeah.
2762000	2764000	They were Disneyland sick.
2764000	2765000	That was...
2765000	2767000	I hope they don't have an H1N1,
2767000	2769000	which they say is that the flu strain
2769000	2770000	is going around right now.
2770000	2771000	Is it?
2771000	2773000	Well, they talk about how they have the flu
2773000	2774000	and how crappy they feel.
2774000	2776000	I'm like, they probably have H1N1.
2776000	2778000	I didn't know that was going around again.
2778000	2779000	Yeah, oh yeah.
2779000	2781000	Well, whatever it was that I had,
2781000	2783000	I mean, well, keep in mind, when I had swine flu,
2783000	2785000	I only felt mildly sick too.
2785000	2787000	And sorry I gave it to you.
2787000	2788000	Yeah, I know, I know.
2788000	2792000	But I mean, I just, you know,
2792000	2794000	didn't really feel much like playing anything.
2794000	2796000	So I played my few things.
2796000	2797000	I can understand.
2797000	2798000	Sleep is good when you're sick.
2798000	2799000	All right.
2799000	2800000	Let's go over...
2800000	2801000	Sleep is good all the time.
2801000	2802000	What are you talking about?
2802000	2803000	Let's go over to Jason.
2803000	2804000	I want to check in with you again.
2804000	2805000	Which by the way, Jason,
2805000	2807000	even though we promised we wouldn't talk a lot about football,
2807000	2810000	I think I do owe Jason the PSA of saying that,
2810000	2813000	prepare for sad riots tonight because...
2813000	2814000	So says Bobby Blackwell.
2814000	2816000	Let's see what SSG100 Matt said.
2816000	2817000	SSG100 Matt says,
2817000	2819000	so it's the Seattle Betty Whites versus the Denver Betty Whites
2819000	2821000	and the Betty White Bowl in two weeks.
2821000	2822000	Yes.
2822000	2823000	And what's also very important is that...
2823000	2824000	Featuring puppies.
2824000	2825000	You have...
2825000	2826000	And lingerie.
2826000	2829000	You have the Washington team and the Colorado team.
2829000	2831000	The two states that legalized marijuana this season.
2831000	2833000	Going to the marijuana bowl.
2833000	2834000	They're going to smoke the Super Bowl.
2834000	2836000	They're going to smoke the Super Bowl.
2836000	2839000	In New Jersey where they're probably going to cause it to burn down.
2839000	2842000	I sent a message to my coworker and said,
2842000	2845000	let me know if the bridge burns down and I won't be able to make it back in, please.
2845000	2849000	Oh, that wouldn't happen in New Jersey because they'd just close it.
2849000	2854000	So I checked out this game this week that...
2854000	2857000	It's kind of a godsim where you play a single character,
2857000	2859000	so maybe not so much a godsim,
2859000	2865000	where you're able to make goals at any point in time,
2865000	2870000	but then energy level and various other resources can determine
2870000	2872000	whether or not you'll actually be able to fulfill those goals.
2872000	2874000	This is, by the way, a 100% lie.
2874000	2876000	Games like this don't exist.
2876000	2877000	That was just my week.
2877000	2879000	Oh, yeah, I'm going to work on the video tonight.
2879000	2883000	Oh, wait, it's 3 a.m. and I'm still at the office socializing with coworkers
2883000	2885000	that I don't usually see, oops, Tuesday, same thing.
2885000	2886000	Wednesday, same thing.
2886000	2889000	Thursday, same thing.
2889000	2893000	Needless to say, I literally played nothing this week.
2893000	2895000	You don't play anything to pass the time when things get really crazy?
2895000	2897000	I don't have downtime.
2897000	2901000	There were 15 people in from out of town this week,
2901000	2904000	plus the fact that things are ramping up like normal,
2904000	2908000	like truly everybody's back from holidays and all that kind of stuff,
2908000	2914000	and there is enough going on as part of my mission to do as much as possible
2914000	2916000	while I'm in the area in Cannes.
2916000	2919000	I'm usually literally out with people constantly
2919000	2921000	and don't really know what they're doing.
2921000	2923000	All right, all right, all I hear are excuses.
2923000	2926000	I'm important and busy and I'm having fun.
2926000	2931000	No, I killed like eight hours last night finishing off a video and uploading it.
2931000	2932000	It's rather fun.
2932000	2934000	All right, all right, they're here to hear about video games.
2934000	2936000	Maybe Loki won't disappoint them with gaming week chat.
2937000	2940000	No, I guess.
2940000	2943000	So I played a lot of Minecraft this week
2943000	2946000	because I've been tweaking stuff on our server
2946000	2949000	and setting up plug-ins and that kind of thing.
2949000	2954000	So mainly I've been focusing on some of the Crackshot plug-ins,
2954000	2957000	which Crackshot allows you to add guns to Minecraft
2957000	2960000	and make some really interesting ones.
2960000	2962000	So I've been playing around with those. That's been kind of fun.
2963000	2967000	And then, let's see, I played a little bit of,
2967000	2969000	it was some Flash game.
2969000	2973000	I should say, not Flash, a Unity game called,
2973000	2976000	I want to say it was Catastrophe or something like that.
2976000	2979000	It's a first-person cat game
2979000	2982000	where you're supposed to knock things off shelves onto the floor.
2982000	2984000	I heard of that. That sounds awesome.
2984000	2987000	Yeah, it's pretty awesome and the guy has,
2987000	2990000	it's kind of like a little demo for that and stuff.
2990000	2992000	It's hilarious because all the graphics,
2992000	2994000	it reminds me a lot of Katamari.
2994000	2996000	They're very simple like that.
2996000	2999000	And just the whole premise seems kind of silly
2999000	3001000	because that's what my cat does.
3001000	3004000	And then I decided,
3004000	3007000	today I took Josh to Golfland
3007000	3010000	to go play some mini golf and stuff because he's never done that.
3010000	3013000	And I saw DDR there and of course he wouldn't let me play DDR
3013000	3018000	because he got scared of the Terminator gun game that was there.
3018000	3021000	Because he saw the Terminator on top of it
3021000	3023000	and I don't know, he got scared.
3023000	3025000	So I ended up, right before the show,
3025000	3029000	I drove down there and decided to play some DDR
3029000	3032000	on Max 2 and put in,
3032000	3034000	slipped on a card twice because hey,
3034000	3036000	I thought I was going to play a game of doubles
3036000	3038000	and you need to do that.
3038000	3041000	But then they had the mode where
3041000	3044000	it only takes one credit to play two player or doubles.
3044000	3047000	So I went ahead and did that and I found out it's four songs each.
3047000	3049000	So I started off like, yeah, I can do this.
3049000	3051000	I'm going to pick something a little easier
3051000	3053000	because I know I'm a little out of shape.
3053000	3057000	And then in the middle of my fourth song or whatever,
3057000	3061000	I swear my body was just pulling a Danny Glover saying,
3061000	3063000	you're getting too old for this.
3063000	3066000	I'm like, shut up, I'm going to play another set of songs.
3066000	3069000	About song three, I'm like, fuck this,
3069000	3071000	I don't want to play this anymore.
3071000	3073000	And then so the last one,
3073000	3075000	the last song, I was like,
3075000	3077000	oh yeah, I'm still going to play the last song.
3077000	3080000	I was like, I can't do this, my feet won't move.
3080000	3083000	So I had to hobble back out to my car afterwards.
3083000	3085000	It's funny though because I was like,
3085000	3087000	oh, I totally want to play DDR and after I was done,
3087000	3089000	I was like, I don't want to play DDR anymore.
3089000	3091000	But I don't know.
3091000	3093000	So that was that.
3093000	3095000	Did the state of the arcade
3095000	3097000	lead you to great sadness outside of DDR?
3097000	3100000	Honestly, the machine is working.
3100000	3102000	It's super loud.
3102000	3104000	I mean, holy crap, it's loud.
3105000	3107000	I wanted to have Josh try it
3107000	3109000	and he was afraid of it because it was too loud.
3109000	3111000	It was just like screaming ear.
3111000	3113000	There was a Disney rave there,
3113000	3115000	but it's turned off.
3115000	3117000	So I guess it's broken.
3117000	3119000	It didn't seem like it was in that bad of shape.
3119000	3121000	The pads seem to be working just fine.
3121000	3123000	It's amazing that those games
3123000	3125000	still make money all these years later.
3125000	3127000	Well, they have it marked down.
3127000	3129000	It's four songs, three doubles,
3129000	3131000	for 50 cents.
3131000	3134000	Still, I mean, it's a great moneymaker for the arcade.
3134000	3136000	Those machines have paid for themselves
3136000	3138000	five times over by now, I'm sure.
3138000	3140000	Probably, yeah.
3140000	3143000	All right. Well, if that's it for your gaming week,
3143000	3145000	I will quickly touch on my gaming week,
3145000	3148000	which I don't actually have a whole lot of new stuff to share,
3148000	3150000	just a couple games.
3150000	3152000	Of course, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV,
3152000	3154000	way too much of it,
3154000	3156000	and continuing to play some stuff on the PlayStation 4,
3156000	3158000	like Don't Starve,
3158000	3160000	which I continue to actually play a little bit on the PC this week
3160000	3163000	because Loki gifted me that copy some time ago,
3163000	3166000	which that version is...
3166000	3168000	It's pretty much the same thing on PlayStation 4,
3168000	3170000	but I was finding some slightly different stuff in it,
3170000	3172000	and it just has the different feel with the controller,
3172000	3174000	or with the keyboard,
3174000	3176000	as opposed to the controller and mouse and so forth.
3176000	3178000	But I will say this,
3178000	3180000	because I was a little harsh on Don't Starve last week
3180000	3182000	because of the fact that it doesn't have a tutorial mode,
3182000	3184000	and it doesn't really give you much...
3184000	3186000	It doesn't really tell you, like,
3186000	3188000	how to go about playing the game at all,
3188000	3190000	which I understand was a design choice,
3190000	3192000	but I just get really frustrated with games like that.
3192000	3194000	But I will say this,
3194000	3196000	after kind of figuring it out,
3196000	3198000	and watching more YouTubes,
3198000	3200000	and reading some FAQs on it and so forth,
3200000	3202000	I kind of went back now that I understand the game a little more,
3202000	3204000	and I'm actually having a lot more fun with it,
3204000	3206000	now that I kind of understand,
3206000	3208000	oh, okay, you gotta gather all this stuff
3208000	3210000	so you can try to start to make a little base,
3210000	3212000	and this is how you can get your food and so forth.
3212000	3214000	So it just...
3214000	3216000	It actually enhanced it a little bit,
3216000	3218000	of hand-holding you just a little bit,
3218000	3220000	because I think it did make it more fun and exciting,
3220000	3222000	although some will disagree with me there, and that's fine,
3222000	3225000	I just feel like I almost missed out on this game.
3225000	3229000	If I hadn't really gone to the PlayStation 4 live channel
3229000	3231000	and watched some other people play,
3231000	3234000	I don't think I would have kept going with it.
3234000	3237000	But now I'm glad I did, because I'm enjoying the game.
3237000	3239000	One other new game that I checked out this week,
3239000	3242000	because I decided to catch up on my Steam backlog a little bit,
3242000	3244000	so I bought a game during the sale,
3244000	3246000	I hadn't checked out, but I decided to check it out this week,
3246000	3248000	and that game is Guacamelee,
3248000	3250000	which is a game that's...
3250000	3251000	Melee.
3251000	3254000	I like Guacamelee, but fine, Guacamelee.
3254000	3256000	You can...
3256000	3259000	This game is kind of like a Super Metroid-esque type of game,
3259000	3261000	where you have the exploration and so forth,
3261000	3264000	but it has more beat-em-up style mechanics in it,
3264000	3266000	like I don't want to say it's like Double Dragon or something like that,
3266000	3269000	but I don't exactly remember Samus
3269000	3273000	kind of doing combos on people and uppercuts and all this stuff either,
3273000	3276000	so it's a very different type of feel, a game, when you're playing it.
3276000	3279000	But I gotta say, it's fucking great.
3279000	3281000	It is a fucking great game.
3281000	3283000	I am really, really enjoying the game.
3283000	3285000	Obviously, I love me some Super Metroid,
3285000	3287000	but it's not even just that.
3287000	3292000	I mean, yeah, that's a great skeleton for your game or whatever,
3292000	3295000	but I just love doing the combos
3295000	3299000	and actually being able to throw guys and other guys and all this.
3299000	3301000	Some of the puzzle mechanics get very interesting, too,
3301000	3303000	with the whole light world and the dark world
3303000	3306000	and constantly flipping back and forth between the two.
3306000	3311000	And I love the references, constant funny references,
3311000	3313000	to internet memes and other video games.
3313000	3316000	They are all over the place, and they're really funny,
3316000	3318000	and there's been so many that I've had to go,
3318000	3320000	oh, my God, Alan, look at this, look at this.
3320000	3324000	This is a riff on the oh, really, yeah, really, owl
3324000	3326000	from like ten years ago.
3326000	3328000	Or a walrus.
3328000	3330000	A walrus in his bucket.
3330000	3332000	No, I have not seen a walrus in his bucket yet,
3332000	3334000	but I wasn't really looking out for it either.
3334000	3337000	But I did see the Super Hermanos
3337000	3340000	with the red suit and the green suit,
3340000	3342000	kind of a riff on that.
3342000	3344000	And then in one of the backgrounds,
3344000	3346000	you can just very faintly see a Mega Man
3346000	3347000	cut out in the bricks.
3347000	3349000	There's just little references like that.
3349000	3351000	And they're not shy about it either
3351000	3353000	because you get your power-ups from,
3353000	3355000	I think they call them chorizo statues.
3355000	3358000	They call them a different name,
3358000	3359000	and it's just really funny.
3359000	3361000	But they look like they do in Metroid.
3361000	3363000	They don't even try.
3363000	3365000	But I love that. I love it.
3365000	3367000	And I know the game is really big
3367000	3368000	with speedrunners right now,
3368000	3370000	and I know it's going to come to PlayStation 4
3370000	3372000	at some point, and I'm really excited
3372000	3375000	because I love how the game is loud and vibrant,
3375000	3378000	the music's great, it's fast-paced,
3378000	3381000	and it's a Super Metroid clone on top of all that.
3381000	3384000	Honest to God, this is a great example
3384000	3387000	of why I can't ever, at the end of 2013,
3387000	3390000	say, here's the best video games that came out in 2013
3390000	3392000	because I just don't have time to play them all,
3392000	3394000	because if I had played this before December,
3394000	3396000	I would have put this in my top ten for sure.
3396000	3399000	This says PlayStation 4 and Xbox One Spring this year.
3399000	3401000	Yes, it is going to come out in some way.
3401000	3404000	Should you do a music game called Guaka Yooka-Laylee?
3404000	3405000	You never know.
3405000	3407000	I don't know if there's going to be DLC expansion,
3407000	3409000	but supposedly these other versions on PlayStation 4
3409000	3411000	and Xbox One are supposed to be expanded.
3411000	3413000	So yeah, the game is an awful lot of fun.
3413000	3414000	I really...
3414000	3416000	Rageinator, your joke completely fails
3416000	3419000	because Melee is fighting.
3419000	3423000	Um, 13 cross forever in our chat says,
3423000	3425000	Rob, you should try Mutant Blobs Attack.
3425000	3427000	I'll just have to put that on the list.
3427000	3431000	Tech2030 says, some intense platforming in that game.
3431000	3432000	Let's see.
3432000	3434000	That's actually an L.
3434000	3436000	Oh, ActDeft. Ooh, I love this.
3436000	3439000	ActDeft says, if we're saying it in Spanish, Rob is correct.
3439000	3441000	Guaka Mealy.
3441000	3443000	Melee isn't the...
3444000	3445000	Really?
3445000	3448000	I will trust what the Mexican listener of OLR says.
3448000	3450000	But it's a play on...
3450000	3453000	It's a portmanteau of Guaka Mealy and Melee.
3453000	3455000	What is the etymology of Melee?
3455000	3456000	What is that language rooted in?
3456000	3457000	I'll find out. I think it's Latin.
3457000	3461000	And Tigerclaw says, of course, since the game is inspired by Mexican culture.
3461000	3464000	And I gotta say, it's great.
3464000	3470000	Like, I love the environment and the way...
3470000	3472000	It's played off so well.
3472000	3476000	Just between the amazing soundtrack and the characters.
3476000	3477000	And the way they taught...
3477000	3480000	And you can see a lot of the inspiration from the culture as well.
3480000	3482000	It's great.
3482000	3484000	I mean, it's... Yeah.
3484000	3487000	I know I'm speaking very highly of this game, but it's for good reason.
3487000	3489000	It was old French, actually.
3489000	3492000	The word was melee.
3492000	3494000	But it was French.
3494000	3496000	Also, it does have a co-op mode, apparently.
3496000	3498000	Haven't even touched it yet.
3498000	3500000	But that just even kind of enhances the game.
3500000	3502000	Stream it! Stream it!
3502000	3503000	I probably will at some point.
3503000	3506000	I was going to, but another program was on when I was playing it.
3506000	3507000	So I didn't want to...
3507000	3510000	I don't like to broadcast at the same time as other bog shows.
3510000	3512000	Alright.
3512000	3514000	I lied. I did play stuff this week.
3514000	3515000	What did you play?
3515000	3516000	I don't remember...
3516000	3517000	I knew it.
3517000	3520000	I don't remember if I covered this when I was talking about the Xbox One last week.
3520000	3524000	I was showing a coworker that only has a PS4, the Xbox One.
3524000	3533000	I tried playing Forza and some very strange bugs started happening where we played one race and then could literally never play another one.
3533000	3537000	Because whenever they pressed start, it would take us back to the main menu screen.
3537000	3541000	And I played a four-person match of FIFA with other coworkers.
3541000	3548000	And it was fine, if not ridiculously confusing, because the camera cannot adjust for four people that well.
3548000	3554000	But yeah, more Xbox One stuff, being able to introduce more people to it and see their reactions to it.
3554000	3558000	More hilarity with testing out the Kinect and that kind of stuff.
3558000	3569000	More equivalent frustration when I realized that you cannot create an account on the Xbox One without binding it to a Microsoft account.
3569000	3572000	A Windows Live account, whatever the principle one is nowadays.
3572000	3578000	You cannot have... I assume you can have essentially silver accounts, whatever they're calling it now.
3578000	3584000	But it has to be signed on, authenticated, registered via Microsoft's authentication service.
3584000	3590000	Or a guest of another profile that is on the system.
3590000	3593000	But no local system accounts.
3593000	3595000	But yeah, just those two.
3595000	3598000	Gaming-wise, nothing new. Just a couple rounds with new people.
3599000	3602000	Also, being reminded of one other game I did play a little bit this week.
3602000	3605000	Code Man just joined our chatroom at live.fognetwork.com saying,
3605000	3609000	Rob, someone killed someone in your Minecraft sex dungeon.
3609000	3611000	Y'all need to stay the fuck out of my house on Minecraft.
3611000	3615000	Can I get an alarm installed in my house? Get out of my house!
3615000	3616000	That'd be a pretty cool mod, actually.
3616000	3619000	Unless I consensually invite you into the sex dungeon.
3619000	3620000	Stay out!
3620000	3621000	You can do that, actually.
3621000	3623000	Can I? I'm gonna put a...
3623000	3624000	We have World Guard on there.
3624000	3626000	You can block people from entering.
3626000	3627000	I need to think about that.
3627000	3630000	No, I don't mind the little jokes and things like that.
3630000	3632000	But let me have some creativity, too, people.
3632000	3634000	But actually, I will say this.
3634000	3637000	Here's what I've loved on the Minecraft vog server.
3637000	3638000	I've actually gone in and I've played.
3638000	3642000	So not only did they build that giant Normandy in front of your house, which is hilarious.
3642000	3645000	Somebody put, and I think this is Loki, put a giant penguin near my house.
3645000	3648000	I don't mind if you build stuff near my house, because the penguin actually cracked me up.
3648000	3651000	Because I was like, what the hell is this thing inside the penguin?
3651000	3655000	And Loki says, you put something on there and you pull the lever and it shoots it at its butt.
3656000	3657000	Yeah.
3657000	3659000	And I'm like, that's fucking amazing!
3659000	3660000	I gotta check that out.
3660000	3667000	And then I think it was Codeman or somebody built a giant moogle riding a chocobo behind my house.
3667000	3668000	So that's great, too.
3668000	3671000	Lots of awesome creativity on the Minecraft server.
3671000	3673000	I do have an odd question, though.
3673000	3678000	Can you incorporate other maps people have built into an existing map?
3678000	3682000	I don't think so, unless there's like a third-party copy-paste type of thing.
3682000	3684000	There is a third-party copy-paste thing.
3684000	3690000	You can load schematic files, which is how I created the Normandy and also the penguin.
3690000	3697000	Because I found a complete ocarina of time that someone built with all the buildings and the rooms and everything perfect.
3697000	3700000	I think that would be just really large.
3700000	3706000	A lot of times what they do with other maps and stuff is they'll have a hub part in a server,
3706000	3713000	and then they'll be running multiverse, but they'll have multiple servers with rooms that go to different things.
3713000	3717000	They'll have a pixel art room and all sorts of stuff like that.
3717000	3722000	So we could do that. I just don't know how much the server could really run.
3722000	3729000	I mean, it's meant to run up to 20 people at a time. We never get close to that, so maybe.
3729000	3730000	Right.
3730000	3733000	But I will say this. The creativity on the Minecraft server is pretty amazing.
3733000	3736000	That roller coaster, I don't know if that was you that built that, Loki.
3736000	3737000	That was awesome.
3737000	3738000	Yeah.
3738000	3740000	I sat in that and took a ride in that.
3740000	3745000	Except I had to put some extra minecarts on the track because they all got stuck in one part, but whatever.
3745000	3747000	Yeah, I fixed that earlier.
3747000	3757000	There was a plugin that had, it's called Craftbook, that had some stuff messed up where different blocks do different things to minecarts.
3757000	3759000	And so I had to disable all that.
3759000	3763000	Because I remember when I built the coaster the first time, I ran that same problem.
3763000	3765000	And I'm like, why is it not working?
3765000	3767000	I'm like, I know it's a plugin that's doing this.
3767000	3769000	And so I went into Craftbook and I'm like, oh, there it is.
3769000	3772000	So yeah, it should work now.
3772000	3773000	Awesome.
3773000	3775000	Is there a way to switch the perspective?
3775000	3779000	Because one time I was riding in the coaster and all I could see, like half of my screen was the cart.
3779000	3781000	Is there a way to?
3781000	3785000	That's a glitch, but yeah, you can change the perspective of your character.
3785000	3787000	I don't remember what it's set to.
3787000	3788000	Check that out.
3788000	3791000	Because I do mine through a gamepad.
3791000	3793000	I don't remember.
3793000	3795000	I'll look it up. I'll figure it out.
3796000	3801000	I do want to give props though, because I believe the Netherworld, I was very impressed with that as well.
3801000	3803000	And the whole transportation hub that's built under there.
3803000	3805000	And I think a lot of that was hitstun, right?
3805000	3807000	Yeah, that's pretty much all of him.
3807000	3810000	Dude, I'm pretty impressed with that little elaborate system that you built there.
3810000	3813000	That was something else to go in there and see that too.
3813000	3817000	So at some point I'll do a livestream from the VoG server for those of you that don't own Minecraft.
3817000	3819000	Just so you can see the creativity of the people on there.
3819000	3821000	But that was a lot of fun.
3821000	3826000	If you want to join the Minecraft server at VoG network, check that out in the forums over at VoGnetwork.com.
3826000	3830000	It's almost always in the five recent posts thing on the very front page.
3830000	3831000	So just check that out.
3831000	3835000	It is a whitelist server, because we don't want jerks coming in and ruining things.
3835000	3839000	We want people that we kind of know who they are in case they try to destroy things.
3839000	3841000	Or fuck with my house.
3841000	3844000	You can find that all at VoGnetwork.com in the forums.
3844000	3848000	But we're welcoming of any VoG participant who wants to check that out.
3848000	3850000	Alright, we gotta move on to some news.
3850000	3853000	We're running a little behind, but that's okay because we had some good discussions so far.
3853000	3855000	Someone starts her first day of work tomorrow.
3855000	3856000	I know, right?
3856000	3858000	So let's quickly do housekeeping.
3858000	3860000	Twitter.com slash OLRs where you can follow us on Twitter.
3860000	3861000	We're also on Facebook.
3861000	3864000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3864000	3867000	We will still be here next week and so on.
3867000	3869000	I can't think of any shows we have off coming up.
3869000	3871000	So I think everything is still on track.
3871000	3873000	We'll let you know though if something comes up.
3873000	3876000	Let's get into some gaming news.
3876000	3880000	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
3880000	3881000	Sure.
3881000	3883000	YouTube.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3883000	3886000	The YouTube is definitely worth plugging.
3886000	3889000	Tell the listeners what they can see in last week's episode.
3889000	3894000	You can see epic dog editing when we were talking about release dates last week.
3894000	3901000	There was some kind of a shoot-em-up looking game with a big Shiba Inu like dog meme.
3901000	3906000	And we were imitating dog meme and I had a hell of a fun time doing that in video.
3906000	3907000	Oh, I got to check that out.
3907000	3910000	Very well.
3910000	3911000	Much edit.
3911000	3913000	Such editing.
3913000	3914000	Much learning.
3914000	3915000	Now I can do it all over again.
3915000	3916000	Wow.
3916000	3917000	All right.
3917000	3920000	Whatupgnchat says, OLR doing the Super Bowl.
3920000	3921000	Yeah.
3921000	3922000	Why wouldn't we?
3922000	3924000	I don't remember the last time I watched the Super Bowl.
3924000	3925000	Ooh.
3925000	3926000	Oh, Jesus.
3926000	3927000	Is that next week?
3927000	3928000	No, that's the second.
3928000	3929000	February 2nd.
3929000	3930000	Oh, great.
3930000	3931000	I...
3931000	3932000	Oh, damn.
3932000	3933000	You may end up missing your last show.
3933000	3934000	I might.
3934000	3938000	Because I was just talking to my coworkers today saying, Super Bowl party!
3938000	3942000	Hey, I completely understand, you know, taking time off, you know, for a Puppy Bowl.
3942000	3945000	Yeah, I was going to say, I'll watch the Puppy Bowl in the morning.
3945000	3949000	Did you know that they posted the lineup for the Puppy Bowl in the Kitty Halftime?
3949000	3950000	Yes, I'm so excited.
3950000	3952000	No, there's penguin cheerleaders now.
3952000	3953000	Oh, what?
3953000	3954000	Yes.
3954000	3957000	Oh, this year they're sparing no expense at the Puppy Bowl this year.
3957000	3958000	I'm excited about the Puppy Bowl.
3958000	3959000	By the way, did you do...
3959000	3960000	Okay, I have to say this.
3960000	3963000	Did you see the labra husky?
3963000	3969000	There is a dog, and for me, okay, keep in mind, I'm super allergic to labs and huskies.
3969000	3973000	However, I would have this dog in an instant and live on Benadryl.
3973000	3979000	Imagine a cute little lab, but the shape of a lab with pure white, you know, like a husky,
3979000	3983000	and the little black markings, and those eyes.
3983000	3984000	A labra husky.
3984000	3988000	Did you hear who they got for the Halftime Music Show?
3988000	3989000	Who?
3989000	3990000	Keyboard Cat.
3990000	3992000	Keyboard motherfucking Cat is on that show.
3992000	3993000	Yes, I heard that.
3993000	3995000	Yeah, Keyboard Cat's doing the Halftime Show.
3995000	3996000	The reincarnation?
3996000	4000000	Yeah, because original Keyboard Cat's kind of dead, because that video was from the 80s.
4000000	4001000	Yeah.
4001000	4002000	But, um...
4002000	4003000	Seriously?
4003000	4004000	Is it Pistachio Keyboard Cat?
4004000	4005000	It's like a new Keyboard Cat or something.
4005000	4006000	Oh my god, I didn't know that.
4006000	4008000	I knew that Cat wasn't alive.
4008000	4010000	That video was from the 80s, yeah.
4010000	4011000	Oh my god.
4011000	4013000	It's like America's Funniest Home Videos or something.
4013000	4014000	Alright, anyhow.
4014000	4015000	News!
4015000	4016000	Yes, please.
4016000	4017000	I could talk about Keyboard Cat all night, but let's get into it.
4017000	4027000	Alright, so Valve, of course, they had their Dev Days this week, and no one was allowed
4027000	4028000	to talk about Dev Days.
4028000	4032000	But people did talk about Dev Days, and some of the things that came out from tweets and
4032000	4033000	all sorts of stuff.
4033000	4039000	That, of course, and this is kind of a big duh, that Valve wants to offer digital music
4039000	4043000	video and TV as part of SteamOS.
4044000	4049000	In other words, I'm guessing they want to implement music streaming services and movie
4049000	4052000	streaming services, Netflix, Hulu, that kind of stuff.
4052000	4053000	It makes sense.
4053000	4059000	I mean, most game consoles nowadays have something like that, if not all of those services.
4059000	4066000	So, I would be fine with that on SteamBox as well, even if it's not necessarily part
4066000	4068000	of SteamOS, just on Steam.
4068000	4072000	That would be fantastic, because then I would be able to get rid of our crappy boxy.
4072000	4077000	This is kind of interesting, because it's not a surprise, especially considering Steam
4077000	4081000	already sells desktop apps, this is not one bit of a surprise that this exists.
4081000	4087000	And Canonical, the company, the for-profit company behind Ubuntu, has done much the same
4087000	4088000	thing.
4088000	4093000	Cloud storage and music and videos and any other licensing deals that they can get their
4093000	4098000	hands on, I'm assuming in addition to also promoting copyleft things like Jamendo and
4098000	4109000	other non-all rights reserved copyrighted materials.
4109000	4115000	It is interesting to me, as far as I know, Steam is a couple hundred employees, maybe,
4115000	4121000	but when you scale to this size, when you support an OS and sign deals and post this
4121000	4126000	kind of stuff, their company size is going to triple.
4126000	4131000	If SteamOS goes somewhere, their company is going to grow by at least three to four
4131000	4132000	times.
4132000	4136000	Just the sheer volume of dealing with publishers and anybody else that they start doing business
4136000	4138000	deals with.
4138000	4143000	Great, another system for me to have Netflix on.
4143000	4145000	Yeah, tell me about it.
4145000	4150000	Well, at least we wouldn't get, at least on Hulu, we wouldn't get those messages saying,
4150000	4153000	sir, you can only watch this on the web.
4153000	4158000	Fuckers, I wanted to watch the end of fucking 30 Rock.
4158000	4165000	That's very true, Steam is intending to be, I assume, very much the antithesis of that.
4165000	4167000	We'll see.
4167000	4171000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundromatia with fognetwork.com,
4171000	4173000	use the pass phrase, beast.
4173000	4178000	One of the things that maybe I'll be able to watch on my new Netflix Steam box will
4178000	4180000	be the Magic the Gathering movie.
4180000	4184000	That's right, Magic the Gathering is apparently going to be adapted into a movie.
4184000	4188000	I thought this was supposed to happen some time ago, but I guess, I don't know, I guess
4188000	4190000	this has got some motion with it.
4190000	4194000	20th Century Fox has acquired the screen rights to Magic the Gathering.
4194000	4200000	The film studio wants the 20-year-old series of Magic the Gathering to become a mega franchise,
4200000	4205000	you know, like Lord of the Rings, which took one book and made it three movies, or three
4205000	4210000	books and three movies, or Harry Potter, which turned seven books into eight movies.
4210000	4214000	If you can adapt, you know, Battleship into a movie.
4214000	4219000	Well, I thought that's where I had heard this before, because I want to say, when they licensed,
4219000	4222000	like, didn't they license Battleship and, like, Clue?
4222000	4227000	Oh god, Candyland with motherfucking Adam Sandler.
4227000	4230000	Oh, that's gonna be fucking terrible.
4230000	4231000	Ew.
4231000	4234000	And, like, the Monopoly and, like, a bunch of other stupid shit.
4234000	4235000	Clue?
4235000	4242000	Clue, but not to be confused with the greatest movie of all time, The Clue from the 1980s.
4242000	4245000	It was not a remake of that, it was something, it would have been worse.
4247000	4250000	You can't get better than Clue from the 1980s.
4250000	4254000	Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm not even, we're not even pretend that they're even remotely related to that.
4254000	4256000	The math is simple. The math is simple. One plus one plus two plus one.
4256000	4259000	Flames, the side of my face.
4259000	4261000	I can't do it because I can't do the voice.
4261000	4263000	Heaving, heaving breaths, heaving.
4263000	4264000	I can do it.
4264000	4266000	I miss you, Madeline Kahn.
4266000	4269000	I know, I miss her so much. Alright, anyway, and Eileen Brennan, let us not forget you.
4269000	4272000	But, you know, no, no, no, no, no, no, yes.
4272000	4273000	Alright, moving on.
4273000	4274000	Different movie, but still.
4274000	4276000	Sorry, Magic the Gathering.
4277000	4280000	So, we don't know much, I mean, there's no director attached or anything like that.
4280000	4282000	This is just something that they are working on.
4282000	4285000	It's going to be made into a movie at some point.
4285000	4289000	But, you know, video game movies don't always exactly have the greatest track records.
4289000	4291000	We'll see how that Warcraft movie turns out.
4291000	4294000	It's time to rip off.
4295000	4296000	What?
4297000	4302000	Because it was a card game turned into a multimedia Digimon.
4304000	4309000	I don't know. I mean, the good news is it's not like the movie is going to be about people busting out cards.
4309000	4311000	Like, that's not how it's going to work.
4311000	4312000	That's what you think.
4312000	4313000	Maybe it will.
4314000	4322000	The Battleship the movie incorporated a huge gigantic feature that pushed on a certain square of water and then a torpedo...
4322000	4325000	Did it have Liam Neeson saying, you suck my battleship?
4325000	4326000	Maybe.
4326000	4328000	Because if it didn't have that, then fuck that movie.
4328000	4329000	It didn't fucking see that movie.
4329000	4334000	It had the pegs. The pegs were in the movie. That was the best part about it.
4334000	4335000	Are you serious?
4335000	4337000	Seriously, it's in the trailer.
4337000	4341000	I'm now equally motivated to see this movie and stay far, far away.
4341000	4344000	There's no interest in Battleship unless it has Liam Neeson saying, you suck my battleship.
4344000	4349000	You know what the advantage now of having rough voices as I can make my favorite complaint about everything.
4352000	4353000	Her dismissive voice.
4353000	4357000	All right then, Dar Sacher, if you have some better news for us, why don't you go right ahead?
4357000	4359000	For the record, Xanadu is a better movie.
4361000	4363000	If you want to talk about good, bad movies.
4363000	4370000	Well, at the start of the show, we talked about how the Nintendo was said to have flopped and they lied.
4370000	4374000	Or I should say Nintendo, the Wii U had flopped.
4374000	4386000	And it's a very big thing usually in light of fiscal underperformance that a CEO will be pushed into resigning.
4386000	4388000	Or may resign on his own.
4388000	4394000	However, Satoru Iwata said that he's not going to resign.
4395000	4400000	The direct quote says there will be no major management shake up in the short term.
4400000	4407000	He does say that he feels responsible and that it is important to get business going back again.
4407000	4418000	And another thing too that people aren't seeming to mention is that Nintendo went from having a 200 plus billion yen projection.
4418000	4426000	To operating at a 35 billion yen loss for the upcoming year.
4426000	4429000	I think they honestly can make it back.
4429000	4432000	But he says he's not going to step down.
4432000	4433000	Good thing they're sitting on piles of money.
4433000	4434000	I know, right?
4437000	4442000	But I mean, they've still got the 3DS. It's still performing incredibly strongly in Japan.
4442000	4445000	It's still performing decently in America and around the world.
4446000	4448000	It's still printing money.
4448000	4450000	So I don't think that they're going to be...
4450000	4452000	He has no reason to step down.
4452000	4457000	He hasn't ruined Nintendo, you know, with the release of the Wii U.
4457000	4461000	Yeah, all those damn pundits have ruined the Wii U.
4461000	4469000	Well, now that you go there, I go, see, this is why Nintendo is not going to come out and say that a console of theirs flopped.
4469000	4472000	Because their president isn't going anywhere and he's very stubborn.
4472000	4475000	And that's okay. I don't necessarily blame Iwata for this.
4475000	4480000	But I do think, and I'm a little hopeful in what I'm hearing here, that they talk about a management shakeup.
4480000	4484000	I don't think that means that Reggie's going to get fired or something stupid like that.
4484000	4487000	The crap did Reggie have to do with any of it? He's been the big cheerleader.
4487000	4492000	Well, because you know in an internet comment section somewhere, that's what they're saying on NeoGaf or some shit.
4492000	4501000	But anyway, what I really want to say about that is that maybe the good news that comes out of this as they talk management shakeup is that they'll hire someone from the outside.
4501000	4509000	And now that's how the bubble gets broken. If somebody comes in with some fresh perspectives, that could be a very, very good thing.
4509000	4517000	It does seem that Nintendo is very insular and that usually if they bring somebody in, they have to eventually, you know, tow the Nintendo line.
4517000	4520000	It's like their own special form of cultism, you know.
4520000	4526000	Can you imagine, sorry to add to the wank, but I can't resist.
4526000	4527000	Wait, I have to do it.
4527000	4530000	It's a gaming fan podcast. I have to.
4530000	4531000	I'm doing the wank motion.
4531000	4533000	All right, here we go.
4533000	4537000	Can you imagine if Nintendo had hired Don Mattrick?
4537000	4539000	Fuck.
4539000	4545000	I mean, but I could see a type of Nintendo coup along those lines, not necessarily him, but along those lines.
4545000	4550000	I could see them trying to lure over a big executive from some other company to...
4550000	4552000	That's just not the...
4552000	4556000	Tigerclaw, I don't think Iwata is going to be replaced by Miyamoto.
4556000	4560000	I mean, I don't think that it would happen and I don't think Miyamoto is...
4560000	4562000	I don't think Miyamoto wants to be that guy.
4562000	4567000	I think Miyamoto is more of a creative type than a business type.
4567000	4569000	Miyamoto wants to make games.
4569000	4571000	Exactly. He's living his dream.
4571000	4575000	He does that very well being that face of creativity.
4575000	4581000	Like when you see Miyamoto, like genuinely excited about one of his games, you can't help but be excited too.
4581000	4592000	No matter what you think about Nintendo, I think it's hard to argue that Miyamoto's enthusiasm is fucking infectious and Microsoft and Sony don't have that.
4592000	4594000	They don't have Miyamoto.
4594000	4602000	That's the thing that I think keeps Nintendo strong is the fact that they have people who are passionate about what they do.
4602000	4607000	Who love their jobs and want to keep doing the best that they can.
4607000	4610000	I really do like that they adhere to an ideal.
4610000	4612000	Because you don't really see a whole lot of that.
4612000	4614000	I mean, you certainly don't see it so much with...
4614000	4616000	You really don't see it at all with Microsoft.
4616000	4620000	Unless, you know, you're counting individual developers or a few people here and there.
4620000	4622000	For the most part, it's just towing their corporate line.
4622000	4625000	Sony is a lot the same way too.
4625000	4632000	Nintendo, you've got people who are enthusiastic about what they're doing and love what they do.
4632000	4641000	And I honestly would even think that the underperformance of the Wii U would be taken as a personal disappointment.
4641000	4644000	I mean, certainly the fiscal standpoint is going to have something to do with it.
4644000	4649000	But I think just from, oh, we love this thing and no one else loves it.
4649000	4655000	Like, when you have the ugliest baby in the world and you love it, but everyone else thinks you just have an ugly baby.
4655000	4657000	I hate to use that.
4657000	4660000	What a strange analogy, but okay.
4660000	4661000	But you get what I mean.
4661000	4662000	I do.
4662000	4665000	I mean, the system's only been out for a year.
4665000	4668000	I don't really think it's a failure yet.
4668000	4670000	And it could grow out of being ugly.
4670000	4672000	Babies grow.
4672000	4676000	Did I just hear Loki defend the Wii U?
4676000	4678000	He does it once in a while.
4678000	4681000	Nintendo was the prettiest girl at the whole ball last console generation.
4681000	4682000	Let's not forget.
4682000	4684000	Well, and here's the other thing.
4684000	4689000	And I want to put people, you know, this just goes back to bringing up what if Iwata was replaced by Miyamoto.
4689000	4692000	Imagine that you were living your dream job.
4692000	4694000	You got to make games.
4694000	4695000	This is what your passion was.
4695000	4701000	Or, okay, it would go the same thing if they said, what if they made Koji Kondo CEO.
4701000	4702000	He's a musician.
4702000	4703000	What he does is make music.
4703000	4709000	He develops the music and controls that part of whatever game environment he's working in.
4709000	4715000	I think we need to get the guy that was doing the drumming as part of that stage demonstration for Wii music.
4715000	4718000	That guy, he has a good future at Nintendo.
4718000	4729000	Well, my point is, if you try to offer that job to any of those guys, they'd probably turn it down right away and say, get someone who's a businessman to run the business.
4729000	4733000	Go to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
4733000	4737000	Let's see, Fifth Dream says Nintendo's ugly baby is Mario.
4737000	4741000	Mario's not ugly. He's just plain.
4741000	4746000	Let's see, Rama in chat says, Loki defends the Wii U. Take a shot.
4747000	4752000	And then, of course, there's some wank in our chat about who they should hire and so forth.
4752000	4754000	Thank you for posting my favorite Mario fan art ever.
4754000	4757000	Uh oh, who posted it? Akuma JP?
4757000	4759000	I love you, Akuma-san.
4759000	4761000	It's a radio show. You're not supposed to be sending the artwork.
4761000	4765000	No, it's one of the super buff Mario with the giant shroom.
4765000	4768000	It's Super Mario Bear, if you know what I mean. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
4768000	4769000	Yeah.
4769000	4770000	I did it.
4770000	4772000	Well, you've been in San Francisco for how long now?
4773000	4775000	I'll do it. I'll just bring the Wii U around.
4775000	4777000	He doesn't look Italian with expression.
4777000	4778000	I can do it.
4778000	4780000	It looks like Zangief costs playing Mario.
4780000	4781000	Here you go.
4781000	4784000	Alright, let's move on. Loki, what do you have?
4784000	4788000	Like I said, I'll take care of this. I can bring the Wii U back.
4789000	4791000	It's all up to me.
4791000	4793000	What would you do, Loki?
4793000	4797000	What would I do? Well, what wouldn't I do?
4797000	4801000	First off, you know, I put out some really kick-ass games on that system.
4801000	4805000	You know, we need a new Metroid and fuck, we're getting F-Zero this year.
4806000	4811000	I would just lower the price and actually make online decent.
4811000	4818000	All the OLR dream games, such as things like President Cat, Puzzle Sluts, all of them would be a reality.
4818000	4821000	What, they play Snap? Definitely.
4821000	4823000	Awesome. Alright.
4823000	4836000	So Apple has to settle with the Federal Trade Commission and now they have to pay out millions of dollars, 32 million dollars to be exact.
4836000	4848000	And that whole in-app purchase suit where people, you know, apparently were unlocking their system for like 15 minutes or something and their kids were racking up tons of charges.
4848000	4860000	Which basically, I don't know. I mean, I think it's a little ridiculous because people need to be a little bit more responsible.
4860000	4869000	But I understand at the same time, app developers are kind of making it very easy for people to rack up those huge numbers in in-app purchases.
4869000	4878000	And I know that they've kind of tweaked that now where it fixes that, but it's still kind of annoying that it kind of turned out that way.
4878000	4890000	But yeah, so apparently they're saying there's some people that spent thousands of dollars of, you know, their parents' money on games. Free to play games.
4890000	4893000	All those damn Smurf Berries.
4893000	4896000	I do like that they make it very clear now though.
4896000	4898000	And the Angry Bird Eagles.
4898000	4901000	Loki's right though. The changes are for the better.
4901000	4911000	Well, I think at one point, you know, they probably were making it so it's easy for you to make in-app purchases and they didn't really intend for people to do that.
4911000	4918000	But then they probably heard about all these stories about people racking up those things and then they made it even easier for kids to make those purchases.
4918000	4926000	But at the same time, I think there's a little bit of, you know, the parents not taking responsibility for their kids using their account and stuff.
4926000	4932000	I have to blame the parents a little bit, but apparently no one wants to blame the parents, so.
4932000	4937000	Going to the chatroom, because this is a really good point from our pal Segg over at live.vognetwork.com.
4937000	4945000	Segg says, the problem with in-app is that once you sign in for one purchase, you're not asked for a password for 15 minutes after.
4945000	4948000	And on Google Play Android, it's 30 minutes.
4948000	4954000	So it's honest for a parent to go, oh, okay, I'll pay 99 cent for my kid and then $2,000 later, dot, dot, dot.
4954000	4959000	Yeah, that's a really good point. I didn't realize it did that.
4959000	4963000	I like to prevent me. I'm the big kid I've got to prevent.
4963000	4966000	So I like to be asked, like, are you sure you want to spend this money?
4966000	4974000	So I don't like accidentally do something that's going to, you know, spend money or something if I, you know, have a moment where I forget to read something or whatever it is.
4974000	4978000	You know, I just I like having that extra safeguard in there.
4978000	4980000	So I didn't even realize it shuts off after 15 minutes.
4980000	4986000	That's not or doesn't shut off until 15 minutes. That's not good. That's not good.
4986000	4991000	All right. Let's move on anyhow with some more news. Jason.
4991000	5005000	Going back to episodes to Miss Dark Soccer's classic game of the week trend of featuring games that you may never have seen, whose characters have cameos in Namco High.
5005000	5008000	She taught us about a little game called Wonder Momo.
5008000	5015000	I had indeed never heard of this before. We sat around watching the video available at YouTube dot com slash Orange Launch Radio.
5015000	5022000	But Namco Bandai has launched a Wonder Momo teaser site at Wonder Momo dot JP.
5022000	5027000	It is literally a site with a silhouette of Momo in her Wonder Momo outfit.
5028000	5035000	And I really don't want to use a culturally incorrect picture.
5035000	5040000	It's a silhouette. So you just see, like, her helmet and whatnot. That's all you get.
5040000	5044000	There are other accents in the silhouette, of course, but nothing quite that detailed.
5044000	5050000	And then characters at the bottom, which represent the audience, I believe, unless it's the creature she was fighting.
5050000	5055000	No, it's pretty much similar to the audience heads.
5055000	5062000	Yes. The site literally features, as of this moment, features a splash that says Momo is back.
5062000	5069000	There has been a Wonder Momo comic that Jamie also talked about during that classic game of the week segment.
5069000	5073000	And we have no and this game never made it to America.
5073000	5081000	So, and again, it is also Wonder Momo dot JP, which announces some pretty specific intentions.
5081000	5093000	We don't know when it's going to come out, if it's going to be a port revival, new game, new media, as seems to be the case between Namco High and, again, this webcomic for Wonder Momo specifically.
5093000	5102000	Speculation is hugely up in the air, but a series from the 80s is on its way back in a prominent form, and it seems to be gathering a lot of attention and buzz.
5102000	5105000	And that can't possibly be a bad thing. Seriously.
5105000	5107000	Wonder Momo is a cute game.
5107000	5109000	It is. It was very fun watching that.
5109000	5112000	Even with gratuitous panty shots.
5112000	5117000	All of like six pixels, though? Let's be honest here.
5117000	5121000	You know they'll look for the fan service wherever they can get it.
5121000	5126000	Yes. And back in those days, well, maybe not so much in Japan.
5126000	5137000	Aren't there other games, not counting Namco High itself, aren't there other games that have had other characters whose games have had similar reboots in the last couple of months?
5137000	5140000	Or am I just making stuff up?
5140000	5143000	I'm probably just making stuff up and thinking of Namco High itself.
5143000	5144000	There's plenty I'd like to see.
5144000	5145000	Yeah.
5145000	5155000	Well, and what I didn't realize that the whole Namco High thing is that all the characters that they've brought in are, they have in their webcomic series from Shifty Look.
5155000	5158000	Which is also where this Wonder Momo webcomic is from.
5158000	5159000	Exactly.
5159000	5161000	So it's very much two-part.
5161000	5169000	And it will be nice to see how this continues and what prominence they decide to feature with Wonder Momo and many other characters.
5169000	5176000	Well, I would definitely, I would like to see either a remake or like an actual sequel or something.
5176000	5178000	It was a fun little game. I've played it.
5178000	5185000	Even Viewtiful Joe had the kind of implied with an audience motif and certainly there were some possibilities for Wonder Momo as well.
5185000	5190000	You can even say that Super Mario World was set on the stage.
5194000	5196000	That just short-circuited my brain.
5196000	5201000	Super Mario Brothers 3 had that literal stage where they had the curtain that raised in the very beginning of the game. Remember that?
5201000	5214000	Exactly. But there's actually a whole, I think, the first thing is, I kind of thought about it before and it had been mentioned before, but Game Theory, which is one of the YouTubes that I like,
5214000	5223000	even went into detail about how they're all set on the stage, how everything is done up like, not Mario World, it was Mario 3, thank you Rob, I'm sorry.
5223000	5233000	And how they're all on a platform and you can go behind the scenes to walk behind the scenery and then when you get to the end of the level, you're going backstage.
5233000	5242000	Yeah, they're all kind of curtain-y, transition-y, exit, exit, stage left, stage right, technically stage left because it's one stage, but yeah.
5242000	5246000	I never really gave that design a lot of consideration.
5246000	5252000	And it was 3 I was thinking of, but World had some of the same things incorporated in it.
5252000	5260000	Interesting. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that will be coming a little sooner than any other remake that we're talking about tonight.
5260000	5262000	Loki, is there anything for the US yet?
5262000	5271000	Not this week. 28th is the first step we get this month and then we'll be getting regular releases each week.
5271000	5280000	Alright, then give me a minute here, we'll travel to Japan and check out the releases there. Still no PlayStation 4 or Xbox One out in Japan, so there's no releases to read there.
5280000	5287000	What is it, February 22nd I believe is the big day for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Do we have a date for Xbox One in Japan? I don't think we do.
5287000	5290000	Yeah, I don't think they've announced anything.
5290000	5302000	It's still TBA. Well, meanwhile, you have some other things to look forward to, such as on the 24th we have, I'm sorry, the 23rd of this month we have on the PlayStation 3 Army of Two, The Devil's Cartel gets a price reduction.
5302000	5314000	Saints Row 4 also gets a Ultra Super Ultimate Deluxe Edition out in Japan. As far as new games go, you get Sengoku Basara 4 comes out from Capcom this week, that is finally out.
5314000	5322000	And I believe there is some special bundles and things that go with that as well, because, you know, who doesn't love bundles? Like limited editions and things like that.
5322000	5331000	On the Xbox 360 in Japan this week, just that same Saints Row 4 and then also Dragon Ball Z Battle of Z, which I believe is also on the PlayStation 3 as well.
5331000	5334000	You love your Dragon Ball games, don't you?
5334000	5341000	I've been getting a little nostalgic lately just because, yeah, I really am nostalgic for some Dragon Ball Z.
5341000	5352000	Well, you could get it on the PlayStation Vita as well. It's also out there this week as well as the Sega game named Utagumi 575 comes out in regular and limited edition this week on the Vita.
5352000	5360000	And I'm kind of like, what is this? It says it's a new genre ground. It takes literary sensibilities and mixes it with popular Japanese music.
5360000	5366000	The haiku, a Japanese poetic form that follows the strict rule of three lines following 575 syllables.
5366000	5370000	I know, it's like they read my mind tonight. Per line, a new style of gameplay is invented.
5370000	5379000	Instead of the formulaic approach of only matching button presses to various tempo-based patterns, Utagumi 575 incorporates this with a hiragana guessing game.
5379000	5385000	The result for players is that after filling the correct cadence requirements, a prompt for missing Japanese characters appears.
5385000	5392000	And these are filled by paying attention to the phrase that's displayed, the context of the song, and the rules of a haiku.
5392000	5395000	This sounds hard.
5395000	5403000	I was just thinking because I haven't said anything on air, but I'm planning on taking the JLPT N5 this year.
5403000	5407000	I was just thinking something like that would actually be really helpful for my studies.
5407000	5415000	It's a SEGA rhythm game. I gotta say, as quirky as that sounds, I love that it's something kind of different.
5415000	5420000	SEGA's made rhythm games more recently too, like that Rhythm Thief that was on 3DS. That was only last year.
5420000	5424000	Sorry, I didn't mean to take a tangent, but I thought that was pretty cool.
5424000	5427000	Like a rhythm game that's haiku-based. It's kind of neat.
5427000	5431000	On the Wii U this week? Nothing in Japan.
5432000	5438000	On the 3DS though, you do get Carlos, the Beast of Re-Eden comes out this week.
5438000	5441000	I'm trying to see what kind of game this is. Oh, it's a shooter.
5441000	5444000	It's a pew-pew shooting game.
5444000	5451000	It's more that isometric shooter though, not just above. It's more of using 3D shapes and stuff.
5451000	5455000	You were exactly correct, by the way, that February 22nd is the PlayStation 4 Japanese release date.
5455000	5458000	And no date outside of this year for Xbox One in Japan.
5458000	5462000	Alright. I like hearing that I'm right. You should say it more often.
5462000	5465000	I can fact-check everything.
5465000	5468000	You may be right about that, but you're so wrong in other ways.
5468000	5472000	Alright, let's see what the UK has to say for releases.
5472000	5478000	On January 20th, which I guess is technically today now for them, is Kick Beat for PC.
5478000	5483000	On the 21st is Chess 2, the sequel on Android. Whatevs.
5483000	5486000	It's chess. Again.
5486000	5493000	On the 22nd we have Insurgency for Mac and PC and OlliOlli for Vita.
5493000	5497000	On the 23rd there is Might & Magic X Legacy for PC.
5497000	5502000	Ninja Gaiden 3, the Ancient Ship of Doom for 3DS.
5502000	5504000	That be it. Arr.
5504000	5509000	Alright, there it is. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5509000	5512000	But first, Loki.
5512000	5515000	Alright, so let's see.
5515000	5519000	We've got a little bit of interesting rumor here.
5519000	5524000	And I don't know. It would be nice to get some new blood kind of in the series.
5524000	5532000	But there's a rumor that Silent Hill 9 is being, I guess, resurrected by Hideo Kojima.
5532000	5537000	That he is going to be working on the game series now.
5537000	5544000	And I don't know if that's actually going to be true now.
5544000	5548000	I know he's very busy with all the Metal Gear Solid 5 stuff.
5548000	5555000	But it would be kind of neat if he took it over because he does really good directing in his games.
5555000	5558000	But I don't know.
5558000	5562000	They need another solid series though. Pun intended.
5563000	5566000	Haha. A Kojima Silent Hill game.
5566000	5569000	I don't know. It sounds a little fan wankish to me.
5569000	5572000	But if it is true, it could be very interesting.
5572000	5578000	I think Silent Hill needs a nice kick in the butt to kind of get it back to where it was in its heyday.
5578000	5583000	I thought I saw another fan wank rumor not that long ago that they were trying to get Team Silent back together.
5583000	5585000	And I was like, good luck.
5585000	5588000	I mean, Akira Yamagata works for...
5588000	5591000	Well, they were saying that they were supposed to be resurrecting Team Silent as well.
5591000	5593000	And here's the other thing too.
5593000	5600000	The information that right now that they're kind of going off of is based off of a listing on IMDB which anybody can make.
5600000	5602000	So I don't know.
5602000	5604000	Oh, that's nothing. Yeah.
5604000	5606000	That's a huge rumor. That's for sure.
5606000	5608000	Alright. Well, let's talk about...
5608000	5610000	We are about to get into the Classic Game of the Week.
5610000	5613000	But let's talk about one of the great classics right now. Tetris.
5613000	5615000	Tetris always comes back.
5615000	5619000	It's like a rite of passage for any generation of gaming consoles.
5619000	5621000	Where's the Tetris game?
5621000	5626000	Well, the next-gen Tetris game for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming from Ubisoft.
5626000	5628000	They'll be the ones publishing this Tetris game.
5628000	5631000	We don't know more details than that.
5631000	5635000	It's just that the Tetris game will be on the digital channels.
5635000	5637000	Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
5637000	5639000	So I guess they're going to focus on a download title, which is fine.
5639000	5643000	Because paying $60 for a Tetris game would be a little bit ridiculous.
5643000	5645000	So I think the networks are the place to go.
5646000	5648000	I don't know what next generation is going to entail.
5648000	5653000	But I would imagine that probably more online, competitive-based elements.
5653000	5659000	You know, I gotta say though, since it's been a very Nintendo talking about what they've done right and wrong over the years.
5659000	5662000	Tetris on the DS was so freaking good.
5662000	5664000	It's going to be really hard to top that one.
5664000	5667000	Remember Tetris on the DS? That was a great port of that game.
5667000	5669000	Probably the best since the original NES version.
5669000	5672000	Just with all its different modes and the retro Nintendo stuff they brought into that.
5672000	5674000	Obviously Ubisoft can't do that.
5674000	5679000	But it'll be interesting to see what they decide to add to this as well.
5679000	5681000	So there you go.
5681000	5683000	No word on when it's coming out.
5683000	5688000	Maybe a year from now? A holiday?
5688000	5691000	Yeah, whenever it's done. So you can just wait.
5691000	5696000	While you're waiting for that Tetris game, maybe you want to take a moment out to experience a classic.
5696000	5698000	Well, Dark Soccer is here to help you out.
5699000	5702000	Because every week she dives into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5702000	5705000	Hey, you should be playing this game.
5705000	5707000	In my case it's blowing dust off of it.
5707000	5709000	She really likes diving.
5709000	5710000	She does.
5710000	5712000	I'm not a good diver. I'm more just like...
5712000	5713000	Dives into the vault.
5713000	5714000	She just plays Scrooge McDuck style.
5714000	5715000	I do a cannonball into it.
5715000	5717000	Dives into the mailbag. Scrooge McDuck style.
5717000	5719000	She plays one on TV.
5719000	5721000	She dives into the UK. Scrooge McDuck style.
5721000	5724000	I wish I could just dive to the UK. That would be awesome.
5724000	5727000	She's actually just singing Dive by B4U the whole time.
5727000	5730000	I just started humming that, but I have no voice, so stop it.
5730000	5731000	Dark Sakura.
5731000	5732000	Stop it.
5732000	5734000	What is the classic game of the week?
5734000	5737000	The classic game of the week is Taiko no Tatsujin.
5740000	5742000	That's actually from the Wii version.
5742000	5745000	I was trying to find older stuff and it only felt like the Evangelion.
5745000	5748000	But the Wii version had the cutest accessory.
5749000	5751000	That little inflatable drum.
5752000	5762000	And since I'm sticking with my Namco high theme, Donko is a character that showed up in Namco High who is a character in this.
5762000	5766000	And don't make me anything to look at while I'm doing classic game guys.
5767000	5773000	Taiko no Tatsujin came out in the US as Taiko Drum Master, but there were a bunch of different versions out in Japan.
5773000	5775000	We've seen an arcade version.
5775000	5784000	It came out on TBS, TBS, PST, PSP, Wii, Wii U, iOS, the Advanced Pico Bina, and other mobile versions.
5784000	5787000	I'm just watching this little video you got going.
5787000	5790000	This is insanity. Listen to the drum beat in this.
5794000	5795000	Wow.
5797000	5798000	Wow.
5798000	5799000	Yeah.
5801000	5804000	That one, I was like...
5804000	5807000	No, it's not Donkey Konga. Shut up, Bobby.
5807000	5809000	I mean, hearts, hearts, hearts.
5809000	5820000	But like I said, there were Chinese versions that came out to be used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia.
5820000	5822000	And we've seen other versions.
5822000	5824000	I've seen knockoffs of the game too.
5824000	5833000	Remember the one, the big single Taiko that was at John's Incredibly Mediocre Pizza, Rob?
5833000	5835000	We've seen stuff like that.
5835000	5836000	Yeah.
5836000	5846000	So anyway, basically you have two Taiko, and you have your sticks to play with it, and your notes are called ompu.
5846000	5856000	And as they move across the screen, you either have to hit the center, or you hit the end to make a certain type of sound.
5856000	5864000	And you have your Tamashi Geiji, which is your spirit gauge to show how well you're doing.
5864000	5871000	You have a red marker, which is your don, and your blue marker, which is your kato.
5871000	5878000	And it's exactly, you make the, to describe the noises that you're making.
5878000	5882000	So the don is in the face, the kato is the side.
5882000	5893000	And then you have the large ones that are basically, you know, large don and large kato that are double notes.
5893000	5903000	So you hit with, basically you hit both buttons on both sides of the drum, and the console releases, or in the drum you have to hit just really, really freaking hard.
5903000	5906000	And the drum just punched that thing in the face. That was adorable.
5906000	5908000	Oh Rob.
5908000	5910000	You actually gave me several videos to take a look at here.
5910000	5915000	I did. I think the third one is the Evangel, or the second one might be the Evangelion one.
5915000	5916000	No, this is Hatsune Miku.
5916000	5917000	Oh yeah.
5917000	5918000	We're gonna look at here in this video.
5918000	5921000	So I guess, is this one of her songs in the game?
5921000	5923000	I believe so.
5923000	5927000	That's, I love the little chibi Hatsune Miku at the bottom. Anyway, sorry.
5927000	5930000	And you see the little Miku running in the background?
5930000	5933000	Oh yeah.
5933000	5940000	So, and for the record I do have a little Taiko plushie.
5940000	5949000	So you also have a yellow bar called Renda where you hit either don or kato as many times as possible across it.
5950000	5952000	It doesn't build up your spirit gauge but gives you bonus points.
5952000	5957000	You have a balloon, which is called Husen Ompu.
5957000	5968000	You also have, it also goes with the Genki Renda, where if you hit don for a certain number of times within the time limit, then you get bonus points too.
5968000	5979000	You have all kinds of different, I'm not gonna go into all of them because there's a Kusudama, there's a Suzudon, there's all kinds of stuff that pops up.
5979000	5988000	And you get different kinds of power ups and health bonuses and different things to attack your enemy if you're doing boss battles.
5988000	5999000	Like on the DS ones like Dororo no Kai Daikessen and a lot of the different versions.
5999000	6011000	There's also a wrestling version, it's called Dual Note, which is based on wrestling, where you have to hit the Taiko repeatedly, more than your opponent does, so that you win.
6011000	6016000	Like I said, it's almost more like a tug of war, you know, whoever hits more wins.
6016000	6023000	And unfortunately this was only in the boss battles on Wii, Dodon, To, Todame.
6023000	6034000	So there's different versions, you have Easy, which is Kanton, Normal, Hutsu, and Hard, which is Musukashi, which is really hard.
6034000	6043000	And then you have a fourth difficulty that's in later games called Donderful, which is a combination of Don and Wonderful.
6043000	6054000	And you've got basically all your different note charts for how difficult, how easy they are, and it goes all over the board for how easy it is, or how hard it can be.
6054000	6070000	In your different options, and they've changed from different types, you have different Taiko sounds that will be working on different types of songs, I think, that play.
6070000	6077000	And they change them around, you can hit the different rim in your difficulty selection to change what your Taiko sounds like.
6077000	6079000	Oh gosh.
6079000	6080000	Pretty customizable.
6080000	6082000	I bet that's pretty funny.
6082000	6086000	This was one I wanted to play because we were talking about Dragon Ball Z earlier.
6086000	6089000	I was going to say, we want to switch up the video here a little bit because that last one just ran out.
6089000	6091000	So this is from the portable version of the game we're about to look at right now?
6091000	6092000	Yes.
6092000	6098000	This is actually the intro song to Dragon Ball Z, the original intro.
6098000	6100000	The audio is a little distorted.
6100000	6103000	That's exactly what it sounds like in the anime too, so don't worry about it.
6103000	6104000	Okay.
6104000	6106000	That one's actually a fun one to play.
6107000	6108000	So you've got different modifiers.
6108000	6112000	You have auto, which plays automatically, and you can look at the song, and you get full combo.
6112000	6119000	You get hidden, or as it's called, doron, which it's like it says.
6119000	6129000	You have speed modifiers, you have double speed, you have triple speed, quadruple speed, and then you can go up to eight.
6130000	6131000	I'm sorry.
6131000	6138000	It looks like it's just the symbols that move faster, like the modifiers we have in BeatMania.
6138000	6143000	And these have been eight since eight and why why happy roku daime.
6143000	6148000	You have perfect, where the song will end if a note is missed.
6148000	6152000	So if you're playing in perfect mode, you have to finish the whole song perfectly.
6152000	6157000	You have reverse, abekobe, which is backwards.
6157000	6158000	Different modifiers.
6158000	6166000	You have one called whimsical and haphazard, where it changes your notes from red to blue or vice versa, so you have to look at them differently.
6166000	6168000	Just all kinds of different stuff.
6168000	6178000	It's really, really just a complex little game for as much as it seems you're just hitting on a drum, or hitting on the rim of the drum.
6180000	6181000	So all kinds of different versions.
6181000	6187000	As far as what has come out, for the Japanese versions, there are plenty of them.
6187000	6199000	We've had arcade versions starting with Taiko no Tatsujin through Taiko no Tatsujin 14, then an overhaul in September 2010.
6199000	6201000	The first one came out February 2001.
6202000	6215000	And then the revamp, which is Taiko no Tatsujin from November 2011, and Taiko no Tatsujin Katsudon, and the Sorayo version that came out in March 2013.
6215000	6219000	For home versions, we've had three different on the DS, a bunch on 3DS.
6219000	6226000	The last one coming out November 29, 2012 called Taiko no Tatsujin Wii Chogokaban.
6226000	6229000	And there's been a Wii U version, Taiko no Tatsujin Wii U.
6229000	6247000	Tons on PS2, three on PSP, four on iOS, three on Android, one on Advanced Pikobina, and different mobile versions, two in Japan, which were Taiko no Tatsujin Pop Monthly and Taiko no Tatsujin Mobile, and then one that came out in South Korea.
6247000	6253000	We have had different guest appearances within the games.
6253000	6259000	Like I said, Hatsune Miku showed up in Portable DX, and I sent you that link.
6259000	6262000	And you can also play the same song in Project Diva.
6262000	6264000	A little crossover.
6264000	6266000	There's Puzzle and Dragons crossovers as well.
6266000	6270000	So tracks that were for Puzzle and Dragons.
6270000	6276000	But yet, I'm not going to be able to find any of this in America except for that one release they had, the Drum Master.
6276000	6278000	Nope. Sorry.
6278000	6283000	I remember one of my Balani friends had that, who I haven't seen him in forever. I miss him.
6283000	6284000	Well, there's been spin-offs.
6284000	6285000	Yeah?
6285000	6289000	There was a Taiko no Tatsujin character thing done in clay anime.
6289000	6294000	And it was in, it was for Kid Station, it was in Comic Bum Bum.
6294000	6296000	Then...
6296000	6297000	My bum is on my bum.
6297000	6304000	We had many versions, it was in Tales of the World, NariKiri Dungeon 3, which is, you know, another Amco game.
6304000	6307000	And in the DS game, Nodame Kontabile.
6307000	6315000	And then in Mario Kart Arcade GPDX, you have a theme. A Taiko no Tatsujin theme.
6315000	6317000	Alright.
6317000	6322000	And so I was just doing Taiko no Tatsujin. I didn't even touch Taiko Drum Master.
6322000	6323000	As we got it over here.
6323000	6324000	Yeah.
6324000	6329000	Which, I mean, basically it's the same game, we've just got different music, you know, licensing.
6329000	6335000	And I have that. I actually have a legit drum for it, and I have one of the knockoffs.
6335000	6339000	And it's fun, I love it. You know, like I said, I had to dust it off.
6339000	6340000	Yeah.
6340000	6345000	You know, so, uh, it's, oh wow, I'm totally lucky.
6345000	6347000	A good music game memory.
6347000	6349000	I mean, I'm totally jealous of Ikuma JP.
6349000	6350000	Why?
6350000	6354000	I used to own a three foot don and katsu saiyan doll.
6354000	6355000	Adorable.
6355000	6356000	What?
6356000	6358000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6358000	6361000	Taiko no Tatsujin, or Taiko Drum Master, if you will.
6362000	6366000	Uh, for, well, hell, there's fourteen of them, so it's pretty much on everything.
6366000	6367000	In the arcades.
6367000	6368000	In the arcades.
6368000	6370000	In the many, many, many, many more versions.
6370000	6377000	Well, you remember, um, Loki downloaded Taiko no Tatsujin for his PSP back in the day.
6377000	6378000	Yeah, I remember that.
6378000	6380000	He was talking about how to get all the important stuff.
6380000	6383000	Well, I just remember our friend Garrett had the big drum peripheral that he got.
6383000	6385000	And, yeah, I know.
6385000	6386000	I heard from Garrett.
6386000	6387000	I don't know what happened to him.
6387000	6388000	Yeah.
6388000	6389000	Hmm.
6389000	6390000	Oh well.
6390000	6392000	Get him back on the show at some point would be awesome.
6392000	6393000	Yeah.
6395000	6397000	Alright, uh, it is running long.
6397000	6398000	We gotta go to break.
6398000	6401000	Uh, but thank you Dark Soccer for taking us to a great music game from our past.
6401000	6403000	Uh, we're gonna be back with plenty more news.
6403000	6406000	The Fugal Question of the Week, which should be exciting tonight, because I didn't even
6406000	6409000	plan it this way on purpose, but we were talking haikus earlier.
6409000	6411000	We're gonna get some haikus in the Fugal Question of the Week.
6411000	6412000	Haiku.
6412000	6413000	Haiku.
6413000	6414000	Not haikus.
6414000	6415000	Haikai.
6415000	6416000	Haiku.
6416000	6417000	Haiku.
6417000	6418000	Haikus.
6419000	6420000	Haiku.
6420000	6421000	Haiku.
6421000	6422000	Haiku.
6422000	6423000	Haiku.
6423000	6424000	Haiku.
6424000	6425000	Hike a lot.
6425000	6426000	Alright, Dark Soccer is gonna have a meltdown, but we'll be back after this with more of
6426000	6427000	Orange Lounge Radio.
6427000	6430000	Stay tuned.
6430000	6431000	Baka.
6436000	6438000	Hi everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
6438000	6444000	We are live here on January 19th, 2014, with the 536th episode of our program already in
6444000	6445000	progress.
6445000	6449000	Thank you so much for joining us, be it that you're live here at the Voice Geeks Network,
6449000	6454000	VOG Network.com, or perhaps you're listening to us on the podcast feed via one of the many
6454000	6458000	iPhone apps that lets you listen to things like Stitcher Radio or TuneIn.
6458000	6462000	I just want to say a big thank you to checking out our show, no matter how you are choosing
6462000	6464000	to listen to it.
6464000	6466000	We've had a lot of pretty good debate on tonight's show.
6466000	6470000	We'll see if it continues with some more news that we're gonna get into in this half of
6470000	6471000	the show.
6471000	6476000	Loki, if you're back there on the Skype line, you're not gonna be here next week for sure,
6476000	6477000	right?
6477000	6478000	That's right.
6478000	6481000	Well, I hope, again, I know I said this a little bit last week, but since you are back
6481000	6485000	this week, and I didn't think you would be, I will say it once again, all of us here at
6485000	6488000	Orange Lounge Radio wish you all the best with the new child.
6488000	6489000	I know everything's gonna go great.
6489000	6493000	We can't wait to hear the name, which somebody had hoped you were gonna name your baby Tingle,
6493000	6495000	but it doesn't sound like that's gonna happen, right?
6495000	6497000	That's definitely not gonna happen.
6497000	6500000	We can't wait to hear all of that whenever you do come back, but, you know, take the
6500000	6501000	time you need.
6501000	6503000	We all understand.
6503000	6505000	Dark Soccer and I will somehow manage to continue on.
6505000	6509000	Jason will be here for at least a week or two, but after that, I don't know, we'll figure
6509000	6510000	something out.
6510000	6514000	Hopefully, Alan can fill in for a show or some of our other loyal, go-to people can
6514000	6516000	help us out if we need to.
6516000	6519000	So, enjoy your time off with the new child.
6519000	6520000	Alright, I will.
6520000	6523000	Alright, start us off, if you wouldn't mind, with some rapid-fire news.
6523000	6530000	Yes, so there was a teaser trailer, if you will, that was put out by Bossa Studios, who,
6530000	6538000	you may remember, did a little game on Steam called Surgeon Simulator 2013, and the video
6538000	6541000	is called Shh, I Dentist Now.
6541000	6547000	And so, it's kind of teasing a little bit, like, they have Surgeon Simulator coming soon
6547000	6553000	for the iPad, and hopefully we'll see some sort of, you know, add-on for Surgeon Simulator
6553000	6559000	2013, but it sounds like the iPad version might revolve around Dentistry, which, you
6559000	6563000	can only imagine how that'll go.
6563000	6568000	Yeah, I'm not excited about this game, because, you know, I'm not a big fan of the dentist,
6568000	6572000	no offense to any who may be listening, but it's just, you know, I'm one of those people.
6572000	6576000	So, yeah, I look at the idea, after seeing Surgeon Simulator, which, by the way, is a
6576000	6579000	part of the, I don't think this ever came up on the show, but Humble Bundle 10 is out,
6579000	6583000	and it's great, and it's to help charity, but Surgeon Simulator is one of the games
6583000	6589000	in it, and, yeah, after seeing that, when I hear about, like, this idea is really funny,
6589000	6591000	but I'll pass, thanks.
6591000	6598000	I'm, I am equal parts thrilled and horrified by it, because I don't mind dental work, I've
6598000	6605000	had a fair amount in my life, including something that only hosts, I...
6605000	6609000	They look fine to me. You don't gotta show me the back of your throat, Jason.
6609000	6611000	Ooh.
6611000	6612000	It's very sexy.
6612000	6616000	I can see your uvula.
6616000	6623000	I am equal parts thrilled, horrified, and prepared to play this game, because, if it's
6623000	6628000	any, if it's even remotely as impossible as Surgeon Simulator is, and it will be, it'll
6628000	6633000	be a good time, but with lots of drills and noises and whirly bits and picks and spoke
6633000	6634000	spiky things.
6634000	6639000	I think I'm, like, the only person I know that doesn't have dentist trauma. I always
6639000	6640000	fall asleep because I'm bored.
6640000	6643000	Consider yourself lucky.
6643000	6647000	It's just an awesome, I'm kind of curious to see how it's gonna work as far as, because,
6647000	6651000	you know, the whole point of Surgeon Simulator is that the controls are really hard to, you
6651000	6658000	know, use, and so, you know, with an iPad, I guess it would be a little bit easier, I
6658000	6662000	think, with the touchscreen, maybe, I guess, they're gonna map it exactly the same, you
6662000	6668000	know, one hand does the, you know, five keys, and the other hand moves the actual arm. I
6668000	6669000	don't know.
6669000	6670000	We'll see.
6670000	6678000	All right. And then, moving on, Unity is coming to the Vita, and this is great if you are
6678000	6685000	an up and coming game developer. Now you can actually port your Unity games that you make
6685000	6693000	in, for the Vita, I guess, and I think now, man, I think Unity supports pretty much almost
6693000	6699000	all console platforms now. It's, I know, at least the entire PlayStation suite. I'm not
6699000	6705000	really sure. It's been a while since I actually looked at Unity, but, yeah, so support for,
6705000	6711000	you know, all the sensors, the cameras, analog sticks, touchpad, all that fun stuff. And
6711000	6719000	that's, I guess, with Unity 4.3. And, in fact, they're saying that there is a game, Stick
6719000	6726000	It to the Man, that was developed, I guess, on PS3 and Vita, and that's with Unity as
6726000	6733000	well, and that's, I think it's already out or coming out very soon. So that's kind of
6733000	6739000	cool, I think. Especially since it's relatively, I mean, well, it's free to use non-commercially,
6739000	6743000	and if you make, I think, over $10,000 in the year or something like that, then you
6743000	6749000	have to pay the licensing fee, which isn't that expensive. And last but not least, Apple
6749000	6758000	and Google have pulled a game, if you will, that was promoting plastic surgery for children.
6758000	6763000	It was a game called Plastic Surgery for Barbie, which I'm sure probably could, you know, have
6763000	6769000	been pulled just because, you know, the copyright infringement on the name itself. But basically,
6769000	6775000	it was a game aimed at kids, you know, I guess it was marked suitable for kids 9 and over,
6775000	6782000	and had you performing plastic surgery procedures on female characters, you know, such as liposuction
6782000	6788000	and on the characteristics problem areas. And you compare the before and after shots,
6788000	6793000	and they were saying, you know, some of the results, like, this unfortunate girl has so
6793000	6798000	much extra weight that no diet can help her, you know. In our clinic, she can go through
6798000	6802000	surgery called liposuction that will make her slim and beautiful. So apparently, people
6802000	6807000	were offended, you know, that it's giving children the wrong idea.
6807000	6809000	Well, did they really think that people...
6809000	6810000	It is giving the wrong idea.
6810000	6813000	It is. It is a little offensive, actually.
6813000	6820000	Yeah, and I think Mattel was one of the ones also that kind of, you know, helped in pulling
6820000	6825000	that since, you know, obviously they mentioned Barbie in there, and, you know, they want
6825000	6828000	that associated with any of the Mattel stuff.
6828000	6833000	I mean, this picture doesn't look like any Barbie I've ever seen, but maybe that's just me.
6833000	6835000	Yeah.
6835000	6839000	All right. Moving on to some other news that I have for you guys. Some eShop releases for
6839000	6844000	Nintendo, because they are still putting some classics out there as we go.
6844000	6848000	UnEpic is now out on the Wii U. This game's been out for a couple of years, but it's that
6848000	6854000	platformer that has some RPG elements, D&D, NES-style gameplay. Or as Nintendo puts it,
6854000	6858000	UnEpic is a mixture of platform game, role game, I think it's a role play game, and joke
6858000	6862000	that takes place in a huge castle of medieval fantasy. It is set in the 80s style, but
6862000	6867000	completed with the most actual features. So, okay. That is available.
6867000	6868000	Wow.
6868000	6871000	I haven't checked that out on Steam. I haven't checked that out on Steam. I think it's in
6871000	6876000	my wish list, but anyway. So that is now out. You can also check out F1 Race Stars
6876000	6880000	Powered Up Edition, which is kind of like a cutesy cart game. You can check that out.
6880000	6884000	And then as far as Virtual Console goes, this is pretty cool. Castlevania II, Simon's
6884000	6890000	Quest. I think this game kind of gets shit on unnecessarily, but I kind of think it is
6890000	6895000	the reason we have things like Super Metroid and Metroidvania, meaning like, you know,
6895000	6899000	Symphony of the Night and so forth. It really kind of can be traced back to a game like
6899000	6904000	Castlevania II, which I love imperfections and all. And Badass Soundtrack, most importantly.
6904000	6906000	Absolutely Badass Soundtrack.
6906000	6911000	Speaking of classics, more PlayStation 1 or PS1 games are going to be out on the PlayStation
6911000	6918000	network in January and February, thanks to Monkey Paw Games. The big release they're
6918000	6923000	going to come out with on February 18th is Tomba 2, The Evil Swine Return. I remember
6924000	6931000	the Tomba games. The original Tomba is already out. That came out in 2012. But some other
6931000	6937000	games that will be coming out, Double Dragon, the Neo Geo Double Dragon. This is the one
6937000	6942000	that's based on the film adaptation of Double Dragon. That's why they got that out of the
6942000	6947000	way first, I'm thinking. But some other games that are coming out, let's see, Lucifer Ring,
6948000	6954000	The Fireman 2, Pete and Danny, Hyper Crazy Climber, and Wolf Fang. So these are obviously
6954000	6958000	very niche, kind of cult titles. But I think that's really cool because, you know, a whole
6958000	6962000	new audience can kind of find these now thanks to PlayStation Network. So that's neat. And
6962000	6970000	lastly, if you were looking forward to Star Wars 1313, you might be waiting a long time
6970000	6974000	because unfortunately, Star Wars 1313, although we saw it at E3 2012, we knew it was going
6974000	6979000	to have some issues once Disney bought LucasArts. Well, Disney let the trademark on Star Wars
6979000	6985000	1313 lapse. And that's not a good sign. That means they probably aren't doing anything
6985000	6990000	with it now unless maybe they could have took some of it and put it in a new game. And that's
6990000	6995000	probably what's happened with this is that they are making it work for a different video
6995000	7000000	game to come out in 2015 with the new movie. You basically said the same thing when the
7000000	7005000	acquisition happened. But we basically knew that this happened when they shuttered LucasArts,
7005000	7009000	at least as far as development, development such publisher is concerned. Right. But this
7009000	7014000	was this was this. And I think some of us were explicitly called out as being I think
7014000	7018000	some of us were holding out hope that maybe they would shuffle it around some didn't happen.
7018000	7025000	Didn't happen. They're saying all the rogue squad, rogue crap, not Rogue Squadron. That's
7025000	7032000	the N64 and GameCube game. Attack Squadrons reached started sending out beta codes last
7032000	7037000	week. I didn't get one, but I'm still holding out hope. Oh, all right. There is new Star
7037000	7041000	Wars content. So, yeah, it's still actually happening on over to dark soccer for the rest
7041000	7048000	of our rapid fire news. Just a few things. Gabe Newell says he's fine with origin being
7048000	7053000	on steam machines. He's not worried. In fact, he says we're trying to make it as open as
7053000	7057000	possible. If he wants to put origin on it, that would be fine. Does origin even exist
7057000	7063000	outside of Windows? Hmm. I don't think it does. He said, well, if he would have to make
7063000	7070000	sure. Sure. But they're not they're not like if they want to, then they can. So, yay, that's
7070000	7081000	very kind of him. I don't think he has anything to worry about. And then there is a demo out
7081000	7092000	for a He-Man playable side scroller and brawler. And it is available for PC on Gamejolt. And
7092000	7096000	there's files for an Android version that's on a Dropbox. But you'd have to follow the
7096000	7103000	link. And they're planning on making Shira as a playable character. Sweet. And then we
7103000	7108000	have to find that little wizard guy hiding in the background somewhere. What's his name?
7108000	7116000	Orko. Orko. Yeah. And I think in for Shira, she had Madame Cal. So, no, no, not Madame
7116000	7122000	Cal. What am I saying? Cal was the owl thing. It was Madame Crap. Not Madame Crap, but I
7122000	7127000	don't remember. Now I'm thinking about the He-Man movie from 1984. It was Dolph Lundgren.
7127000	7132000	And Courtney Cox was in that movie. I was one of our first roles. With her big hair.
7132000	7136000	With her big hair. By the way, go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com. SEG is there
7136000	7144000	to let us know. Origin is on the Mac. So there you go. And then last news. This is sad
7144000	7150000	news. Is that the Doctor Who MMO is shutting down. As of February 28th, 2014, it will no
7150000	7155000	longer be available. All the transactions have already been suspended. But we can still
7155000	7160000	play Doctor Who Legacy. I didn't even know there was like a full on MMO out there. Yeah.
7160000	7168000	Because I keep seeing it turn up in what TV thing should be an MMO. Wasn't too interested.
7168000	7173000	Alright. Well, let's get into our coughing fits. Let's get into our FUGL question. Hey,
7173000	7177000	I've been doing it all show. Let's get into our FUGL question of the week. You take Facebook
7177000	7187000	and Google and slam them together, you get FUGL.
7187000	7191000	Every week we go to our Facebook and Google Plus fan communities. Available at facebook.com
7191000	7197000	slash orange lounge radio and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio. And we ask a question
7197000	7202000	and we read some of our favorite answers on air. Although I made it a little trickier
7202000	7207000	tonight. So we've got less answers because of it and they're all short. But that's alright.
7207000	7214000	Because we love haikus. And sure enough. Haiku. Haikais. That's a completely different word.
7214000	7219000	Alright. Anyhow, the question we asked, so we're going to ask the obvious question, what
7219000	7225000	would you do to boost sales of Nintendo products? But all answers must be written as a haiku.
7225000	7229000	Five syllables, seven syllables, five. Let's see how many people broke the rule. I will
7229000	7232000	be the haiku enforcer. Will you be the syllable police tonight? I will be. Alright, let's
7232000	7236000	go to Google Plus first because I always forget to start with Google Plus. So I'm going to
7236000	7241000	start with them tonight. So let's start with act deft. I'm going to actually dim the music
7241000	7244000	here to make it a little easier for you to be the syllable police. Alright, here we go.
7244000	7254000	Act deft. To avoid a flop. Nintendo needs games a lot. New marketing works. That pass?
7254000	7258000	That passes. Alright, good. That's actually really well written. Yeah, that's good. That
7258000	7267000	goes together very well. Retertainment. Create a better. Platform for online gameplay. Also
7267000	7274000	boobs, boobs, boobs. That was awful. There was no artistry to that. You fail. But it
7274000	7278000	passes. It passes. It passes five, seven, five and that's all I need to do. It passed
7278000	7282000	five, seven, five and you worked boobs into it. So I'm okay with it. I give that a 10
7282000	7290000	out of 10. No, no, no, no. It's a 17 out of 17. You need to stop. Total syllables. Five,
7290000	7299000	seven. Just stop. Paul L. I'll see myself out. Paul L. Here we go with Paul L. on Google
7299000	7308000	plus. Drop the price by half. Unique use of the touch pad. Pokemon Wii U. There you go.
7308000	7313000	Very good. These are awesome. See, I love haiku nights on Fugu question of the week.
7313000	7318000	I should do haikus everywhere. Excuse me. Haiku. We should do this show in haiku. That's
7318000	7322000	never going to happen with my big mouth, her big mouth, your big mouth. No, maybe five
7322000	7327000	hours, seven hours, five hours. All right. And you definitely being the seven. Let's
7327000	7333000	be real here. I have to work in the morning. All right. Travis H. Please give us more games.
7333000	7341000	Wii U smells kind of moldy. Do not do cell phones. But then in parentheses, he put mobile
7341000	7346000	gaming rumor barf. I think you're not allowed to have four lines, sir. Not, not quite. Not
7346000	7351000	quite. Last one. Oh, wait, no, do not do. Yeah, that's, that's, yeah, there's something
7351000	7355000	at the seven. It was like a bonus. It was like the bonus scene on the DVD. It was like
7355000	7361000	the extra line. All right. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Minus that extraneous sentence. Anyways,
7361000	7368000	there you go. Facebook tech 2030 on Facebook. Pokemon is what Nintendo must use to save
7368000	7375000	their failing console. It passes. I'm failing is a strong word, but I, again, it's, it's
7375000	7381000	hard to sugar coat the numbers. It needs to do better. A degenerate Johnny expand a first
7381000	7389000	party. Nintendo must be Disney. Buy up third parties. That's what Nintendo should do. All
7389000	7392000	right. You're not going to put games on the system. Fine. We'll just fucking buy you with
7392000	7396000	all this cash we have on hand. I wonder if they have, I can buy and sell you bitch. Probably
7396000	7399000	not. No. Realistically, they probably don't have enough to buy EA, but you never know.
7399000	7404000	Not EA, not EA, but their market caps are past Sony. So then maybe we should just buy
7404000	7409000	some, no bloody bloody blah. It was a terrible. I understand how finances work. All right.
7409000	7416000	Renee in a, for our buddy from Koopa club responds with the following Nintendo only
7416000	7423000	has to do one simple thing. HD retro games, NES remix. Anyone?
7423000	7429000	Eh, any S remix? I already told you my issues with that. Baseball is not a fucking retro
7429000	7435000	classic. All right. Neither is wrecking crew. Other than the horror. No, nevermind.
7435000	7441000	Continue please. No need to do their own version of super Mario crossover. There's only. Yeah.
7441000	7447000	Right now. That would be awesome. Like honestly, just why don't just do super Mario crossover.
7447000	7451000	I mean, all respect to the guys who made it, but since they kind of took a bunch of that
7451000	7455000	Nintendo's characters, Nintendo stealing their game would only be fair play. All right.
7455000	7460000	Our buddy Flaco Jones responds and says, no more 3DS games,
7460000	7465000	no more 2DS games, no more Wii U games. I don't think that's a haiku.
7465000	7470000	Someone missed the memo. You missed the memo. Just Nintendo games that play on all current
7470000	7475000	Nintendo consoles. They're all dual screen anyway, so it's not a huge stretch. You didn't do a haiku.
7475000	7482000	Boo. Sort of. Boo. Sometimes. All right. KJ. Fatal frame Wii U.
7482000	7488000	Lots of ghosts and scares for you. Body not ready.
7488000	7493000	That was four seven, four seven five. Unfortunately, no fatal frame Wii U.
7493000	7498000	That's five. I just police the police. Well, all right. I'm going to say
7498000	7502000	the next one I'm going to save for last because that's my favorite. So we're going to do that last.
7502000	7507000	All right. Dark charger said frame Wii U though. I mean, I liked fours engine.
7507000	7511000	And if they smooth out some of the rough edges and oh my God. OK. All right.
7511000	7517000	Dark charger says, understand online, focus on games, not gimmicks, cross platform support.
7517000	7522000	I'm not sure what else. What cross platform or maybe 3DS.
7522000	7527000	Eddie, who hasn't been on this show in forever. He really thinks that games should be not exclusive.
7527000	7532000	Nintendo to boost software. And that will be the first foot in the grave if that happens.
7532000	7537000	All right. Our buddy Eddie, who used to go by the doctor on this show and I hope he comes back someday.
7537000	7542000	I miss I miss his face. Eddie says, Legend of Zelda. Be unapologetic.
7542000	7547000	Oh my God. That's a hard word. Rage against machine.
7547000	7552000	Critical Myth says, Abandon Wii U. Publish to competitors.
7552000	7558000	Focus on handheld. Again, I know that's what people want, but we'll focus on handheld.
7558000	7563000	That's published on competitors over a Wada's dead body.
7563000	7568000	All right. Awesome Unicorn. I love that name.
7568000	7576000	So Awesome Unicorn says, To play is to love. Nintendo's strength and downfall.
7576000	7581000	Price drop. More titles. That was strangely poetic. I like that one.
7581000	7586000	All right. Renee sent a couple more haikus, but one haiku per person.
7586000	7596000	Fifth Dream responds and says, Any games but these? Zelda, Mario, Metroid. Do something new, please.
7596000	7601000	Michael H wrote a response that definitely was not a haiku. Sorry, sir.
7601000	7607000	Rob H. Definitely not a haiku. Sorry, sir. But Fifth Dream responded, which I think is a haiku.
7607000	7614000	Fifth Dream says, One of the best games Nintendo needs to reboot. Hey, you, Pikachu.
7614000	7617000	Oh, yeah. That'll do wonders for them.
7617000	7624000	All right. But here it is. This is the winner. You get a gold star, sir. This is my favorite out of all the responses. You ready?
7624000	7629000	Here you go. Gold star haiku, but I need it to be policed. From Red the Haze.
7631000	7634000	Sorry. I love this haiku. Okay, here we go. Ready?
7634000	7641000	Price drop. Price drop drop drop. Wub wub wub wub wub wub. M-rated games, please.
7644000	7653000	It passes. Price drop. Price drop. Price drop drop drop. Wub wub wub wub wub wub wub wub.
7653000	7658000	No. You win, sir. You win an internet. Congratulations. No.
7658000	7664000	Red the Haze, your username has never been more appropriate considering that Rob's face is being red right now.
7664000	7669000	Price drop. Price drop drop drop wub wub wub wub wub. No.
7669000	7674000	I'm gonna be- I'm gonna be like walking to the mall tomorrow for some sale or something and I'm just gonna be in the middle of the mall.
7674000	7679000	Yeah. I'm gonna start strutting. Price drop. Price drop drop wub wub wub wub wub.
7682000	7685000	All right. Well, I'm glad we could laugh on this episode for once.
7685000	7689000	All right. Hey, we've been having a good time. We've been having a good time.
7689000	7692000	We've been having quite the gay old time.
7692000	7697000	All right. Actually, Black Wolf says I could give him loot. That's right. I could assign him specific loot. Maybe I will do that.
7697000	7703000	I'll see if he has a VoG network account. I'll give him some type of- I'll give him a cherry blossom or something because he's such a haiku.
7703000	7707000	Give him the- Give him a dubstep gun. A dubstep gun. Yeah, I was gonna say a dubstep gun.
7707000	7711000	Well, I'm not- We can't give things that are copyright. Like, I can't give out Mickey Mouse ears.
7711000	7715000	Give him an extraneous bass EDM gun. All right.
7715000	7718000	Give him a golden 575. There you go. All right.
7718000	7721000	Hey, that's a good idea. There you go. All right.
7721000	7726000	And to make like ripples for the bass. Like, 575 with a big button in it. Sorry.
7726000	7728000	All right. We'll figure something out.
7728000	7732000	I'm sorry. Tigerclaws said haiku dubstep. Let's make it happen.
7732000	7736000	I only keep thinking about is there's a- You know what Enka is, right?
7736000	7737000	Yes, I do.
7737000	7739000	There's an Enka singer who-
7739000	7741000	In case the listeners don't, you might want to explain.
7741000	7752000	It's really sad, sappy. It's done a really melancholy style and it's pretty much just for- just a Japanese style.
7753000	7762000	But there's a singer out there who is a quarter Japanese named Jetero and he does Enka hip-hop style.
7762000	7768000	And that's all I was thinking about is Jetero. He does nothing but Enka covers hip-hop style.
7768000	7774000	So, anyway. I have like his last two albums. They're very good.
7774000	7777000	Well, for all the big audience looking for that. All right.
7777000	7779000	Yes, I like Enka. Shut up.
7779000	7782000	All right. Let's move on with some more gaming news. Loki.
7782000	7790000	All right. So, let's see. I was kind of distracted by it. I was actually looking at a further topic here.
7790000	7798000	Let's talk a little bit about baseball. And, you know, it's funny. We had a baseball series.
7798000	7802000	Well, the 2K series just kind of up and cancel itself.
7802000	7809000	Now, we have an old baseball series coming back. And RBI Baseball is that series.
7809000	7815000	It's RBI Baseball 14. It's supposed to be coming out from Time Warner Interactive.
7815000	7819000	Or, yes, I'm sorry. The Time Warner Interactive did the original one.
7819000	7824000	But this one's supposed to be coming out on consoles and mobile.
7824000	7831000	And it doesn't really say on who's developing yet. But, I don't know.
7831000	7837000	It's interesting to see that coming back. I don't know if it's actually going to be like a full-fledged game.
7837000	7841000	You know, when they mention mobile, I always think something, you know, very quick being done.
7841000	7848000	But it'd be interesting to see yet another series and hopefully something that's actually on the Xbox.
7848000	7854000	Because right now the only option for baseball is, you know, MLB 14 the show.
7854000	7860000	Yeah, something that finally gets baseball games back in the limelight considering the news we've been reporting on over the last month.
7860000	7864000	Yeah. I'm surprised they couldn't, like, have, you know, they just gave up on that.
7864000	7869000	You know, maybe just 2K Sports, they've been doing pretty good stuff with NBA.
7869000	7876000	I'm surprised that they couldn't do that same type of thing with MLB. I don't know.
7876000	7879000	As much as I like the whole idea of like, ooh, retro with RBI baseball.
7879000	7883000	You know, obviously I'm not a big sports gaming person anyway.
7883000	7886000	But I don't remember RBI baseball really being a particular favorite of mine.
7886000	7889000	So, when I kind of hear this is coming back, I'm like, eh.
7889000	7892000	Maybe it's just one of those things where it's like in name only. I don't know.
7892000	7896000	Well, and also too, you know, not everything that comes back was necessarily great.
7896000	7901000	Because remember they did a redo of Tecmo Bowl and I don't think that was that great on the Wii either.
7901000	7906000	It really wasn't, which was really unfortunate. It just wasn't the same as the original.
7906000	7911000	Or Blitz. You know, remember Blitz? They tried to make it all hardcore.
7911000	7914000	Or NBA Jam. Oh my God, the new NBA Jam was really not good.
7914000	7915000	Yeah.
7915000	7919000	So, yeah, sometimes it's just not the same. But it could also end up being better. Who knows?
7919000	7924000	Speaking of reboots, here's a game that they rebooted and it came out way better.
7924000	7927000	Like, it was for the better for it. And it's Tomb Raider.
7928000	7932000	And there is yet some more news coming out on Tomb Raider as we're heading into the, what is it?
7932000	7936000	The definitive Lora's Hair edition. You know, the one that's coming out soon.
7936000	7938000	Definitive and game of the year.
7938000	7940000	I was going to say, definitive game of the year edition or whatever.
7940000	7948000	So, Tomb Raider is, the big kind of buzz quote about the story this week is that
7948000	7954000	Tomb Raider is finally in the black. Meaning it's finally been a profitable game.
7954000	7959000	And this goes back to that story where they mentioned that Square Enix at one point had said,
7959000	7964000	oh, very disappointed that the game didn't sell, you know, what it was supposed to.
7964000	7969000	And only 3.4 million. Well, they were expecting 5 to 6 million.
7969000	7975000	Well, a lot of that has to do with the cost to make the game. Because, you know, pretty games don't come cheap.
7976000	7985000	So, the news got around and in an interview with Eurogamer, executive producer Scott Amos said that quote,
7985000	7993000	by the end of last year, Tomb Raider is in the black. We've crossed the line of profitability for the last gen and PC versions.
7993000	7998000	And so I imagine the definitive edition, I mean, I don't want to call it a cash in.
7998000	8003000	Because, you know, obviously it looks like they've done more than just port the game to the other system.
8003000	8005000	So I want to give it a little more credit than that.
8005000	8009000	But obviously it's kind of a way to put it even further in the black, let's say.
8009000	8014000	I imagine a game like this didn't cost nearly that same amount of money to end up making.
8014000	8018000	So to try to get this out there for the people that might have missed Tomb Raider the first time,
8018000	8024000	you know, now that they're getting PlayStation 4s in the house or what have you, or Xbox Ones is the case maybe.
8024000	8031000	I imagine, you know, it's going to push itself even further into the black and hopefully justify the continuation of the series.
8031000	8035000	Because I think all of us here at OLR, as well as you guys in chat and so forth,
8035000	8039000	we'd like to see a sequel in this style of Tomb Raider. At least I know I would.
8039000	8045000	I hope that if they do do a sequel, however, though, that we get to start in Loras' mansion and commit suicide in hideous ways,
8045000	8047000	just like in the original PC game.
8047000	8049000	That was great. That was in the second one.
8049000	8054000	Or as Dark Sakura will call it, Girl 2.
8054000	8058000	I need to find that picture again and link it to everybody.
8059000	8062000	I have to thank Alan for the idea.
8062000	8065000	Other continued comments from that interview.
8065000	8068000	As a franchise, Square Enix has clearly invested in us.
8068000	8074000	They already let us get kickstarted on a sequel and they backed us with the game's upcoming definitive edition.
8074000	8078000	That's right. We already knew it because that comic thing had spoiled and they had to come out and say,
8078000	8081000	yes, we're doing something else. So there you go.
8081000	8085000	They've always been behind us regardless of maybe what was said or how it was said in the press.
8085000	8090000	And certainly at the end of the year, we've actually gone over expectations because we've managed to get profitability back.
8090000	8095000	So great. Can't wait to see what's next in that franchise.
8095000	8097000	It'll be a lot of fun.
8097000	8101000	All right. Let's go on with some more stories. Dark Sakura.
8101000	8105000	Well, I have a story.
8105000	8109000	As soon as my tablet stops choking. There we go.
8109000	8121000	Basically, Valve has paid the community content creators four hundred thousand dollars collectively in the first week of January.
8121000	8124000	They they did it during.
8124000	8127000	They actually came up with a statement on Steam Day.
8127000	8134000	And the content, you know, like we all know, is just regular people out there making content to resell.
8134000	8144000	You know, whether it be Team Fortress 2 stuff or, you know, making gifts for other people, making.
8144000	8147000	You know, there's all kinds of different games and items that have come out.
8147000	8154000	So. Steam's paying for it. So they're like, thank you. Here, have money.
8154000	8159000	Which makes me kind of want to do hats now. Should I make hats, Rob?
8159000	8166000	Hats would be awesome, actually. So. Very cool. All right.
8166000	8171000	Well, let's move on with just a couple more stories for the mailbag. Loki.
8171000	8180000	Yes. So, you know, you may have heard that there's been some multiplayer alpha invites going out for Titanfall.
8180000	8188000	And of course, all of them are under NDA, which means we need to upload that shit to the Internet as fast as possible.
8188000	8195000	And that's what's happened. So there's a lot of gameplay from Titanfall making it out to the Internet.
8195000	8201000	And I don't know, I've actually checked out some of it. It looks better than I thought it would be.
8201000	8207000	And looks actually quite fun. Although, you know, some of the stuff in there is very early.
8207000	8213000	Like the textures are only 25%. As detailed as they're going to be in the final version.
8213000	8219000	Which, that being said, they still look really good already, so I don't know.
8219000	8230000	And then also the gameplay looks pretty fast. It just looks interesting. I don't know. Very fast paced.
8230000	8235000	So I probably have to check that out on 360 when it comes out.
8236000	8245000	Yeah, if you're looking for some video, check out Dailymotion, because they seem to have a lot of gameplay feeds on there.
8245000	8249000	Yeah, I was checking out one of those bootleg feeds. It looks pretty cool.
8249000	8257000	Yeah, it does. And I mean, it looks like there's still a lot of people running around, even though it's only 6 on 6.
8257000	8262000	There's a lot of AI players and stuff in there, and the mechs and everything is still pretty crazy.
8262000	8268000	So I don't think the 6 on 6 now, after seeing all the people complain about it, is going to be that big of an issue.
8268000	8273000	I always thought that discussion was way overhyped. I didn't think that was going to cripple the game at all.
8273000	8279000	I am a little concerned that the AI is as stupid as it is in the video that they're being shown me.
8279000	8286000	Because this game is only a couple months out, or not even, like pretty much a month and a half away.
8286000	8291000	So hopefully they can fix that in time.
8291000	8295000	Alright. Well, let's go to the mailbag.
8295000	8300000	You know, we encourage you to send your emails and feedback to the show at mailbag at orangelaundraider.com.
8300000	8305000	And every week, usually DarkSakura will dive in the mailbag head first and pull out an email.
8305000	8307000	There's that diving thing again.
8308000	8310000	Why can't I cannonball or belly flop?
8310000	8315000	Well, this week DarkSakura is pouting at the top of the diving board saying, I want to cannonball.
8315000	8318000	So Jason will have to dive instead.
8318000	8321000	She's the little kid throwing a hissy fit on the side of the pool.
8321000	8324000	But it's wet! And it's cold! And it's water!
8324000	8328000	I think right now I have the perfect voice to do whiny three-year-old.
8328000	8332000	I don't want you in the mailbag!
8332000	8335000	Oh, you are correct in that assumption.
8335000	8337000	So listeners, thank you for that one.
8337000	8338000	Woohoo!
8338000	8339000	Alright.
8339000	8340000	Woohoo!
8340000	8343000	Well, for those that are still connected and listening to the show after that.
8343000	8346000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Jason, if you wouldn't mind.
8346000	8349000	Rob-a-bub-a-bub-a-bub-a-bub-a says...
8349000	8350000	Oh, speaking of Rob.
8350000	8354000	Rob and Jason talked about how racy content is getting onto the PSN livestreams.
8354000	8356000	PS4 livestreams.
8356000	8361000	I looked on Tuesday and I can thankfully say I didn't find anything sexually charged.
8361000	8363000	That must be mostly a weekend thing.
8363000	8365000	Yeah, weekend holidays.
8365000	8371000	There was a guy drinking himself drunk and another getting high off camera.
8371000	8375000	But there was also a guy jamming on his electric guitar to make things a bit better.
8375000	8377000	Then I read the chat and it was awful!
8377000	8384000	They made fun of the way the people on camera looked, dressed, acted, and they also made the most disgusting situations.
8384000	8386000	From what pit do these words come from?
8386000	8388000	I'm not one for censorship, but it tested my resolve.
8388000	8392000	I'm all about self-censorship, so I turned that crap off.
8392000	8398000	The language being used by the broadcasters themselves wasn't too clean either, but that's another issue.
8398000	8415000	So, yeah, even if the content on screen isn't rolling with it, the masses can say what they want to say, and it usually leans in a very particular direction.
8416000	8423000	The chat is almost worse in many ways than what's being offered out there on PlayStation 4 because the stories we were telling last week,
8423000	8429000	obviously those were some of the big horror stories, if you will, but that's not all the feeds.
8429000	8435000	I mean, once again, I was trying to find a shocking feed to show Dark Sakura before the show tonight because she wasn't here last week to hear,
8435000	8438000	well, I mean, she heard the discussion, but she wasn't here to participate in it.
8438000	8441000	But when I looked at those feeds today, I was like, ah, there really isn't anything that scandalous.
8441000	8445000	There was some girl there that was, she had an accent. She's like Australian maybe.
8445000	8449000	She was sitting there and it was just, she was just sitting there reading the chat and responding to it.
8449000	8456000	But then once again, looking at the chat, people would say things like, you know, it was just, you know, calling her names and stuff like that.
8456000	8457000	It's just pretty disgusting.
8457000	8459000	I don't see why people think that that's okay.
8459000	8466000	You know, they've got this layer of anonymity being on the internet, but I still don't think...
8466000	8467000	That's enough.
8467000	8469000	And sometimes it takes less than that.
8469000	8481000	In the end, in the end, in the end, what I don't see is how people fundamentally think that it is okay to speak to another human being that way, even if they are hidden by anonymity.
8481000	8484000	By no means am I defending it. I'm sure you know that.
8484000	8492000	And if any of you listening to this have done it, I want you to go find whoever you've done it to and apologize before I spank you.
8493000	8500000	Because clearly you weren't taught to respect other people and I don't want that type of behavior associated with the show.
8500000	8507000	I think the people that listen to this show and have made it this far in this show are too smart to do something like that. I really hope.
8507000	8512000	And if you're going to be an ass to someone, at least have the decency to put your name on it.
8512000	8516000	You know, have the vagina to do it.
8516000	8521000	Have the, have the uteral strength to do it because as we all know, balls are squishy.
8522000	8533000	I, this conversation is kind of interesting. I've never really, I've never really said anything about it myself, but like, I don't think I've ever been anonymous asshole on the internet.
8533000	8543000	And I've said shit in bad moods, you know, whether, whether, I don't want to say people deserve it, but whether argumentative or not, you know, I've, I can, I can get nasty.
8543000	8553000	I kind of realized that sometimes I do that myself. And when I get in that mood, now I have a filter to just get the hell off the computer and do something else slash sleep.
8553000	8556000	Because it's usually fucking three o'clock in the morning.
8556000	8567000	But like there are some people that I'm not necessarily on bad terms with, but I just have snarky approaching snide reactions to.
8567000	8573000	And when they do something that I expect, I'll, I'll call them out on it.
8573000	8584000	And I don't know, these are, these are very different things though, because these are, these are things that I've formed with people versus people that I don't know that that shirt makes you look stupid.
8584000	8587000	That's what are you a lumberjack? I don't know.
8587000	8596000	Well, you know, this is actually why I actually became a moderator on DDR Freak back in the day is because just the way that people would talk to each other was absolutely horrible.
8596000	8601000	You and me both, not to mention my form, my section didn't exactly have a lot of the time.
8601000	8612000	That's actually how I got offered my position is because I was playing babysitter in my favorite forums, trying to get people to play nice because I wanted to see what people had to say and not see people just bitch at each other.
8612000	8632000	And that also got me on Gorillaz Unofficial back in the day. You know, it was, I have this thing where the moment someone starts insulting or treating somebody else in a sexist or racist or anything ist manner, they instantly lose all manner of respect.
8632000	8640000	I don't treat them as an intelligent human being anymore. I don't deal with them. I cut them out. They are no longer existing to me.
8640000	8652000	I made a point last week when we were talking about this, that it's not even an ist. Maybe there's a word that ends in this that describes it, but it's just a nasty mentality.
8652000	8662000	And it doesn't have to be born out of any sort of a prejudice. People will do these things because it satisfies a need.
8662000	8672000	It's the bully mentality. It's the put down someone to make yourself feel better. It's using the internet as validation.
8672000	8676000	To an extent. That among other things, no doubt.
8676000	8678000	In and of itself is super unhealthy.
8678000	8679000	It is.
8679000	8692000	So first of all, if people want validation, they need to earn their damn validation. And secondly, they need to validate themselves, not look towards putting somebody else down or telling them to kill themselves or bullying somebody.
8692000	8702000	There was another article, too, that I was reading today about a guy in God for the Life of Me. I can't remember his first name, but his last name is Hassan Hassan or something like that.
8702000	8714000	He's a writer that outed a transgendered inventor. And she said, you know, please don't say what my birth gender is because that's going to count as it's going to lead to a hate crime or something.
8714000	8725000	And it turned out that I read his article and he did it in such an insensitive way and did out out this lady and she killed herself.
8725000	8736000	And it's just that level of insensitivity that people have towards respecting other people. There is no respect when you don't see them face to face.
8736000	8742000	Everyone needs to realize that there is another human being on the other side of that monitor.
8742000	8751000	This is actually something that I didn't think about the Bay Area is that I've met a lot of diverse people in a lot of very particular ways over the last year.
8752000	8755000	Any other comments? Any other comments?
8755000	8758000	Well, it's just a mindfulness that people should have.
8758000	8763000	It is. People aren't naturally extroverted enough to understand that, though.
8763000	8770000	And people will also say that, oh, you're just being too PC or you're being too strict.
8770000	8772000	Why don't you just let people say what you're going to say?
8772000	8773000	God forbid you treat people like people.
8773000	8786000	Exactly. It's because and I also posted a link to another article earlier on my Tumblr about casual racism, how we have these phrases and sayings that are built into our language.
8786000	8792000	But in the end, do we really know where they came from and do we know how, you know, the origins of them, how hurtful they are?
8792000	8796000	And we just say things and don't think about how we treat other people.
8796000	8801000	You know, every every one of you listeners, you are each an individual and special person.
8801000	8804000	And certainly calling, you know, in calling things gay.
8804000	8809000	The word retarded, retarded, which is really, you know, I've I've been bad and use that and I really shouldn't.
8809000	8814000	Or saying someone is autistic when they're just socially awkward.
8814000	8818000	Yeah. Which trust me, I know what autism is.
8818000	8822000	Anyway, in the interest of time, I got to ask for your next email.
8822000	8827000	No, it's all right. It's just good discussion, but just as I have said at least two or three times before.
8827000	8831000	Be awesome to people. Those those people that they are people, too.
8831000	8834000	They have their own lives in as much history as they've lived up to this point.
8834000	8840000	And it's actually something phenomenal. And if you don't care, then don't bother.
8840000	8845000	There are 60 million things that could kill you every day, including yourself.
8845000	8850000	And if you've lived this long, kudos to you. You're awesome.
8850000	8855000	Next email. I just found plans for next weekend.
8855000	8859000	This is frauds in the intro. Hey, all our crew.
8859000	8866000	Hp here. This email is mostly for more as he's expressed the most interest in the speed runs from awesome games done quick.
8866000	8871000	But I think other people might be interested as well. At the convention AOD.
8871000	8874000	The convention AOD. I don't know what AOD stands for.
8874000	8882000	Maybe it'll make sense in a minute. At the convention AOD being held next Saturday, the 25th at the SFO Marriott near Berlin game.
8882000	8889000	The speed runners from AGDQ Trihex, who formerly held the world record for Yoshi's Island 100 percent, now third.
8889000	8898000	Cosmo Wright, who formerly held who formerly held the world records for Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker and Commander King 4.
8898000	8906000	And ROM Scout, who holds the world record for Castlevania Symphony of the Night, will be hosting a panel about speed running at 6 p.m.,
8906000	8911000	followed by a panel hosted by Dasset Bro, an EVO commentator on fighting games and the community.
8911000	8919000	It'll be a great chance to learn more about the art and ask questions you might not get answered as candidly if you are asking questions in their chat.
8919000	8922000	Run Mrs. AOD's anime overdose.
8922000	8927000	Oh. Oh, so con this weekend. OK. I tried Googling it a couple times and I wasn't getting anything.
8927000	8938000	I was getting a Tomb Raider old something. I know it was mentioned on the show, but I'm so amazed, surprised and proud these gamers were able to raise over a million dollars for charity.
8938000	8942000	And I'm excited to get the chance to tell them how great I think they are for doing it.
8942000	8946000	So anyone who's free next Saturday and around the Bay Area, stop on by.
8946000	8950000	I'm freaking there. Hell, yes. Awesome.
8950000	8954000	I would love to go, but that's not going to happen.
8954000	8958000	Not that I don't think this is great. Just, you know, the trip and everything. But please.
8958000	8962000	Oh, it's going to be big. Send our love.
8962000	8966000	Damn, that's going to be exciting. All right.
8966000	8975000	Suppolar. I'll try to be brief for anyone. There's a nasty canasta for anyone, including Mr. Black Wolf, if he's around, who's used or reads about the Oculus Rift.
8975000	8979000	Has there been any issues brought up with people who have vision problems?
8979000	8985000	I'd like to try the rift someday, but I am near sighted in my left eye, so I'm afraid I won't be able to enjoy it.
8985000	8990000	Unrelated, but because of my eye problem, I cannot see 3D images, not even on my 3DS.
8990000	8999000	This is a principal article that Sir Black Wolf wrote up on the site in the start of December, mid-November, one of the two.
8999000	9007000	I'm laughing because I don't want to say it's the exact same thing, but Bobby has a vision impairment that's exactly what you're describing.
9007000	9010000	And you know how much he talks about the rift.
9010000	9017000	And keep in mind, the whole point of, and I've been sort of phrasing it incorrectly, that it's specifically lenticular 3D.
9017000	9028000	Well, it kind of is, but if you've ever ripped one of the little 3DS files on it, it's actually two images that are superimposed at different opacities.
9028000	9033000	And it's meant for one eye to read one part of the image, and the other eye to read the other part of the image.
9033000	9038000	And if you don't have that synchronization between your eyes, you're not going to see it. You're going to see a blur.
9039000	9044000	SaganChat says, to answer the writer, wait till they develop their tech to solve these problems.
9044000	9047000	It's true. It's not totally done yet either.
9047000	9051000	But keep in mind, there's more to it than just the 3D imagery.
9051000	9055000	That whole sensation of looking around and having the movement, that's a lot too.
9055000	9062000	And I think, well, you know, like I said, Bobby, and he wrote an article on the site about it, so go dig through the things he's written on the rift.
9062000	9069000	Because he explains exactly what his vision thing is that's going on, and how he still enjoys the rift.
9069000	9072000	So you might find that it's a very similar story to what you've got.
9092000	9096000	If you're a PlayStation owner or PC owner, go check out DC Universe Online.
9096000	9102000	Yes, I know, DC, but it is more of like a beat-em-up style MMO, and it's a little more fast-paced.
9102000	9105000	And I think is exactly the type of thing you're looking for there.
9105000	9110000	I honestly did find some enjoyment with Ragnarok Online too.
9110000	9114000	Because, I mean, it has a lot of that same repetitive beating over and over.
9114000	9116000	But it was a little bit easier to control.
9116000	9119000	I think you're always going to find floatiness in an MMO.
9119000	9125000	You know, just the nature of multiplayer, not to mention massively multiplayer, things are a hell of a lot more difficult.
9125000	9132000	And so, for the foreseeable future, until internet and processing speeds and everything else improve dramatically,
9132000	9138000	MMOs may not be your cup of tea, as I've resigned myself to think right now.
9138000	9145000	In the chat, the individual I keep saying is 13x forever, but Jason pointed out to me it might actually be Lex forever, L-E-X forever.
9145000	9151000	It says WildStar, it's awesome for an MMO. I've been hearing a lot of good stuff about WildStar too, I want to check that out.
9151000	9162000	Lastly, since I kind of broke Jason's brain because he had to rush through reading my last email, here's a link to a huge roguelike wiki, since he said he likes them so much.
9162000	9172000	O-R-G-U-E-B-A-S-I-N dot com. I will definitely be partaking of this as soon as I get back.
9172000	9175000	Assuming I don't just get back, crawl in bed, and pass out like immediately.
9175000	9177000	Thank you, Nasty Canasta.
9177000	9182000	That's a phrase I like to utter on this show. Thank you, Nasty Canasta.
9182000	9186000	One more email from Brozime.
9187000	9213000	Hey O-L-R, I'm a relatively new listener since about episode 500 and normally can't listen live due to work. However, having just listened to your discussion about the good and bad of streaming from last week, I would like to know what you think about the mandatory stream delay of about a minute on Twitch.
9214000	9223000	I think it's a huge issue since most streams I watch, I do so because the host interacts with the chat. For me personally, I stream to my friends to record commentary for YouTube.
9223000	9233000	Since they imposed this new delay in lieu of the consoles getting streaming functionality, it's been impossible to do either of the things we had the possibility of doing before.
9233000	9240000	I really love listening to O-L-R to keep my brain working at work. Hope you guys stick around, and I'm sorry if my grammar isn't tip-top, dark sucker.
9240000	9247000	Well, thankfully you get the leeway of me, but unfortunately my own brain tiredness today packed everything.
9247000	9254000	I still got the sense of what was being said, and a funny little story that I wrote about the day before.
9254000	9265000	My own brain tiredness today packed everything. I still got the sense of what was being said, and a funny little story that I want to relay to this listener is that, guess what?
9265000	9276000	When we do this show here at Orange Lawn Radio and interact with our chat room, we're facing the same delay because of the fact that the setup we have here is actually slower than Twitch.
9276000	9288000	When we used to broadcast the video for this show live on Justin TV, just to give you an idea how long ago it was, when we used to broadcast the video of the show here and we had a different setup because we had the space that could accommodate for it better,
9288000	9294000	they would actually see things first on Justin before our listeners would hear it, which I always hated.
9294000	9303000	I mean, no disrespect, it's just the fact that I wanted the video to always be secondary to the audio because it is Orange Lawn Radio, but I'm digressing a little bit.
9303000	9313000	My point is that you still can work with that delay. Don't let it ruin what you want to do. Just figure out how you can kind of adapt with that delay.
9313000	9325000	But I'm not saying to you, oh, just suck it up, baby. I'm not saying that because, yeah, that sucks when you want to do that commenting and for the YouTube and you need to have that instant feedback.
9325000	9334000	I do run into that problem almost all the time. Shane and I will be live streaming things and he'll be on Skype and the way he sees the game is he's watching me on the feed.
9334000	9340000	And I'll do something and he'll laugh or I'll laugh and he'll be like, what just happened? I have to describe it to him because he hasn't seen it yet.
9340000	9352000	And it doesn't make for the best feed. But what makes for a better feed, and maybe this is something to think about, maybe it'll work for you, maybe it won't, is if Shane and I or whoever I happen to be gaming with, if we're playing the game together,
9352000	9363000	then if something funny happens, we both just saw it in the game. He's not having to rely on my feed. I realize that doesn't work for every scenario, but just think of it as a new barrier to work around.
9363000	9374000	Don't let it ruin what you're trying to do. But at the same time, it does kind of suck that people were used to it one way and then all of a sudden it changed.
9374000	9381000	And if you did adapt to the old rules, it sucks to have the rules changed on you like that. But look at it as a challenge, not as something to end you.
9381000	9390000	It's not a rule, it's literally a technical limitation. What would you rather have, a cap or low latency?
9390000	9395000	And the answer is that two different people want two different things.
9395000	9398000	I'm letting the e-mailer talk back to you right now.
9398000	9401000	I'm letting the e-mailer speak for himself. Well, we're gonna be waiting here for a while.
9401000	9403000	That's right, you wanna talk about delay.
9404000	9412000	No, yeah, we covered that. And I don't think I ever realized that Twitch streams were near to live.
9412000	9416000	I also have really no basis of comparison because it's people just doing their thing.
9416000	9423000	And otherwise, you know, mostly popular people. And no, not even that.
9423000	9432000	I've watched fighting game streams of my friend who doesn't read the chat except in between matches because you don't fight and watch chat at the same time.
9432000	9442000	So I've not seen the content like Rob's talking about where the delay is that impacting.
9442000	9448000	Because in most other cases, you can't keep up with chat that actively because you're playing a game.
9448000	9457000	What game doesn't... I guess Playroom is actually a real fine answer to answer that argument.
9457000	9461000	Yeah, but Playroom needs a delay and they need moderators.
9461000	9468000	Chat needs to be... I don't know. Chatting like commenting too just scourges of so much of the internet.
9468000	9474000	Bobby Blackwolf would like you to know that we actually did talk about this in the segment at the end of his show last week when he calls us.
9474000	9478000	So a cheap plug for the Bobby Blackwolf show if you do wanna hear us talk about this a little more.
9478000	9483000	I gotta ask, we keep things moving though. Sorry, new e-mailer and I'm saying let's move on.
9483000	9491000	5.35, revisit our same arguments. It is unfortunate. Alternatives do exist. Do check out hitbox.tv.
9491000	9498000	Came out of the conversation last week. I looked at it today. It's gaming oriented but nothing in their terms say it has to be like literally a game.
9498000	9510000	Alternatives exist. Find what works for you. Nico Nico, overseas. The Japan and now English site may also be feasible.
9510000	9515000	Maybe. Look for the tool that fits your needs. That's that.
9515000	9520000	Alright, thank you very much for reading those. Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9520000	9525000	Hopefully next week we won't have an hour long Nintendo discussion at the top of the show and we can spend a little more time on those.
9525000	9526000	Nintendo bicker fight.
9526000	9533000	Alright, not really, not really. What I love about the show is that it's not really fighting, it's spirited debate.
9533000	9541000	And yes, there is a big difference. There's a huge difference. Jason and I will hug it out later. Not in a sexual way. Get your head out of the gutter.
9541000	9547000	But you know, I respect, just like Logie. Logie and I fight all the time on this stuff and it doesn't change anything.
9547000	9556000	And we're still here. You three are here each and every. I've realized that this week. It's like, well yeah, we do this and we do this on the show.
9556000	9561000	I'm like, wow, this has become mildly second nature to me because I've been doing it so regularly.
9561000	9563000	And that's how we've done it for 12 years now.
9563000	9570000	And I mean, I literally don't know what the fuck else I do with myself. Like when I don't have a show on Sunday, I'm always kind of like in my mind.
9570000	9573000	I have so much time on Sunday nights. Where did this come from?
9573000	9576000	And I'm like, oh, it's six o'clock. I should be on the air. Oh, I should be listening to Bobby. Right?
9576000	9580000	Well, I usually am listening to Bobby anyway, unless we're both off and then it's like, you know?
9580000	9584000	All right. Anyway, focus. Let's get to the FUs of the week.
9591000	9597000	Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
9597000	9599000	This is fucked up.
9599000	9606000	Um, FU to my voice not being able to lay back and the lingering cough that will not escape, even though I feel better.
9606000	9610000	So, and then having to wake up at 6 a.m.
9610000	9612000	Mm-hmm. Uh, Jason.
9612000	9614000	FU to Sunday drivers.
9614000	9619000	Frickin' Florian Perkins, Florian Perkins, whatever that road is down there.
9619000	9620000	Uh-huh.
9620000	9622000	I'm doing like frickin' 15, 20 miles an hour down it.
9622000	9624000	Hey, don't tell the listeners where I live, please.
9624000	9625000	You don't live on Florian Perkins.
9625000	9626000	I know.
9626000	9627000	They know it's in Sacramento.
9627000	9628000	Yeah.
9628000	9629000	I think.
9629000	9630000	Yeah, they do.
9630000	9631000	Somewhere in this great place.
9631000	9633000	We're moving soon anyway, so it wouldn't even matter.
9633000	9634000	Peace out, y'all.
9634000	9639000	No, I just, it was so weird. It was trying to turn and everybody was taking their dear sweet time.
9639000	9645000	Although at the same time, I was also rushing because I literally got the intro done 15 minutes before the show started.
9645000	9648000	So I couldn't have possibly influenced it.
9648000	9652000	Um, there's probably another one, but whatever.
9652000	9659000	My FU goes to these popcorn kernels because it's the worst addiction, but I'm totally that guy when I have microwave popcorn.
9659000	9663000	Like I've got to find those kernels that are like half popped and eat them because it's the best part.
9663000	9664000	Don't give me that look.
9664000	9666000	I'm not the only one that does it.
9666000	9667000	I've just never heard of this before.
9667000	9671000	You've never heard of it? You've got to try it because that's like the best part.
9671000	9672000	I don't promise that I will.
9672000	9673000	All right.
9673000	9676000	Anyhow, um, Loki.
9676000	9680000	Um, I guess FU being out of shape.
9680000	9684000	Maybe you need to get a Fitbit like me. We'll have Fitbit contests.
9684000	9686000	I don't know about that.
9686000	9688000	Me and Rob are friends on Fitbit now.
9688000	9689000	Yeah, we're friends on Fitbit.
9689000	9694000	Hopefully, hopefully each of us will inspire each other to walk and maintain step counts.
9694000	9695000	I am not getting one.
9695000	9696000	That's all right.
9696000	9699000	As like I said before the show, different strokes for different folks.
9699000	9700000	All right.
9700000	9703000	Let us do a couple more stories for you guys.
9703000	9706000	Then we'll get into the Skype line real quick tonight.
9706000	9708000	I'm not going to leave it open forever.
9708000	9710000	So if you want to get through, you're going to have to call pretty quick.
9710000	9712000	Two more stories first though.
9712000	9714000	Starting with Loki.
9714000	9719000	So hey, do you have an Oculus Rift and you happen to be a fan of Ready Player One?
9719000	9721000	Well, there's a tech demo for you.
9721000	9724000	And that would be the Stax Rift demo.
9724000	9730000	It allows you to walk through one of the locales of Ready Player One,
9730000	9736000	which is stacks of mobile homes making these mobile home skyscrapers.
9736000	9739000	So you can actually wander around those and check it out.
9739000	9741000	Looks kind of neat.
9741000	9743000	All righty.
9743000	9747000	Too bad I don't have an Oculus Rift and I haven't read Ready Player One.
9747000	9750000	But as a fan of the book, does this look interesting to you from what you're seeing?
9750000	9752000	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
9752000	9754000	All right.
9754000	9756000	Moving on, this looks great too.
9756000	9758000	I need this game.
9758000	9760000	This YouTube was all over Facebook and Twitter and stuff.
9760000	9762000	If you haven't seen it, please look it up.
9762000	9765000	It's a game called Cat Lateral Damage.
9765000	9768000	It's Cat Lateral Damage.
9768000	9770000	I saw this on a Tuesday.
9770000	9772000	This is so good.
9772000	9774000	I'm sorry, Jason.
9774000	9776000	I'm going to have to play a video here.
9776000	9778000	Isn't that the game that Loki brought up for his game?
9779000	9781000	Oh, you had the name wrong?
9781000	9783000	He might have mentioned it during his gaming week.
9783000	9789000	But yes, you play a cat and what you do is you run around and you knock things off.
9789000	9791000	Why? Because you're a cat.
9791000	9794000	Much like Loki's cat that he's complained about the last two weeks.
9794000	9796000	So you run on these surfaces and that's all you do.
9796000	9801000	And if you break enough valuables, you get combo points and so on and so on.
9801000	9804000	It's a free download for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
9804000	9806000	Oh, I didn't even know it was already out.
9807000	9810000	It needs maybe some work with sound effects a little bit.
9810000	9812000	I mean, it is still in early alpha, but I love the concept.
9812000	9815000	This could be like a Katamari Damacy style game.
9815000	9820000	I'm sure it was inspired by cats in general and any owner understands.
9820000	9828000	But the particular inspiration in my mind from this game came from one very specific place.
9828000	9830000	You know what that is?
9830000	9833000	A little meme image that consists of a cat on a ledge with the words,
9833000	9836000	Fuck this thing, fuck that thing, fuck this thing in particular.
9836000	9839000	Fuck that, fuck that thing in particular.
9839000	9840000	Yes, I love that.
9840000	9844000	I posted a picture, it was called CEO Kat.
9844000	9846000	Kat, person sitting at a desk.
9846000	9847000	I should buy a boat.
9847000	9850000	Oh no, the one where he tips the coffee mug off the desk.
9850000	9854000	I think I saw it recently, it was probably during the show, but yeah.
9854000	9856000	Sitting at a desk all nice.
9856000	9857000	Tip!
9857000	9858000	Perfect.
9858000	9859000	Exactly.
9859000	9860000	So good.
9860000	9861000	Ah cats.
9861000	9862000	Alright.
9862000	9864000	That's what the internet was really made for.
9864000	9866000	We are going to open up the Skype line.
9866000	9867000	It's open now.
9867000	9871000	1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9871000	9874000	If you have something you want to call in to the show to talk about tonight.
9874000	9877000	Maybe, excuse me, something we talked about already or something we neglected to bring up.
9877000	9882000	Or a game you've been playing this week or maybe you have a thought on this whole Nintendo thing.
9882000	9883000	Go ahead and give us a call right now.
9883000	9886000	The Skype line is open, but it will not be open very long.
9886000	9888000	Please hurry.
9888000	9890000	Meanwhile, while we wait for those calls to come in.
9890000	9892000	Let's see if there's any last minute stories.
9892000	9894000	Loki, I always check in with you for last minute stories.
9894000	9902000	Yeah, there's a pretty cool ENB mod that's for Skyrim that's supposed to fix some of the memory problems that the game has.
9902000	9908000	And allows for draw distances which are really a lot bigger than they had more characters on screen.
9908000	9911000	And apparently less crashes and takes up less memory.
9911000	9913000	So, that's pretty cool.
9913000	9915000	Alrighty.
9916000	9922000	Oops, I'm sorry guys. I was hanging up on some of these calls accidentally because I'm on the iPad.
9922000	9926000	And it's like when I get multiple calls at once, it goes crazy.
9926000	9929000	So, go ahead and try to call again.
9929000	9931000	Orange Launch Radio on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9931000	9933000	Geez, Rab.
9933000	9938000	Well, I wanted to take the first one because it's somebody that doesn't call into the show very often.
9938000	9941000	But then as soon as I was about to hit the button, another one came up and I was like,
9941000	9946000	Oh, I want to talk to the first one there because it probably has to do with the story we were just talking about.
9946000	9948000	So, I'm hoping they call back.
9948000	9951000	But if they don't, I'll go ahead and take another one.
9951000	9952000	But we have a stream delay.
9952000	9954000	Alright, there we go. I think I got it.
9954000	9956000	So, let us go to the phones.
9956000	9958000	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9958000	9960000	That cat GIF is the best GIF ever.
9960000	9963000	It is the best GIF, isn't it?
9963000	9965000	The best GIF ever.
9965000	9967000	That's right. What's on your mind, buddy? How you doing?
9967000	9972000	Hey, so this is Bobby and I wanted to correct a little bit for the emailer who was talking about Twitch.
9972000	9974000	Yes, please. Go for it.
9974000	9978000	Because I remember, Plug Plug, you were talking about this on your show, were you not?
9978000	9979000	Yes, I was.
9979000	9987000	And he said in the email that Twitch is imposing this delay and they're making it a mandatory delay.
9987000	9989000	They're not.
9989000	9994000	The actual technical side of it is basically Twitch got popular.
9994000	9999000	And the way they were doing streaming the old way was not going to be sustainable.
9999000	10002000	It was crashing. There were a lot of people having dropped streams.
10002000	10004000	I was having dropped streams.
10004000	10006000	It was getting unbearable to watch Twitch.
10006000	10010000	I'm already surprised that they can maintain what they've got.
10010000	10015000	Especially with the PlayStation 4 and now they want to get Xbox One in and on it too. It's crazy.
10015000	10022000	But it's actually, and they did this before, they had decided to do this before they added the consoles.
10022000	10027000	So they switched to a new streaming protocol but unfortunately it introduced latency.
10027000	10037000	And they're apparently working to lower the latency but it was either have the latency or have more people leave Twitch because nobody could stay connected to the stream.
10037000	10043000	And it was an unfortunate trade-off. And yes, Twitch has gotten so big and everybody's like, well I'm going to go to Hitbox and I'm going to go here.
10043000	10049000	And that's great. You can go there and then when they get too big, they're going to have to switch to do, you know,
10049000	10055000	they're going to have to do the same new streaming and they're going to introduce latency and everybody's going to leave there and go somewhere that's smaller.
10055000	10062000	And it's going to be a cycle. Until they figure out how to lower the latency, it's unfortunately going to have to be there.
10062000	10067000	It's not Twitch saying, oh it's the consoles, we have to have one minute of latency.
10067000	10074000	No, it's just unfortunate reality of the internet right now and hopefully smart people are working on it to stop that.
10074000	10080000	Yeah. I mean, I just, you know, again, maybe I'm spoiled because I've done this show for so long where we've always had that built in.
10080000	10087000	So I've kind of had to think of a way to work around that. I just kind of like, you know, try to look at it as an opportunity where how can I repurpose what I'm doing?
10087000	10094000	And, you know, to be fair, maybe I'm not, you know, because I don't rely on that two second delay or what have you.
10094000	10102000	I'm a little more, you know, I don't get as upset about it, but I'm just kind of like, I'm like, well, you'll make it work. We all have, you know.
10102000	10105000	Or you could just, I mean, there's going to be competition, which is great.
10105000	10116000	That's true. And that's true. Leaving Twitch and going somewhere else isn't necessarily, I don't want to say it's a bad idea, but I mean, the competition is, I've always said, I'm really surprised nobody's really competing with Twitch out there.
10116000	10124000	After these numbers that came out this past week, though, were like, what is it, more people are watching Twitch than Hulu Plus and watching like Spike TV or something like that.
10124000	10131000	Like it's, it's because there's so many viewers consistently watching all this programming out there. It's, it's pretty crazy.
10131000	10135000	So I'm really surprised that a lot of other companies don't want a piece of it.
10135000	10142000	I'm really, really surprised that the Xbox streaming is not going to be done through some type of Skype thing. I'm really surprised at that.
10142000	10143000	Maybe they're rethinking that.
10143000	10145000	Maybe, maybe.
10145000	10150000	So, yeah, so I just wanted to kind of correct that because I know there's a lot of misinformation that Twitch is being evil.
10151000	10153000	They're not being evil. They're trying to stay afloat.
10153000	10158000	And this is a very unfortunate and crappy side effect for some people.
10158000	10166000	Because I know people, they do speed runs or stuff like that, and they don't remember what happened 30 seconds ago that everybody's talking about.
10166000	10170000	And they're so used to, for the past couple of years, having one or two second delays.
10170000	10172000	They're not used to it.
10172000	10177000	And, you know, for gaming, this is a problem that is mainly for gaming streams.
10177000	10182000	It's a gaming stream problem. I don't think any other type of streaming really has this kind of problem.
10182000	10186000	But this is a new problem that needs to be addressed.
10186000	10193000	Hopefully people are working on it to make it work with low latency and able to handle a whole bunch of viewers.
10193000	10198000	Alright, well Bobby, I appreciate the call as always to help us, help keep us adrift here on what's going on.
10198000	10205000	Quickly, everybody tune into the Bobby Black Wolf show who is on at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern here at VOG.
10205000	10209000	But if you're listening to us on the podcast feed, as a lot of people do, such as that emailer.
10209000	10214000	Be sure to check out Bobby Black Wolf on Stitcher and iTunes and all the usual places, right?
10214000	10215000	Yep, that's it.
10215000	10217000	Alright, there, I'm doing the plugs for you. It's all good.
10217000	10219000	Also, audiblepodcast.com.
10219000	10221000	Alright, take care Bobby.
10221000	10222000	See you Bobby.
10222000	10223000	Thanks.
10223000	10225000	Alright, we're going to go ahead and open it up.
10225000	10230000	Again, 1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
10230000	10233000	And we'll take that call.
10234000	10237000	Um, Loki, did you get all your last minute stories out? Was it just that one?
10237000	10239000	Yeah, it's a slow news week.
10239000	10241000	Yeah, I was going to see, I was in the middle of it.
10241000	10243000	There wasn't really any tweets that I saw.
10243000	10244000	Was there no tweets?
10244000	10248000	Couple shoutouts, something out of context about dog style from last week.
10248000	10249000	I don't remember if that was-
10249000	10250000	Oh, that was funny though.
10250000	10252000	I don't remember if that was release dates or what we were talking about.
10252000	10256000	My ego loves it when people quote, or when people tweet quotes from the show.
10256000	10257000	Like, my ego really, really loves that.
10257000	10259000	But let's get into some more calls.
10259000	10261000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10261000	10262000	Hey, this is Act Deaf.
10262000	10264000	There's a legendary attacking you!
10264000	10265000	Run!
10265000	10268000	There's like a Pokemon thing on your head. I love it. What's up?
10268000	10274000	Yeah, it's a Pokeplus, a battle from the Pokemon Y legendary.
10274000	10283000	Uh, well, first of all, the guacamelee, or guacamelee, that, uh, let's get that out of the way.
10283000	10286000	In Spanish, it would be guacamelee.
10286000	10287000	Ah.
10288000	10296000	So it's, uh, yeah, it's kind of like guacamelee, but yeah, well, it's similar in that spec.
10296000	10297000	Well, whatever.
10297000	10300000	But whatever it's called, it's a great game, right?
10300000	10302000	Yeah, it's a really great game.
10302000	10306000	I also tried it because of another podcast I listened to.
10306000	10308000	They were talking about it.
10308000	10316000	And how it's referential to a lot of Mexican, and also Dia de los Muertos, so Day of the Dead.
10316000	10320000	And it's a reference to that, so it's a pretty cool game.
10320000	10324000	And then, yeah, but it has a lot of references and all that.
10324000	10327000	But aside of that, another thing.
10327000	10332000	It's not Bobby, I love you and I respect you, but it's not Jeff.
10332000	10334000	It's not Peanut Butter, it's Jeff.
10334000	10340000	And I'm gonna start saying that in Spanish, like, heff.
10340000	10345000	So, that's to trick off people, because, seriously.
10345000	10349000	Yeah, guys, I'm gonna go back to my Bay Area job and work for GitHub.
10349000	10352000	This debate will never, ever end.
10352000	10356000	We're just gonna have to live with it, and it's just what we'll have to do.
10356000	10358000	Yeah, definitely.
10358000	10364000	Well, my call was pretty much about the Nintendo thing.
10364000	10368000	And basically it was, hey, Nintendo week.
10368000	10371000	Yeah, wasn't it a crazy week?
10371000	10375000	I hated that headline, though, that said they admitted they flopped, because that's not true.
10375000	10378000	Those headlines have been here for...
10378000	10382000	They've been ongoing for literally a year now, if not longer.
10382000	10385000	And we weren't hating them in studio, to be honest.
10385000	10392000	Like I said, I am still going to buy the console, and I am still in support of Nintendo.
10392000	10398000	I understand exactly what people are saying, and I think, without reiterating my points,
10398000	10402000	I think my argument was the best I could possibly say on this matter.
10402000	10407000	But, yeah, I see these articles a lot.
10407000	10409000	I don't know if I've said it on this show.
10409000	10412000	There's a quote that I thought of.
10412000	10415000	I don't know if I heard it before, or if I truly made it up.
10415000	10420000	But, in the case of punditry, in the case of news and this kind of stuff,
10420000	10425000	death and failure are the easiest thing to predict, because both are inevitable.
10425000	10428000	But that's all, like so many people talk about.
10428000	10430000	It's disheartening, really.
10430000	10434000	Yeah, it's really hard to bear on this type of news,
10434000	10438000	because all people are, oh, Nintendo's gonna go out of business,
10438000	10442000	they're gonna start publishing for other people or other consoles,
10442000	10448000	and a lot of stuff that there's really a lot to go through to get to that point.
10448000	10454000	And right now, while Nintendo isn't doing that great, to be honest,
10454000	10459000	but still, they're doing it decently.
10459000	10466000	They over-expect it, or something I had said on another site,
10466000	10472000	that they had a high expectancy of selling their console.
10472000	10473000	Absolutely.
10473000	10480000	So it was really over-exploded, or, well, you get the idea in this case.
10480000	10483000	Now, I have a feeling I know where you might be going with this,
10483000	10485000	so I want to kind of prod you with this question here.
10485000	10489000	What else is contributing to Nintendo's bad week?
10489000	10494000	Well, yesterday or, I don't remember if yesterday or Friday,
10494000	10497000	Polygon published an article on their site,
10497000	10508000	and basically, it was about an Earthbound person that worked on the Earthbound localization team.
10508000	10512000	He was going to publish a book, and he was going to promote it on Kickstarter and all that,
10512000	10519000	and it looked like a really good project, an interesting one.
10519000	10528000	But Nintendo said, no, cease and desist, and, well, the project is cancelled.
10528000	10534000	And now people are calling Nintendo and saying that they're dicks because they cancelled the project,
10534000	10543000	and it was going to be something that it was not going to even sell for a profit.
10543000	10547000	So, oh, they're saying Nintendo are dicks and this and that.
10547000	10555000	But basically, if you read the article, it says that the person did contact Nintendo beforehand.
10555000	10558000	Sorry if there's echo.
10558000	10559000	Is there?
10559000	10561000	What's that? No, you're fine.
10561000	10564000	Okay.
10564000	10571000	He basically contacted Nintendo, and he is under an NDA.
10571000	10577000	Yeah, I mean, as most people, when they sign up for a job or whatever, they're usually under NDA.
10577000	10580000	They can't be talking about the process or so forth.
10580000	10583000	I would think, though, after so long, it's whatever.
10583000	10587000	We always get expose books on politics and even movies and so forth,
10587000	10589000	so video games, I wouldn't think would be any different.
10589000	10596000	But I also get why Nintendo wants to shut it down because this guy would be making a profit off of a Nintendo IP.
10596000	10597000	Like, I get it.
10597000	10604000	The fact that Nintendo is shutting it down doesn't surprise me, and I don't see it as them being dicks.
10604000	10608000	It does make me go, well, what are you so afraid of, Nintendo?
10608000	10612000	But at the same time, I kind of go, eh, I bet a lot of companies in their position would do that.
10612000	10616000	If you don't, in the land of trademarks, if you don't protect it, you lose it.
10616000	10621000	So they actually have a very significant reason to do this, unfortunately.
10623000	10627000	Yeah, but can't they give him, like, instead of not protecting it, can't they give him permission to do it?
10627000	10633000	Something that I was discussing with other people, especially on GameFAQs, it's mostly a copyright reason.
10633000	10642000	It's basically they're protecting their IP, their product, because, yeah, even though he wasn't going to get a profit of it,
10643000	10647000	he was going to still sell it. It was going to be a sold product.
10647000	10648000	Yeah, yeah.
10648000	10655000	And I was saying something that probably would have been a, would have been, sorry, a great alternative.
10655000	10662000	He would have published a blog or a PDF, an e-book, basically, online.
10662000	10663000	Do it for free.
10664000	10667000	And I don't think Nintendo would have stopped that.
10667000	10669000	I kind of think that's probably what's going to end up happening.
10669000	10674000	If he really wants to tell the story, it'll probably get on the internet somehow. So, all right.
10674000	10681000	Yeah, basically. And I was, I was seeing the example of a Starman.net, the makers of the, of the Mother 3 translation.
10681000	10682000	Yeah.
10683000	10686000	They didn't get stopped. So what's...
10686000	10696000	But money, money was never, money was never, ever involved as opposed to, you know, funding investments up front and after the fact selling.
10697000	10703000	The difference with the translation is that it, it was, it, you know, there was definitely a lot of groundswell and a lot of people knew about it,
10703000	10711000	but money was never an object, at least not in large amounts from the, from, from everyday individuals.
10711000	10714000	They weren't, they weren't selling the game. They weren't selling the patch.
10715000	10719000	That's a fair point, though. It does seem weird that Nintendo never shut that down, but they'll shut this down real quick.
10719000	10722000	But I, I get, I get what you're both saying. So, all right.
10722000	10725000	All right. Akdeft, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much.
10725000	10729000	And I appreciate you talking about the Earthbound thing, too, because that's a good story to share. So...
10729000	10731000	Well, thank you for having me.
10731000	10734000	All right. Take care, my friend. And I hope that Pokémon doesn't eat you. All right. Bye.
10734000	10735000	Bye.
10735000	10742000	All right. I am going to have to close up the Skype line. I am so sorry to those who didn't get through, but just, we got to end here, wrap up.
10742000	10746000	I'm sorry we ran a little long. Those things happen. But please feel free to write your thoughts down and send them on over.
10746000	10756000	mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com is the place to send your emails, and you can also do tweets, twitter dot com slash o-l-r and all that good stuff.
10756000	10763000	Is there any other last minute story, excuse me, last minute stories, Loki? Sorry, I don't know if I...
10763000	10767000	I was going to say that I just saw this one real quick here.
10767000	10768000	Yep.
10769000	10778000	We're using the Oculus Rift, and also a Wii remote that allows you to play Quidditch.
10778000	10781000	That sounds really cool, actually.
10781000	10784000	That's the game that people want to play, I think.
10784000	10785000	That's very cool.
10785000	10786000	That's pretty cool.
10786000	10787000	Yeah.
10787000	10796000	Alright. Loki, good luck with everything next week, and I didn't have any tweets to read.
10796000	10810000	I guess I will say this real quick, though, because as I was going back through the twitter thing, I did notice a conversation that Bobby and I were having with one of our fellow indie podcasters, Godfrey over at Gamertag Radio, and he puts on a really great show.
10810000	10818000	It's a very different vibe than what we do here, but that's the great thing about indie podcasting is that we all kind of do our own thing and use our own voices.
10818000	10828000	He had a lot of good stuff to say about the experience of being nominated for a podcast award seven times and still not, unfortunately, winning and kind of seeing what's going on with all that stuff.
10828000	10830000	Does it make him Susan, what's your face?
10830000	10835000	They kind of are the Susan Lucci, unfortunately, but what they do there is really great.
10835000	10840000	So just kind of a handshake of support and a hug to those guys over there.
10840000	10844000	I think what they do are great and what a lot of independent producers do are great.
10844000	10849000	And I, for one, am getting a little sick of supporting these awards.
10849000	10855000	I know we've asked a lot for people to support and vote for podcast awards and stitcher awards and so forth.
10855000	10859000	But, you know, especially in the case of I'm just going to name names. Sorry about it.
10859000	10865000	In the case of the Stitcher Awards, I didn't see a single indie in the gaming category or over the map at all.
10865000	10870000	So I'm just kind of like, you know what, we could use our resources.
10870000	10880000	You know, I know it's good exposure to get nominated for those things and so forth, but we could use our resources to better promote our show, better promote other indie shows and better promote this stuff.
10880000	10886000	So I'm just going to say, as far as all this award show stuff goes, as far as getting our listeners to clickbait all this stuff.
10886000	10891000	I mean, if a jury judge award thing comes around, then sure, we'd love to be considered.
10891000	10896000	But as far as asking you guys to do this, no, we're done. We're done.
10896000	10899000	No more clickbait award shows. We're done.
10899000	10905000	So anyhow, hooray for indie podcasting, by the way.
10905000	10906000	Yes.
10906000	10908000	I just want to get that thought out there at some point.
10908000	10918000	Loki, good luck with everything this week and I can't wait to have you back on the show, but take all the time you need and we'll be thinking about you.
10918000	10921000	And we expect regular updates on Twitter and so forth.
10921000	10922000	Alright, you got it.
10922000	10923000	We want pictures of the small person.
10923000	10924000	Yes, we do.
10924000	10925000	Okay, well.
10925000	10928000	I'm sorry, the smaller person, because you already have a small person.
10928000	10929000	That is true, yes.
10929000	10931000	Well, Loki, your final thought?
10932000	10942000	My final thought is I need to go back and watch some more of the, what was it, the Skate 3 glitch videos I watched the other night and I literally got tired of laughing.
10942000	10957000	It was just hilarious. I mean, and I've seen those videos numerous times before, but the guy, I really wish I remembered what his YouTube name was, but he seriously makes this into like an art form.
10957000	10962000	I don't even know how he does half the stuff he does in that game, but it's amazing.
10963000	10968000	DarkSoccer, you two are starting a new adventure tomorrow of a different sort, so best of luck with everything.
10968000	10969000	Thank you.
10969000	10972000	We'll be thinking about you too. And your final thought tonight?
10972000	10980000	I've had to reset my sleep schedule, so I'm actually super tired and I have to be up at six in the morning, so I will be going right to bed as soon as I get home.
10980000	10982000	Thanks for the booze.
10982000	10983000	You're welcome, enjoy it.
10983000	10986000	Jason, thank you as always for being here.
10986000	10987000	Absolutely.
10987000	10990000	Sounds like your next week might be the last week we have you here for a while.
10990000	10994000	Possibly, yeah, depends on the way everything shakes down.
10994000	10997000	We'll see how that works out, but for now, any final thoughts for our listeners?
10997000	11004000	There's a Twitter account, emergencyNSF, and I opened it up and the first thing I see is a structure fire.
11004000	11008000	Crews just entering garage on fire on Dolores at 25th Street.
11008000	11010000	It's from two days ago, so I'm not actually that worried.
11010000	11024000	Seems the Bay Bridge is still up, the new Bay Bridge is still up, so I'll be able to make it back in and settle down and sleep probably another four hours because last week was insane because there were a bunch of co-workers in for a particular purpose.
11024000	11037000	This week, my team is in town. Literally my entire team except for one individual is in town. It's gonna be kind of insane and wonderful all at the same time. It's gonna be a good week.
11037000	11042000	And that YouTuber, I just remembered his name, HelixSnake. Go look him up.
11042000	11047000	My final thought as always, thank you guys for taking the time out to listen to the show. Support independent broadcasting.
11047000	11056000	We appreciate you helping to spread the word about the show. Leave a nice review on iTunes or on Stitcher or anything like that.
11056000	11060000	Unlike award show nominations, that stuff really does help, so we really appreciate that.
11060000	11068000	Help spread the word. Word of mouth is all we got because I don't got millions of dollars to advertise. I don't have a big website backing me up.
11068000	11078000	It's independent and home grown, so help us continue to grow and bring more mature, intelligent voices to the family here at Orange Lounge Radio.
11078000	11080000	And many different definitions of the word.
11080000	11086000	Alright, have a great week everybody. We'll be back next week to do it all over again. See you next time. Bye bye.
