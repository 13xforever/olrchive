7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, we're talking money. Money money money money money. Some surprising financial developments have taken place.
19000	27000	We've also joined this generation of gaming consoles. Our thoughts, your chat comments, calls, emails, and tweets on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 535 for January the 12th of 2014.
44000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
52000	63000	Unfortunately not here tonight. The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She unfortunately came down with a sinus infection today so she felt with her new job starting very soon she should probably take the night off.
63000	72000	Which I understand. She is however in our chat room so if you want to say hi to her she's commenting along with the show at live.vognetwork.com
72000	81000	But that's of course only for the live listeners. Sorry for the podcast folks. But if you wanted to say hi to Jamie you could always send an email. Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
81000	85000	But we do have on the skype line tonight say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.
85000	86000	Hello.
86000	87000	Hey Loki how are you doing?
87000	90000	I'm doing good. Still on baby watch.
90000	94000	That's right. Still Loki baby watch 2013 slash 14 still in effect.
94000	102000	Although for those of you that have been tuned out for a little bit over the holidays Loki has been joining us for about the past month over skype.
102000	111000	Because Mrs. Loki is in that last section of the baby making phase where the babies literally do any day now.
111000	117000	Yeah pretty much. I mean she's at the point now where she's just waiting for labor to start.
117000	125000	So she's off work and you know if the baby doesn't come naturally next week they're going to induce her a week from Monday.
125000	128000	So one way or another we will have a baby by the 20th.
128000	132000	So you're going to have a Martin Luther King Jr. Day baby possibly. Quite possibly.
132000	133000	I guess.
133000	138000	Very interesting. Although it could be before too.
138000	141000	Yeah it's on or before so anytime.
141000	151000	This is very likely. Should we place bets on this? I'm going to bet before. I think the baby's going to come during OLR's time slot.
151000	157000	So it's going to make it cancel out on the show at like 4.30 next week.
157000	161000	So no I'm fully expecting you probably won't be here next week.
161000	164000	So this very well may be the last Loki show we have for a little bit.
164000	167000	But just in case I don't get an opportunity to say it again.
167000	174000	Best of luck and may everything go swimmingly and can't wait to see your new healthy baby in the coming weeks.
174000	177000	And tell Mrs. Loki we're all thinking about her here.
177000	178000	Will do.
179000	185000	In the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com Blackwool says are we placing salty bets on Loki baby?
185000	188000	Quite possibly. Quite possibly.
188000	193000	SSJ100Matt says I'm sure Nellie would love it if it happened during the show.
193000	199000	And DarkSakura is in our chat room still having her voice at live.vognetwork.com says guys this is Nellie.
199000	201000	That baby has stubborn genes.
202000	208000	Well she's been, we've been trying everything you know all the like home remedies to get the baby out.
208000	211000	It's like okay spicy food. Nope not really doing anything.
211000	213000	Pineapple juice. Nope.
213000	216000	So it's just, it's just not coming out. We just have to wait.
216000	222000	But you know he's bigger already than Josh was when he was born so they don't want him to go too much longer.
222000	224000	So it's definitely the 20th or earlier.
224000	225000	Sure makes sense.
225000	231000	Brad our buddy from PodCulture is in chat saying no it'll be tonight. We'll hear oh shit gotta go.
231000	238000	I doubt it. I mean she was not having any contractions a few hours ago so I doubt that it'll be tonight.
238000	244000	That would, that would really be something if I, cause DarkSakura I had to call out just a couple hours ago and then I lose Loki mid show.
244000	250000	I would be left here with nobody but the mighty fine VXJSnXVXYZ.
250000	252000	And what a terrible thing that would be.
252000	257000	I mean I know then it would just be like alright I guess I'll have to just do the whole damn show between the two of us.
257000	258000	Well you know.
258000	260000	It would be, that would be quite a bit of an experience.
260000	262000	It would be an experience.
262000	264000	Hey my phone has Skype. What are you talking about?
264000	274000	I could just see Loki trying to do the show on mobile Skype on the way to the hospital with Nelly like turn that god damn thing off.
274000	276000	In the background.
276000	278000	That would be hilarious.
278000	280000	Or in the room with the rhythmic beep beep.
280000	281000	Right.
281000	284000	And then as he's starting to talk beep beep beep beep.
284000	285000	How are you doing, Jason?
285000	288000	I'm doing good. It's another, another mighty fine week.
288000	295000	What's new in your world? What are you up to? Enjoying, do you do any like tourist trap things while you're out here in San Francisco?
295000	297000	No, I'm not touristy in the least.
297000	306000	Like my, my life is literally like a five to six block radius of the apartment that I'm staying at and the office.
306000	311000	And then it's a commute south to hang out with people or north up here to help out with the show.
311000	313000	Oh you gotta expand your horizons in SF a little bit.
313000	315000	Peer 39, come on, everybody's gotta go there.
315000	324000	I've been, no I've done this kind of stuff before. My dad used to live in Gilroy and I visited for a summer so I did Alcatraz, I did Treasure Island, I did Peer 39 Fisherman's Wharf.
324000	334000	Um, I've, I've been to these places whenever things are going on at work I'm um obviously I tag along so I can socialize with all my coworkers immediate or not.
334000	342000	And um, I've, I've been through this kind of stuff. Left to my own choices, eh, eh, eh.
342000	343000	Fair enough.
343000	344000	I have other things I want to do.
344000	352000	When I'm working away from town, like when I went to Phoenix last year was the big trip I took for work, I, I probably did the same thing where I didn't leave like a small little radius from where we were.
352000	360000	And I mean the big difference with this now is that since I'm coming up on two years at work and also two years of coming out to the Bay Area,
360000	370000	like I kind of have my groove and I've been having conversations with people about whether San Francisco slash anywhere California is going to be home or not at some point.
370000	381000	I don't think it is but I'm definitely seeing the feasibility if nothing else. I don't think I want to live here but I see the fact that I can if I'm so inclined.
382000	391000	And so I have my routines now. I have my, I have my office, I have my job that I go into. I come back and I'm starting to get into producing more and more content.
391000	392000	Sure.
392000	400000	And I'm, I'm taking advantage of, you know, being, being able to do things while still being around people while I'm out here.
400000	409000	Because as soon as I get back home, I'm 25 minutes. Yeah, I'm at least 25 minutes from any coworker and only their houses.
409000	416000	So it would be, you know, it'd be like a pretty personal person, socially personal thing that I would have to, I would have to make plans with to go do anything with them.
416000	423000	And it'll just be a lot different. So the life of a telecommuter. So soaking it up as much as I can right now is really the gist of it.
423000	430000	That's fair. I understand. Talking about all the Pier 39 kind of, kind of made me think of back when orange Ontario was a station.
430000	436000	And one of my favorite days was the day we broadcast from the DDR tournament that was at Pier 39. We actually were live like all day long.
436000	446000	We used to, we haven't really done anything like that in a very, very long time. But I can't think of the last time we were like live for like an entire day outside of maybe the marathon episode and maybe like an E3 thing or something.
446000	452000	But that would be, you know, back when we were with, you know, other, other, it wasn't just us, it was like other shows coming together to do that.
452000	457000	But I remember that Pier 39 DDR tournament was quite an experience. I had a good time.
457000	461000	How did you even do it back in the days of like shitty wireless leads and everything else?
461000	465000	Isn't that funny? Like, yeah, like now you look back and you go, how the hell did we pull that off?
465000	470000	Well, we have tethering, we have MiFis. Back then we had to plug our computers into things for internet.
470000	476000	I guess the arcade was a really good sport about it. And they thought it was really cool exposure for them to be able to say that something like that was happening.
476000	479000	And they had like a DSL was like all the rage.
479000	485000	It was a really, really, really long Ethernet cable. I remember they had to run it.
485000	490000	We had to go to Radio Shack and get like a 50 foot Ethernet cable. It was huge and ran it that way.
490000	495000	And keep in mind, Orange Launch Radio was running our big thing right when we first launched. We were a modem friendly.
495000	501000	We were a 28.8K friendly dial-up radio station. So that was the thing.
501000	513000	There's still some relevance of that. It's happening all over again because cell phone speeds, cellular connections are not always terribly fast in all parts of the US and outside of the US as well where we do have listeners.
513000	518000	Yeah, that's true. That's true. But my how times have changed. My how times have changed.
518000	522000	Actually, that arcade is now a sports bar because I've been back to Pier 39.
522000	532000	I went there. You actually suggested it the day before saying, oh, no, not the day before the day of St. Patrick's Day.
532000	539000	I had a Saturday to myself the day after my interview and I was just kind of going around and I figured I'd go back to Pier 39 and kind of see what I remember.
539000	546000	Like I said, I was out here for a summer when my dad lived in Gilroy. That was 2000 somewhere around there.
546000	555000	And since I had done this before, talking to people that I know in the area that have been through San Francisco and just kind of solicited suggestions, you suggested Pier 39.
555000	562000	So I hopped a ride, caught a ride to get down there. And it was pretty it was not a bad sports bar.
562000	569000	There are still some pretty cool, good looking and well maintained arcade machines. No music games, not not even a little bit.
570000	574000	You've got to have your deer hunter game, your requisite deer hunter game.
574000	583000	They had one of the new Terminator, Rise of the Machines, whatever it is. And, you know, obviously the the obligatory basketball hoops, skee-ball type thing.
583000	591000	But the takeaway is that they actually seemed to be taking care of the machines because they looked pretty good.
591000	598000	All the screens were fine. There was no signs taped up on the over the coin mix or on the screens or anything like that.
598000	603000	Still a worthwhile place to go if you find yourself walking up and down the pier.
603000	612000	All right. Well, let's as much as fun is to talk about tourist traps and the fair the fair amount of arcade games you may find at them, we should probably go back to talking about gaming.
612000	616000	I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff.
616000	619000	So, hey, my kickoff topic tonight, I literally have it on the show roll.
619000	625000	Tonight's kickoff topic is ass and titties, ass and titties, ass and titties, ass and titties.
626000	632000	OK, here's the thing, though. No, really. No, no, hold on. Don't change the station. Don't change the station. This does relate to gaming.
632000	635000	No one's changing the station or the kickoff topic is ass and titties.
635000	636000	They're turning it up.
636000	638000	We're going to talk about ass and titties, everybody.
638000	639000	They're trying to find the webcam stream.
639000	643000	OK, so here's the thing. Not my ass and titties. Hold on.
643000	652000	OK, here's the thing, in all seriousness, and yes, we are going to talk about ass and titties because last week I made a big deal on the show about,
652000	659000	OK, guys, I finally jumped the shark and I ordered my PlayStation 4 and my PlayStation 4 will be here on Tuesday.
659000	664000	So sure enough, there's the new parallelogram is sitting on the TV stand.
664000	670000	My PlayStation 4 is all hooked up and with all its gaming goodness and I've had a good old time on the PlayStation 4 this week.
670000	672000	So which console did you end up removing?
672000	679000	Oh, yes, I was playing television stand Survivor on Twitter this week where one of the consoles got voted off the island.
679000	683000	The Xbox 360 was voted off the island, actually.
683000	690000	However, it is not out of the game. It's been exiled to Master Bedroom Island is what's happened.
690000	694000	But now Sony has officially asserted its dominance over the living room.
694000	700000	For now, until I get the Xbox One, which I don't want the Microsoft fanboys to be all like, nah, but here's the reality.
700000	702000	I haven't really touched the 360 in a while.
703000	711000	The last big, big thing I remember playing on it was either Minecraft or the most likely the Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC was probably the last big thing I played on 360.
711000	720000	And with PlayStation 3, there is still the Final Fantasy 10 remake coming and there's the Kingdom Hearts 2 package that's all coming out next year.
720000	724000	So those I knew were things that I would want to still have on PlayStation 3.
724000	733000	I couldn't think of anything on 360 that I would want to play next year that badly that isn't also on PC or something else.
733000	736000	Am I missing something, Loki? Did I miss an obvious choice?
736000	743000	Well, there's two. I mean, if you're not getting an Xbox One right away, there's Plants vs. Zombies, Garden Warfare, and Titanfall.
743000	748000	Titanfall I do want to check out, but that is on PC eventually, right?
748000	753000	It's PC the same day, but I guess you probably want to play it on PC.
753000	760000	Yeah, so either I'll check that out on PC or, again, the PlayStation 3 will have to be voted off the island when I can finally afford an Xbox One.
760000	762000	I just think that'll be more like summer.
762000	767000	And then by that point, I will have at least played the Final Fantasy 10 remakes.
767000	772000	Kingdom Hearts 2 we'll have to see. I might unfortunately have to just play that in the bedroom or figure out something else.
772000	778000	I had joked around that the Wii U was up for elimination, but not really because I still play enough Wii U.
778000	783000	I had people over this week and we were having a good old time with Nintendo Land, of all things, but I'll get into that later.
783000	787000	Because Ass and Titties. You guys got me distracted from Ass and Titties.
787000	788000	Here's the thing.
788000	790000	Miracles do happen sometimes.
790000	797000	On the PlayStation 4. I'm sure you all know one of the big features on the PlayStation 4 is that you can livestream your games.
797000	805000	We've even talked about this on the show, that it's not only the games that you can stream, but people have figured out that they can stream from Playroom,
805000	814000	which is just kind of the play space, if you will, the camera area where you have just silly little, like, make robots spawn and interact with.
814000	816000	They have silly little things like this with Kinect too.
816000	822000	There was, on Xbox, they had something very similar to this. They even showed it off at 1E3 and I don't remember the name of it.
822000	826000	Do you remember the name of the Kinect showroom that they had?
826000	833000	Well, they have, like, a Kinect, I forget what it was, they have some sort of Kinect Party thing.
833000	834000	Yeah.
834000	836000	They've got, I don't know if it is Kinect Party.
836000	842000	It was all download. They had something, somebody in chat will yell it out over at live.vognetwork.com soon enough.
842000	853000	So, okay, so I'm screwing around and I'm looking at the PlayStation 4 livestreams and one thing I noticed right away, it is really easy to just, I mean,
853000	861000	you power up the PlayStation 4 and it's all integrated, like, you just, your little bar shows up that shows all the little games that you have downloaded
861000	869000	and, you know, the PlayStation Store or the Netflix Amazon link and all that stuff and then PlayStation 4 Live.
869000	872000	So you go in there and you will automatically see what the top channels are.
872000	878000	And so I've been just kind of looking around and seeing what people are doing in the Playroom streams.
878000	886000	And I'll tell you what, it is a real toilet bowl of the internet, what's going on in those Playroom streams.
886000	895000	Last night, I kid you not, I'm not making this up, I actually was playing around with the, because, you know, the Vita will livestream from your PlayStation 4.
895000	901000	Like, it'll, you can actually do the whole second screen thing. It's, like, very similar to the Wii U and the Wii and it works very well.
901000	902000	I was very impressed with that.
902000	908000	So I was lying in bed about to go to sleep and I'm playing around on the Vita and I'm doing the PlayStation 4 and I look at the livestreams
908000	914000	and I tune into this channel that has 500 viewers that's just called, like, Party or something like that.
914000	922000	And it's these three bros and one girl that are in a room and I can't really understand what they're making out because, you know,
922000	928000	they're all loud and boisterous and those microphones are pretty sensitive, so all I can hear is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
928000	929000	You know, they're all kind of laughing.
929000	940000	Well, suddenly, the girl gets up, walks over to the camera, pulls down her top, plays, like, does the whole little, like, you know, the ending of Elvira
940000	943000	where she, like, does her, spins her titties around a little bit, like, she does that.
943000	948000	She does, I don't mean to be, like, too explicit, y'all, but this is, like, this is unfolding in front of my eyes.
948000	950000	I was like, oh my God, this is really happening on PlayStation 4.
950000	957000	She picks up one of her boobs and starts licking it and that whole thing and does these very explicit types of things on the TV
957000	962000	and then she laughs and goes back and sits down and I'm just thinking.
962000	964000	But what were the robots doing at this time?
964000	968000	Somehow the robots weren't there. I don't know how that happened.
968000	978000	So then I changed chan- I was like, okay, so I changed the channel and I look at somebody, there's somebody else's stream and it's, it's, it's called,
978000	985000	I was like, wow, there's all this, like, boobs and, and, and Alan and I were kind of joking, like, are there any dudes that are getting naked on there?
985000	992000	So sure enough, we see a channel that's called, like, Workout Session or Workout With Me or something.
992000	997000	So we go to the room and it's this dude that's sitting there and he's wearing nothing but gym shorts, right?
997000	1003000	And he's, like, he's doing sit-ups and he's talking to the camera about, like, how he's trying to get in shape and all this,
1003000	1010000	but he sounds, like, really out of it kind of to me, like, like, I don't want to say he was on drugs, but-
1010000	1013000	But you might say that he's a resident of Colorado.
1013000	1019000	Yes, yes, he might be a resident of Colorado. It's, it struck me as he was very possibly in Colorado.
1019000	1022000	No offense, Jason, it's just your state's a little infamous for something right now.
1022000	1023000	I'm aware of these things.
1023000	1031000	So here's the thing, I just, I just happened to notice that as he's doing sit-ups, I was like,
1031000	1036000	I think he's very happy to be doing these sit-ups, if you know what I mean.
1037000	1045000	So my point in telling these stories, I'm not just trying to, like, titillate you with all these stories about girls and boys
1045000	1052000	and the things they're doing on camera, but I was just, like, this is a fucking Fox News story waiting to happen.
1052000	1058000	This is a ticking time bomb before somebody, I mean, that's how easy it was.
1058000	1065000	I turned on the PlayStation, went to the PlayStation 4 live, like, it's, like, literally, like, three button presses before I'm there.
1065000	1070000	Now, am I saying that, oh my gosh, this is gonna be a problem and all this stuff?
1070000	1078000	Well, I do think that parents should be monitoring what their kids do, and I think if parents turn on the parental controls,
1078000	1085000	they can probably block access to this and all this stuff, but you and I and everybody else knows that is not gonna happen.
1085000	1092000	Real quick, so this is stuff, is this going out over Twitch, or is this just via their internal, like, streaming thing?
1092000	1096000	I swear that the boob thing was on Twitch.
1096000	1102000	Now, I know we reported on this show last week, or, sorry, not last week, but a couple weeks ago that Twitch had removed Playroom,
1102000	1110000	but you can see when you're actually in the PlayStation 4 channel, there's a little icon that indicates if the stream is coming from Twitch or if it's coming from Ustream.
1110000	1115000	You see the little logo, and you can also filter, and it actually looks like there's room that they could put more into it,
1115000	1121000	so if those two services were to get overwhelmed or a third one pops up, but I swear the boobs were on Twitch TV.
1121000	1124000	Which I was like, how did they do that? Because I thought Playroom was banned.
1124000	1127000	Maybe there was another trick or something, I don't know.
1127000	1134000	It's not that it's banned, it's that it's delisted from the directory on the website, is my understanding.
1134000	1139000	So the PS4, you can still get everything that's being streamed from other PS4s, but if you were to get on your computer,
1139000	1144000	go to Twitch.tv and search for the game Playroom, it will not show up.
1144000	1145000	That makes a lot more sense.
1145000	1152000	You can probably still, even if you know the name of the account, I assume that you can still watch the channel from your computer.
1152000	1156000	But to browse to it and find it is too much of a liability that they delisted it.
1156000	1162000	But yeah, most of them are going through Ustream, Loki, to be honest.
1162000	1164000	Alright, I was curious.
1164000	1168000	But here's the other thing, it wasn't just the livestreams that were appalling, it was the chat.
1168000	1177000	It was the chat. The chat was just like, I was almost offended and appalled by what I was seeing in chat.
1177000	1181000	Like when that girl was showing her boobs and everything, all the chat was like,
1181000	1185000	show your pussy, was basically what they were saying in chat.
1185000	1191000	And I'm sitting there going, and it wasn't just like show your pussy, it was like show your pussy you fucking whore,
1191000	1196000	and show you fat slut and all this stuff, and I'm just like this is gross.
1196000	1199000	This is gross behavior. And it's like one of those train wrecks.
1199000	1203000	Like I should not be watching this, I should not be supporting this, this is dirty, this is wrong.
1203000	1205000	But it's like you can't look away.
1205000	1210000	So I'm just thinking to myself, I'm like this is a Fox News nightmare waiting to happen.
1210000	1214000	And it's all going to get blamed on PlayStation 4 and this is not going to end pretty.
1214000	1221000	Because there's a part of me that's really excited about the potential of what this could do for broadcast.
1221000	1224000	You know I'm a big champion of independent broadcasting and independent stuff.
1224000	1228000	And earlier today I went in there again before the show, I was kind of showing Jason,
1228000	1237000	and there was two dudes on there doing a show in Playroom that was like our gaming show every Saturday at 7 or something like that.
1237000	1242000	And they actually decorated their little kitchen to look like a studio and all this,
1242000	1245000	kind of like what we used to do with OLR back in the garage.
1245000	1247000	And I was like okay that's a pretty good use of it.
1247000	1252000	And the chatters there were relatively pretty respectful.
1252000	1260000	But I'm thinking it's only a matter of time before Sony's going to have to moderate what they push to the front page.
1260000	1262000	You know what I mean?
1262000	1266000	Like I just, yeah it's something else.
1266000	1270000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
1270000	1275000	I used the Twitch Xbox One app and they had the Playroom in the list of games but there were no games in there.
1275000	1281000	I saw a Playroom stream two days ago with a woman and she was playing with her kid and she was responding to all the nasty comments.
1281000	1283000	That is the vast majority of those streams.
1283000	1291000	It's just people sitting there in front of the TV while we're all staring back and saying the nastiest shit and they're just responding to it.
1291000	1298000	And they just watch the chat go by and respond and this is like, is this what gaming has become?
1298000	1305000	No, it's what the internet is when the situation arises.
1305000	1310000	It's that whole, you know we've joked about this on the show before, but it's time to penis, right?
1310000	1317000	Whenever you put a new peripheral out there, how long before somebody puts their dick in it or on it or whatever?
1317000	1324000	And sure enough, dick, tits, whatever, it doesn't matter, they're private parts, it doesn't take very long at all.
1324000	1327000	This is just that whole thing in reality.
1327000	1337000	How long does it take for somebody to whip their boobies out or for somebody to practically be running around with no pants on where it leaves nothing to the imagination?
1337000	1339000	You know what I mean?
1339000	1346000	I don't know, it's just fascinating, but is this going to end positively for gaming? I don't think so.
1346000	1348000	I think this is a ticking time bomb.
1348000	1352000	And if Sony doesn't change this quickly, it's going to get real ugly.
1352000	1356000	Real ugly when one of the big stations reports on this.
1356000	1362000	Well at least if there's any benefit to this, it's that the local news won't pick up on this for at least another couple of years.
1362000	1364000	So we're still okay.
1364000	1365000	That's true.
1366000	1373000	Scottatron in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, awesome, so dude bros and a few morons are going to ruin it for everybody, typical.
1373000	1378000	Alan Alchemy says, but it was just spools of sewage directed at any woman.
1378000	1384000	Anyone who still thinks that being a woman on the internet, quote, isn't that bad, needs to see this shit.
1384000	1387000	It is literally everywhere and instantaneous.
1387000	1391000	I hate to say it, but absolutely. I mean, it's pretty appalling.
1391000	1392000	I'll second that.
1392000	1394000	It's pretty appalling.
1394000	1397000	Now, are the men objectified too?
1397000	1398000	A little bit.
1398000	1400000	Sure, especially the dude who is working out.
1400000	1409000	You know, he was getting the gay thrown out, which is a whole nother, you know, stop saying that, you toilet bowl commenter or whatever.
1409000	1411000	But I mean, they get a lot of that too.
1411000	1413000	But it is, it's really bad.
1413000	1421000	You know, when somebody's got a stream where it's like, you know, OMG a girl and all the comments are just like the most misogynist of things you can imagine.
1421000	1423000	It's pretty gross.
1423000	1429000	Tigerclaw in chat says, what Sony needs to do is put on some sort of explicit tags on streams that are showing mature content.
1429000	1436000	Kind of like how Twitch TV lets you change a setting on your account to warn people that you're showing mature rated content.
1436000	1444000	I think Sony needs to, I think they need to moderate what playroom streams they push to the front page.
1444000	1448000	I think what Sony needs to do in a firmware update is they need to filter out at least.
1448000	1455000	Now granted, I think in any game what's going to eventually happen is that even in the little camera window people are going to go crazy.
1455000	1461000	But I think for now to avert a real crisis, what Sony ought to do, they need to filter out the playroom streams.
1461000	1464000	And maybe you can still search for them if you know the name or whatever.
1464000	1472000	Or that Sony will only push playroom streams that they know are doing relevant content, let's just say.
1472000	1477000	I think the way that Microsoft implemented this and Bobby talked about two or three weeks ago is actually really relevant.
1478000	1487000	This doesn't disagree with your point, but that if anybody is reported and verified as having been doing something with this, they get delisted. Period.
1487000	1493000	And not even allowing people to search for them if you're going to do this kind of thing.
1493000	1504000	I'm kind of conflicted because ratings are a thing, parental controls are a thing, and you shouldn't outright punish someone for doing something.
1504000	1509000	But until an alternative exists, if anybody is caught doing something like this, just delist them.
1509000	1513000	They can still stream, they won't get any feedback, they're going to stop streaming.
1513000	1523000	What they should do is just have, when they're reporting these people, instead of having these anonymous reports, have it capture five seconds of what they were watching.
1523000	1528000	That way they can say, okay, yeah, that's definitely not appropriate.
1529000	1541000	I'll go a funny step further and say that when one user reports a second user, that the first user should not be able to see the second user anymore at all.
1541000	1546000	Just to prevent, like, it's still on, I'm going to report them again even if nothing's going on.
1546000	1548000	That's diving down a whole other rabbit hole.
1549000	1560000	The only concern I have, and maybe I'm being a little too tinfoil-hattish with this, but I just kind of see the reality of this as it's as easy for me to see tits on my PlayStation 4 like I did last night.
1560000	1568000	It's as easy for me to do that as it is to turn on cable and go to, you know, CNN on the cable box.
1568000	1571000	It's exactly as many button presses as it was.
1571000	1576000	And my thought is that everything on the cable box is regulated by the FCC.
1576000	1582000	I think some of it's a gray area, especially late at night, because I know Comedy Central used to show, like, the underrated movies and stuff.
1582000	1589000	But all that dialogue aside, it's moderated and it's filtered and it's government-controlled.
1589000	1595000	But this stuff on PlayStation 4, and I don't think we want to see it necessarily government-controlled.
1595000	1597000	And, you know, the Internet is a worldwide thing.
1597000	1600000	How do you control with the government something that's worldwide?
1600000	1603000	But my mind is just going, something's gonna give here.
1603000	1609000	And if Sony doesn't do it, somebody else is gonna step in and it's not gonna be good news anywhere.
1609000	1617000	And if Xbox gets this streaming thing soon enough, considering every Xbox owner has a camera in their house,
1617000	1623000	the problem very well will only be worse for Microsoft if they unveil this whole thing.
1623000	1628000	Because I'll tell you what, those PlayStation 4 cameras are harder to find than the fucking system.
1628000	1635000	I don't know how these other guys are finding them. I can't find them anywhere here in a 100-mile radius.
1635000	1642000	Yeah, they are very allocated by Sony. They're getting ready for their Japanese launch, so all their accessories are hard to get right now.
1642000	1647000	Yeah, so I'm just saying, it's gonna be very, very interesting.
1647000	1652000	Alright, going to live.vognetwork.com.
1653000	1656000	Alan's saying, the dudes get, let's see your dick, happy face.
1656000	1663000	The woman's get, you're fucking fat, let's see her dirty bleep bleep, you ugly bleep bleep, this boring slut, show us beep beep beep.
1663000	1670000	It's kind of a false dichotomy. Yes, people ask the dudes to do dumb shit, but it's not soaked in gross insults.
1670000	1680000	I will agree with that to an extent. I think there's still gross insults on either side, but is it unfortunately weighted way more towards the women?
1680000	1685000	Yes, I would agree with that, and that's very unfortunate. But that is the reality of what we're seeing right now.
1685000	1693000	Bobby Blackwell says, less Rob, the PlayStation 4 will push further to the left in the bar the stuff you used the most, or most recently.
1693000	1699000	Live with PlayStation could realistically be the first thing you could click on if you use it enough. That's very true.
1699000	1706000	And DarkSakura, of course, saying hello in our chat room, saying sorry, all the pussy talk reminded me to feed Midna.
1706000	1713000	Glad we could help. Glad we could be of service there over at live.vognetwork.com.
1713000	1718000	Alright, and Act F says, people will bitch if Playroom gets shut down or something.
1718000	1727000	Well, there is quality stuff to be seen on Playroom. Unfortunately, it's just not the stuff that's at the top of the list or the most easiest to access.
1727000	1735000	The two dudes that were doing the live show about video games was like about three pages down if you scroll down.
1735000	1743000	They only had like 20 viewers, whereas last night the girl with her cha-chas was at 500 and the dude wearing the gym shorts was like 250.
1743000	1747000	So, there you go.
1747000	1755000	DarkSakura says, it's built into society and it can be combated, but it has to start at home.
1755000	1767000	Alright, anyway, so I just wanted to get that out because I was just like, it's going to be one of those things where you're going to see it on the news and we're all going to be like, that isn't gamers.
1767000	1776000	That has nothing to do with gaming, but it's going to be the gaming community that takes the heat because I'll tell you what, it's going to be one of those ignorant local news people.
1777000	1785000	And yet, I say ignorant because I bet you anybody, this reporter will not be a gamer themselves, so it will be somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about when it comes to video games.
1785000	1794000	It will be an ignorant TV reporter that gets up there and says, well, you won't believe what gamers are using their PlayStation 4 for and it could shock you.
1794000	1797000	That's the story that's coming.
1797000	1812000	And it's going to be like, you know, I bought my kid this console for his birthday and this is the filth he saw immediately when powering it up and he came calling back to me and saying, mommy, I don't know what's going on.
1812000	1817000	It's going to be like one of those, just like all those porn on the 3DS stories.
1818000	1828000	Tall in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com with a very firm comment here that I think is important to address says, I would disagree. This is a part of gaming culture.
1830000	1834000	You know, despite what I just said, unfortunately, I do think he's right a little bit.
1834000	1840000	I think it's a part of human culture. This is by no means a specific thing whatsoever.
1840000	1841000	That's very true.
1841000	1845000	You will find it everywhere because it is human life.
1845000	1850000	It is a very ugly pointing the mirror at ourselves, at a society in a way.
1851000	1853000	That's a very good point.
1853000	1861000	But certainly you see a lot of that in the game, you know, just the way that women have been treated in the past and the insults that people hurl at each other on Xbox live.
1861000	1864000	I mean, that all has been a part of gaming culture, but you're right.
1864000	1868000	That's almost part of human culture as it is too, unfortunately.
1868000	1877000	Cosplay circles, you know, anime in general, anime, unfortunately, kind of especially because of the subject of the show, anime and manga both.
1877000	1891000	But also there's an argument to be made with gaming is that with the improvements and realism and everything else that technology is being used to benefit gaming is also making this thing more accessible, easier, for better or for worse.
1893000	1894000	Heavy stuff.
1894000	1900000	I don't know if there's an easy answer to this and I'm glad I'm not the guy that has to make these sorts of decisions.
1900000	1904000	But it's going to be fascinating to see how this next year plays out with these consoles.
1904000	1907000	If you have further thoughts, please feel free to email us.
1907000	1909000	Mailbag at OrangeOnTrader.com or you can also tweet us.
1909000	1911000	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1911000	1912000	You know, I'll tell you this.
1912000	1923000	I had that before I even saw the guys doing their little gaming show, I had that idea where I was like, dude, if I got one of those PlayStation cameras, we could do OLR through the PlayStation.
1923000	1929000	And we would get like, we would easily be able to be like in the top and it would get, be like a whole new audience.
1929000	1931000	We get all these new listeners. Oh my gosh, it would be great.
1931000	1938000	But then I'm thinking in the back of my head after I'm watching some of these streams, honest to God, my reaction was, do I want some of these people listening to OLR?
1938000	1941000	I don't think it's a bad idea to be honest.
1941000	1944000	I mean, yeah, there's going to be idiots and stuff, but they won't stick around.
1944000	1948000	They may show up for a little bit, but then they're like, oh, hey, someone's showing their ass on this one.
1948000	1949000	And then there'd be guns.
1949000	1950000	True. True.
1950000	1958000	And I would honestly, I would just hide the chat because you know, in PlayStation 4, you can either shrink your screen down so you can see the chat or you can just have the thing be full screen.
1958000	1964000	And I would honestly probably just have it full screen with it written on the whiteboard or something to join chat, go to our moderated chat room.
1964000	1965000	But I don't know.
1965000	1968000	I mean, again, I'm just, I'm brainstorming aloud.
1968000	1971000	This is not nothing we're actually thinking of doing.
1971000	1973000	But I'm sure there's a lot of other podcasters having the same thought.
1973000	1977000	I don't think I'm some type of like genius who thought of this idea first or something.
1977000	1978000	No, absolutely not.
1978000	1983000	I think a lot of people are weighing, how can I use this technology to do my thing?
1983000	1989000	One last little bit of this is that it doesn't even take anything particularly specific for this to happen.
1989000	1995000	I was watching the wrap up of All Games Done Quick, Awesome Games Done Quick last night.
1995000	2005000	And as they were finishing their official broadcast stream, there's a thing in the speedrunning community, probably maybe the game streaming community at large,
2005000	2013000	where they take a featured stream with a lot of viewers and they want to pay it forward, so to speak.
2013000	2016000	They want to take the traffic and send it on somebody else that's worthy.
2016000	2025000	Awesome Games Done Quick was wrapping up and so they wanted to send it to another guy that they recognized with good Super Metroid speedrunning talents.
2025000	2029000	And so there was a person transcribing stuff on the screen.
2029000	2033000	He accidentally linked to somebody else that was playing Legend of Zelda NES.
2033000	2038000	And I pop over to the channel because I'm kind of curious, thinking it was going to be Super Metroid.
2038000	2044000	And it's just dude sitting on his chair, full screen, you know, majority screen playing Legend of Zelda.
2044000	2049000	And first of all, the chat was scrolling 10 million miles a second.
2049000	2054000	But second, there was also like approachingly raunchy stuff.
2054000	2057000	Mob mentality, I guess, sort of thing.
2057000	2062000	Just kind of like the fact that they were trying to have their second to shine, they were trying to have their moment.
2062000	2066000	And they were trying to one-up the other people that were saying specific things.
2066000	2075000	And he was just, and the guy that was playing, when he noticed that his screen was scrolling by, he kind of walked up to the camera.
2075000	2084000	Whoa! And then just kind of went back to playing the game and something probably happened like 10, 20, 30 minutes later whenever there was a lull in gameplay.
2084000	2090000	But literally nothing was happening except somebody was playing Legend of Zelda NES of all things.
2090000	2098000	And people come in and just start going crazy, expressing themselves in a matter of speaking.
2098000	2102000	You know, I'm glad you bring up though the whole awesome games done quick thing.
2102000	2107000	Because obviously what they accomplished over the weekend, well over the week really, was a really cool feat.
2107000	2111000	Because they ended up raising a million plus dollars for cancer research.
2111000	2113000	A million bucks, two times their target for the week.
2113000	2120000	Thank you for bringing that up because I think that brings a very nice little bookend to the story about the cesspool of live streaming and the bad that comes from it.
2120000	2127000	And then we have this really great like, but we can't throw it all away because there's these great things that come from it too.
2127000	2134000	I mean that whole thing is a direct, you know, kind of reflection of the live streaming culture as well.
2134000	2139000	Is that, you know, thanks to that, you know, you've raised all that money and that's the real good that can come out of this too.
2139000	2144000	So, you know, just things to think about. It's not all bad I guess is my point.
2144000	2146000	In fact there's some real, real, real good stuff coming out of it.
2146000	2150000	As with anything, people can take advantage of it for better and people can exploit it for worse.
2150000	2152000	Very true, very true.
2152000	2158000	Alright, anyhow, let's get into how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.
2158000	2160000	You want to finish off your week Rob?
2160000	2165000	I guess I should start, huh, since Jamie's not here and I did bring up PlayStation 4, right?
2165000	2168000	Okay, so going into our gaming weeks, my gaming week.
2168000	2172000	So yes, I got a PlayStation 4 and besides all the stuff I just brought up, I have been playing some games on it.
2172000	2176000	You know what's funny? I actually don't have any disc based games right now.
2176000	2179000	I'm going to be getting some. A friend of mine is getting me a good deal on a couple games.
2179000	2188000	But right now I'm just kind of enjoying what's able to be downloaded on the PlayStation Store and what's available through PlayStation Plus.
2188000	2191000	So I played like a good seven or eight games on PlayStation.
2191000	2197000	I mean I downloaded stuff that, excuse me, I already had on PlayStation 3 that was cross by like Flower.
2197000	2201000	Which, yes I can tell the difference playing it on PlayStation 4.
2201000	2205000	It's just a lot crisper and even more vibrant.
2205000	2208000	I mean generally it's the same game, especially a game like Sound Shapes.
2208000	2210000	Really didn't look any different to me at all.
2210000	2213000	But Flower you could see just a little bit more.
2213000	2217000	It was very subtle but it was just that much crisper and looked that much better on PlayStation 4.
2218000	2225000	I will say a game that I really enjoyed on PlayStation 4 that I was really surprised because this game didn't really get that good of reviews.
2225000	2229000	But reviews aren't everything. It's sometimes about how you view a game.
2229000	2236000	I actually played all the way through a game called Contrast that's available for free.
2236000	2238000	Or at least it was. I don't think it is anymore.
2238000	2241000	But it was available through PlayStation Plus for free.
2241000	2244000	And I had that. And I actually played that from start to finish.
2245000	2250000	What's interesting about it though, the only reason I probably played that on PlayStation 4 is that it was free.
2250000	2255000	Because the game is also out on 360, PC, PlayStation 3.
2255000	2264000	And PlayStation 4, the graphics, it looks good but it doesn't really look that much better than what you would see on PlayStation 3.
2264000	2267000	But I wasn't expecting it to be much better because it's available on those systems.
2268000	2274000	But I liked it's setting a lot. I liked the style of the storytelling.
2274000	2278000	I loved the mechanic about how your character can become a shadow.
2278000	2282000	And basically the shadow kind of blends into the wall.
2282000	2285000	And you solve these puzzles and move around in the shadow.
2285000	2289000	And then you can phase out. And then you get later in the game you phase objects in with you.
2289000	2291000	And that's how you move things around.
2291000	2293000	It's a really interesting little mechanic.
2294000	2297000	The game's a bit buggy, unfortunately.
2297000	2300000	You really see some graphical bugs as you're going through it.
2300000	2303000	I have a really bad feeling this game was rushed.
2303000	2306000	Probably to try to make the PlayStation 4 release.
2306000	2308000	But yeah, there are some bugs.
2308000	2310000	But nothing that broke the game for me.
2310000	2312000	Yes, I did see some graphical glitches.
2312000	2317000	But it was nothing that broke the game or took me too far out of the environment and being able to see it.
2317000	2324000	Which I really love the style of the French carnival sort of theme that the game had to it.
2324000	2326000	It was really cool.
2326000	2328000	And it's short. It's a short game.
2328000	2331000	You could probably play the damn thing start to finish in about...
2331000	2335000	You could speed run it probably in like 45 minutes if even that.
2335000	2341000	But I think a normal person playing through it, it'll probably take them about 3 hours to play through it.
2341000	2343000	Depending on how good at platformers you are.
2343000	2345000	It wasn't anything too, too difficult.
2345000	2348000	But I thought the story was good enough.
2348000	2352000	And the ending kind of made me go, oh, that's kind of neat.
2352000	2354000	I was left feeling pretty good about the ending.
2354000	2359000	Even though in the last section I was like, alright, they're trying to wrap things up pretty quick.
2359000	2363000	So I think it was a little bit rushed, which is too bad.
2363000	2367000	But for the most part I enjoyed the game, especially for the price of free.
2367000	2369000	And I enjoyed my time with it.
2369000	2371000	So yeah, I did play through that start to finish.
2372000	2376000	I also played Resogun, which I know a lot of people on PlayStation 4 are playing.
2376000	2381000	And the only thing that kind of bugged me about Resogun is...
2381000	2385000	I was almost overwhelmed by all the buttons there were for a little shooter.
2385000	2388000	Because you have the overdrive and the bombs and everything.
2388000	2391000	And I don't think the tutorial in the game is really that good.
2391000	2393000	But I figured it out eventually.
2393000	2398000	And I guess through a little bit of trial and error I was able to figure out how it works.
2398000	2401000	Like, oh, okay, you shoot the little green ships.
2401000	2404000	And that's what breaks the guys out of the cage.
2404000	2406000	So when you see those, okay, now I've got to go pick up the guys.
2406000	2409000	That took me a little bit to kind of get the hang of in some trial and error.
2409000	2413000	But once I got the hang of it, Resogun's a pretty fun game too.
2413000	2417000	And then one other game that I've been playing...
2417000	2420000	Well, I've been playing the two pinball games, of course.
2420000	2422000	But those I've already talked about on prior episodes of the show.
2422000	2426000	I would say the one other game I've been playing a little bit of on PlayStation 4 is Don't Starve.
2426000	2430000	Which is the free game right now for January, which of course is also available on Steam.
2430000	2433000	A lot of people playing that on the PC.
2433000	2439000	Don't Starve is kind of neat because it's almost, in some ways it's kind of like Minecraft.
2439000	2443000	Where you're trying to go around the world and collect things and craft.
2443000	2447000	And you've got to do things so that the creepers don't get you in the middle of the night.
2447000	2449000	It's almost like that same type of thing.
2449000	2452000	Except it's more in a 2D world.
2452000	2455000	But I don't want to make people think it's Terraria because it's not.
2455000	2462000	It plays a lot more like a overhead, kind of like Zelda-esque, if you will, type of game.
2462000	2466000	But you're like gathering things and crafting and trying to survive through the night type of thing.
2466000	2471000	The only thing that bugged me about Don't Starve, and some people are going to criticize me for this viewpoint.
2471000	2473000	But I don't care because it's my viewpoint.
2473000	2475000	And this bugs me about games.
2475000	2479000	The game had no tutorial, no explanation, nothing.
2479000	2482000	Just throws you in and you've got to figure it out.
2482000	2488000	Okay, I understand that that's the charm of some games and some games are better for that.
2488000	2490000	But I'm going to be honest with you guys.
2490000	2494000	I didn't like Minecraft for the longest time because of that exact same thing.
2494000	2497000	When I first played Minecraft, I was like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
2497000	2498000	What the hell is this?
2498000	2501000	What am I supposed to do in this game? What's the point?
2501000	2507000	It wasn't until I played it on the 360 that it had a short five minute tutorial thing where I was like,
2507000	2510000	oh, this isn't so bad. I get this now.
2510000	2512000	Oh, Minecraft is actually kind of fun.
2512000	2518000	I think Don't Starve, although I get that the whole joke is the object of the game, Rob, is don't starve.
2518000	2519000	Okay, yeah, I get that.
2519000	2525000	But I think even just a couple, a little short explanation about this is what the game, this is what you're supposed to be doing,
2525000	2527000	would have helped a little bit.
2527000	2529000	But not everybody is going to agree with me there.
2529000	2536000	Some will argue that that's the whole charm of the game is being able to see it unfold what the game really is as you're playing.
2536000	2540000	But I'm going to tell you, in my mind, that was a little bit of a hindrance in the beginning.
2540000	2546000	And sure enough, there's Bobby in the chat room saying, they said that that was by design, the lack of a tutorial.
2546000	2551000	Well, I'm saying that was not a good design choice, in my opinion, and I'm entitled to my opinion.
2553000	2560000	He's also saying that the PS4 counterparts of Contrast and Flower, both compared to the PS3,
2560000	2566000	and in the case of Contrast, the 360 version are both maintained framerate and smoothness much better.
2566000	2567000	Oh, really?
2567000	2571000	Which is interesting because I always seem to remember new consoles, especially new architectures,
2571000	2579000	kind of lagging in certain ways and not being able to keep up just because the optimizations and efficiencies haven't really been worked out.
2579000	2581000	But apparently that's not the case for these.
2581000	2583000	Okay, at least somebody agrees with me in chat.
2583000	2589000	Fifth Dream says, yeah, I can't get a hold on Don't Starve, and I don't feel like going to Game Facts to get a manual.
2589000	2590000	That's how I feel.
2590000	2594000	Let's see, SSJ100Matt says, I'm glad you enjoyed it though, Rob.
2594000	2596000	Yeah, I had a hard time figuring it at first.
2596000	2601000	If it weren't for me playing it at PAX East and watching others play it, I wouldn't have gotten it either.
2601000	2602000	So there you go.
2602000	2606000	Yeah, I did play a little more, and I was starting to get into it.
2606000	2610000	I was like, okay, I get it a little more, but it's one of those games I need to go back and play more.
2610000	2615000	Because honestly, I played Don't Starve for maybe an hour or so, but then I was like, I need to go back and finish contrast.
2615000	2616000	So I did.
2616000	2621000	Otherwise, PC, I've still been playing a lot on PC.
2621000	2624000	I know I've been going on and on, but I've actually been doing a lot of gaming this week.
2624000	2628000	I just want to give a shout-out to this game as well, because I was playing an awful lot of it this week.
2628000	2634000	And I continue to play Path of Exile, which is the free-to-play game that's an awful lot like Diablo.
2634000	2639000	Honestly, I think Path of Exile is a better game than Diablo 3.
2639000	2645000	And one of the things that they do, that Diablo doesn't do, is that they do these races, they do these league races.
2645000	2651000	And I did my first race this week where it was a one-hour, it was called One Hour Endless Ledge,
2651000	2656000	where you would play the ledge levels of the game that were just over and over.
2656000	2658000	There was no caves or anything, you just play those levels over and over.
2658000	2661000	And it was who could level the highest in an hour.
2661000	2664000	And it was my first time, I didn't do that great.
2664000	2670000	But I didn't die, it was all in hardcore mode, and I got to level 12 or 13 without dying.
2670000	2675000	Now the people that were doing really well, they got all the way to level 26 and so forth,
2675000	2681000	so I ended up maybe in the middle of the pack above a bunch of dead characters.
2681000	2685000	But I was still pleased with my progress, and I had fun with it, which is the most important part.
2685000	2691000	So yeah, if you like roguelikes, Diablo games, you really owe it to yourself to try Path of Exile.
2691000	2694000	That game is great, and I can't believe it's free.
2694000	2701000	All of the microtransactions are either additional inventory space or cosmetic things,
2701000	2707000	and they've been making it work, because people have been supporting them after playing a lot of the games.
2707000	2708000	That's great.
2709000	2715000	Alright, over at live.vognetwork.com, Nate432 says,
2715000	2718000	Is Killzone any good to get for PlayStation 4?
2718000	2721000	Again, I don't have any disc-based games yet.
2721000	2724000	That's probably in the next week, I'll have some of those.
2724000	2729000	I've been hearing good things about Killzone, but I have not checked it out myself yet,
2729000	2732000	so I really couldn't say anything about that game.
2732000	2736000	DarkSakura in our chat room reminding us, speaking of Diablo-like games,
2736000	2739000	Torchlight 2 is on sale right now.
2739000	2748000	Yeah, Torchlight 2 is also a really, really great game in that same family as Diablo 3 and Path of Exile and so forth,
2748000	2750000	and that's really good.
2750000	2752000	Okay, I've yammered on enough.
2752000	2755000	There was even more stuff I played, but I've yammered on plenty.
2755000	2757000	Let's go to some more gaming weeks.
2757000	2759000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2759000	2762000	Well, let's see, this week I played a little bit of Minecraft.
2762000	2768000	In fact, right now I'm spying on the people playing Minecraft right now on the VOG Network server,
2768000	2771000	thanks to the dynamic map that we have on there.
2771000	2776000	I did play that too, and I'm glad to see more people are using it this time, it's great.
2776000	2779000	Yeah, we've got three people on there right now, so that's fantastic.
2779000	2783000	So I've been doing that, I'm actually doing some planning and stuff,
2783000	2788000	just trying to fix the mob arena thing that we have in there,
2788000	2793000	doing new classes for that, and one of the things we kind of came across today is
2793000	2800000	I may force upon everybody a resource pack, which will adjust some of the skins in the game
2800000	2805000	to maybe change some of the weapons they have, firing other objects,
2805000	2809000	instead of making them look like hoes, it'll look like a gun or something,
2809000	2813000	so I may put that into effect at some point.
2814000	2819000	So I have that, and then, what else did I play? I played a ton of different things actually.
2819000	2823000	I played Grand Theft Auto 5 this week, I went back and played some of the online in there,
2823000	2831000	and so far so good there, I leveled up to like 42 I think on Xbox,
2831000	2839000	and so I played through that and then passed my first survival mode in there, so that was pretty cool.
2839000	2847000	I played a little bit of Child of Eden, because I actually bought the digital version off eBay
2847000	2851000	for like 6 bucks a while back using some of my eBay points or whatever,
2851000	2856000	and so I actually played that a little bit because Josh wanted to see me play games,
2856000	2860000	and he wanted to see that game, so I'm like ok fine we'll play that,
2860000	2864000	and so I played that a little bit, it's still fun,
2864000	2869000	and let's see I also tried, there was a couple indie games I checked out,
2869000	2876000	I did play Time Viking and Space Raptor, which is, it's silly and cheap,
2876000	2881000	but great music in it, so fun little dollar indie game that you can buy.
2881000	2886000	I noticed that like mostly indie games on Xbox Live, indie games as far as like the top ranked ones,
2886000	2893000	they're all Minecraft type games, or some sort of Deathmatch type games,
2893000	2897000	it's Avatar Deathmatches or Minecraft, that's everything.
2897000	2901000	Minecraft games are the new hello world for game development.
2901000	2910000	Pretty much, let's see, I was going to say also, what else did I play,
2910000	2915000	I played a little bit of Call of Duty, and actually went back this week also
2915000	2922000	and was working a little bit on Saints Row IV, so I played through that a bit.
2922000	2929000	What else, I was redeeming some more Steam codes that I've been sitting on for a while from some old Humble Bundles,
2929000	2941000	so I'm now up to 197 games, and I thought I played some other Steam games that I had, maybe not,
2941000	2946000	but I'm going to try to get through this backlog of games I have maybe this year,
2946000	2951000	and try to play at least everything once.
2951000	2957000	Alright, well good luck in that goal, especially trying to get through that huge Steam library I know you've got going on there.
2957000	2958000	Oh yeah.
2958000	2962000	A lot of discussion in our chat room over at live.voguenetwork.com around Torchlight 2,
2962000	2964000	there's a couple people interested in it while it's still on that Steam sale,
2964000	2967000	so I see a few people kind of jumping on that, so that's pretty good.
2967000	2974000	Let's see, Fifth Dream says, I got Child of Eden physical copy for like $4, I haven't played much yet though.
2974000	2978000	So, looks like you can find that on pretty good sales at some places.
2979000	2982000	Before we get into Jason and what he's been playing this week,
2982000	2986000	well DarkSakura wanted me to pass along, because DarkSakura wanted to talk about her gaming week with y'all,
2986000	2989000	and so DarkSakura did not go into-
2989000	2991000	She obviously sent you a virus over IRC.
2991000	2995000	She has passed me her sinus infection somehow through the inner tubes.
2995000	2999000	DarkSakura says Animal Crossing and My Japanese Coach, she's been playing,
2999000	3005000	and Russian Dancing Men, aka WeebleStuff version of VibRibbon.
3005000	3006000	I have no- is that-
3006000	3007000	She was talking about that last week.
3007000	3009000	I've never heard of that, it's kind of neat.
3009000	3013000	Well, it wasn't exactly a big topic, but she said it was coming out and she needed to play some of it this week.
3013000	3014000	Gotcha.
3014000	3015000	So she did.
3015000	3019000	And DarkSakura says, and Minecraft, my Normandy is amazing.
3019000	3023000	Yeah, I know, when I logged into Minecraft, I went into the VoG server this week,
3023000	3028000	and I saw that Normandy that you guys built DarkSakura, that is damn impressive.
3028000	3029000	It's huge.
3030000	3032000	There's a huge Normandy, that ship.
3032000	3036000	But the only problem with the Normandy is, there's no door on it.
3036000	3041000	So the only way to get in, somebody finally cut a hole in the ceiling,
3041000	3044000	so I noticed it when I was flying over, I was like, oh, somebody put a hole in the ceiling.
3044000	3047000	So I went in and I was like, damn, this thing is huge.
3047000	3049000	So that was very impressive.
3049000	3053000	In fact, I think somebody had left a sign that said, holy shit.
3053000	3056000	And so I left another sign that just pointed at it and said this.
3056000	3057000	I'm with stupid?
3057000	3058000	Yeah, something like that, something like that.
3058000	3060000	Well, listen, let me be honest.
3060000	3063000	I didn't actually make that, it's a schematic file.
3063000	3066000	I just was testing out one of the plugins I have,
3066000	3070000	which is like a little NPC character that goes around and builds stuff off a schematic.
3070000	3074000	So I don't want to have like 50 Normities, though, on the map,
3074000	3077000	so that's why I'm not saying how to do it.
3077000	3081000	But I will have different schematic files that people will be able to generate.
3081000	3083000	You can actually do it instantly with WorldEdit,
3083000	3088000	but it's more fun watching an NPC run back and forth and actually build it block by block.
3089000	3090000	I don't know.
3090000	3094000	No, that is, I would like to see that in progress sometime.
3094000	3095000	That's pretty cool.
3095000	3097000	So there's Dark Soccer's gaming week.
3097000	3098000	All right, now we can go to Jason.
3098000	3099000	Jason, how was your gaming week?
3099000	3101000	Since it's been forever since I've played it
3101000	3104000	and since I'm a little bit interested in a lot of the stuff that's been added in,
3104000	3108000	I actually downloaded, went back to Minecraft.net and downloaded the client again,
3108000	3110000	and I didn't do anything else with it.
3110000	3112000	So I didn't play Minecraft this week.
3112000	3117000	I actually jumped into this gaming, this generation of console gaming.
3118000	3123000	We, for a long time now, the office has a couple of Xbox 360s, a couple of PS3s,
3123000	3127000	and more often than not, the game that a bunch of my coworkers play is FIFA.
3127000	3132000	Earlier in the week last week, or Friday the week before,
3132000	3137000	sometime very recently, I walked into our little gaming section of the office
3137000	3141000	and there was a whole bunch of green boxes stacked in one of the chairs.
3141000	3144000	And I walked over to it wondering what it was,
3144000	3149000	because it seemed kind of familiar, and sure enough, it was an Xbox One and two controllers.
3149000	3151000	While I'm still in the office, we'll have all four,
3151000	3154000	and I can actually put the controller that I bought for myself to use.
3156000	3160000	When the system by itself came in, there was only Forza.
3160000	3163000	We're left to our own accounts, so if I want to buy any games
3163000	3165000	and be able to play them there, I can.
3165000	3166000	I didn't.
3166000	3172000	I downloaded Dead Rising, Killer Instinct, and what was the other demo?
3172000	3175000	Lego Marvel, but I didn't actually get a chance to play that.
3175000	3180000	So, since Forza was the only title there and I was interested in checking it out,
3180000	3184000	I got the whole system set up, which was kind of a nightmare,
3184000	3187000	because when you turn on the system, you get a picture of the controller
3187000	3193000	and a little pulsating thing over the guide button,
3193000	3196000	or whatever they're calling it, this generation.
3196000	3202000	It'll also start showing you the pair button on top if you have to pair it with the system.
3202000	3205000	So I did that, and it recognized that the controller connected,
3205000	3211000	and then the controller would zoom in and there would be a pulsating light over the A button.
3211000	3214000	And I hit it, and it didn't do anything.
3214000	3216000	So I tried the other controllers.
3216000	3219000	They synced, but the A button didn't do anything.
3219000	3224000	TLDR, I reset that console probably six to seven times.
3224000	3227000	Just restarted, not deleted everything and started all over.
3227000	3235000	I restarted that console at least six times before I could actually get the controller to sync and start it to join the wireless.
3235000	3242000	To its credit, the entertainment center that we have in the room is basically like a gigantic shielded cage,
3242000	3247000	so we had to wind up setting the one on top of it so that it could get enough signal to play.
3247000	3254000	But then there was the 500 meg firmware patch, initial firmware patch that took longer to download than it should have,
3254000	3256000	even after we resolved the wireless problems.
3256000	3261000	A couple strange connectivity issues that I'm, because we used the wireless at work,
3261000	3265000	I'm pretty damn sure is a 360's fault and not ours, but I digress.
3265000	3272000	It was a hassle. It took two to three hours process that was completely nonsensical.
3273000	3277000	I don't expect it to happen again if and when I actually wind up buying that console this generation.
3277000	3280000	Okay, Forza, really, really, really good looking.
3280000	3286000	BlackWolf made a comment when he was talking about this game a couple weeks ago that the outrage,
3286000	3292000	the worst thing of Forza is the crowd and they look flat because I think they actually are,
3292000	3294000	or certainly they don't have body depth.
3294000	3298000	And he said it wasn't a big deal because you don't focus on the crowd.
3298000	3305000	I'm gonna disagree with that because when I was playing, whenever I play a driving game,
3305000	3314000	I will either play over the shoulder Birdseye style or I will play in the car itself.
3314000	3316000	What other ways are there, Jason?
3316000	3320000	There's technically, so the difference is...
3320000	3322000	Dog style, hanging out the side window.
3322000	3325000	Ace Ventura, cracked windshield style.
3326000	3330000	That's the first time I've heard dog style used in a clean context.
3330000	3333000	I was trying to quip that myself as well.
3333000	3339000	So to be fair, there's two in-car views with car decoration without car decoration.
3339000	3345000	And there's various levels like, like, you know, Daytona had the four styles.
3345000	3347000	It's basically, those really are the only two ways.
3347000	3352000	In the beginning, Jason, it just kind of sounded like some car out of the car.
3352000	3354000	Sometimes I like to be inside and sometimes I like to be outside.
3354000	3356000	From space, RC style.
3356000	3359000	Sometimes I like warm weather and sometimes I like cold weather.
3359000	3362000	Sometimes I'm in the front seat, sometimes I'm in the back seat.
3362000	3365000	It's Sunday, it's Sunday.
3365000	3369000	So I was playing in the driver's seat.
3369000	3375000	And the track that I remember most vividly is the Top Gear test course.
3375000	3379000	And the announcers, you know, they're all over that game.
3379000	3382000	And the people stick out like a sore thumb.
3382000	3385000	Their colors are a little bit off.
3385000	3391000	And when you're coming up like, you know, you're coming into a turn that's practically a U-turn.
3391000	3396000	And so you come in on one side of the people, wrap around them and head off.
3396000	3403000	And when they don't rotate or when you should be able to see the depth of the people and they look off, it's distracting.
3403000	3405000	Maybe that means I'm not paying enough attention to the road.
3405000	3408000	Probably true, but I still picked up to it.
3408000	3411000	If it's obvious enough, though, that you kind of look at...
3411000	3414000	And I've done this in games before where it's like, maybe it's not really a big deal.
3414000	3418000	But I'll kind of look at it and go, okay, that looks weird and out of place.
3418000	3420000	I've definitely done that before.
3420000	3428000	When they're putting in the effort to model all of the raindrops on the car and all the different reflections and stuff.
3428000	3433000	But they can't spend a couple polygons extra on the people.
3433000	3437000	To be fair, there are probably thousands, but the comparison you're making is very relevant.
3437000	3439000	Did it ruin the game, Joe?
3439000	3441000	Oh, hell no. It absolutely did not.
3441000	3443000	It stuck out and it was...
3443000	3447000	You just wanted to disagree with one of Bobby's points here on the show.
3447000	3450000	I am totally okay with that, Jason.
3450000	3452000	I... yeah.
3452000	3453000	Love you, Bobby.
3453000	3455000	And at the same time, I also knew about it leading in.
3455000	3457000	So, oh yeah, I did see that.
3457000	3459000	Whatever.
3459000	3461000	Confirmation bias. I don't know.
3461000	3464000	But it was still an absolutely gorgeous game.
3464000	3466000	I had a whole bunch of fun with it.
3466000	3469000	To the extent that I can have fun with a simulation racer.
3469000	3471000	I'm very much more of an arcade racer.
3471000	3476000	I played around with a coworker where I turned all of the assists off.
3476000	3478000	Ah, that game sucked.
3478000	3482000	Without Anilock breaking and the guide arrow.
3482000	3486000	One little piece of disappointment that I learned is that I thought...
3486000	3491000	So when I started playing the game, I knew there was a little bit of assistances in breaking, automatic transmission, all that kind of stuff.
3491000	3498000	But it wasn't until I raced a coworker that I found out that straight up breaking is assisted for you, too.
3498000	3506000	That kind of disappointed me because that's like half... well over half the challenge of racing is appropriate breaking for drifting and turns and all that kind of stuff.
3506000	3508000	Can you turn it off bit by bit, though?
3508000	3509000	Yes, absolutely.
3509000	3512000	Because I remember... I was like, in Forza Horizon, you could choose what assists you wanted.
3512000	3513000	I'm also... and also, you know...
3513000	3514000	There's brakes in this game?
3514000	3516000	What was that?
3516000	3518000	I've never used brakes, so I don't know.
3518000	3522000	I thought those were the walls that we ran into.
3522000	3524000	Brakes are for wusses.
3524000	3531000	And also, to be fair, I have never played a Forza title before. Ever. This was my first one.
3531000	3535000	Horizon is so good. I really hope they do Horizon 2 for Xbox One.
3535000	3541000	Honestly, if they come out at E3 and they're like, Forza Horizon 2 this holiday, I'm gonna be like, I just bought an Xbox One.
3541000	3546000	Well, you have six months to save up, so five months you can manage.
3546000	3547000	Totally fair.
3548000	3553000	But, yeah, I had a really fun time. I started racing on above average.
3553000	3561000	I liked the fact that I could blow past Black Wolf's Drivatar within the first lap of the race.
3561000	3570000	Not to keep hammering on Bobby's points, but it's my only frame of reference right now because I haven't played the Xbox One Forza myself.
3570000	3575000	I know he talked a lot about how the Drivatar system was really... what's your thoughts on that?
3575000	3589000	I think that's a very hard thing to judge because I just now played the game, I don't have the reference of knowledge of how much detail Bobby went into that game.
3589000	3596000	So what he did or didn't use assist-wise, what difficulty level he raced on, I have no idea.
3596000	3602000	I do remember him talking about consistently being about halfway up the field, like 7-6, something like that.
3602000	3605000	At least that's what I remember.
3605000	3618000	I pretty consistently, on the 100% defaults with all assists and on average, could hit first or second without too much difficulty.
3618000	3624000	I started playing around with some of the assists, then I also turned the difficulty to above average, which is just one step up.
3624000	3627000	I think there's still two more ahead of it. Fourth, fifth.
3627000	3629000	Don't be showing off your skill too much here.
3629000	3635000	My real question, I guess, in this is, is the Drivatar system a good thing or a bad thing in your opinion?
3635000	3642000	I like it because of the bonuses and benefits that it provides to a particular account, to a particular player.
3642000	3649000	And the driving felt... I read a lot into the fact that, oh, you're racing a real person instead of AI.
3649000	3652000	That's horseshit. It's learned AI.
3652000	3658000	But it still felt right because there were still the right kind of challenges and the differences between the tracks that people would take.
3658000	3669000	It wasn't just 12 competing cards on the perfect guideline, and they would actually take insides and outsides when they shouldn't necessarily do that.
3669000	3679000	So it kept the same sort of variety that I've learned from simulation games, and it still felt like a good, challenging race.
3679000	3681000	I guess that's what it boils down to.
3681000	3692000	And as those cars can continue to race, they provide credits, in-game credits, back to the player, which seems fun. A benefit for everybody.
3692000	3695000	Any other Xbox One titles you were just checking, like Killer Instinct?
3695000	3699000	A little bit of Killer Instinct, and I am also completely terrible at that game too.
3699000	3706000	I went through, I played a couple training matches. Yeah, whatever, I'm okay. I remember a little bit from the SNES days.
3707000	3715000	I started grinding through the dojo, and I got 15 or 16 stages in, and I was starting to understand the mechanic.
3715000	3720000	But I was literally just pouring through, this is how you low punch, this is how you low kick.
3720000	3723000	I've heard that Killer Instinct has a really good tutorial though.
3723000	3726000	It's incredibly granular, it is incredibly comprehensive.
3726000	3734000	But it was the last thing I played before I left, so I was kind of running through it as quickly as possible, maybe not reading as much of the detail and getting into it.
3735000	3738000	But I want to revisit that, obviously I still have a chance to.
3738000	3740000	Played a little bit of Dead Rising 3.
3742000	3743000	It's Dead Rising?
3745000	3753000	Oh god, Dead Rising demo has a 30 minute limit, or 20 minute limit, one of the two, and two execution limits.
3753000	3756000	You can only start the demo two times.
3757000	3758000	I don't get it.
3759000	3760000	This seems like, like, I...
3760000	3763000	They don't want people to just play the demo over and over.
3763000	3770000	You can't even play, like, give us more than two executions so we can understand if we're gonna play the game differently, let us play the game differently.
3771000	3776000	But a two execution limit with a time limit is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
3776000	3781000	I mean the DS demos have what, 30? But it's the full game.
3781000	3788000	Any demo with a limit of how many times you can execute it is fucking stupid.
3788000	3796000	Yeah, I've played, I've played Sonic, Mario and Sonic at the Summer Olympics, one of the two.
3796000	3802000	And I knocked down, like, six or seven rounds of that while I was trying to decide if I wanted to pick up the game or not.
3802000	3810000	That's, that's liberal that if you play the demo 30 times, I don't know, I don't see a situation where that's bad.
3810000	3814000	But the DS games aren't the full, wait, is the Xbox One demo the full game, or is it just like the first 20 minutes?
3814000	3815000	I doubt it.
3815000	3816000	Okay, I was gonna say.
3816000	3819000	It drops you in the action and there's no story to speak of.
3819000	3826000	Okay, because the DS demos, like the ones that I've played, like Kingdom Hearts, Dream Drop Distance, and The Resident Evil, you know, that's just a small section of the game.
3826000	3830000	Especially the Kingdom Hearts one was not really that in depth, and it still has a 30 play limit.
3830000	3837000	And it's like, I would maybe need two, but I honestly got a feel for this off one.
3837000	3845000	I don't know who the, what the character's name is, I don't know why he's doing what he's doing, I don't know where it's taking place, because I don't think it was Willamette or, or, uh...
3845000	3847000	No, it's a whole separate story.
3847000	3854000	Yeah, and I kind of gleaned a little bit just from the communication that's happening and whatnot, but there are no details of the game.
3854000	3862000	They just start you, which is great, but the two execution limit is still gonna bug me, because I can only play it in theory one more time before I leave.
3862000	3869000	And I, because I didn't have enough time to play it the first time, that means I have to really make the most of the second time, and then I'm screwed.
3869000	3871000	Which is very strange to me.
3872000	3873000	Um...
3873000	3878000	Anything else quickly before we get into, I wanna, we've been running for about an hour, so I just wanna make sure we get to news.
3878000	3883000	Well, if somebody didn't have to talk about so many lewd acts, no, no, no.
3883000	3886000	Look, the viewers want ass and titties, I'm sorry.
3886000	3887000	We gave it to them.
3887000	3892000	I think that that's certainly the most important. That was the notable parts of my week.
3892000	3898000	Although I would, I would like to hear more about Xbox One, I just, I'm gonna have to come visit and see it in action.
3898000	3899000	Do it.
3900000	3906000	I really did not get a feel for PlayStation 4 until I really got to see it in action, which honestly wasn't until I really got one myself.
3906000	3912000	And just got to really see how the interface has just, and I imagine it's gotta be the same on Xbox One.
3912000	3918000	It's the same for everything. How can you take something in when you're not in your own, like, comfort zone to sit down there and take it all in?
3918000	3924000	Exactly, but one thing I noticed about PlayStation 4, and I'm sure you noticed this about Xbox One, is that there was a lot that I was doing on PlayStation 4,
3924000	3927000	where I was like, oh, this is what PlayStation 3 needed to do.
3927000	3935000	Like, queuing up a game to download, and it downloads the game and the patches while you're in standby mode,
3935000	3940000	it just does it, and then it's installed, ready to go the next time you turn on your PlayStation 4.
3940000	3943000	That's what we all expected the PS3 to do.
3943000	3945000	Two quick other anecdotes.
3945000	3952000	A coworker of mine was talking about how slow the installation process is on the Xbox One.
3952000	3958000	And I agreed with him at the time, but I forgot that Forza is a 6 gig install, and it was gonna take a long time.
3958000	3962000	The fact that I was playing after half of it got installed, pretty damn nice.
3962000	3966000	I was playing in less than 10 to 15 minutes, if I recall correctly.
3966000	3973000	And, hey, Weiland, Xbox, turn off. Sorry.
3973000	3977000	Related to this, another coworker of mine, we were...
3977000	3982000	Did you see the video? I don't know if this is where you go with it. Did you see the video on YouTube of the guy who's...
3982000	3988000	He actually went into Call of Duty, and his name, his gamertag, was Xbox shut down.
3988000	3989000	And so he did this...
3989000	3990000	Hey, it's Xbox, sign off.
3990000	3992000	Oh, that's it, thank you. Xbox, sign off.
3992000	3995000	Sorry to anybody who's listening on Xbox One, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.
3995000	3996000	And you thought what I did was bad.
3996000	3999000	I know, unplug your Kinect for a minute, because I gotta tell this story.
3999000	4001000	So his name is Xbox, sign off.
4001000	4006000	And, like, all these people, while he's playing Call of Duty, because you know how people will tend to call people out.
4006000	4009000	Hey, Xbox, sign off. Off.
4009000	4014000	Okay. No, but he would be jumping up and down in front of players, and people would be like,
4014000	4017000	What the hell are you doing, Xbox, sign off?
4017000	4019000	No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
4019000	4022000	The reactions were pretty fucking funny, I gotta say. Anyway, sorry, tangent.
4022000	4029000	So we were, again, crowded around our gaming room, and me and coworkers were just kind of socializing.
4029000	4033000	And we started talking about something that I wanted to show a video of.
4033000	4038000	And so I'm, you know, I'm facing my coworkers away from the Kinect, and I just kind of turn my head over to the left.
4038000	4040000	Xbox, launch YouTube.
4040000	4043000	One of my coworkers looks at me and busts out in laughter.
4043000	4045000	And then the TV starts doing things, he's like,
4045000	4048000	Whoa! How'd you do that?
4048000	4051000	I was like, I just told you, dude. I just told you and the Xbox.
4051000	4055000	And then he busted up in laughter again, because he didn't realize it was actually gonna work that way.
4055000	4059000	Kind of fun, relatively natural voice.
4060000	4066000	The fact that there's no dictation, speech to text, is obnoxious.
4066000	4070000	There is for being searching, there is not for anything else.
4070000	4073000	So far as I could tell, so far as I could figure out.
4073000	4079000	A couple of other weird nitpicky things, but I've used my Kinect with the 360 quite a bit.
4079000	4083000	I enjoyed it. There's better integration on the Xbox One.
4083000	4085000	I'm gonna take advantage of it.
4085000	4090000	Hopefully they fix these rough edges for the shitty troll commands.
4092000	4096000	Alright, let's get into, since we've talked about our gaming weeks,
4096000	4099000	and quite extensively gone over some of the new consoles,
4099000	4103000	I'm curious, those of you guys that have been getting your PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones,
4103000	4105000	what are your guys' thoughts on everything?
4105000	4107000	Certainly would open up the email bag for that.
4107000	4109000	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
4109000	4112000	Other housekeeping I want to mention, don't forget to follow us on Twitter.
4112000	4115000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We also have a Facebook page.
4115000	4118000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
4118000	4120000	We will be here next week.
4120000	4123000	The roadshow we've been talking about doing this month
4123000	4125000	is gonna have to be put on the back burner for a little while.
4125000	4128000	I'm hoping we can reschedule that for the summer at some point,
4128000	4129000	but it's not gonna work out.
4129000	4132000	With all the personal stuff people are going through on the show right now,
4132000	4134000	it's just not gonna be able to be happening.
4134000	4137000	But I'm hoping something like that can be rescheduled for the summer.
4137000	4139000	We'll see. That would be exciting.
4139000	4143000	Alright, anyhow, let's get into gaming news.
4143000	4145000	Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?
4145000	4149000	Yes, so this week at CES, there were some announcements from Sony.
4149000	4153000	And during their press conference, they announced a few things,
4153000	4159000	including PlayStation Now, which is what they're calling their brand new Gaikai service.
4159000	4161000	It's gonna be launching this summer,
4161000	4166000	and it's basically meant to bring streaming of PlayStation 3,
4166000	4172000	PlayStation 2, and PlayStation games to the PlayStation 4, PS3, Vita,
4172000	4178000	and other devices, including tablets, TVs, and I'm not sure about phones,
4178000	4182000	but definitely other devices, Android and iOS and stuff like that.
4182000	4184000	So very cool.
4184000	4189000	And they were even showing off a demo at the convention
4189000	4192000	where people were playing The Last of Us on a Vita.
4192000	4194000	And apparently it worked pretty well.
4194000	4197000	But it's hard to say right now how it's actually gonna work in a real-world environment
4197000	4202000	since they had the server basically down the hall,
4202000	4207000	but it looks pretty cool and something that I'm looking forward to,
4207000	4212000	especially since I have a big library of PlayStation Plus games.
4212000	4216000	It'll be interesting to see how well those will stream.
4216000	4220000	Yeah, it's one of those things where you really don't know how it's gonna go
4220000	4222000	until you are able to get your hands on it.
4222000	4225000	And I just think there's so much potential for variables.
4225000	4229000	And even though PlayStation might be able to get this thing working flawlessly in their bubble,
4229000	4231000	how's it gonna work in the real world?
4231000	4237000	For people that live out maybe not in a major city, is it really gonna be that good?
4237000	4239000	How's it gonna work?
4239000	4245000	Well, they said it's basically that you only need five gigabits down,
4245000	4249000	I think is what the minimum was for it to work.
4249000	4251000	That's still high for some people.
4251000	4253000	For a lot of people it's not bad.
4253000	4257000	For some people that's still high.
4257000	4262000	True, but networks are improving and speeds are getting faster.
4262000	4263000	Yes, that's true.
4263000	4267000	So maybe by the summer it'll be rolled out in more locations,
4267000	4271000	and it's not necessarily something that everybody wants to do.
4271000	4274000	I don't know, I think it's a neat idea.
4274000	4277000	Yeah, I'm curious to see too what pricing looks like.
4277000	4281000	I love the idea of possibly a Netflix-style library for PS1 and PS2 games.
4281000	4283000	That would be freaking awesome.
4283000	4284000	Yeah, that's true.
4284000	4289000	The other thing is they mentioned that there may be some sort of rental program built into there,
4289000	4295000	as well as some sort of subscription program that would be separate from PlayStation Plus.
4300000	4304000	I'd be wondering too if I bought games on, let's say on PlayStation 3,
4304000	4307000	I actually bought PlayStation 1 games in the store,
4307000	4309000	because there was a couple of those I bought.
4309000	4311000	I think about Castlevania Chronicles and City Code and One.
4311000	4315000	If I bought those games in the store, would I get access to those on PlayStation 4?
4315000	4317000	I would think that you probably would.
4317000	4319000	You would think, but maybe not.
4319000	4321000	I don't think it should be a given.
4321000	4323000	I mean, look at Virtual Console.
4323000	4325000	You have to pay a dollar to upgrade on Wii U.
4325000	4328000	Yeah, but look at a lot of the stuff that Sony's done.
4328000	4330000	Most of their stuff is cross-buy anyway,
4330000	4334000	so they were kind of the people that brought that to the forefront as far as,
4334000	4337000	hey, you buy it on one console, you get it on all of the consoles.
4337000	4339000	Nintendo hasn't really picked up on that yet.
4339000	4343000	They figured, hey, we can charge you a few extra bucks for this Virtual Console title,
4343000	4347000	because one, we overcharge you from the get-go in the first place,
4347000	4351000	and two, we did things to it this time, so you need to pay us more money.
4352000	4355000	I was going to say the same thing with the cross-buy initiative.
4355000	4359000	I think it's a pretty safe thing to say that Sony will be as loose with it
4359000	4364000	in terms of compatibility that they can with regard to things like compatibility.
4366000	4369000	Well, we'll see. More details probably on this in the coming months.
4369000	4372000	Did they say that this was coming out sooner rather than later,
4372000	4375000	or is it the type of thing where we won't see more until E3?
4375000	4376000	Summer.
4376000	4378000	So E3, you'll see a lot more on this.
4378000	4382000	Maybe they'll unveil it, or they'll roll it out at E3. Who knows?
4382000	4386000	All right. Well, meanwhile, in the world of Xbox One,
4386000	4389000	Xbox One, you can view Twitch streams on Xbox One,
4389000	4393000	but you can't broadcast ass and titties yet on Xbox One.
4393000	4396000	And a lot of people are asking, well, when is that going to happen?
4396000	4402000	Well, a tweet from Twitch TV themselves indicates that it might be a little while.
4402000	4404000	A tweet that went out earlier this week said,
4404000	4408000	Xbox One direct broadcasting. There is no ETA at this time for Microsoft.
4408000	4412000	Expect a few more months. If we know sooner, we'll update.
4412000	4420000	And there's no reason for this. We don't know what the real holdup is or what's going on.
4420000	4424000	We don't know if maybe Microsoft might actually be seeing what's going on on Sony's system
4424000	4426000	and some of the things we talked about at the beginning of the show.
4426000	4429000	Maybe they're getting some cold feet about some of it. I don't know.
4429000	4432000	Or it could just simply be a programming. I mean, we don't know.
4432000	4434000	We could make things up until the cows come home.
4434000	4436000	But it doesn't seem like it's going to be happening anytime soon.
4436000	4439000	I want to say I saw a related story where an executive said,
4439000	4448000	We promised it before E3. So this thing could not be out until April or May or even early June at this point.
4448000	4454000	Or maybe I think they could still get away with putting it out at E3 and still come out looking good.
4454000	4458000	I think maybe it's just more complicated because the way they have their systems set up.
4458000	4461000	The fact that it's like three operating systems running on top of each other.
4461000	4468000	That they may not know how. It may be hard to. What exactly do we show on this?
4468000	4473000	Is it just going to show everything or is it going to show just the game?
4473000	4479000	Or we can also have this stuff that's snapped in there because remember it has an HDMI in on it.
4479000	4484000	That could be maybe there's some sort of abuse to that.
4484000	4489000	They're just trying to make sure they can filter all that stuff out maybe.
4489000	4495000	Maybe. We'll see. So I'm very curious to see how different it looks when it comes out.
4495000	4498000	Or if it's going to be very similar to what you see on PlayStation 4.
4498000	4501000	Well it's going to look like Metro I'll tell you that much.
4501000	4505000	Which is a whole bunch of squares so maybe it's not too terribly different from what the PS4 did.
4505000	4511000	Is everything a table of blocks and tables and squares and maybe not so squares? It's just the easy thing to do.
4511000	4514000	Even the PlayStation one is kind of blocks and squares though.
4514000	4518000	It could be worse. It could be like the Vita where everything circles.
4518000	4520000	You mean Google Plus style?
4522000	4523000	Alright.
4523000	4530000	State of Decays developer Undead Labs has signed a multi-year, multi-title agreement with Microsoft Studios.
4530000	4536000	A lot of the speculation of what this means is that Undead Labs can start proceeding.
4536000	4543000	That they got the green light for an MMO that is still going under the name Class 4 right now.
4543000	4548000	But that doesn't really suffice the multi-title agreement.
4548000	4553000	But that's the odds on favorite to take place.
4556000	4561000	New contract which is a nice antithesis to everything that was happening last week with everything just kind of disappearing.
4561000	4565000	So at least we're getting a positive outlook continuing into the year.
4565000	4574000	I would just like to see an actual, I guess we will see an MMO on the Xbox One once the Elder Scrolls Online launches.
4574000	4578000	But maybe something else on there?
4578000	4580000	It'll happen.
4580000	4586000	I mean online is prevalent and powerful enough now that if they're not doing it they're missing out.
4586000	4591000	Well I don't know how it is on Xbox One because I know Killer Instinct is their big free to play thing that's out.
4591000	4595000	And I don't know what else is there but I did notice there is a pretty big push on PlayStation 4.
4595000	4601000	There's several free to play things, like I knew there was DC Universe but I didn't realize there was Warframe.
4601000	4605000	There's one other one that's like a free to play first person shooter on there.
4605000	4609000	There's already like a handful of free to play things on PlayStation 4 so I don't know.
4609000	4613000	Anything that you may have picked up from PlayStation Plus is only sweetening the deal.
4613000	4614000	Yeah really.
4614000	4620000	Well I don't know, to be honest these free to play games that are available on PlayStation 4 I don't know if they're system sellers.
4620000	4621000	They're all available on PC.
4621000	4625000	Well maybe not system sellers but let's compare your experience of starting to mine.
4625000	4630000	I played one, two retail titles now with FIFA.
4630000	4634000	I've played two retail titles now and everything else was a demo.
4634000	4643000	The marketplace on Xbox One didn't rub me the right way just in available titles and especially arcade titles in general.
4643000	4653000	Yeah they were out there but they weren't particularly prevalent and it felt like I would look through, I would thumb through the catalog in ten seconds and I had seen everything and I was done with it.
4653000	4657000	I think, I don't think PlayStation 4 is as much better as you might think.
4657000	4666000	There's still, I mean the good news is a lot of the stuff that's there, there's a lot of free to play stuff with the pinball and so forth and the PlayStation Plus stuff since they didn't have Drive Club.
4666000	4675000	Remember, Contrast and Resogun weren't supposed to be free but they ended up pushing those through as free because they weren't able to get Drive Club out for the launch.
4675000	4684000	And these are new consoles, they haven't had a chance for the catalog to come up or new titles and not just classic whatever backwards compatibility system they do have.
4684000	4687000	Yeah, still to come.
4687000	4692000	Alright, let's go to Loki.
4692000	4713000	Alright, so of course the MPD numbers have finally come out and before that there were some pre-end of the year announcements of sales and for 2013 the Nintendo 3DS software sales of course increased and they've sold 11.5 million units in the US.
4713000	4730000	And I guess they're planning to announce their third quarter earnings later this month but right now they're saying that's a 45% increase in software sales from 2012.
4730000	4750000	Which, yeah, there's a lot of good titles that came out this year and even I would think a lot of stuff that was coming out at the end of the last, well 2012, like Mario Kart 7 and Super Mario 3D Land or whatever it was.
4751000	4756000	Those are some good titles so they've had a pretty good year I'd say.
4756000	4760000	Moving on from that, let's get our first look at next gen sales.
4760000	4763000	The 3DS had a good year but did they say anything on the Wii U at all?
4763000	4765000	Oh no, Wii U what?
4765000	4774000	Yeah exactly, that's what worries me a little bit is when Nintendo doesn't really say anything about the Wii U then you kind of go, hmm.
4774000	4778000	I think we've all known this though that 2013 was a rough year for them.
4778000	4786000	Well, but then there was that wank that came out last week about how VG Charts had said that they outsold the Xbox One in the last week.
4786000	4792000	Wasn't that like literally like two days of the end of the year though? Plus it was an end of the year story.
4792000	4793000	Just saying.
4793000	4797000	Colin, 2012, 2012 was a wash, 2013 was a year.
4797000	4808000	Let's put it this way, they outsold the Xbox One for the entire year but the Xbox One has been out for a month and a half versus the Wii U that was out for the entire year.
4808000	4812000	Oh, I didn't even realize that the time, that's just plain silly.
4812000	4820000	That's what they were talking about. Not in that same time frame as when, you know, not in that six week time frame, they're talking about the entire year.
4820000	4823000	So yeah, that's not that impressive.
4823000	4824000	Alright.
4824000	4830000	Speaking of the Xbox One though, the Xbox One hit 3 million sales before the end of the year.
4830000	4834000	And that's actually sold through and not just sold to stores.
4834000	4845000	They of course, they passed the 1 million mark on the first day of retail across 13 markets because they launched globally.
4845000	4850000	And it only took them 18 days to make 2 million.
4851000	4866000	And of course, to go along with that, Sony announced during their press conference at CES that they've sold 4.2 million units of consoles worldwide as of the 28th of December.
4866000	4884000	And I guess they were saying that they were meaning to ASL another, they sold 2.1 million units across December.
4884000	4891000	So that's pretty good. I'm not sure what they're forecasting though for 2014 but they definitely hit their number.
4891000	4898000	I think they were originally saying they wanted to hit 3 million by the end of the year so not bad.
4898000	4908000	Yeah, they're still pretty hard to find so 15 million units! Pinky's up. Anyone knows.
4908000	4918000	Well it's going to be interesting because I think, like I mentioned before, I think we're running into a similar situation where there's not a whole ton of content coming out.
4918000	4925000	I mean they've got actually a little bit more for Playstation 4 and Xbox One versus the Wii U.
4925000	4932000	The Wii U I actually posted on Twitter. The Wii U is running into the same damn problem it had before with last year where there's nothing coming out.
4932000	4941000	There's literally 4 titles, 4 retail releases between now and April. And they're not big titles either.
4941000	4948000	I mean there's Donkey Kong so that's going to be coming out but the rest of them are really small third party titles that have been delayed.
4948000	4957000	I mean Hello Kitty I guess you want to save the game of the year for that but there's 4 titles coming out in 3 months.
4957000	4962000	That's kind of the same problem we had last year. That's not going to move systems.
4962000	4969000	Yeah that's not good. That's not good news. But I mean that's unfortunately a direct result of the third party abandonment of Wii U.
4970000	4971000	Yeah.
4973000	4979000	Alright well let's move on to... I don't know if this is better news but Jason what do you have for us?
4979000	4991000	I was reading an article over the course of the week, an op-ed posted on Polygon by Ben Kucera.
4991000	5007000	And basically what it boils down to is that we've made a big deal about how these super crazy 3 fourths, 80%, 90% sales, we live for this kind of stuff on Steam, Desura, GOG and anything else.
5007000	5019000	And that a couple of people have expressed how they feel like it's unfair to the original authors, to the original developers, designers, the publishers and everything else of a video game.
5019000	5025000	And basically this article struck me as really interesting because it reminded us, it reminded me of a really specific point.
5026000	5036000	There were some games that were less than 6 months old that went on sale, usually not more than 50% at most and usually much less.
5036000	5044000	Probably from what I recall of looking at the catalog definitely closer to like 25, 30, 15% those kinds of things.
5045000	5058000	And what it boils down to is that when you release a game, unless you have a crazy resurgence cult smash, when you release a game you make up, you recoup any sales you're going to in the first month or two.
5058000	5061000	Because after that people have probably forgotten about it.
5061000	5069000	That's changing with MMO and other long living kinds of games but you know the rush to get the game is going to happen in the first month or two.
5069000	5075000	And immediately after every other additional sale is as good as it's going to get.
5075000	5077000	If it's full price, great.
5077000	5091000	But if the long tail is made up of a ton of people paying less than that, it's still worth it because it will be more exposure because more people will be willing to pick it up when it's at a discounted rate.
5092000	5106000	So any, at least some individuals feel that if you feel that these sales are an outrage to popular games that would otherwise make a lot more money, probably not.
5106000	5110000	Because they've already made what they're going to make in large part.
5110000	5114000	Everything's reported as the first week, the opening week, the opening month.
5114000	5123000	After that, it's not exactly as defined and it's really just up to the long lasting nature of the game for them to be able to continue raking in any additional income.
5123000	5128000	That's very true, is that most games are judged within its first month of sales.
5128000	5136000	You get very, very, very few games where it's like, oh this game was a slow burn but it ended up doing okay.
5136000	5139000	Or you know, oh this game made a big revival later on.
5139000	5145000	Like maybe a game like Katamari Damacy did that, but how long ago was that game, you know?
5145000	5151000	And Mario is going to be in a pretty similar situation. We were talking about how 3D World was not doing particularly well.
5151000	5160000	It was the lowest selling game in its launch window in its first week or first month than any other previous Mario game and there's been a steady decline of that.
5160000	5171000	But as more people pick up the Wii U and this kind of stuff becomes available, it will have, it should have a good, you know, resounding success over the long term.
5171000	5178000	And Nintendo stuff doesn't get discounted that much. Like I don't know that I've ever seen a Mario game in the bargain bin.
5178000	5179000	That's true.
5179000	5185000	So those games more than anything else have a chance of riding out good two, three year.
5185000	5187000	Although they might have to discount the system again.
5187000	5189000	I think they're going to have to.
5189000	5191000	Give away the razor to sell the blades.
5191000	5192000	Yeah.
5192000	5199000	Why can't they just have like Steam sale type sale on virtual console games? I mean, that would be fantastic.
5199000	5207000	They were for a hot minute. Like they were doing that 30 cent promotion. Like, you know, where the games, which is, you know, practically free.
5207000	5216000	Because 30 cents is nothing. But yeah, they didn't, they didn't, that went for just like last year and they haven't really done anything like that since.
5216000	5227000	I know Wii U does do sales once in a while, but it's, you know, so does, so does the Xbox marketplace and so does PlayStation four, you know, it's, it's really nothing different than what you see there.
5227000	5232000	So, all right, Jason, I think you have something else for us.
5232000	5233000	Yeah. Double header.
5233000	5236000	Double header.
5236000	5254000	Continuing financial news and results and everything else. Basically, as of the conclusion of the year, due to many other non-gaming facets of Sony, Sony's stock fell to a rate that Nintendo had a wider market cap than them.
5254000	5261000	This is also in the, oh, what's the Japanese stock exchange called, the Nikkei, I think.
5261000	5269000	Sony, Sony's market cap dropped to 1.86 trillion yen, which is about 17 and three quarters billion.
5269000	5279000	And Nintendo's market cap was still above 1.93 trillion yen, about 18 and a half billion, 18,500 billion.
5279000	5283000	If that number actually makes sense in your brain, it barely does in mine.
5283000	5298000	But the, and this is, this is, this is in large part, conceded as the fact that Sony is a huge company that has stakes in not only gaming, but also in media, both music and movies.
5299000	5313000	Publishing as well as development, as well as licensing and everything else that the, you know, that the Sony conglomerate covers, where Nintendo has largely shrunk down to a single purpose.
5313000	5324000	So it's kind of spectacular to see that somebody that does less is able to withstand a company that reaches all of digital entertainment in the modern era.
5324000	5332000	And going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, poor Sony.
5332000	5343000	You know, I don't think anybody's really crying for Sony in this case, because, you know, Sony's still selling a shit ton of PlayStation 4s, and it's probably a better story right now than what the Wii U's got.
5343000	5346000	And everything that is successful can be spun off.
5346000	5359000	You know, these are all subsidiary companies and everything else that can be sold off selectively, so that other places post better gains, and the hemorrhaging wounds are skirted out.
5359000	5368000	Sony has survivability one way or another, and by no means does this spell bad for Sony. They'll survive.
5369000	5375000	Yeah, and they will. But this also goes a long way for the people that are like, oh Nintendo should just throw in the towel and make mobile phone games.
5375000	5381000	It's like, did you forget about the 3DS? You must have just forgot about the 3DS. You must have just forgot that it's there.
5381000	5390000	There's even some companies like EA that have, you know, not only have they cut off Wii and Wii U, they're also done with the 3DS.
5390000	5397000	You know what, though? The news isn't that great for EA. Two words, Loki. Battlefield 4.
5398000	5401000	And no NCAA, so that's even less money coming in.
5401000	5405000	I have a really, really, really quick comment about that.
5405000	5406000	Sure.
5406000	5416000	A new coworker just started last week. You wanna guess, in the context of EA and Battlefield, you wanna guess what his username on Twitter is?
5416000	5417000	Fuck EA?
5417000	5420000	DICE. Who's the company that develops...
5420000	5421000	Oh no.
5421000	5426000	You'll never guess the kind of tweets he's been getting in the past month in large part.
5426000	5428000	They make for good stories, though.
5428000	5430000	Oh my gosh.
5430000	5431000	Pretty hilarious.
5431000	5434000	He must have in his bio line, I did not make Battlefield.
5434000	5440000	There's actually three different kinds. There's a rapper in Texas or something like that.
5440000	5446000	And then EA, DICE. And then reality TV show somebody's cousin or something? I don't know.
5446000	5453000	But he also starts to retweet some of this stuff so the people that actually know what's going on...
5453000	5455000	It makes for great stories. I've been laughing so hard.
5455000	5456000	Is this him here?
5456000	5457000	That's him.
5457000	5460000	Blaming me for Battlefield 4 will get everything fixed.
5460000	5463000	I love that he has a sense of humor about it.
5463000	5465000	He's taking it in stride. He's a wonderful guy.
5465000	5466000	It's great.
5467000	5473000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Zones Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, ball.
5475000	5478000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5478000	5483000	And let's see what unfinished games are coming out to a store near you very soon, if anything. Loki.
5483000	5484000	Nothing this week.
5484000	5493000	Thankfully though, after this week, once we get into the 28th, we'll actually get some games coming out.
5493000	5500000	I was going to say, the end of this month, the Tomb Raider HD edition, whatever they're calling it, is out, right?
5500000	5503000	And then February, you get the Rayman.
5503000	5504000	Definitive Edition.
5504000	5506000	Yeah, Definitive Edition. You get the Rayman ones too.
5506000	5510000	My mistake. Nothing for two weeks. I forgot. There is still another week in there, so wow.
5510000	5515000	Yeah, it's still a drought. But once we hit the 28th, then there will actually be game releases every week, so that's good.
5515000	5517000	Alright, we're starting to get back into it.
5517000	5523000	Alright, speaking of getting back into it, Japan finally seeing some releases after a couple, a little bit of a drought for them.
5523000	5525000	So Japan does have a few things right now.
5525000	5531000	A lot of it though is price reductions, although there is some new stuff, but you do have price reductions on Borderlands 2, the Game of the Year edition.
5531000	5537000	Musou Orochi 2 and Shinsekoku Musou 6 Empires, all kind of going into their best hits.
5537000	5540000	The only new game I see on PlayStation 3 is Short Piece.
5540000	5544000	Tsukugime Ranko no Ichiban Nagai He comes out this week.
5544000	5546000	Like a miniature version of One Piece?
5546000	5549000	Bandai Namco. What, Short Piece?
5549000	5551000	That was a dumb joke.
5551000	5553000	Yeah, it sure was.
5553000	5557000	Well, I'm trying to look at screenshots of this game to see kind of what it is, because I don't know, is this like an anime?
5557000	5564000	It kind of looks like it might be based on an anime. I'm just not as familiar with those, but I see a lot of anime-looking cutscenes here.
5564000	5569000	What the hell game is this? Oh, Bullet. It's got to be a shooter. I see a bullet meter.
5569000	5570000	And a...
5570000	5571000	What?
5571000	5573000	Is that a giant dog game?
5573000	5575000	It is. It is a giant dog.
5575000	5578000	It's here to wreck your day.
5578000	5582000	The things when you can't put screenshots together, my god.
5582000	5584000	Can you put that on the YouTube for people or something?
5584000	5585000	I certainly can.
5585000	5588000	Such destruction. Many shooting. Wow.
5588000	5590000	Very bullets.
5590000	5591000	Very bullets.
5591000	5593000	Much dodge.
5593000	5595000	There you go. Bullet dodge.
5595000	5597000	Bullet dodge.
5597000	5605000	All right. On the Xbox 360 in Japan, the only thing of note there is that Borderlands 2 goes to the Game of the Year edition there as well.
5605000	5609000	On the PlayStation Vita, nothing this week.
5609000	5617000	On the Wii U, nothing this week. In fact, they don't have anything until February when Puyo Puyo Tetris comes out in February on Wii U.
5617000	5622000	Let's see. On the 3DS, Vitamin X Evolution Plus.
5622000	5626000	I don't think that's a drug-dealing game. I think that's just something else there.
5626000	5628000	On the 3DS, and lastly...
5628000	5629000	They don't have drugs in Japan.
5629000	5631000	Classic game, like Dr. Mario.
5631000	5638000	On the PSP, Chō no Dokuhana no Kusari Taisho Iroki Ibun comes out from Prototype.
5638000	5641000	Yes, they are still a steady stream of PSP games in Japan.
5641000	5646000	So, go figure. This looks like kind of like a... I don't know if it's like a romance game.
5646000	5648000	Definitely a dating or visual novel game.
5648000	5650000	Yeah, but that looks like objection.
5650000	5651000	Objection!
5651000	5657000	I love that Phoenix Wright in that scene there. It's love and lawyers or something. I don't know. There you go.
5657000	5659000	How about the UK, Jason?
5659000	5666000	Kind of a light week continuing. It'll be a nice time whenever these releases start to really ramp up later this year.
5666000	5669000	But tomorrow, possibly today already with the time zones.
5669000	5675000	On the 13th, Nidhogg on the PC. On the 14th, The Banner Saga reaches PC.
5675000	5684000	On the 15th, they finally will be getting Assassin's Creed Liberation HD on the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Dr. Luigi on the Wii U.
5684000	5690000	Lastly, on the 17th of January, Mario Party Island Tour comes to the 3DS.
5690000	5692000	And that's that.
5692000	5697000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.
5697000	5702000	Alright, so Nintendo, they've won a patent lawsuit.
5702000	5712000	This was actually one of the companies that was suing them based off of the, I want to say a patent that had to do with the Wii Balance Board and the censors in that.
5712000	5725000	And as part of it, not only did they win against IA Labs, but IA Labs was forced to pay them compensation for their legal fees and stuff and had no money to do so.
5725000	5729000	What did they do instead? They went ahead and bought up all of IA Labs' patents.
5729000	5732000	So, they're not going to be doing that again.
5732000	5735000	That is a shockingly good turn of events.
5735000	5747000	Well, judgments aside about whether or not their patents were or weren't deserved in the first place, the fact that they couldn't pay is something I've not really heard of.
5747000	5754000	And for Nintendo to just kind of bring in all of those and not have them sold off to somebody else that turns around and does the same damn thing.
5754000	5755000	Good news for Nintendo.
5755000	5756000	Yeah.
5756000	5757000	Very good news.
5757000	5761000	Alright, one more story for you guys about arcade games.
5761000	5768000	Ironically, after we kind of reminisced a little bit on last week's show about some of the big pompous things, like prop cycle and things like that.
5768000	5777000	There was an interesting article that was ran on USgamer.net this week that talked about what the 10 biggest grossing arcade games of all time were.
5777000	5780000	Actually, no, I take that back. It wasn't this week, it was actually last week.
5780000	5783000	It kind of slipped under the radar though, so it was called to our attention this week.
5783000	5785000	But I wanted to go over it because, hey, arcade games.
5785000	5791000	And I also thought it was interesting because not a lot of the games were modern.
5791000	5801000	I don't know if you've peaked at this story at all, but Jason, if you were to guess, and Loki, I don't know if you've peaked either, but if you guys were to guess, what would you say would be some of the biggest arcade grossing games of all time?
5801000	5808000	I would easily put those for any of the tabletop and various format games from the late 80s, early 90s.
5809000	5815000	At least a couple of these would be owned by the Donkey Kongs and DigDogs and Jousts and Rally-X.
5815000	5824000	More recently than that, oh god, I would assume that at least one of them has to be, like, some kind of game.
5824000	5826000	But that's about all I could really guess.
5826000	5832000	I would have said for sure Pac-Man, because that game was so huge in the 80s, don't underestimate it.
5832000	5835000	And Street Fighter II, for sure, because that game...
5835000	5839000	That's what came to mind as a classic fighting game that probably made it.
5839000	5848000	I would have also guessed newer games like Capcom vs. SNK 2, I would have guessed Soul Calibur, I would have guessed Driving Games, I would have thought Initial D.
5848000	5851000	I would have guessed Dance Dance Revolution, to be honest, would be on this list.
5851000	5854000	I would sooner say Daytona USA than Initial D.
5854000	5858000	But maybe it's because games like that have several incarnations.
5859000	5864000	There's the original Pac-Man, yes, there's Ms. Pac-Man, but there really wasn't much beyond that.
5864000	5869000	Whereas, you know what, there's like 17 Dance Dance Revolution games, and Driving Games and so forth.
5869000	5873000	Well, here it is. Here's what the top games are of all time, time, time, time.
5873000	5878000	Now, keep in mind, this is also with adjusted revenue.
5878000	5883000	And that's a big factor too, because when I tell you number 10 is Space Ace, you might go, huh?
5883000	5891000	That's for a game that was critically acclaimed, but not exactly the highest success, because it's very strange nature.
5891000	5893000	It also took two or three quarters to play the game.
5893000	5899000	Which, you know, back in 1984, whenever this game was out, yet now two or three quarters is kind of commonplace.
5899000	5902000	Back in 84 it was very rare, so, you know.
5902000	5908000	Number 10 was Space Ace, number 9 was Time Traveler, and by name alone, I was like, what the fuck game was that?
5908000	5911000	And then I was like, oh god, it's the hologram game that Sega put out.
5911000	5914000	This game was awful. I would have never guessed it was in the top 10.
5914000	5920000	But because it was the hologram game, and that part of it was pretty cool, you know, it eats up quarters.
5920000	5922000	Because people are like, OMG, it's magic.
5922000	5926000	Number 8 was Tron, which I would say is a pleasant surprise.
5926000	5930000	I would not have guessed that that would have been in the top 10, but it was, so I go, okay, cool.
5930000	5934000	Number 7, Dragon's Lair, for the same reason as Space Ace.
5934000	5940000	Number 6, Defender, which I think sometimes we forget how big this game was.
5940000	5944000	A game like Resogun? Heavily inspired by Defender.
5944000	5946000	So, you know, how does...
5946000	5949000	Number 5, Donkey Kong, as you would have guessed, which, you know, I'm sure.
5949000	5951000	Number 4, Street Fighter II.
5951000	5956000	Number 3, Street Fighter II Championship Edition.
5956000	5960000	So they are counting them as separate games, and that's kind of interesting that, you know,
5960000	5965000	but if you were to put those two together, it would probably be damn near number 1.
5966000	5972000	Number 2, Space Invaders, which, as you remember, is probably bigger in Japan than it was here,
5972000	5974000	but it was still a big deal here.
5974000	5978000	And then, of course, number 1, Pac-Man, which I'm sure is a surprise to nobody.
5978000	5982000	I'm surprised Daytona's not on there, because there's Daytona machines everywhere.
5984000	5986000	Number 1, Pac-Man.
5986000	5991000	If you adjust the inflation on how much this game has made since its launch in 2013...
5991000	5995000	Keep in mind, these machines still make money. Still.
5995000	5999000	You know, because every barcade's got a Pac-Man machine, and people go,
5999000	6002000	LOL Pac-Man. I even do. I play Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man if I see a machine.
6002000	6005000	I'm like, oh, what the hell? For old times' sake, right?
6005000	6007000	Let's see if I can get to board 256 today.
6007000	6012000	Paperboy, Marble Madness, and Punch-Out pretty much, and Tapper at the drop of a hat if I see it.
6012000	6017000	3.4 billion dollars. Billion.
6017000	6023000	Avatar is like the highest-grossing movie ever made, and it's only made about 1 billion. 1.1 and change.
6023000	6026000	Pac-Man's made 3 billion plus.
6026000	6029000	That's also in a much smaller window. As soon as Avatar's gone, it's gone.
6029000	6034000	Home video, yeah, whatever, but same kind of argument as retail games.
6034000	6038000	Outside of a certain window, they're done, and then you just pick up the onesie-twosies afterwards.
6039000	6043000	Alright, let's do a little bit of reminiscing since we're talking about arcade games.
6043000	6047000	Let's do a little more reminiscing in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
6049000	6053000	Every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,
6053000	6056000	hey, you kids should be playing this game this week, dammit.
6056000	6057000	But this week, she missed.
6057000	6063000	But this week, she got sick. She OD'd on playing too much of the game she was going to pick for you guys,
6063000	6067000	which I admit was a really cool game, so I almost said, oh, I'll just do her game for her,
6067000	6070000	but then I'm like, ah, but she might want to talk about it.
6070000	6074000	So we're going to shift her game to a future week when she's back,
6074000	6081000	and I'm going to take over, mwahahaha, with a game that I have chosen for this week's Classic Game of the Week.
6081000	6087000	And the Classic Game of the Week that I have picked this week is a game called Arkon.
6089000	6092000	Alright, Arkon, the light and the dark.
6092000	6096000	Arkon was probably best known on the Nintendo.
6096000	6100000	It was an NES game, so a lot of people know it from the Nintendo,
6100000	6104000	and the video that you guys are going to see on YouTube comes from the Nintendo version as well.
6104000	6106000	But I also remember this as what?
6106000	6108000	A Commodore 64 game.
6108000	6114000	This is a Commodore 64 game that a lot of people mistake as a chess game when they first look at it,
6114000	6116000	because it does look an awful lot like chess.
6116000	6119000	You have a lot of, like, pawn style pieces that are in the front,
6119000	6122000	and you have stronger pieces that are in the back and so on,
6122000	6127000	but, you know, Arkon is the type of game that could really only be done in the digital era,
6127000	6130000	because the game board shifts and changes colors,
6130000	6134000	and your pieces have spells and all this crazy stuff in the game.
6134000	6140000	This game you probably also would know as the game that has the battle arena,
6140000	6142000	not to be confused with battle chess,
6142000	6146000	but when two pieces meet up, they actually do battle with each other.
6146000	6149000	They actually go into an arena, and you use the controller to move them around,
6149000	6153000	and, you know, if you just have one of the little pawns, like one of the little goblins,
6153000	6156000	and when you hit the button, he's just going to go with a sword.
6156000	6158000	Oh, we're going to see a battle taking place right now, actually,
6158000	6162000	with a unicorn and a little goblin guy, and that goblin guy is hosed,
6162000	6165000	because he just has a little club, but you can beat the unicorn over the head with it,
6165000	6167000	but the unicorn can, like, fire projectiles.
6167000	6170000	Of course, the unicorn is going to win in that particular case.
6170000	6172000	So that's kind of how the battles work there.
6172000	6176000	So, I mean, it's very much unlike chess in that regard.
6176000	6179000	Just because you move on to a square doesn't mean you're necessarily going to capture it.
6179000	6184000	So, the original development of this game was for Atari 8-bit computers in 83,
6184000	6187000	but it was ported, of course, to the NES, the Commodore 64.
6187000	6194000	It was also on the ZX Spectrum, the Amiga, IBM PC, Macintosh, PC-88, Amstrad CPC.
6194000	6197000	Whoo, it was on a lot, a lot of different systems.
6197000	6200000	How is it possible to port to that many different systems back in the day?
6200000	6201000	In the 80s, that was common.
6201000	6204000	I mean, yeah, games were simpler, but, I mean, come on.
6204000	6208000	Today, we at least have, like, modern technologies to make that kind of thing easier.
6208000	6210000	One or two dudes did it.
6210000	6211000	Yeah, yeah.
6211000	6214000	In fact, the designers of Arkon, three guys,
6214000	6217000	I'm sorry, actually not, I shouldn't say three guys,
6217000	6219000	because there was actually a woman as well.
6219000	6222000	Ann Westfall was one of the designers of this game.
6222000	6227000	John Freeman and Paul Reich III all did this game, so that's pretty cool.
6229000	6232000	So, you might think the game is chess, but of course it's not.
6232000	6235000	The pieces are, you know, moved around by the player,
6235000	6237000	and some have different moves than others,
6237000	6240000	but of course getting rid of a piece is not automatic,
6240000	6242000	because sometimes they will do battle.
6242000	6246000	The squares on the board actually can affect the battle,
6246000	6248000	because if a dark player is on a dark square,
6248000	6249000	then they're going to get a bonus,
6249000	6254000	but if they're on a light square, they're going to have a hindrance.
6254000	6258000	And some of the squares on the board actually change color,
6258000	6259000	so that's kind of interesting.
6259000	6261000	And then you also have some really cool pieces,
6261000	6265000	like the shape shifter will actually just become whatever piece it's fighting.
6265000	6268000	And then like the phoenix was exploded,
6268000	6270000	it didn't have projectiles at all,
6270000	6273000	it actually just turned into a ball of fire and slash a shield.
6273000	6278000	Each side also has a spell caster that kind of serves as the king or the queen,
6278000	6279000	depending on what side you're on.
6279000	6282000	The light side gets the wizard, the dark side has the sorceress.
6282000	6285000	And they have different spells that can be used,
6285000	6288000	such as like teleport and heal and things like that.
6288000	6293000	Either to win, you either destroy all of the pieces on the opposing side,
6293000	6296000	or you occupy all five power points.
6296000	6299000	But that wizard I mentioned a minute ago, or sorceress,
6299000	6301000	is in one of those power points,
6301000	6304000	so you really are going to have to take that piece out if you really want to win the game.
6304000	6306000	So, there you go.
6306000	6310000	The game was very well received when it came out and got pretty high reviews.
6310000	6315000	In 1996, Computer Gaming World said it was the 20th best game of all time.
6315000	6318000	IGN named it the 50th best in 2003,
6318000	6321000	so a lot of people remember this game pretty fondly.
6321000	6325000	There were sequels that came out to the game as well.
6325000	6327000	There was Arkon 2 Adept,
6327000	6332000	there was Exciter was the third game, although people don't know those as well.
6332000	6334000	However, people might know some of the remakes.
6334000	6340000	1994 had Arkon Ultra, which was big because it had modem play.
6341000	6345000	I wanted this game so bad when I was a kid, but my parents wouldn't buy it for me.
6345000	6347000	I was so mad.
6347000	6349000	Real teenage problems, right?
6349000	6351000	Thanks, ma'am.
6351000	6354000	But now that I'm a big kid and pay my own bills,
6354000	6357000	I can actually go and buy Arkon myself,
6357000	6361000	because there's actually a version of it on Steam that's available.
6361000	6365000	And that is, I think, Arkon...
6365000	6367000	There's different rewrites of the game.
6367000	6370000	There's Arkon Evolution that was in 2008.
6370000	6372000	Everything on Steam is all Arkon Classic.
6372000	6375000	But I think it's Arkon Conquest was the game that they actually put out.
6375000	6377000	There's a version on iPhone as well.
6377000	6379000	And then, yeah, there's Arkon Classic.
6379000	6384000	But no, there's a version that's actually on Steam right now
6384000	6386000	that's like a newer version. I have it in my library.
6386000	6388000	It's still called Arkon Classic.
6388000	6390000	No, there's a different one. I know there is.
6390000	6392000	Is there Arkon Ultra, maybe?
6392000	6396000	I searched for Arkon, and there was the trailer, the demo, and the full title
6396000	6398000	all called Arkon Classic.
6398000	6401000	Maybe you still haven't got delisted, something like that?
6401000	6403000	Yeah, I doubt that.
6403000	6406000	And Tigerclaw in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
6406000	6408000	Do you think this game needs a next-gen remake?
6408000	6410000	Well, it's kind of already had one.
6410000	6412000	Well, there's one on Steam right now.
6412000	6414000	So let me see if I can actually find it.
6414000	6417000	Maybe it is Arkon Classic, but I thought...
6417000	6423000	By Classic, it does not look like the classic Spectrum NES C64 version.
6423000	6425000	It is Arkon Classic. I thought it had a different name to it.
6426000	6429000	It's just a graphically improved version of the classic gameplay, by the looks of it.
6429000	6431000	That's still really cool, though. Yeah, I've played a little bit of this.
6431000	6433000	It's pretty cool.
6434000	6436000	And yeah, the boards can take different shapes,
6436000	6438000	and you can do some different things with that, so...
6438000	6439000	Very cool.
6439000	6441000	Did you ever play this game, Loki?
6443000	6445000	No, I never played Arkon.
6445000	6447000	Oh, I love this game. Did you play it, Jason?
6447000	6448000	It was a fun game.
6448000	6450000	I've seen it. I think this is one of those games
6450000	6453000	that I didn't understand how to get started of it, so it didn't last very long.
6453000	6455000	But I've definitely poked at it.
6455000	6457000	Again, here's my whole thing where it's like,
6457000	6459000	there's no tutorial.
6459000	6461000	Was there ever in the 90s?
6461000	6464000	Yeah, in the 80s. I guess there really wasn't.
6464000	6466000	So, there you go.
6466000	6467000	Tigerkongchat says,
6467000	6469000	Has there ever been a speedrun of Arkon?
6469000	6471000	I wonder how long it would take to beat.
6471000	6474000	Yes, there are on YouTube, and I think the answer is a minute and a half.
6476000	6480000	I mean, especially with long-moving, diagonal-moving characters,
6480000	6483000	you can make a little bit of room and get there in a hurry.
6483000	6487000	SSJ100Matt noted that the company founded by one of these developers
6487000	6489000	went on to do some of the Skylanders games.
6489000	6493000	So, these guys are still involved with gaming in some way or another.
6493000	6494000	Anyway, one of my favorites.
6494000	6496000	I played a shit ton of this on the Commodore 64,
6496000	6498000	and then when it came out on the NES, I was like,
6498000	6502000	there's music, and the graphics are so good.
6502000	6504000	This is next-gen, baby.
6505000	6506000	On the NES.
6506000	6508000	So, yeah, this is a game I remember fondly,
6508000	6510000	so that's why I picked it, Arkon.
6511000	6514000	I guess for the NES, since that's the version I played there,
6514000	6516000	because it had the Commodore 64 version,
6516000	6518000	that didn't have the background music,
6518000	6521000	but I remember the Commodore 64 version fondly,
6521000	6523000	although the original original version,
6523000	6525000	of course, on a completely different system altogether.
6525000	6526000	So, there you go.
6526000	6528000	There's your classic game of the week.
6528000	6530000	We're going to take a break, but when we come back,
6530000	6533000	there is plenty more OLR to come, including rapid-fire news,
6533000	6534000	the FUGL question of the week,
6534000	6538000	and, of course, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,
6538000	6540000	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,
6540000	6542000	when we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio,
6542000	6544000	right after this.
6550000	6553000	Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio,
6553000	6557000	live on this Sunday evening, January the 12th of 2014,
6557000	6561000	with the 535th episode of our show already in progress.
6561000	6563000	Again, we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network
6563000	6566000	voggenetwork.com, Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern,
6566000	6568000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,
6568000	6570000	and a lot of you guys in our chat room,
6570000	6571000	over at live.voggenetwork.com,
6571000	6573000	participating with tonight's show.
6573000	6575000	We've been reading a lot of fun little comments.
6575000	6577000	Some of our topics we were talking about earlier in the show,
6577000	6579000	generating a lot of chat.
6579000	6580000	Well, they appeal to a lot of people.
6580000	6581000	Some good discussion there.
6581000	6583000	DarkSakura, not here tonight, but she is in chat,
6583000	6585000	so the live listeners can at least interact with her.
6585000	6587000	Podcasters, you can always send an email
6587000	6588000	if you're listening on the podcast,
6588000	6590000	be it either on the podcast feed,
6590000	6592000	or through Stitcher, or what have you.
6592000	6594000	Now, some things to look forward to on upcoming episodes
6594000	6596000	of the show of Orange Lounge Radio.
6596000	6598000	Next weekend is a three-day weekend,
6598000	6601000	so I'm hoping that means maybe a little bit...
6601000	6602000	The road show may not have happened,
6602000	6604000	but maybe a little bit of liquor will happen next week.
6604000	6605000	A safe, of course.
6605000	6608000	We're not going to get crazy like the people on PlayStation 4,
6608000	6610000	but it might be a little bit of liquor on next week's show.
6610000	6611000	Dunk show.
6611000	6612000	That should be fun.
6612000	6617000	In a couple weeks, coming up on February 2nd,
6617000	6619000	I think it is, if I got the date right,
6619000	6622000	February 2nd, he may have just left Hoard House,
6622000	6625000	but he's going to be here in person on Orange Lounge Radio.
6625000	6627000	Shane Olinko is going to be here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6627000	6630000	He has not been on OLR outside of a call.
6630000	6631000	It's been a very long time.
6631000	6632000	It's probably been about five years,
6632000	6634000	so we're going to get caught up a little bit there
6634000	6637000	and give him crap for leaving Hoard House and all that stuff.
6637000	6638000	No, I'm kidding.
6638000	6641000	What games are you going to try to push on you guys now?
6641000	6643000	I don't know. Oh, no, I do know.
6643000	6646000	He is bringing his PlayStation 4 copy of Skylanders
6646000	6649000	because he's convinced he can get me addicted to that stuff,
6649000	6650000	and I'm like, no!
6650000	6651000	Don't do it.
6651000	6654000	That'll be the first week that everybody gets a reprieve from my voice.
6654000	6656000	If you're going to get hooked on something,
6656000	6658000	at least make it Disney Infinity.
6658000	6661000	I thought that was your last show, was that same night?
6661000	6662000	No, a week before.
6662000	6665000	My current plan, and of course this can still change
6665000	6669000	because work's going to determine how long I stay here,
6669000	6673000	but I'm currently planning on being back on the road on the 1st,
6673000	6678000	so this time that weekend I should either be listening to everybody's wonderful voice
6678000	6682000	as I coast down the mountain back home or not.
6682000	6684000	We'll find out then, of course, when it happens.
6684000	6687000	So that's going to be a fun show in a couple weeks when Shane's here.
6687000	6689000	I'm sorry you're not going to be here.
6689000	6691000	Maybe the work situation will change. We'll see.
6691000	6692000	Miss you, Shane.
6692000	6694000	Yeah, it's no secret that Shane and I are really close friends.
6694000	6696000	We talk every day and so forth,
6696000	6701000	and despite everything that happened with Hoard House and so forth,
6701000	6706000	I'm glad that he can still kind of have his voice heard and so forth and be on the show,
6706000	6708000	and I just know it's going to be a really awesome time.
6708000	6709000	So it'll be good.
6709000	6713000	This is the first time I've seen him in person in probably like three years.
6713000	6714000	That'll be fun.
6714000	6718000	So already thinking of all the places he's got to do in California when he's here.
6718000	6723000	Where do all the out-of-town people want to go when they come to California?
6723000	6725000	RVGL.
6725000	6727000	No, we're past that.
6727000	6730000	Now when you go back to golf land, you're like, this is sad.
6730000	6733000	What are all the places you have to do in California, Jason?
6733000	6735000	Disneyland.
6735000	6738000	Unfortunately, we're not going to have enough time or money to go to Disneyland.
6738000	6739000	Alcatraz.
6739000	6741000	No, no. You're thinking too big.
6741000	6743000	Think of like restaurants and stores.
6743000	6745000	They don't have other places.
6745000	6746000	In-N-Out.
6746000	6748000	In-N-Out is the big one.
6748000	6751000	In my defense, I'm not used to that being...
6751000	6755000	It's not exactly California exclusive because when I was in Arizona, I went as well.
6755000	6759000	There certainly are none in Colorado that I know of.
6759000	6764000	The other thing, this is the other big thing that Shane really loves in California.
6764000	6765000	And I'm like, really?
6765000	6767000	Out of all the restaurants, you missed that?
6767000	6769000	Chevy's.
6769000	6771000	Like Chevy's is kind of bad.
6771000	6772000	Like I don't...
6772000	6773000	That's...
6773000	6775000	Is that a chain in California?
6775000	6776000	It is a chain.
6776000	6778000	They might be in other states, but I know it best with California.
6778000	6781000	For those who don't know Chevy's, it's a Mexican restaurant basically.
6781000	6783000	But it's kind of whitewashed.
6783000	6786000	And when I say kinda, I mean like really?
6786000	6788000	But I know what it is.
6788000	6792000	It's that fucking corn substance they serve with every meal that some people go apeshit bananas over.
6792000	6794000	And I think it's gross.
6794000	6795000	That's just me.
6795000	6798000	How do you describe Chevy's to an out-of-towner, Loki?
6798000	6800000	Um...
6800000	6802000	No idea.
6802000	6804000	I mean, with the franchise...
6804000	6806000	I don't know. I don't really eat there.
6806000	6810000	We live in California. You can get better Mexican food at thousands of other places.
6810000	6812000	It's a round table instead.
6812000	6814000	They have decent wings.
6814000	6819000	All I know is that Chevy's is right across the street from a hotel that I stay at pretty often when I'm around San Francisco.
6819000	6820000	Oh nice.
6820000	6826000	Things change from location to location and franchisee to franchisee, but I was not impressed.
6826000	6830000	Oh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, they're in Times Square. I didn't even know that.
6830000	6832000	I didn't know they were nationwide. Alright.
6832000	6837000	I'd like to think I have a pretty discerning palate and taste buds for Mexican and Mexican.
6837000	6839000	They don't have them in Kansas.
6839000	6841000	The margarita wasn't half bad.
6841000	6844000	The drinks are never gonna be that bad. Alright, look.
6844000	6846000	We can talk about food and restaurants.
6846000	6847000	Oh, well, foodie-o.
6847000	6852000	One more. I gotta mention this though, because you know Shane's making a big deal out of he's gotta go to Espituse.
6852000	6853000	You know what that is?
6853000	6854000	I've never heard of this before.
6854000	6856000	That is the Brazilian Grill.
6856000	6862000	Where they bring the big hunks of meat on the swords to your table and slice it off on your plate.
6862000	6868000	And Shane goes crazy about, like, the gross disgusting raw meat and the chicken hearts.
6868000	6869000	Yes.
6869000	6870000	Oh my god, yes.
6870000	6871000	I've eaten, I've eaten, I tried it.
6871000	6872000	Chicken hearts are so good.
6872000	6874000	I tried it. And then I, you know what?
6874000	6878000	The week after I tried them, they ate them on Survivor.
6878000	6880000	And I was like, I just ate that for real.
6880000	6882000	That's not particularly surprising.
6882000	6883000	Like, non-ironically.
6883000	6890000	I have asked my coworkers about two types of foods in the Bay Area, in San Francisco specifically.
6890000	6893000	Brazilian, and I want to say I didn't get any positive answers.
6893000	6896000	And Mongolian, which I still don't have any answers for.
6896000	6898000	But there is a place in the Bay Area.
6898000	6900000	I am totally inviting coworkers to do that.
6900000	6902000	Good Mongolian is hard to find.
6902000	6904000	Yeah, but that's great.
6904000	6906000	But I've just never heard of any place's existence at all.
6906000	6907000	Alright.
6907000	6908000	I'm hungry.
6908000	6909000	Food, food, food, food.
6909000	6914000	There's another Brazilian place down in, uh, Fair Oaks or Citrus Heights, actually.
6914000	6915000	It's, like, off Madison.
6915000	6916000	Yeah.
6916000	6917000	No, it's not there anymore.
6917000	6918000	Touch of Brazil.
6918000	6919000	Oh, really?
6919000	6920000	No, not there anymore.
6920000	6922000	Now they've reopened so many times, though.
6922000	6924000	Alright, let's move on.
6924000	6925000	We gotta get back into games.
6925000	6929000	I could talk food all night, but we gotta work up an appetite by talking about games.
6929000	6930000	3 hour show, Rob.
6930000	6931000	Rapid fire, I know.
6931000	6934000	We've got, like, 45 minutes left because we've got a late start tonight.
6934000	6935000	Alright, Loki, go ahead.
6935000	6940000	Alright, so there's a new mod for Bully that kind of changes the game entirely.
6940000	6949000	Remember, Bully may have been the Rockstar Games kind of, you know, watered down version of, like, almost like a Sandbox Grand Theft Auto type game.
6949000	6957000	Well, now it's Bully Zombie Edition where you can add guns to the game that didn't have guns to begin with and zombies into it.
6957000	6959000	Because, you know, every game's better with zombies.
6959000	6961000	So, um, you can actually check it out.
6961000	6964000	They have a ModDB page.
6964000	6970000	If you go to moddb.com slash mods slash bully dash zombie dash edition.
6970000	6973000	And you can find the information on that as well.
6974000	6983000	Kind of tucked away in the announcement that we were talking about a little bit earlier for the 3DS numbers and what they sold in 2013.
6983000	6995000	There's actually an announcement that they're localizing Disney's Magic World, which is a game that came out in Japan called Disney Magic Castle by Magical Life.
6995000	6997000	And it's by Namco Bandai.
6998000	7003000	And what it basically is is kind of like Animal Crossing crossed with the Disney characters.
7003000	7007000	There's, like, farming in the game and you can customize all sorts of things.
7007000	7013000	But, uh, I'm sure Rob and Jamie will probably be all over it because it's Disney and Animal Crossing kind of mixed together.
7013000	7017000	Hey! Hey! That assessment is completely accurate.
7017000	7023000	It's supposed to be coming out March 11th on the eShop and in retail.
7024000	7028000	And then, last but not least, also another 3DS story.
7028000	7033000	Apparently some hackers have found a way to get past the region locking on 3DS systems.
7033000	7041000	Although this exploit is only available in firmwares 4.1 to 4.5, which are about 9 months old at this time.
7041000	7050000	So, if you do have that and have, like, a cartridge loader that you can load different things in there, you can actually bypass the firmware.
7050000	7060000	And if I remember correctly, and now I'm not entirely positive because I read up on this a couple times, I think if you update your firmware it still stays unlocked.
7060000	7064000	I'm reading conflicting things about it, though.
7064000	7068000	But, um, it's interesting, though, that you can be able to do that.
7068000	7074000	And this doesn't in, you know, any way enable piracy. It just enables you to play games from other regions.
7076000	7078000	So, that was pretty cool.
7078000	7082000	I figured it was only a matter of time before somebody would hack that to get what they wanted, you know?
7082000	7087000	Going back a few topics, one may say they made a mod with zombies in it.
7089000	7092000	Alright, traveling around for some other news.
7092000	7097000	Starting off with Super Smash Brothers, the next game in that series, which we still don't know the exact name.
7097000	7100000	But we do get little details on that each and every day.
7100000	7107000	And director Mashihiro Sakurai has confirmed that trophies will be returning for the Wii U and 3DS game.
7107000	7112000	But here's the little twist, because of course this next game is on both the Wii U and the 3DS.
7112000	7115000	The trophies will be version exclusive.
7115000	7120000	And handheld games and characters will be mostly seen on the 3DS version.
7120000	7124000	And the Wii U will see more console and Wii-related versions.
7124000	7126000	So that's kind of a neat little twist on it.
7126000	7132000	And a way to get people to buy both, which I'm sure they're looking for as many reasons as they can for that.
7132000	7136000	Or because they can't figure out a way to make them actually interact with each other. It's more like it.
7136000	7138000	Could be, could be.
7138000	7144000	We'll see. I think this is going to be the big, big thing that Nintendo's got a show at E3 this year, so we'll see.
7144000	7158000	Majesco has announced that they will be bringing WayForward's Double Dragon Neon and Slender the Arrival by Blue Isle Studios to new platforms under the Midnight City Indie label.
7159000	7164000	Double Dragon Neon will be hitting Steam with a new online co-op mode.
7164000	7168000	I guess this was not on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, which surprises me.
7168000	7173000	I thought it did have those, but maybe it was only local, like a Wii U game or something.
7173000	7180000	Slender the Arrival will have post-game flashback levels, and it will be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
7180000	7182000	Oh, that's really exciting. I hope that comes out soon.
7182000	7188000	Midnight City will also be putting out a game called Krautscape, which is a tactical racing game.
7188000	7196000	So, pretty cool there. When you hear about all these labels going under, it's nice to hear new ones sprout up, especially with, you know, Slender the Arrival's a really fun little game.
7196000	7200000	It's, you know, indie and lots of fun livestreams with that, so.
7200000	7205000	Also, lastly, here in Rapid Fire News for me, love this.
7205000	7211000	Super 3D Noah's Ark is being reprinted for the Super Nintendo.
7212000	7222000	It was a Wolfenstein remake, reimagining type of thing that was done with, like, you know, Noah, as in, like, the biblical Noah.
7222000	7228000	Where, yes, it was a first-person shooter, but you pelt animals with fruit to put them to sleep.
7228000	7232000	Apparently, the game was actually based off the Wolfenstein 3D source code. That's pretty amazing.
7233000	7243000	It's, looking at the screenshot, it's a funny way, because bodies persisted back then, it's a funny way to rewrite what's really going on in that.
7243000	7259000	So, anyway, originally this game had to go through a crazy little pass-through system to get against Nintendo's lockout, but now it's going to be on a real cart for only $69.99, if you want to own Super 3D Noah's Ark, which, let's be real, it really wasn't a good game anyway.
7259000	7269000	But, you know, it gets a lot of lulz. There's also stuff that you can buy on the PC if you're curious in Wisdom Tree and the types of biblical-based video games that they do.
7269000	7279000	Spiritual Warfare is one of the games that you can buy there. It's a Christian-based Zelda game, I guess. I don't know. I got nothing.
7279000	7285000	Oh my god. That is a blatant ROM hack right there.
7285000	7288000	That's the stuff I want to see on Twitch. Alright, Jason.
7288000	7303000	Jpop lovers, idol lovers, rejoice. There is a new game featuring AKB48 coming out, at least in Japan, probably unlikely in America, who knows who AKB48 are.
7304000	7312000	It's going to be a shooting game, and AKB48 are going to be zombies. Or at least that's the understanding of it so far.
7312000	7318000	Based off of other shooting games and arcades right now, and it's the style of shooter where you have...
7318000	7323000	It's a sit-in shooter where you're enclosed with curtains and all that kind of stuff.
7323000	7329000	I'm sure there's a lot of crossovers like this in Japan. I really wish there were more things like this in America.
7329000	7339000	Because being able to take a pop culture icon, for good or for bad, to be able to be put into this situation seems hilariously good.
7339000	7355000	Mega Touch is throwing in the towel. If you've ever been at an arcade that has a bar in it, or any other kind of a place where games are just kind of relegated to countertops and whatnot,
7355000	7362000	you've probably seen in Mega Touch, those tiny little touch screens. Well, they're actually like 15 to 20 inches usually.
7362000	7368000	Touch screens that have the little games like you would see on Facebook nowadays.
7368000	7380000	Photo Hunt, where you have two pictures and you spot the differences. Various number solitaire, not like window solitaire, but the classic pyramid solitaire kind of games.
7380000	7385000	Mega Touch was just a quick action series of arcade games.
7385000	7388000	It was a bunch of shitty little games, but you just, you know, you're at the bar...
7388000	7389000	I haven't had a lot of fun with them.
7389000	7393000	You're at the bar, you're drunk, you want to put a quarter in the machine and smack the penguin.
7393000	7399000	One of the games where you try to get him as far as possible with detrimental, not an obstacle course.
7399000	7402000	My favorite Mega Touch game was, can you tell the difference between the two pictures?
7402000	7403000	Photo Hunt.
7403000	7404000	That's it, Photo Hunt.
7405000	7412000	But Mega Touch is done. They're calling in the towel, despite the fact that their TVs and their technology have gotten better and better as the years go on.
7412000	7419000	And their screens and their systems really have looked better and better as I've seen them every once in a while over the past couple of years.
7419000	7429000	But they're done, they're throwing in the towel, the system's touch-based do start to have problems with gunk and various other bad things like that.
7429000	7434000	And they're kind of pricey, $3,000 for just a little set-top box.
7434000	7444000	If that could come down a little bit, it would be a pretty interesting thing to see in homes or non-fully public kind of places.
7444000	7448000	Because there's a lot of fun to just sit down and kind of start poking with that kind of thing.
7448000	7454000	I want to say that I've even heard some of them have internet connectivity and long-range leaderboards and that kind of stuff.
7454000	7457000	They had a profile system and everything, I was always very adamant to use it.
7457000	7461000	But alas, for them as it stands, no more.
7461000	7465000	Now bring out Photo Hunt on the PlayStation 4.
7465000	7470000	I already have Photo Hunt on my iPhone and iPad and that's good enough for me.
7470000	7472000	I'm pretty sure it's in MAME and stuff already too.
7472000	7473000	Yeah, I guess I could get it on an iPad.
7473000	7476000	Yeah, there's actually a lot of really fun versions of it.
7477000	7487000	Metal Gear Re-Vengeance. As most games of this generation are, the quality settings let you go up to 1080p, 1920x1080.
7487000	7489000	But there is a coder.
7489000	7492000	Did you hear that too?
7492000	7494000	Is everything okay, Loki?
7494000	7497000	The cat knocked over water.
7497000	7499000	Well, at least there's only water.
7499000	7501000	She's kind of a jerk.
7501000	7503000	This is like the third time she's done it today.
7503000	7504000	Cats usually are.
7504000	7507000	That picture we were looking at in the break is suddenly a lot more relevant.
7507000	7512000	My wife wants to announce that the cat is free for any takers.
7514000	7516000	I'm not joking, don't laugh.
7516000	7518000	OLR Adoption. What did she say?
7518000	7521000	She says, I'm not joking, don't laugh.
7523000	7525000	We're laughing with you, not at you.
7525000	7528000	Very important. Go ahead.
7528000	7533000	Most games of this generation have a max of 1080p and that is still considered the high end.
7533000	7539000	4K displays are coming out, but that's bleeding edge if you actually have them for at least a little bit longer.
7539000	7552000	But there is a coder by the name of Durante that has been fixing the available resolution of visually high quality games like Dark Souls, Deadly Premonition, and now Metal Gear Rising Re-Vengeance
7552000	7561000	that works around the 1080p resolution cap and actually allows you to start experiencing these games in 4K.
7561000	7568000	I assume this is all in upres because I don't think any company would include 4K assets in a game and literally never let you use them
7568000	7571000	because that would balloon the size of the game in a heartbeat.
7571000	7579000	But it is still pretty damn nice as these games are looking better and better and these impressive displays are coming out in huge swaths.
7580000	7589000	The one for Revengance is not necessarily going to be released because apparently there's some rumors going around that Konami may be doing this themselves.
7589000	7599000	Well, not as of the conclusion of CES, we know that much now, but in the next couple of months in the lead up to E3 and that kind of stuff as 4K displays start to become more prominent.
7599000	7606000	Whether it's released officially or released unofficially, that will be seen in the not too distant future ultimately.
7606000	7614000	Alrighty. Let's take this opportunity to visit our Facebook and Google pages in a segment we call the FUGL Question of the Week.
7620000	7629000	Every week we ask a question of our communities over at Facebook and Google Plus and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.
7629000	7638000	Let's get to it. This week's question is about that article we talked about in part A with the top 10 grossing arcade games of all time.
7638000	7644000	So we decided to simply ask, what game in the arcade do you think you've dropped the most quarters or tokens into over the years and why?
7644000	7652000	And here's the thing, when I originally posted that question, about five minutes later I was like, oh god, everybody's going to say DDR.
7652000	7655000	DDR, DDR, DDR, DDR, pop it, DDR.
7655000	7659000	That isn't the case. That's not the case at all. So I'm very happy with the way this turned out.
7659000	7667000	Let's go to our first answer. Funny enough, it's from Shane over on Facebook saying, with no question I'd say the game I dropped the most quarters or tokens in would be DDR.
7667000	7672000	However, I think the more interesting answer would be my number two game, which would be Time Crisis.
7672000	7680000	I spent all my time playing and beating those games in the arcade. They were one series I felt never translated well to the home consoles, so I had to play them in the arcade.
7680000	7683000	That's a really good answer and I also think I've never beaten a Time Crisis.
7683000	7695000	Elliot B says, being a youngin, I haven't been around many arcade cabinets, plus I think they may have dried up in the UK faster than the US, but as a kid I would never pass up the opportunity to play any version of Metal Slug.
7696000	7703000	Clover Nikon responds and says TMNT Arcade. Oh god, so many quarters on that.
7703000	7714000	Joe G responds, or sorry, it's Haseo Sumerugawa, put that at the beginning if you want me to read that first, says Street Fighter versus X-Men or probably various pinball tables.
7714000	7726000	Fifth Dream says, I spent a lot of times in arcades in the 80s and 90s, so Centipede, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Final Fight, Double Dragon, but the toss up would be between Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Street Fighter II.
7726000	7738000	Delvin B, our buddy from video game Realness, love that show, responded and said, very surprised that Mortal Kombat was not in the top 10.
7739000	7744000	You know, I was surprised by that too, because I always thought it gave Street Fighter II a pretty good competition, but I guess not.
7744000	7752000	But there were a ton of fighting game clones around that same time because of Street Fighter's success, just like there were a ton of Pac-Man clones at the time too.
7752000	7754000	Do you remember Primal Rage?
7754000	7758000	I do remember Primal Rage, absolutely. I remember when that came out for the Atari Jaguar.
7758000	7764000	I think they were a bit worse on consoles, I'm thinking like Clay Fighter and that kind of stuff. The ones that actually made it into the arcade were good.
7764000	7766000	There's Fighting Street and that whole lawsuit.
7766000	7768000	Alright, anyway.
7768000	7778000	Delvin responds and says, number one, Killer Instinct. My best friend and I would go to arcades and beat anyone that was already playing and then take over, which led to people lying to us and trying to beat us.
7778000	7788000	Ultra combo, and number two says, would be the original X-Men arcade game with six players. So much fun playing through with six friends when we were kids.
7788000	7794000	Eddie K replies and says, Street Fighter II Championship Edition or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
7794000	7802000	Degenerate Johnny says, I have to admit I was more of a console gamer than an arcade gamer, but I put the most quarters in Mortal Kombat 2.
7802000	7810000	But if you asked me what game I put the most money into play, I would say Michael Jackson's Scramble Training. It was a rare Starfighter game that was available in Sega World.
7810000	7816000	Each game session cost 10 pounds, which was equivalent to $15 at the time, and I went through three game sessions.
7816000	7818000	I've never heard of this before.
7818000	7820000	Me neither, me neither.
7820000	7830000	Giavadea says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Simpsons, and any game that had a gun I could point and shoot with. Didn't matter what the game was about, I could play with a gun and that's all I cared about.
7830000	7834000	Anthony C replies and says, I don't want to know how much I've spent on DDR.
7834000	7843000	Andy R replies and says, Technica, no contest. When Technica 3 came out, I just moved closer to an arcade that had it.
7843000	7850000	Thanks to the crew race and bi-weekly updates, I was putting in at least $10 a week for several months. RIP DJ Maxx series.
7850000	7852000	Because they shut down the platinum crew.
7852000	7854000	Yep, just over the new year, right?
7854000	7859000	DJ Rama S says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, hands down. It was so much fun to play with four peoples.
7859000	7864000	And in my old neighborhood, each machine has a different amount of lives per quarter you put in.
7864000	7869000	Our buddy Rene from Koopa Club also says there's a lot, just to name a few.
7869000	7874000	Gauntlet, Quartet, Dragon's Lair, DDR, Beatmania, and so on and so on.
7874000	7879000	Most of these games were the recipient of my money, surely because they were quick and fun and offered a fair amount of replayability.
7879000	7885000	The largest recipient was the Addams Family pinball game, because I love the Addams Family and I love pinball.
7885000	7888000	Pinball is the foundation of my gaming experience, so there you go.
7888000	7891000	That is one of the best pinball tables. So, so, so good.
7892000	7897000	I think that's supposed to come out for the pinball arcade. It's one of the big, big things we're waiting for.
7897000	7900000	Tiger Claw says Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Turtles in Time.
7900000	7903000	Terminator 2 was a huge quarter muncher as well.
7903000	7909000	Raginator says, I've had a number of arcade games, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Do you see a pattern here?
7909000	7915000	Smash TV, Final Fight, and so on and so on. My list could easily go on for quite some time, but in the interest of time, I shortened it.
7915000	7921000	Burr says, I was never a huge arcade fanatic, but I could never say no to a Bubble Bobble machine.
7921000	7925000	Something about that game just makes me happy to feed it quarters. Probably the music.
7927000	7933000	Codeman says, what did he say? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Oh, he said Turtles in Time specifically, though.
7933000	7938000	There was something about playing it with my friends in the arcade that was wasting all my parents' money. It felt gratifying.
7938000	7944000	Lawrence Z said, I know it's not the same, but Xbox Live Arcade has taken a ton of cash from me.
7944000	7949000	It is not the same, and many would blame that on the reason why arcades have been struggling.
7949000	7955000	But, you know, like somebody else has said before, you know, if you're younger, you may not have that same frame of reference.
7955000	7956000	Or where you are in the world.
7956000	7964000	Xbox Live has been around for ten years now. You know, some of the, you know, if you're sixteen, then Xbox Live has been around since you were six. Something to think about.
7964000	7967000	Critical Myth says, Galaga. Without question.
7968000	7972000	Austin replies, Dance Dance Revolution. Otherwise, Soul Edge.
7972000	7980000	Thomas C says, I never had access to a legit arcade as a kid. One of the games I played the most was Mortal Kombat. Hundreds of dollars spent in that cabinet.
7980000	7988000	Dark Tetsuya says, DDR. I also one night sunk several dollars of quarters into Golden Axe.
7988000	7993000	Veronica Isabel replies and says, Does Ski Ball count? I used to play that all the time when I was a kid.
7993000	7994000	Hell yeah, it does.
7994000	7997000	Yeah, sure. Sure it counts. Why not? Ski Ball is still fun as an adult.
7998000	8007000	Michael H says, I love playing NFL Blitz at Dave and Busters. It was always a quarter muncher back in the day. Even I liked NFL Blitz. And I don't play a lot of the sports games, but that one was fun.
8007000	8009000	You know which one I love though is NBA Jam.
8009000	8010000	Yes.
8010000	8011000	I remember when that came out on Super Nintendo too.
8011000	8014000	The arcade, arcade sports were amazing.
8015000	8024000	And lastly on Facebook, S2100Matt says, DDR. But I did play the heck out of TMNT, Turtles in Time, Stun Runner, and Tapper when I was a kid.
8024000	8031000	Let's look at Google Plus. So TMNT definitely dominated the conversation there. We have a few answers on Google Plus.
8031000	8041000	Robba replies and says, If I take DDR and laserdisc games off my list, Crazy Climber was the quarter muncher for me.
8041000	8048000	The dreaded falling I-beams after completing the first building were that one chaotic element that could end my game quickly. I remember that game. Those were good times.
8049000	8054000	Retertainment says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So Google Plus thinking the same way, right?
8054000	8064000	I was a kid when the turtles were popular, so I wanted to play that game whenever I saw it as a kid. It was the hardest game to play and I'm a stubborn person, so I kept on pumping quarters in the machine until I ate out of money or my mom got done shopping.
8064000	8070000	Act Dev says, DDR and I still play on occasion. There's also a ton of SNK games like Metal Slug and The King of Fighters.
8070000	8075000	Sam H says, Moon Patrol and Sinistar ate a ton of my quarters.
8075000	8078000	Beware, I live.
8078000	8079000	The game was awesome.
8079000	8084000	And lastly, Black Dynamite says, Time Crisis 3. We're ending where we started. Time Crisis 3.
8084000	8090000	If you're playing someone else, it takes a lot of skill and coordination. Totally worth sinking the several dollars and quarters to conquer.
8090000	8094000	You know, those are all great answers and I love doing the reminiscing, which is why I read them all.
8094000	8105000	I have to admit though, shocked that the game I probably would have named next to DDR and music games, if you throw those out for a minute, because obviously the game I would have named, nobody mentioned.
8108000	8111000	Super Iron Man Ivan Stewart's Off-Road.
8111000	8114000	You know what's really scary is I was going to say exactly the same thing.
8114000	8115000	Get out.
8115000	8116000	Dead serious.
8116000	8117000	Absolutely.
8117000	8124000	I have dropped, I was on a cruise in 94, I don't even remember for sure.
8124000	8130000	And there was a $5 bill behind the off-road machine that was chilling there.
8130000	8136000	So I picked it up, I cashed it out and I put every single quarter into off-road.
8136000	8138000	That game was so much fun.
8138000	8142000	You cannot replicate that free rolling wheel, the pedal.
8142000	8146000	That was a big fucking deal when that came out on the NES too.
8146000	8148000	That four player multi-tap.
8148000	8152000	Because finally there was no more fucking grey car that would always beat you.
8152000	8158000	So that was very, you know, funny enough you mentioned one of the places you like to eat when you're here in California, Round Table Pizza.
8158000	8162000	That's where I, because all those pizza parlors have little arcades, right?
8162000	8167000	I spent an unhealthily amount of money on Iron Man Super Off-Road.
8167000	8175000	Last July a bunch of coworkers of mine were out in Denver for a conference and we went out to the 1UP, our local barcade in Denver.
8175000	8179000	And a coworker of mine, I don't remember if he had or hadn't played it at all before.
8179000	8186000	But I taught him the credit tricks to be able to max out your car in Super Off-Road real quick.
8186000	8187000	And he loved it.
8187000	8191000	And you know, there's something about that wheel, the pedal and everything else that just makes that game unique.
8191000	8193000	And nobody else has done it.
8193000	8196000	But to be fair, I also spent a shit ton on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
8196000	8197000	Yeah, same answer.
8197000	8199000	I had to be hipster and not say that.
8199000	8201000	Loki, you have a quick answer before we move on?
8201000	8203000	What did you drop all your quarters in?
8203000	8205000	Besides DDR. No fair saying DDR.
8209000	8214000	Maybe... well I did play a lot of Gunblade back when QZAR had it.
8214000	8216000	Good call.
8216000	8217000	So maybe that.
8217000	8218000	Good call.
8218000	8219000	Alright.
8219000	8223000	Now I'm thinking about some of those arcade games we used to play at Golf Land besides just DDR.
8223000	8228000	Like the grid. I remember when a bunch of us would get on the grid and play that with a shooter.
8228000	8232000	The joysticks are of maybe iffy caliber.
8232000	8237000	But MGL in Arizona has the grid and I was playing a couple rounds of that too.
8237000	8238000	So good.
8238000	8241000	When arcades have the right games, arcades are still alright.
8241000	8242000	Good times.
8242000	8244000	Alright, let's get back into some news.
8244000	8247000	We're going to try to move through this a little bit quickly guys.
8247000	8249000	Yeah, because we're running a little late in the show and I want to be able to take some calls.
8249000	8252000	So let's try to move through this a little bit quickly. Loki.
8252000	8257000	Alright, so EA has now changed their stance on SimCity mods.
8257000	8265000	And they're now gracefully allowing you to mod their files if you ever so feel like doing that.
8265000	8267000	But there's some restrictions.
8267000	8279000	And basically the mods that you can create, that they are allowing you to create, are stuff like skins and skins.
8279000	8286000	So pretty much mods that do not affect multiplayer simulation or jeopardize gameplay.
8286000	8287000	How generous.
8287000	8294000	Yeah, to which I say, if you're modding the game in the first place, why do you need their permission to do that?
8294000	8297000	I don't know, why?
8297000	8300000	You should. Just do what you want.
8300000	8301000	Yep.
8301000	8309000	I wonder when they're going to really discount this game. Is it already down to 20 bucks?
8309000	8312000	I don't think it's dropped in price really.
8312000	8313000	Wow.
8313000	8316000	I mean, I'm sure, I think it's maybe been on sales.
8316000	8319000	Yeah, I think it's been on sales, but I'm just kind of surprised.
8319000	8321000	It's interesting they're still trying to breathe life into this.
8321000	8326000	They really don't want that game to kind of have the black marks on it that its launch kind of gave it.
8326000	8327000	But they never really recovered from that.
8327000	8331000	Diablo 3 to some extent never did either. Well, a little bit.
8331000	8335000	And the new expansion I think is really going to be a reboot for that game.
8335000	8339000	Yeah, it's down to $39.99.
8339000	8343000	Or, I mean, on sale $33.28 I guess right now is what it is on Amazon.
8343000	8346000	Wake me up when it's $10 or $15.
8346000	8349000	Well, yeah, it's just, yeah.
8349000	8352000	Maybe this holiday it'll finally be down that low.
8352000	8357000	You know, a lot of people give shit to Nintendo, including me, and I have in the past,
8357000	8361000	and I think we all have a little bit about their lack of online support.
8361000	8367000	But, you know, the producer of Super Mario 3D World, Yoshiaki Koizumi,
8367000	8371000	recently made a comment about Nintendo and the fact that they have experimented with online
8371000	8375000	because some people are saying, why isn't Super Mario 3D World online?
8375000	8381000	You know, yes, and I left this out of my gaming week just because I was talking too much about ass and titties at the beginning of the show.
8381000	8386000	But actually I had, you guys who remember OLR, like way back in the day,
8386000	8392000	Princess Irene was here with her now husband, Nathan, we're here this Friday.
8392000	8398000	We were just getting together for sushi, and then we came back and played Mario 3D World on Wii U and Nintendo Land.
8398000	8400000	We had a lot of fun, good times.
8400000	8403000	But, you know, you can have good times with some of that stuff online too,
8403000	8406000	and Nintendo's always kind of resisted that in favor of the living room experience.
8406000	8409000	Well, producer of Super Mario 3D World said, quote,
8409000	8414000	we've been testing online multiplayer since the days of Super Mario Galaxy.
8414000	8418000	But with this title, we really wanted to deliver an experience that you can share with family, friends,
8418000	8423000	or your boyfriend or girlfriend in the same place, like you did with the original NES.
8423000	8430000	We really want players to have fun in front of the TV, talking while they help each other out, or get in each other's way.
8430000	8433000	I don't see why they couldn't have both.
8433000	8437000	I'm kind of with you, I'm with you a little bit, Loki,
8437000	8444000	and I'm even okay with the extent that they stick to their guns, that, you know, it's a living room experience.
8444000	8446000	But here's the problem.
8446000	8452000	Nintendo hasn't proven that they're capable of any online excellent experience.
8452000	8458000	What is a made-by-Nintendo game that is a must-play online?
8458000	8462000	Maybe Mario Kart Wii? I don't know.
8462000	8465000	Maybe. That's probably the best they've done, to be honest.
8465000	8467000	Mario Kart 7?
8467000	8470000	So, yeah, I mean, there's not a whole lot.
8470000	8473000	I think they're trying a little more with the Dr. Luigi and so forth,
8473000	8478000	but, you know, I think that's another reason why a lot of people kind of give Nintendo shit when it comes to online.
8478000	8483000	And there was a very interesting story that was on, was it, U.S. Gamer or Eurogamer?
8483000	8486000	One of those sites where one of those people that was like,
8486000	8490000	I worked for a third-party developer when the Wii U was introduced or whatever,
8490000	8494000	kind of throwing some shade at Nintendo and talking about how it was.
8494000	8498000	And apparently, when somebody had asked Nintendo about Xbox Live or PlayStation Network,
8498000	8503000	their comment was, well, we don't know what those systems are. We don't use them.
8503000	8507000	And it's like, know your fucking competition, you guys.
8507000	8511000	Like, you have to. Come on.
8511000	8515000	And the perfect experience I can think of is Final Fantasy XIV.
8515000	8518000	The first version was so awful, but when the guy came in that said, you know what?
8518000	8522000	Yeah, I've played World of Warcraft. I've played EverQuest. I've played all that stuff.
8522000	8526000	And this is what the people really want. That game came out so much better for it.
8526000	8528000	You have to know your competition a little bit.
8528000	8533000	Look at, that's Microsoft's business, is taking the competition and making it better.
8533000	8534000	We're trying.
8534000	8535000	Trying.
8535000	8540000	Most of the time, to be fair, most of the times they're pretty successful with it.
8540000	8548000	Anyhow, over at live.vognetwork.com, still some people mostly reminiscing on the games
8548000	8551000	we were talking about earlier with the arcade games, but we do have some comments on this.
8551000	8556000	Tigerclaw says there are a couple of Nintendo games that have online multiplayer on Wii.
8556000	8562000	Just a couple, though. Tigerclaw says Excitebike World Rally had online multiplayer,
8562000	8566000	but Excitebike World Rally was no Halo.
8566000	8569000	Or excuse me, Halo 2, to be fair.
8569000	8570000	Well, that's the bar.
8570000	8573000	You know what I mean? Well, yes, it is the bar.
8573000	8578000	No, I'm agreeing with you. That's quite a leap, because I'm trying to think.
8578000	8582000	I don't think I have ever put the Wii to use for multiplayer.
8582000	8586000	I don't have a Wii U yet.
8586000	8592000	Man, I missed out on Mario Kart, but I know a lot of friends that were doing that routinely,
8592000	8595000	and that's probably one of the only answers that I can really come up with.
8595000	8600000	Not the least, the frickin' friend code system.
8600000	8610000	I agree with this much that Nintendo does not have the same caliber of online components in gaming.
8610000	8613000	All right, well, you never know.
8613000	8616000	That could be the thing that Nintendo's gonna come out at E3 and say,
8616000	8620000	we're rebooting the Nintendo Network, and this is how it's gonna blow your mind.
8620000	8623000	Yeah, don't make bets on it.
8623000	8624000	Don't hold your breath.
8624000	8625000	Yeah, exactly.
8625000	8627000	Jason, what do you have for us?
8627000	8634000	A little bit of news on the Steam Controller, and that Valve wants the controller to be more capable
8634000	8638000	than just a gamepad with its mental math.
8638000	8643000	12 buttons and however many sticks slash D-pads.
8643000	8648000	And they're interested in being able to make a controller with the flexibility
8648000	8653000	like the Steam Machine Controller that has touchpads and not D-pads
8653000	8656000	that are multipurpose with movement and action buttons and everything else.
8656000	8662000	And they're very interested in finding a way to be able to take a complex game like Dota 2
8662000	8667000	and be able to have it controlled with just purely the Steam Controller.
8667000	8672000	That's pretty difficult to do because you have to use damn near half of the keyboard
8672000	8678000	and then the mouse independently, and there's just purely not enough buttons.
8678000	8682000	But if some can be relegated to gestures, combinations, or other sorts of things
8682000	8685000	that would make sense with this controller design,
8685000	8688000	they're interested in finding out exactly what that is.
8688000	8693000	Yeah, the trailer that we got was just classic mouse compatibility mode
8693000	8699000	for Papers, Please and Civ 5, and then a little bit of keyboard.
8699000	8702000	It technically wasn't even really keyboard integration for Portal
8702000	8704000	because you'd need a left button and a right button.
8704000	8706000	Whoo, that's hard.
8706000	8711000	So it's an obvious answer that the controller will be heavily mouse
8711000	8714000	and also traditional controller-centric,
8714000	8718000	but they are looking for ways of scaling it and being able to have it take on
8718000	8723000	larger tasks for more complex input games.
8725000	8728000	I'm curious to get my hands on one of those, but it's going to be very interesting.
8728000	8731000	I want to see how a game like Civ 5 or something really transfers over to that
8731000	8734000	that's really, really, really with the keyboard and mouse.
8734000	8738000	Or even Dota is still a game that I can't imagine not playing that with keyboard and mouse.
8738000	8739000	That would be a hindrance.
8739000	8742000	But they seem convinced they can make it work, and maybe they can.
8742000	8744000	They sure as hell are going to try it.
8744000	8748000	I don't mind first-person shooters on controllers, so it works okay enough for me.
8748000	8752000	I know some people really hate it, but it's all right. I don't mind it.
8754000	8755000	All right, Loki.
8755000	8763000	All right, so actually as I saw this article here, it reminded me to go ahead and do that online.
8763000	8769000	The Steam family options have come out of beta, so now you can actually share your library
8769000	8777000	with up to ten people, and you can actually go enable that under settings and stuff,
8777000	8779000	and go check that out.
8779000	8784000	So that allows you, of course, if you're not familiar with it, to basically have somebody
8784000	8790000	play any game that you own on your account, and they can actually download the full game
8790000	8795000	and try it, as long as you're not playing anything else in your account at the time.
8795000	8798000	So that's pretty cool.
8801000	8805000	You kind of seem to have landed with little fanfare.
8805000	8810000	I had no idea that this had gone live until somebody had posted it for tonight's show.
8810000	8812000	I would have thought that Steam might have done a big announcement, but I guess not.
8812000	8815000	It made a splash when it was a beta, and now it's here, hooray.
8815000	8820000	But it's also, as Bobby covered before, it also has kind of limited domain,
8820000	8823000	where if you're multiple people under the same household,
8823000	8826000	have it better than the people that wanted to exploit it for free games.
8826000	8828000	Yeah, but what were people really expecting?
8828000	8831000	And that's why the fanfare isn't any bigger than it is.
8831000	8834000	I guess so. All right, moving on.
8834000	8838000	And the last story before the mailbag.
8839000	8843000	Konami is looking to jump into the 3D dome screen game
8843000	8848000	with a game they're calling Steel Chronicle Ganesh.
8848000	8858000	Basically, they're trying to bring back the huge sit-down cabin...
8858000	8861000	I completely forgot the word that I was going to look for.
8861000	8864000	The huge pods that you sit down, much like Battletech,
8864000	8869000	if you ever played that at a nice big warehouse, arcade, bar, everything entertaining place.
8869000	8871000	DragonCon.
8871000	8873000	I've never been to a con that has this kind of stuff.
8873000	8875000	They have a DragonCon room, but never that specific.
8875000	8878000	Bobby made it a point to walk me down there to say,
8878000	8880000	look at this, look at what they bring in for this.
8880000	8884000	Good man. Because those things are so much fun.
8884000	8888000	So, of course, these games come at a premium price tag.
8888000	8891000	The article quotes $40,000.
8891000	8895000	Because not only is it a sit-down pod with multiple displays,
8895000	8900000	tailored controls for a flight sim,
8900000	8902000	or maybe it is a mech battle game.
8902000	8904000	Hard to tell. The screenshot is pretty small.
8904000	8909000	But it's also a, instead of just a 30-inch CRT,
8909000	8912000	excuse me, that the classic Battletech machines use,
8912000	8918000	these are modern, curved, 3D tall displays,
8918000	8920000	so you have greater field of view.
8920000	8923000	It looks amazing. I would love to play a game like this.
8923000	8927000	When you get the right control mechanism to be able to put management
8927000	8930000	into this game alongside just the rest of the action,
8930000	8932000	these games come out so well.
8932000	8936000	Find your cash money arcade and suggest it to them.
8936000	8938000	It's really funny that in last week's show,
8938000	8941000	we were kind of mourning the loss of the pompous arcade game
8941000	8944000	with all its big peripheral, a story like this comes out where it's like,
8944000	8945000	we're not dead yet.
8945000	8949000	I don't think anybody said that it's gone or that they wouldn't play it again.
8949000	8950000	It's just less often.
8950000	8953000	Well, I kind of said they were dying, but I didn't want them to go.
8953000	8955000	Plus, we're on the heels of CES,
8955000	8957000	where this kind of stuff would have been shown off,
8957000	8959000	which is where most of these articles are coming from.
8959000	8963000	There's a big arcade coin-op show that happens later in a couple months,
8963000	8965000	isn't there? There's like a Vegas coin-op show, too.
8965000	8968000	A coin-op expo sounds somewhat familiar, maybe.
8968000	8970000	Something along those lines.
8970000	8972000	Looking forward to Konami. Make it happen.
8972000	8974000	Make it happen. All right.
8974000	8977000	And Konami has made a bunch of pompous arcade games with big peripherals.
8977000	8979000	As we are well aware.
8979000	8981000	As we are well aware. All right.
8981000	8984000	When are we going to see the Silent Hill arcade game come anywhere near us?
8984000	8985000	The Castlevania one.
8985000	8987000	I want to shoot Pyramid Head in the face.
8987000	8990000	It'll be fun. I don't know. I guess never.
8990000	8992000	All right. Let's get to the mailbag.
8992000	8994000	Every week you guys send us emails.
8994000	8998000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go.
8998000	9000000	And every week you send emails,
9000000	9003000	and Dark Sakura dives in the email bag head first
9003000	9005000	and puts on her hazmat suit and tries to find an email
9005000	9008000	that looks safe for the air or two or five to read.
9008000	9010000	Dark Sakura is not here this week,
9010000	9013000	so we've decided to make Jason jump in the mailbag head first
9013000	9015000	and swim in there.
9015000	9018000	Oh, it's tough to wade through all of this.
9018000	9022000	Yeah, all those mountains and mountains of email we received last week, right?
9022000	9026000	All the spam that's junking up the bag.
9026000	9029000	All the delivery sports.
9029000	9030000	All right.
9030000	9034000	Nasty Canasta writes in to back up Mr. Sky
9034000	9036000	and says, hi, Olar.
9036000	9038000	I'm here to back up Sky.
9038000	9040000	Maybe, sort of, probably.
9040000	9043000	On the last episode, Sky got a Twitter sass from Cuoco Jones
9043000	9046000	along the lines of, you bought a PS4 to play Don't Starve?
9046000	9049000	To which I say, girl.
9049000	9052000	But seriously, what's wrong with buying a console or a computer
9052000	9055000	to play something that one considers to give them lots of...
9055000	9057000	that can...
9057000	9059000	Sorry.
9059000	9061000	I think a word or two is missing.
9061000	9064000	Just short-circuited my brain.
9064000	9067000	What's wrong with buying a console or a computer to play something
9067000	9070000	that one considers will give them lots of replayability
9070000	9073000	and a unique experience for such a small cost?
9073000	9077000	$400 plus a small cost, but I digress.
9077000	9081000	While Don't Starve is not a Call of Duty or an Assassin's Creed,
9081000	9084000	Don't Starve could entertain you way longer than either of those.
9084000	9087000	I will tell you all right now that if I were to own a PS4
9087000	9089000	in the very near future,
9089000	9092000	the one game I'd plunk my nerdy fanny down to play the most
9092000	9095000	is Binding of Isaac Rebirth, which happens to look like an SNES game.
9095000	9098000	I've played the current version of Isaac for over 800 hours.
9098000	9101000	And also isn't out, to be fair.
9101000	9103000	I'd al...
9103000	9106000	Uh... lost my place.
9106000	9109000	I've played the current version of Isaac on the PC, of course.
9109000	9111000	That's the only place it's at right now.
9111000	9113000	I've played the current version of Isaac for over 800 hours
9113000	9117000	and look forward to Rebirth over Diablo 3,
9117000	9120000	Infamous Second Son, and many other high-profile titles coming soon.
9120000	9124000	I guess what I'm saying is, don't shoo away these seemingly smaller games
9124000	9126000	with lower budgets mainstream or indie.
9126000	9129000	You can get a lot out of them depending on how well they're made.
9129000	9132000	And a quick question for Loki.
9132000	9135000	Will there be any Left 4 Dead 2 PC vog...
9135000	9138000	Will... wow, man, I'm doing a really good job at reading this.
9138000	9141000	It's not an easy job she does, is it?
9141000	9144000	Especially... plus the rush and also looking at the clock
9144000	9146000	and I need to stop looking at the clock.
9146000	9147000	Quick question for Loki.
9147000	9150000	Will there be a Left 4 Dead 2 PC vog game night soon?
9150000	9152000	Since that was given away for free over the holidays,
9152000	9154000	lots of folks should have it,
9154000	9158000	but getting into the group you want will be a bit of an issue in online campaigns
9158000	9163000	since they only allow four players for normal style
9163000	9166000	and then, of course, versus with zombie control maxes out at eight.
9166000	9168000	Also, get Rob and Jamie to play.
9168000	9170000	Rob! Rob! Zombies, Rob!
9170000	9172000	I did download it, so yeah.
9172000	9174000	I'm horrible at those games, though.
9174000	9176000	I had Left 4 Dead 1 and I was so bad at it.
9176000	9178000	You just gotta have fun with it.
9178000	9181000	Probably not. That's what my guess would be, probably not.
9181000	9183000	We can set something up.
9185000	9188000	Talk in the vog group on Steam, we'll see what we can set up.
9188000	9189000	I like the idea.
9189000	9191000	Pitch it on the forums, let's make it happen.
9191000	9194000	I'd rather play with cool people that email the show than strangers.
9194000	9195000	Yeah.
9195000	9198000	By the way, just responding to the part earlier there,
9198000	9201000	I think when Flaco was sending me that Twitter,
9201000	9203000	he really was just trying to be sassy
9203000	9206000	and I think it just came from a place of sarcastic Twitter tongue in cheek.
9206000	9208000	I don't think he was totally serious with it.
9208000	9210000	It was also coming from a place of girl.
9210000	9212000	Yeah, I think it was a little bit.
9212000	9216000	Just to say, I don't think it was as pointed as you might have thought it was
9216000	9219000	or I may have made it seem last week.
9219000	9222000	But I think we all know now, thanks to earlier in the show,
9222000	9225000	that I bought my PlayStation 4 clearly for what?
9225000	9227000	Ass and titties.
9230000	9232000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
9232000	9234000	It's the time of the show where we get angsty.
9234000	9236000	And why do we get angsty?
9238000	9240000	Because we're people and people are mean.
9256000	9258000	Well, since Dark Sakura isn't here, I'll let Jason start.
9258000	9260000	Jason, do you have any FUs of the week?
9260000	9264000	I want to say I have one on the drive up here and I don't remember it.
9264000	9266000	It's been a pretty good week.
9266000	9267000	FU to forgetfulness.
9267000	9272000	FU to forgetfulness, FU to routine in some ways at the same time too.
9272000	9273000	Eh.
9273000	9276000	My FU goes after this cough that I've been slowly developing throughout the weekend.
9276000	9278000	I better not be getting sick.
9278000	9279000	I better not be getting sick.
9279000	9281000	This is the second time you've said that in like four weeks.
9281000	9283000	I know, maybe I'm just always sick.
9283000	9285000	It's funny because my throat is feeling kind of weird too.
9285000	9287000	We're still going to curse Al and he's leaving his germs behind.
9287000	9293000	FU to the fact that you do those YouTubes so you remember what I say on this show way better than even I do.
9293000	9295000	Loki, what about you?
9295000	9299000	FU to the cap because she's an asshole.
9299000	9305000	And FU to the new chunks they're generating on our Minecraft map because they kind of suck.
9305000	9307000	They do kind of suck, I'm sorry to say.
9307000	9310000	It's like all I got was ocean the other day.
9310000	9315000	Well, that's the thing is they tweaked the whole generation so that it's supposed to make less ocean.
9315000	9317000	And that's all we're getting is ocean.
9317000	9318000	Lame.
9318000	9322000	Alright, DarkSakura has passed along her FU.
9322000	9324000	It is two sinus infections.
9324000	9326000	Seems obvious enough.
9326000	9329000	Let's keep it up for being here tonight so fair enough.
9329000	9331000	Alright, let's go on.
9331000	9333000	Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then guess what?
9333000	9334000	Guess what?
9334000	9336000	It's Skype line time at 1877 Game OLR.
9336000	9339000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9339000	9341000	But first, Loki.
9341000	9353000	Well, this is kind of shocking but I guess people that do follow the MLB 2K games have kind of seen this coming.
9353000	9360000	They have, or 2K Sports has decided to go ahead and discontinue the MLB 2K franchise.
9360000	9367000	Just I guess the last game didn't do very well and actually the last few games haven't done very well.
9367000	9370000	So, it is done.
9370000	9376000	So, if you want to play baseball, you've got to get a Sony console.
9376000	9380000	So, wait, it's only on that particular console?
9380000	9386000	Well, no. MLB 2K was the only baseball game that was on the Xbox 360.
9386000	9389000	Because Sony's game is only on the Sony platforms.
9389000	9393000	So, those were literally the only two baseball games to come out each year.
9393000	9395000	I didn't realize they were the only two that were coming out.
9395000	9396000	I guess so.
9396000	9398000	In my mind, I was thinking of others.
9398000	9405000	But, you know, my mind goes back to a much more classic gaming time when you had things like Baseball Stars and all this other crazy stuff that was coming out too.
9405000	9407000	So, wow, that's too bad.
9407000	9408000	Yeah.
9408000	9413000	What about like, don't they have like, isn't there like foreign baseball leagues that get video games too?
9413000	9417000	Well, they used to have, was it the Power Pros baseball game that was from Konami?
9417000	9425000	But, you know, Konami cut out pretty much all of their, you know, non-Super AAA franchises.
9425000	9427000	So, their lineup is really slim.
9427000	9430000	But, yeah, we don't see any more of that stuff anymore.
9430000	9434000	And, you know, the thought is maybe EA will pick it up.
9434000	9437000	I don't know, they could use another franchise to be honest.
9437000	9439000	But, it's hard to say.
9439000	9440000	Alright.
9440000	9446000	Well, who says that big news in video gaming doesn't come out of CES?
9446000	9453000	Because at Consumer Electronics Show this past week, some big news on a big game was dropped this week.
9453000	9454000	About a big guy.
9454000	9455000	About a big guy.
9455000	9464000	Mama Shaq, Shaquille O'Neal, actually came out and said Shaq, Shaq-Fu 2 is happening.
9464000	9468000	It's coming soon and the graphics look crazy.
9468000	9473000	That is the, and actually, I guess some of the estimate is a joke if there be a sequel to Shaq-Fu.
9473000	9475000	And Shaq said, yes, it is coming and the graphics look crazy.
9475000	9478000	Now, don't forget, there were trademarks filed in mid-2013.
9478000	9485000	This is not the first time we have fantasized about a new Shaq-Fu because there was a trademark for Shaq Fighter.
9485000	9492000	So, those of you that were hoping for Shaq-Fu 2, Electric Boogaloo, you might get your wish.
9492000	9493000	Awesome.
9493000	9496000	The gaming world needed Shaq-Fu 2, I think.
9496000	9500000	I don't think they realized how badly they needed it.
9500000	9504000	Alright, that pretty much does it for the news.
9504000	9507000	But we're going to go to the Skype line.
9507000	9511000	Going to, well, first I'll go to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
9511000	9516000	Dungeon Buster says, Shaq-Fu 2, the game that no one asked for.
9516000	9521000	And Rama in our chat room says, no, no, no, fuck no.
9521000	9524000	And SSJ100Matt says, why do I feel he's trolling?
9524000	9529000	I don't know, but we're going to go to the phones right now over at 1877 Game OLR.
9529000	9532000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9532000	9534000	Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9534000	9536000	You have some explaining to do.
9537000	9539000	Hi, Shane, how are you?
9539000	9540000	Fine.
9540000	9541000	Fine.
9541000	9542000	What's up?
9542000	9543000	You're explaining.
9543000	9548000	Go quell the thought that, you know, some drama unfolded.
9548000	9552000	Okay, so I knew the minute that I said that.
9552000	9553000	Okay, so here's the thing.
9553000	9554000	Shane is mad at me.
9554000	9556000	Are you mad at me, Shane?
9556000	9557000	So mad.
9557000	9561000	Shane is mad at me because when I was talking about Hoard House,
9561000	9564000	I said something like all the things that happened at Hoard House.
9564000	9567000	And the minute those words left my mouth, I was like, God,
9567000	9569000	that made it sound a lot worse than it really is.
9569000	9572000	And so here you are to clear the air.
9572000	9573000	Yes, nothing bad happened.
9573000	9575000	I left because I left.
9575000	9576000	Nothing bad happened.
9576000	9577000	The end.
9577000	9578000	Nothing bad happened.
9578000	9579000	I agree.
9579000	9580000	No, and I'm agreeing with you.
9580000	9581000	Nothing bad happened.
9581000	9582000	It's just, you know.
9582000	9583000	Hi, Jason.
9583000	9584000	I can see Jason.
9584000	9585000	I know.
9585000	9586000	We have the whole webcam thing on Skype now.
9586000	9588000	So, but yeah, no, nothing.
9588000	9592000	I mean, you just weren't into it anymore, and that happens, right?
9592000	9593000	Yep, that does happen.
9593000	9594000	And it did happen.
9594000	9596000	You shouldn't do things that aren't fun.
9596000	9597000	Exactly.
9597000	9599000	That's my entire life.
9599000	9601000	That's why I don't always go to work.
9601000	9606000	Well, what, okay, for real though, what's on your mind?
9606000	9610000	What have you been up to besides quitting podcasts?
9610000	9613000	Playing Final Fantasy XIV, a whole bunch.
9613000	9615000	But that's not why I called.
9615000	9620000	I wanted to take a moment of silence to honor the memory of DJ Max
9620000	9624000	because it is, with the exception of the mobile game that they put out,
9624000	9628000	that's like Technica, the entire franchise is dead.
9628000	9629000	It's not just Technica that's dead.
9629000	9631000	It's the portable games.
9631000	9633000	It's DJ Max Ray on the iPhone.
9633000	9634000	That's gone now too.
9634000	9635000	Aww.
9635000	9636000	Yes.
9636000	9638000	And that was my favorite music series.
9638000	9639000	Absolute favorite.
9639000	9641000	100 percent.
9641000	9644000	Well, I don't know.
9644000	9647000	How would you send off a game like DJ Max?
9647000	9649000	Lots of drinking and crying.
9649000	9651000	Yeah, lots of drinking and crying.
9651000	9655000	Did you do some drinking and crying on New Year's when they shut it down?
9655000	9661000	I was drinking and not crying, but not for anything to do with DJ Max.
9661000	9663000	Fair enough, fair enough.
9663000	9664000	Yes.
9664000	9667000	All right, anything else on your mind, Shane?
9667000	9669000	No.
9669000	9671000	Oh, you missed Santa Ramen.
9671000	9674000	That's another reason I'm going to come out so I can eat ramen.
9674000	9675000	Because I've never been there.
9675000	9679000	Oh, well, we're going to all go and have really, really good ramen.
9679000	9682000	If I can be off work when you want to go, that'd be great.
9682000	9686000	Every day that I'm there, I should have put in more requests for time off.
9686000	9687000	All right.
9687000	9691000	And my deepest apologies, Shane, if what I said earlier in the show offended you.
9691000	9693000	It was super offensive.
9693000	9696000	It was like something I would see on TMZ or something.
9696000	9697000	Oh, whatever.
9697000	9701000	I don't read TMZ, but if I read TMZ, that's where it would be at.
9701000	9702000	You read Perez Hilton.
9702000	9703000	That's worse.
9703000	9704000	Nope.
9704000	9705000	I don't read that anymore.
9705000	9706000	Because it's super dumb.
9706000	9707000	Good.
9707000	9708000	Because it is super dumb.
9708000	9709000	I read Kotaku.
9709000	9711000	That is super dumb, too.
9711000	9712000	That's even worse.
9712000	9715000	I'd rather you read TMZ and Perez Hilton together than read Kotaku.
9715000	9716000	All right.
9716000	9717000	Ouch.
9717000	9718000	All right.
9718000	9719000	Let's see.
9719000	9722000	SD100MattChat, let me read this comment real quick before I let you in.
9722000	9724000	Yeah, because I can't see chat because I'm playing Final Fantasy.
9724000	9725000	Okay.
9725000	9731000	SD100Matt says, the Technica people I know are very begrudgingly going to re-rave.
9731000	9732000	Not a fan?
9733000	9741000	I don't want to say bad things about re-rave, but it's not a good game, and it sucks.
9741000	9743000	Well, there's always Neon FM.
9743000	9748000	And he criticizes me about being too dramatic and saying shit on this show, and then he
9748000	9749000	goes and says something like that.
9749000	9754000	There's a couple good songs that I've played, and I don't think the note charts are good.
9754000	9757000	I'm sorry, because I know people that work on that game, but I don't think the note charts
9757000	9758000	are good whatsoever.
9758000	9762000	But they have a few good songs on the stupid iPhone game.
9762000	9764000	I'm sure it's in the arcade or whatever.
9764000	9766000	But, no, that game is crap.
9766000	9770000	I do want to play Neon FM, though, because it still has a lot of good music, it looks
9770000	9773000	like, and that's good enough for me to want to play it.
9773000	9778000	I don't care if the game sucks, because it doesn't look that great, but it still has,
9778000	9781000	I think, The Nine and Alien 6 on there, so I'm happy.
9781000	9783000	I don't think it'll really come out either, though.
9783000	9784000	We'll see.
9784000	9786000	All right, Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.
9786000	9787000	That's fine.
9787000	9788000	All right, bye.
9788000	9793000	All right, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us
9793000	9795000	a call, and the phone lines are open again.
9795000	9799000	Let me go to Twitter topics in the meantime, or I don't know, Loki, do you have any last
9799000	9801000	minute news while I pull up the Twitters?
9801000	9805000	Uh, yeah, I think I had something here.
9805000	9812000	Oh, I was going to say, Tony Hawk Underground 2 is getting a massive mod that they're building
9812000	9816000	for the PC version that not only is going to add a ton of new features to it, but it's
9816000	9820000	going to upscale it to 1080p, which I think is kind of cool.
9820000	9823000	The only problem is, where the hell do you get that game now, because they don't sell
9823000	9826000	it on Steam or anything.
9826000	9830000	I guess for those rare people that were able to pick it up, or pirates.
9830000	9833000	I guess, yeah, but it looks pretty cool.
9833000	9836000	All right, let me go to some tweets, and I'll check in with you again, Loki.
9836000	9840000	Again, 1877 Game OLR, whoa, oops.
9840000	9842000	That's what I get for getting to mute Skype.
9842000	9843000	Sorry about that, guys.
9843000	9844000	This is all-
9844000	9845000	Movie magic.
9845000	9848000	All right, this is all still a brand new setup here, so let's go to the phones and see who's
9848000	9849000	there.
9849000	9850000	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
9850000	9852000	It's the one and only DJ Ron Mass.
9852000	9854000	Hi, Rama, how you doing?
9854000	9855000	I'm doing good.
9855000	9857000	Now, since you got your video camera on-
9857000	9858000	We do.
9858000	9860000	I'm going to turn mine on.
9860000	9861000	Oh, my gosh.
9861000	9863000	It's an actual video conversation.
9863000	9866000	I can actually reach out and touch him.
9866000	9872000	All right, but this makes for excellent radio, Rama, excellent radio.
9872000	9874000	What's on your mind, buddy?
9874000	9880000	I want you to know that I upgraded my PlayStation 3 to a 500 gig hard drive.
9880000	9882000	How did you do that?
9882000	9883000	Say what?
9883000	9884000	How did you do that?
9884000	9886000	I went out and bought one.
9886000	9889000	I pulled the old one out of the fat one, put the new one in.
9889000	9893000	I didn't know you could do it that easy, because I need to get a new hard drive in my PlayStation 3,
9893000	9894000	because I'm out of room.
9894000	9896000	Yeah, it's that easy.
9896000	9899000	We'll talk later, and I'll tell you how I did it, because I was able to do it in about an hour.
9899000	9903000	Or I'll just make Loki do it for me, because he just said it's easy, too.
9903000	9906000	I put a 500 in mine, and I had a 20.
9906000	9908000	Nice, nice.
9908000	9913000	So you modded your PlayStation 3, and what all games are you playing on it?
9913000	9915000	I signed up for PlayStation Plus.
9915000	9918000	I'm like, okay, let's see what the big thing is about.
9918000	9920000	I sign in, I look at all the free games.
9920000	9927000	It's like the pearly gates have opened, and I'm looking at all these games.
9927000	9929000	I'm like, Devil May Cry, download.
9929000	9932000	Borderlands 2, download.
9932000	9934000	Something domain game, download.
9934000	9939000	I'm looking at this one game where I think I have it on Xbox Live, but it's free, download.
9939000	9947000	I just have a shit ton of games sitting on my console waiting for me to play at least a little bit of after the show.
9947000	9950000	PlayStation Plus is a great deal.
9950000	9952000	It's really a great deal.
9952000	9957000	I know that some people are not happy about the whole online multiplayer pay-to-go thing that they instituted with PlayStation 4,
9957000	9961000	but it's still a better deal than Xbox Live, in my opinion.
9961000	9963000	Xbox has a way to go to catch up with that.
9963000	9970000	When you say it like that, I'm reminded of that one meme of the Red Wedding from Game of Thrones,
9970000	9975000	where you see three people didn't read the book, didn't read the book, read the book.
9975000	9977000	It's like this. You got the same three people.
9977000	9982000	You got one person played Xbox Live, played Xbox Live, didn't play Xbox Live.
9982000	9987000	So those who are on Xbox Live, it's like, well, we kind of knew this shit, so what the fuck?
9987000	9992000	Bob Coffee in the chat room wants your PSN account.
9992000	9994000	I don't know if you want to give that out over the air,
9994000	9997000	but just know that there are people that would like to play games with you online.
9997000	10003000	Well, it's the same screen name I've always had when I called in here on my podcast and wherever.
10003000	10007000	It's DJ Ronma S. I'll even type it in the chat room later.
10007000	10010000	I'll even throw it up on the forums if need be, too.
10011000	10017000	But I realized that after my trial is up, which I will renew, all the free games are gone,
10017000	10021000	and I'm like, it's not free! These are rentals, dammit!
10021000	10027000	That's right. That's right. You got to keep paying the Sony people or they're going to take them right away.
10027000	10031000	So look out. Good times.
10031000	10034000	All right, Ronma, anything else on your mind tonight?
10034000	10038000	My top three games for 2013. No special order.
10039000	10041000	Number one, Project Cross Zone.
10041000	10047000	This was the only game that stopped me from playing Candy Crush Saga for months.
10048000	10052000	Why? I didn't hear a lot of good things about that game. Why that game?
10052000	10059000	Haters. They're probably mad because it plays like tactics, but the battle is different.
10059000	10064000	When you're battling, you're actually doing punchier commands where you're fighting the opponents,
10064000	10070000	whereas normal tactical games, you don't do that. It's like, they fight, and that's it.
10070000	10075000	Project Cross Zone, you're going in, you're comboing, and you're doing attacks left and right.
10075000	10077000	I love that shit.
10077000	10080000	All right, you're in your second game?
10081000	10083000	DuckTales Remastered.
10086000	10088000	And why DuckTales Remastered?
10088000	10094000	I felt like a kid playing it again. I have a personal challenge for myself to hit $30 million in the game,
10094000	10101000	because when I had it for NES, I could sit there, go through every single level, and crack $30 million without breaking a sweat.
10101000	10103000	Fuck that Vesuvius level, though.
10103000	10105000	I love the Vesuvius level.
10105000	10109000	No, it's great, but I just say fuck it because it's so fucking hard.
10109000	10114000	The only hard part was when I was trying to get to the end, and I'm playing through the game,
10114000	10119000	I'm like, I know where everything is, and I realized, oh, they added this, they added, ooh, they added this stuff here,
10119000	10124000	and then when you're dragging a duck, and I'm like, I'm thinking, oh, they got Transylvania,
10124000	10129000	I'm hopping around, trying to get my ass up the damn screen, and I'm like,
10129000	10133000	let me switch to the analog controls so I can make my way up there.
10133000	10136000	Took me two tries, and I finally made it to the end.
10136000	10139000	Took me a couple tries, too. And lastly...
10140000	10143000	The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Worlds.
10143000	10145000	Thumbs up for you, good sir. That's a great choice.
10145000	10147000	Yes, I just have one thing to say about that.
10147000	10152000	The ice level, sliding back and forth, playing this while you're riding the subway.
10152000	10155000	Fuck you, Nintendo. Fuck you.
10155000	10158000	Alright, on that note, Rama, we gotta let you go to get more calls.
10158000	10159000	Alright, cool.
10159000	10162000	Take care, buddy. Always good to see you. Take care.
10162000	10163000	You got it.
10163000	10164000	Bye.
10164000	10165000	Bye.
10165000	10170000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.
10170000	10172000	We will probably try to sneak in one more call.
10172000	10175000	Let me quickly run through some tweets.
10175000	10178000	We got a few tweets here. Tigerclaw tweeting us at OLR.
10178000	10184000	Last of Us and Assassin's Creed nominated for WGA Awards, Writers Guild of America.
10184000	10187000	You know, we've seen more and more video games show up in those awards.
10187000	10188000	So that's great.
10188000	10192000	Last of Us getting a lot of accolades, a lot of Game of the Year awards.
10192000	10194000	No surprises there whatsoever, and I know Assassin's Creed...
10194000	10196000	The story of GLAAD last week.
10196000	10197000	Yeah, yeah.
10197000	10203000	ActDeft tweets us, Kirby Triple Deluxe is sold out on Amazon Japan and is topping the charts in Japan.
10203000	10206000	So, you know, ActDeft is a Kirby fanboy.
10206000	10210000	So it's probably nice to have that validation that Japan is literally eating him up.
10210000	10211000	So that's great.
10211000	10213000	No, I hope the game is successful here as well.
10213000	10219000	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, we can probably fit in one more call.
10219000	10223000	BobbyBlackWolf, our buddy who tapes before us, had to tweet us a picture.
10223000	10225000	He said, yeah, I had to. Why not?
10225000	10228000	He is playing in his Super Nintendo on the Oculus Rift.
10228000	10231000	He's playing what? Super Noah's Ark 3D.
10231000	10236000	He got that through, I'm sure, perfectly legal means to play on his Oculus Rift.
10236000	10239000	That Super Nintendo emulator is pretty fun, though, because you can actually look around.
10239000	10243000	Like, you see in the little screenshot he sent us on Twitter, and you can see this, too, if you look at the OLR account.
10243000	10245000	Let me do a retweet there so you can see that on the OLR account.
10245000	10251000	He actually, if you look down, you see yourself holding the Super Nintendo controller, which is kind of funny.
10251000	10256000	I realize that I didn't understand the picture because you can see your hands on the controller,
10256000	10261000	and I thought it was a picture that was split in two, and it didn't occur to me until just when you were talking about it.
10261000	10264000	It's a living room simulator emulator.
10264000	10268000	Yep, that's exactly what it is. He let me play a Mario Kart on it, which was a lot of fun. Good stuff.
10268000	10276000	Let's see, 13xForever actually tweeted us in response to the FUGL question from last week.
10276000	10281000	Here's my response to the Create Your Own Fighting constructor, and he gives us a link.
10281000	10287000	Let me open that link, but right now we gotta go to the phones because we do have another phone call coming in, so I want to get to it.
10287000	10290000	So, hi there, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10292000	10294000	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10294000	10295000	Hey there, it's VidPower.
10295000	10300000	Hey, there you are. Now I can hear you. Hey, VidPower. My God, I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you?
10300000	10301000	Good, good.
10301000	10303000	Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?
10303000	10305000	I want to talk about CES again this year.
10305000	10308000	You went to CES this year, right? Because that's right in your backyard, right?
10309000	10310000	Totally.
10310000	10311000	How was it?
10311000	10316000	Awesome, awesome. I got to check out the PlayStation Now service from Sony.
10316000	10320000	Oh, even though they were streaming it from, you know, just down the hall, but that's okay.
10320000	10329000	Yeah, exactly. Well, you know, it worked, you know, seeing as it was down the hall. So, you know, it worked, and it was kind of cool.
10329000	10336000	I was playing The Last of Us, and you could see the video quality, like, you know, it's like depending on the network.
10336000	10344000	So, you know, it like degrades in quality depending on your network. But, you know, it worked. No lag, which was the most important thing, I thought.
10344000	10349000	That was the most important thing I was going to ask is, is there that kind of lag that you would expect?
10349000	10352000	Because that seems like the all-important thing. Like, is there lag?
10352000	10359000	There, I did not feel any lag. That was like the first thing I wanted to try out was, well, you know, seeing as that's down the hall.
10359000	10363000	But yeah, yeah, it was, I was impressed. I was very impressed.
10363000	10371000	Now the question is, is that going to work from here to Alaska? Or is it only going to work when it's down the hall? That's the crazy question, so.
10371000	10378000	It was, it was kind of cool because they had it running on a new Bravia model, and there was no PlayStation 4 connected whatsoever.
10378000	10384000	So, it was, it was completely streamed to their TV, and they also had a Vita set up, so, you know.
10384000	10385000	Nice.
10385000	10386000	Pretty cool, and it worked.
10386000	10393000	But there wasn't like a whole lot of gaming stuff at CES, right? There was just kind of that, or did you get, did you get to catch some other stuff while you were there as well?
10394000	10400000	In terms of, like, new, like, games, the only new game they had there was Infamous Second Son.
10400000	10408000	And, you know, that was fun, that was fun. I had never played too many Infamous games before, but yeah, it was pretty fun.
10408000	10412000	And that only comes out in like two months from now, so it was a nice little preview.
10413000	10425000	Everything else is just like old, older games that have already been out, you know, like Knack, or NBA Live, or games that are already out right now, so nothing new.
10425000	10431000	Okay, I gotcha. Now, did you get to see Michael Bay fucking up on stage, or was that invite only?
10431000	10439000	I did not get to see that, no. I saw the video, though, but that was, I totally missed out on that whole shebang.
10439000	10443000	Was he walking through the show floor with his head hung low, and all that?
10445000	10447000	Maybe, maybe. Maybe.
10447000	10449000	I'm sure he was hiding out backstage for the whole rest of the competition.
10449000	10456000	That was the most, that was so crazy, and, you know, not to be a bitch, but my immediate tweet, because if you're gonna be a bitch, do it on Twitter, that's where everybody's a bitch.
10456000	10462000	So, my first thing, I went and I wrote a tweet, and I said, I said, Live ain't easy, is it, Michael Bay?
10462000	10466000	So, anyway. Alright, I had to say something about that.
10466000	10467000	Yeah, that was good.
10467000	10474000	Now, okay, since you're in Vegas, surely you know the answer to this question. Is there some type of coin-op show that happens in Vegas every year?
10474000	10476000	It's like an amusement expo or something, right?
10476000	10484000	Uh, I think you might be referring to AOU, uh, is it the amusement operators?
10484000	10489000	Yes, yes it is. That is it. Thank you. I knew there was something like that.
10489000	10493000	See, I just have to ask the guy that's in convention, Convention City, there.
10493000	10497000	TigerClan, our chatroom, saying that the teleprompter broke, that's why.
10497000	10502000	Well, you shouldn't have to have the teleprompter to make or break you, my gosh.
10502000	10508000	You know what, though, it isn't easy. To be fair, when I did that, it was the UmLoud thing a couple years ago,
10508000	10513000	when they asked me to be, like, the man on the street thing for the livestream, I was kind of scared shitless.
10513000	10517000	Like, it is really hard when it's a video, and you know that people are watching you and stuff.
10517000	10519000	Like, this is easy, because I can't see you.
10519000	10523000	But when it's in video, it's like, I don't know, it's so much different, it's weird.
10523000	10528000	So, I can't give Michael Bay too much shit, but...
10528000	10532000	Anyway, well what else? Tell us one more funny CES story before we let you go.
10532000	10543000	Um, they had a DDR setup for this, like, health, it was like a health company.
10543000	10546000	Oh, like the DDR in school thing?
10546000	10552000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a DDR in school, like, setup, which I was surprised to see. That was kind of funny.
10552000	10560000	That is pretty awesome. See, kids today, you know, when I was your age, kids, playing your DDR in school,
10560000	10565000	when I was your age, in the wintertime, we did square dancing. That was our DDR.
10565000	10570000	And instead of arrows scrolling up the screen, it would be the female PE teacher out there going,
10570000	10575000	All right, everybody, now do-si-do. And yes, she sounded like that.
10575000	10579000	All right, anybody. Anyway, VidPower, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show,
10579000	10582000	but it sounds like you had a great time at CES, and I appreciate hearing from you.
10582000	10587000	So, your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go to the adult expo that's taking place,
10587000	10590000	I think, right now, and report on that too, okay?
10590000	10592000	All right, I'll see what I can do.
10592000	10595000	All right, appreciate it. All right, take care, buddy.
10595000	10596000	Bye.
10597000	10599000	All right, that again is VidPower there on the Skype line,
10599000	10601000	and that is actually going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
10601000	10604000	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're running a little bit behind tonight,
10604000	10606000	so I want to make sure we can go ahead and wrap things up.
10606000	10611000	Quickly, Loki, I'm going to check in with you. Are there any other last-minute stories?
10611000	10614000	Because I've got to finish these tweets. I didn't finish that one guy's tweet, unfortunately.
10614000	10616000	No, there's nothing really.
10616000	10624000	All right, let's see. This is a tweet that, again, 13X Forever sent, saying the Create Your Own Fighting constructor.
10624000	10630000	I guess this is actually a link to a game that will let you actually create your own 3D.
10630000	10634000	This is better, though. This looks better a little bit than Moog. What is it, Moogan is the name of that or whatever?
10634000	10638000	This is different. This is EF12. It's a playable 3D fighting game,
10638000	10645000	and I guess with the engine built in it, you can actually mod the hell out of it and make your own, like, 3D fighters.
10645000	10649000	You could put yourself in it if you want. So that seems like a more advanced type of game.
10650000	10659000	They had something similar on PlayStation 2, I want to say. It was by the same guys that did the RPG Maker as Fighter Maker.
10659000	10663000	But there's some really terrible games they made out of that.
10663000	10668000	Playism-Games.com, if you want to check that out. Thanks for that tweet. Appreciate it.
10668000	10670000	I'm trying to see if there's any other tweets.
10670000	10672000	Apparently it's on Greenlight as well.
10672000	10674000	Oh, is it?
10674000	10676000	So says the tweet. I haven't seen the actual listing yet.
10676000	10679000	I heard they Greenlit a bunch more games there.
10681000	10684000	Let's see, I'm going to do one more here from Redertainment, saying,
10684000	10688000	Is tweeting about a post on Tumblr which is about a tweet meta meta?
10688000	10690000	Yes, probably.
10691000	10695000	Oh god, that was in reference to last week's show. That's really funny.
10695000	10699000	He linked to the tweet with the guy. He actually ended up following me on Twitter, which is pretty cool.
10699000	10701000	The guy who did the Metroid thing.
10701000	10703000	Cyanic.
10704000	10707000	Don't put me on the spot.
10707000	10710000	There, cymaticbruce.
10714000	10716000	Alright, that's going to do it.
10716000	10718000	I literally just put it in the video like 24 hours ago.
10718000	10719000	Don't forget.
10719000	10721000	That's going to do it for the Twitters tonight.
10721000	10724000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.
10724000	10727000	That's it. It's 9.20 here at O-L-R central.
10727000	10731000	So we got to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.
10731000	10735000	Jason, I want to thank you once again for being here and appreciate you really.
10735000	10742000	You guys don't know this, but Jason had to step up with about five minutes notice to take over Jamie's stories tonight.
10742000	10744000	So I really appreciate that.
10744000	10746000	I'm here. I manage.
10746000	10752000	It's nice being able to get out there and opinionate and pundit it up a little bit more.
10752000	10754000	It's fun. Good times. You did a good job.
10754000	10756000	So thank you for being here. Your final thought tonight, sir?
10756000	10761000	My thought tonight is as much as I'm not looking forward to driving back home, I want to be back home.
10761000	10763000	Three three little weeks.
10763000	10770000	Well, Loki, as much as I'd hope to see you next week, I have this funny feeling we're probably not going to see you next week, although I suppose we might.
10770000	10777000	So let me just say in advance, good luck with everything and wishing you and Mrs. Loki all the best in this next journey.
10777000	10779000	And yeah, we'll be thinking of you.
10779000	10781000	We want to know the name as soon as the kids here.
10781000	10782000	All right. Of course.
10782000	10785000	I already know the name, but I can't say anything until he's born.
10785000	10787000	I understand. I completely understand.
10787000	10789000	Your final thought, Loki?
10789000	10793000	His name's Rob Brower.
10793000	10797000	I wish. That'd be cute. That's a good name.
10797000	10800000	I ate free coffee this week, so that's good.
10800000	10802000	Free coffee! Yay!
10802000	10804000	And I have a coffee truck parked out in front of our work.
10804000	10807000	Nice. I want a coffee truck outside of my work. No fair.
10807000	10811000	And my final thought tonight. I'll say what I always say at the end of every show.
10811000	10815000	If you like what you hear here at Orange Laundry Radio, don't forget to tell a friend or five about the program.
10815000	10818000	Help us spread the word. You know, word of mouth is all we've got.
10818000	10822000	Independents have to support each other.
10822000	10829000	And as long as you're not whipping your titties out on PlayStation 4, chances are, or your wiener.
10829000	10830000	I'm equal opportunity here.
10830000	10837000	As long as you're not whipping that stuff out on PlayStation 4, I probably will support your independent broadcast because I'm all about getting the voices out there.
10837000	10839000	So remember, just support any broadcast.
10839000	10844000	Even if you didn't like this show, there's tons of other people doing a similar type of thing with just as much passion.
10844000	10847000	So please support all those hardworking independent broadcasters out there.
10847000	10851000	If you like what we do, the best way you can support us, tell a friend or five about the show.
10851000	10859000	If you seriously can't think of anybody to tell, a nice review goes a long way on a site like iTunes, a site like Stitcher.
10859000	10862000	Those reviews, especially the Stitcher ones, really do go a long way.
10862000	10867000	And we've been having really good success on Stitcher lately thanks to those reviews, so I really, really appreciate it.
10867000	10869000	And Jamie would like to say blah.
10869000	10870000	Is that her final thought?
10870000	10871000	That is her final thought.
10873000	10877000	Feel better, DarkSakura. We missed you tonight. We hope to see you real soon, okay?
10877000	10879000	Really appreciate that.
10879000	10884000	That's it. We're done. We'll be back next week and we'll do it all over again.
10884000	10887000	So until then, take care everybody.
10887000	10892000	Don't be a jerk online. Keep it in your pants, please. Please.
10892000	10895000	And that's it. Good night everybody.
10897000	10900000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
