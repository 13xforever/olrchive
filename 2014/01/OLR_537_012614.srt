Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, the news is exciting as it ever is. However, we'd like to take this moment to send our congratulations to Loki, along with Miss Loki and Baby Loki, on the arrival of newest Baby Loki this week. Congratulations! And now, on with the show.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right. Congratulations. This story is happy.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yay! Congratulations!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Voice makers, confetti.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hooray for genetics.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Celebration. Hey, welcome back everybody. My internet friends and everybody out there. Tune in to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host. Say hello, of course, to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Blarg.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How are you doing?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Blarg!

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Blarg. That was a very happy kind of blarg.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, it was.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm okay. I'm just tired.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I know you have been settling in at Cool New Job, and things are going very coolly.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Since I am not going to be telling anybody where I work.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's fine. I don't either.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've decided that it is called Cool Job.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Cool Job.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And that I really like Cool Job.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll call mine Fun Job, and you can have Cool Job.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You have Fun Job, I have Cool Job.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Alright.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But, but, but, but...

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jason can have Hand Job.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Hahaha.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Alright.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But, but I have to say...

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Wow!

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh hey, Jason. How you doing?

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Wow!

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I...

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, your job's really cool, though, too.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I just have to say one little thing, though.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have been walking around in my N7 hoodie, and have been called Shepherd no less than eight times during the last week.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
They get it.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's a good sign of a good workplace.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, it is.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's a good sign.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey, Jason. How you doing?

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hi.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I mean, I shouldn't be averse to that, because that falls in line with the trend of things that are at least mildly pleasant.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
One would hope.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A hand job is a very good thing.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, you know what?

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's okay. I couldn't think of any other insert, insert here job.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh wow.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And Dark Soccer's doing the hand jive.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm doing the hand jive because, like, what was that?

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A happy ending massage video.

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hahaha.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh god, that's a great YouTube.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Alright, anyway.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I smell a future fortune cookie.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Perhaps, perhaps.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That one is so visual that it doesn't work, so.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Voice of the show, Jason, back here for another week.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hello.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Celebrating wintertime, which, welcome to California winter, by the way, where it hasn't rained for 45 days.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was here for the brunt of it.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I talked about the miserably cold, like, second week of December, and in the Bay Area, it is getting much nicer, though.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's been nominal all week, and will continue to be.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But we are going to have you at least one more week, right? We're going to have you next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday?

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I... actually don't know.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Alright.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know, I literally have no idea what's going to happen next week because I have been...

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We did talk hand skin ball last week, and that is still the...

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hahahaha.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Maybe your job is hand job. Hahahaha.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You didn't even, you didn't even tell that to be funny.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can't even pick the right words to make that even remotely better anymore.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You know what, just ignore my comments. Ignore my comments.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Pig skin ball. Hand ball. Egg ball.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
These words are not making face.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'd just call it wank ball and be done with it.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Alright.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I do intend to be part of some of a Super Bowl party with some friends next week.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know when it will start, if I'll duck out at the half. I have no idea what my specific plans are.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We will play it by ear, like we usually do. Like I usually do, anyways.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, we will be having a Puppy Bowl party next week.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll go ahead and say, I was going to tease this during the segment later where we talk about the plugs and stuff,

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but I will be saying, live in studio on Orange Lawn Tradio for the first time in several years.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's probably been about five years since we've had this guy on Orange Lawn Tradio.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Many of you know him, however, from his time on Hoard House.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Shane will be here live next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So that's going to be a fun show. Or as Shane would say, whatever.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You know what, I know we're calling it Puppy Bowl Sunday, but my usual nickname for the bigger event that day is going to be...

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There is no bigger event than where Keyboard Cat plays halftime.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
For the more nationally accepted event...

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Fine.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Could possibly be accurate. The Super Bowl.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The Super Bowl.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The Super Bowl.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The Super Bowl.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right. So anyway, we do need to say, of course, Tech Master Loki, not here in studio tonight.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
As you probably guessed, he has the night off because...

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He better be rubbing his wife's feet.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because Mrs. Loki did deliver the child on Tuesday.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So congratulations to Loki and Mrs. Loki on the newest addition to their family.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And I can tell you the name. The name is...

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They named their child because remember he was teasing. It had a video game reference in it.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So they named their child Daniel Layton.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's right. The kid's name is Professor Layton, which is kind of awesome.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You know what my husband said?

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Huh?

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Good name.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know, good name, right?

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Because I married a Dan.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, you and Dan have talked about when that day inevitably comes.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know if you're still like serious about this or not, but...

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's probably not bloody likely.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You were tossed around the idea of Richter as a name, right? At some point?

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, and then we've decided that if we had a girl we'd go after a name each for one of our grandmothers.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And then a name each for one of our uncles.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ah.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Because we are very proud of our uncles and he does not want a Daniel Peter 3.0.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I see. That's fine.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Because Dan's a junior.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ah, okay.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So half the family calls him Pete.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Because his dad is Dan. But not me.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Professor Layton, they're setting him up for a lifetime of a student loan debt.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think... right.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I should, just to clarify, they do spell Layton a little differently.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
L-A-I-G-H.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, I think there's an E in it in 7A or something like that.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so I don't think they actually named it off the video game character. I think it's just one of those things.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, yeah, they don't want their son to get sued for copyright.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I mean...

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, we'll talk about that later.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm pretty sure Mrs. Loki probably said, what about this name? And then Loki probably went, yes, yes, that name will work.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I do have to say though, and I've made this observation just as a Jewish convert, that while Mrs. Loki is not super observant, all of her children have had Jewish names.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So I have... that has not gone unnoticed.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So there you go.

140
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And they sound like normal names to me. So two ways.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I do not know when Loki will be back.

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He can take as much time off as he needs, and I'm sure we all understand. So that's that.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We'll miss him, but we're all thinking about him and his growing families. That's amazing.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Anyhow...

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Nellie, I'm sorry, is gonna be...

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Go ahead, quickly.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Is gonna be... tired.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, well...

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Like I said...

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They all are.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He better be rubbing her feet.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They are all gonna be tired.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He better be getting her whatever she wants, and he better be waking up a baby.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So anyway, let's talk about our growing family. You guys in our chat room, the always present other panelists on the show.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Live.vognetwork.com is where we tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And if you do happen to be listening to this show live, head on over to our chat. Again, that's live.vognetwork.com.

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And you may get your comments right on air. Sometimes epic debates on this program have started from a simple chat comment.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So bring it, y'all.

159
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Go into our chat room. We'll let Locopoco start us off, commenting on the name. Daniel Layton.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Locopoco says, you must solve this puzzle or else you get no dinner.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's cruel, but funny.

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, Raginator says, so no tingle Layton then.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think Loki was going to stay far away from the name Tingle, that's for sure.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Some folks talking about the Super Bowl, and Brad from Pod Culture reminding us it's going to be the Weed Bowl.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And Rama's saying it's the Smoke-A-Bowl.

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I call it the, I don't give a shit bowl, how about that?

167
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I just, yeah. You know what, we've got our thing, video games, some other folks have their thing, football.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Some people have both, which is cool. If next Sunday's a big deal for you, have fun with it.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You know, just be safe, drink in moderation, don't drink and drive, all that stuff. Have fun with it.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We'll still be here doing our thing though.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I did not finish last week's video because I was quite sick and quite busy this week.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Fired!

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But, how have I never heard of Super High Impact before?

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

175
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You hadn't heard of that before?

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I have never played, seen, heard of it before, and I looked up footage for use in the video.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And I just lost, pleasantly lost 30 minutes of my life watching the game being played.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's the game that growls at you.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It was the most ridiculous, greatly ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, it's a fun game, isn't it?

181
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's the only football game that we had at my house for the longest time, was Super High Impact.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It was the other one for me, Tecmo Bowl, was the only one I could, you know.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think it may have been, just based off the name, I was maybe averse to it for like, fighting game reasons or something like that.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But, I've played a lot of one-offs in my life, I've played a lot of alternative sports games in my life, missed that one somehow.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will be correcting this sometime soon.

186
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It actually was pretty fun, I mean, my brothers and I would play it.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And I just liked that it would growl at you every time you picked a play.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You'd go, grrrr, make that noise.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We have several, actually, tonight, because I kind of hit a creative block tonight when I was trying to put together the show role.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I was like, what are we going to talk about for the kickoff topic tonight?

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So, I did what I sometimes do when I hit a creative block and I crowdsourced.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I went to my Twitter feed and I said, guys, you must be a social media expert.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Apparently, right?

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I went to my social media feed, I went to my Twitter and I said, hey guys, what should we do for a kickoff topic tonight?

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And so, I got a few answers and I got some really good stuff.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And so, I want to just quickly, I don't want to have any long 45 minute kickoff topics like we had last week, right, Jason?

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, funny enough, my buddy Ian, or AtariBarbie on Twitter, actually said, Nintendo financials.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I said, you should probably go to last week's show, buddy.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Thanks, though.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But I understand. It's a three hour show. He's probably behind.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But AtariBarbie sent me another one that I thought was a really good kickoff topic.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So, let me start with this one. So, quickly, asking everybody here in the room, what does game of the year mean?

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know, this is January. You've got a lot of podcasts, a lot of media outlets catching up on there.

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What was my 2013 game of the year?

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And, you know, and I even talked about this a little bit on last week's show because I said, damn it.

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know, I mentioned my top five games of the year in the last show of December.

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But then I played Guacamelee. And I was like, you know what, Guacamelee, whatever.

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That really should have been, wait, didn't we find out that in Spanish, I'm pronouncing it right, anyway.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I played that game and it was like, shouldn't that have been one of my top five?

212
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It very well probably should have been. I probably actually would rank that higher than Spelunky at this point.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So, although Spelunky is very good too, but my point is, you know, these things change.

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So, what does game of the year really mean?

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What does it mean when, I don't know, IGN does their big game of the year or, you know, Koopa Club podcast,

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
which Ian is a part of, does their game of the year? What does game of the year really mean?

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Game of the year means to me that it has that sort of association for fond memories.

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's something that you'll come back to actively or passively.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If you're in the mood for it, great. If you're just looking for something to do and it seems to kind of,

220
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you know, fill that need for being able to take in artistic or otherwise meaningful detail,

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
that you'll go back to it for that.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
As we said in our top three, it does not just have to be this year.

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It just has to be something that you played in this year.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And with the ever-growing size of libraries, you can miss things.

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like, I just found out that I missed something for two decades running.

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's a game that resonates with you in whatever way that's meaningful to you.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's as simple as that.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I really think that, you know, game of the year, and we kind of talked about this disclaimer before we did ours,

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
it's really, there's no right or wrong answer, clearly.

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's whatever game to you had the biggest impact on you for that year.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Or, you know, the game that you look back and you say, dang it, that was my best gaming experience.

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And everything I did the entire year, that game frickin' just smacked me with a two-by-four,

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
either with emotion, with beauty, with gameplay, replayability, whatever it is.

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So mine would be Mass Effect every year?

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Possibly, honestly.

236
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
When you look back on 2013, what video game are you going to say, man, that game defined 2013 for me.

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That was a great year for gaming.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That was practically all I played was fractal.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is that a bad thing?

240
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No.

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Just because she didn't go with the artistic choice of Gone Home?

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Or she didn't go with the mainstream choice of The Last of Us?

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, I think I picked Stanley Parable as one of my games because it made me giggle.

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But here's the thing, when you're talking to you as an individual versus, you know, you've got,

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I know Polygon did their list and had some interesting feedback

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
because they chose to name Gone Home their top game of the year, for better or for worse.

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Or GameSpot, which I believe also named Zelda, Link Between Worlds, just like I did as my game of the year.

248
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:20,000
When you have an organization, it's a little bit different because now that list represents your company, your organization.

249
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's part of your branding.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah, it's part of your branding. It really is. It's part of your editorial and so forth.

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I'm going to take, look, I'm going to take a lot of shit for what I'm about to say, but I'm just going to tell it like it is.

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is honest, Rob. I'm just going to tell it like it is.

253
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Polygon's choice of Gone Home as game of the year makes a lot of sense for that organization because both those things are kind of, well, you know.

254
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Quirky, quirky.

255
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, all right, yeah. You know where I'm going with this, right?

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A little bit, you know, whereas, you know, you got something a little more mainstream like GameSpot, you know, picks a little bit more of a mainstream choice or whatever.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You know, it's just, it kind of does match the branding of the organization in some ways.

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

259
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Black Wolf says, I remember getting crap from a listener because of what I chose as my game of the year did not move the industry forward in quotes.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, but Black Wolf, you are your show. You have every right to whatever the hell you want to pick as your game of the year and nobody can really refute that.

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That is your game of the year. That's my opinion anyway.

262
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Well, because it is an opinion and opinions aren't wrong per se.

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's opinions are something based from feeling which actually can't be necessarily quantified.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So he's right to pick whatever he wants.

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Black Wolf in chat says, I liked Gone Home and I also like Polygon.

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't get me wrong, I like both those things too. Gone Home was a great experience.

267
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Not my game of the year necessarily, but that's just because there were so many great games last year.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That doesn't mean Gone Home was not a great experience. It was.

269
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And I gave it a positive review and I talked about it the first time.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's just the, it's kind of come to be accepted as the, how do we say it, pretentious choice?

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I mean, I'm sorry to the developers of the game that worked very hard on it, I'm sure.

272
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But I'm just saying it kind of has that reputation right now of being the pretentious choice.

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So, you know, it makes sense that a pretentious news organization.

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Anyway, let's see. I'm just telling it like it is tonight.

275
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I've been sick all week. I don't care.

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, Biologist calls him like a season.

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Locopoco says, my game of the year of 2013 was Killer Instinct and not The Last of Us.

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why? Because Killer Instinct is the type of game I love most and The Last of Us just doesn't.

279
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's just personal preference.

280
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And you know what? If you're a fighting game fan, I fully expect that a game like Killer Instinct would top your list.

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That game is gorgeous.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Right?

283
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Like from, you know, I, I don't think I still have my Killer Instinct cart, but for the fighting games that I got in, that I actually got into, Killer Instinct ranks up there.

284
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I was never particularly any good at it, but I still have concrete memories about it that I know exactly what the game was, how it played, what it looks like.

285
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Not so much the N64 because I never owned one, a little bit maybe, but the SNES and the arcade versions 100%.

286
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Booting it up on the Xbox One blew me away.

287
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It was, you know, I, just knowing the progression of fighting games.

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The fact that Street Fighter IV went in a slightly different direction where Tekken and, holy crap, what's the other fighting game series?

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Um...

290
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Soulcalibur?

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No, there's an, uh, something, something alongside Tekken that's been frequently updated.

292
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I want to say King of Fighters.

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah, the King of Fighters series has been.

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's very obvious I'm missing it, but like, as many fighting games with a continued series that have come out and have been more realistic and more realistic.

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Street Fighter went more exaggerated and cartoony.

296
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Fucking unbelievable.

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm thinking Virtua Fighter.

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Mortal Kombat and Injustice is what I'm thinking of.

299
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Um, um, and so as all those games got more realistic and, and I want to say dark, but you know, just these, just these really serious tones.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Street Fighter went super cartoony and then Killer Instinct with all of these fake creatures still has so much depth and detail that is 100% gorgeous.

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Um, shifting to another topic here, Kaishudo in chat says, my game of the year is Grand Theft Auto 5.

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You know, I believe that was Loki's pick for game of the year.

303
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And believe?

304
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Right. And we all kind of sat here and went, duh, we could have, we could have named Loki's top three because his top three was what?

305
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Like Saints Row 4, uh, Grand Theft Auto 5.

306
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I mean, it was the, the, the Loki games you would expect, right?

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Absolutely.

308
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Just like the fighting game fans, you know, are going to pick and so on and so on.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So anyway, a pinball fan probably really enjoyed a pinball arcade, you know, whatever.

310
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Anyway, good topic.

311
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And thank you.

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And everybody should listen to Koopa Club.

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's a fun, fun show.

314
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
By the way, I should have also added the Metallica pinball table to my list.

315
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I didn't realize there was a Metallica pinball table.

316
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's kind of rad.

317
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, they had it at, um, uh, California extreme last year.

318
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Awesome.

319
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Had a big thing for it.

320
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It was actually really cool.

321
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let me do a quick, uh, suggestion that came from, I love this username on Twitter.

322
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-T.

323
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But the username says John.

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So I'll, I'll say John.

325
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
John said, yeah, for Pokemon games, how come they don't have the Pokemon talk like in the show instead of the horrific chiptune growls?

326
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Well, maybe I should roll that question over to next week when Shane's here because Shane's a Pokemon expert.

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He'll, he'll be able to answer all that.

328
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But I, my understanding, it's just limitations of the hardware because you have to remember that series dates back to the original Game Boy.

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And that really, you couldn't do voice for 150 characters in the Game Boy.

330
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, and the fact, and I think I had covered it when I did Pokemon as classic game.

331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hint, hint.

332
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That, um, it was actually a big thing that he got the growling noises to go out by, um, using the, uh, the midi processor to have them make any of those.

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah. That's the other thing about that series is that with all of the core games being on portables on, you know, non optical media, it's kind of at a disadvantage for storage space.

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So to fit the entirety of the world, the entirety of the textures, the entirety of the items, all of the other data that goes into making up those games.

335
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They, and not to mention relying on, um, synthesizers, synthesizers instead of samplers or mixing those up.

336
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Uh, the, the limitations and the capacity is not exactly at a premium in the Nintendo mobile world.

337
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Uh, I will say Pokemon XY though does have the actual Pikachu saying Pikachu, which is the most recognizable one from the cartoon series, obviously.

338
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I wish they would have done more, but I, they crammed a lot of stuff into that little 3DS card.

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
All what, 650 or something like that?

340
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, right. So, you know, when you start to get that many, I think they kind of had to pick and choose which ones they're going to give voices to.

341
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So there you go.

342
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Alright, two more kickoff topics here from Twitter.

343
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Uh, this next one comes from my pal Ronnie Talbot on Twitter.

344
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Uh, Ronnie was on Horde House, uh, a while ago, and he was actually, a lot of people have known him because he was on, um, uh, a reality show called Big Brother here in the US.

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So we're, we're Twitter friends after that. Cause when he was a nerd on big, I like trashy reality TV shows and he was a nerd.

346
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So it was like, Ronnie, what's up? We should be friends. And now we are.

347
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Um, so Ronnie sent me a suggestion and I know he was bitching about this on Twitter the other night.

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Ronnie says, how about why is the gaming community so cannibalizing in games like League of Legends?

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
They are so rude to each other. They never consider the concept of everyone sucks in the beginning.

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They expect auto awesomeness. Hashtag not gonna happen.

351
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That is so true though in so many online games and you know, I don't know, maybe this is more of a Horde House topic, whatever. Let's bring it up here.

352
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's oftentimes really toxic communities if for new players, you know, like if you're not good GTFO, right?

353
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And I'm always kind of like, well then why do you play in public rooms if you don't want to play against all skill sets?

354
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
If you want to play against people that are good, find the good people and set up private matches or something like it always just kind of blows my mind how mean people are.

355
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But especially in a game like League of Legends where teamwork is so important to success, like people get really ticked off when they get a new player because they'd rather throw their hands up and say, oh, I quit than trying to teach somebody how to play.

356
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:40,000
A reason is probably the fact that games like that are quantifiably skill based and when they face someone of noticeably lower skill then it's considered a waste of their time.

357
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And when those games more or less have a minimum of 20 to 25 minutes, that's a reasonable chunk of time.

358
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah, you can steamroll them more often than not, but Starcraft, I don't know that I've really seen it so much in Starcraft.

359
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You get those attitudes, but usually at the end and not at the beginning, not that that's different from the point that he was making.

360
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But quantifiable multiplayer games and yeah, I don't know where to go beyond that.

361
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I think it's as simple as when you don't have to look that person in the eye, it's much easier to be a dick to them.

362
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Well that defines every single game ever, which is probably also quite a bit of truth too.

363
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's just the freaking internet. That's the internet.

364
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:38,000
When you get in one of those hyper competitive things where your success is dependent on your team, when you get somebody that's going to quote bring you down, a lot of people get frustrated and throw their hands up and quit and they don't want to take that patience.

365
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I remember watching you stream Final Fantasy XIV one night and you guys were shaming your party.

366
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They don't know what they're doing!

367
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You have to teach this tank!

368
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What the hell man?

369
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I guess we're no better, I don't know, but another big difference is that we didn't say it like you're terrible.

370
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And you legitimately were teaching them so that they would actually be able to get through the instance or whatever was actually going on that night.

371
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The Titan fight was what we were doing that night.

372
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll take your word for it.

373
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Anybody who's played XIV knows the thrill of the Titan fight, so anyway.

374
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm just nodding my head right now because...

375
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Smile and nod, smile and nod.

376
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:30,000
The anonymous internet kind of sucks sometimes for that and I really wish those people who are not going to have any patience for new people would go find their little team and go play with that and nothing but that.

377
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because there's going to be new people and you just have to deal with it.

378
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Like in Final Fantasy XIV, which I play an awful lot of, if I'm going to use the Duty Finder, I'm going to probably get people that are new.

379
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because they're using it too to find the people.

380
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:53,000
So I've got to wait for cutscenes, I've got to explain fights, and sure I might get frustrated but I'm not going to take it out on said person because everybody's got to learn somewhere.

381
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I also remember...

382
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
It was a little different, E3 2004, I was wandering around with you when they had the Final Fantasy XI...

383
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh, the year I won the computer?

384
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah.

385
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And you were...

386
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Because you were...

387
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm waiting to see what words... choose your words carefully, Jason.

388
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, because I've been doing that so well tonight already.

389
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It wasn't like...

390
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Hand skin ball.

391
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Thanks for the reminder.

392
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It was not nearly as bad as what I just referenced with Final Fantasy XIV.

393
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
You were still... you were disappointingly frustrated because the collective of people...

394
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You didn't have a lot of confidence in your team, sir.

395
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You were just like, I want to be able to do this because I know what's actually going on.

396
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I want you guys to be able to keep up with me.

397
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
And so it was that excitement.

398
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I wanted to win, dammit.

399
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Absolutely. It was the frustration born out of eagerness, which is completely legitimate and always happens.

400
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And again, with that slant of, you actually know what the hell is going on.

401
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
You're a fan on the floor that's here because you enjoy the game.

402
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You already have experience with the game.

403
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
But by no means did you boss, take over, browbeat anybody else you were playing with.

404
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Yeah, I didn't walk up to a total stranger on my team and go, why do you suck so fucking bad?

405
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You lost this round for us!

406
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Just kill yourself! And that's what people say in online games.

407
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You know, I would never do that.

408
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I might roll my eyes when they're not looking, but you know, that's the extent of it.

409
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I want to say I remember that you kind of threw hints to whoever was closest next to you.

410
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Maybe? I could be making that up.

411
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I would hope, because helping them would help me win.

412
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
If I'm like, alright, cast this. Go find that guy, cast it. Hit the buttons. Do it, do it, do it.

413
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
No, the other buttons.

414
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
No, no, the other buttons!

415
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I know there's a lot figured out! Let's do it!

416
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Look, if I knew Ronnie's topic was just going to get me called out by Jason, I would never have read it.

417
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Damn it, Ronnie. Alright.

418
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Love you, Ronnie. Never met you, but love you already.

419
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Moving on, one more little kick-off topic here from Flocko Jones.

420
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
If you visit VoGnetwork.com and ever read the comments, you know Flocko Jones.

421
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
He's the number one fan of Hoard House. He's a great guy. We love Flocko Jones.

422
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Flocko says, because it's Grammy night. Oh yeah, that.

423
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Award show.

424
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yeah, award show. Really though, I like this topic.

425
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Maybe a discussion of your favorite video game music since it's Grammy night.

426
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Or to be more topical, music from this year's games that should have been nominated like Journeys was last year.

427
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Let's go with kind of, what soundtracks have you discovered recently that are really frickin' good?

428
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I'm going to kind of generalize it in that way. What soundtracks have you discovered lately?

429
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I saw Frozen on Friday.

430
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I meant video games, damn it. Alright, that'll work though, I guess.

431
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Alright. Anybody? I would say again, Guacamelee was a great...

432
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
To tip the coffee out of your hand.

433
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Was a great, great soundtrack. I love that one.

434
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Hotline Miami.

435
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Hotline Miami did have a great soundtrack to it.

436
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh, and Drunken Robot Pornography. No, it really did have good music.

437
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That name makes me giggle, how can it not?

438
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
What about you guys in chat? Live.vognetwork.com.

439
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And Fractal, if you just want good background ambience.

440
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Jason?

441
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I know I just added a bunch of soundtracks to my library.

442
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I don't know that I've had something...

443
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I've been very into a lot of...

444
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I hate using the word traditional, but you know, composed music for public consumption and not just for the medium of games.

445
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's been a while since I've had something in gaming that has been that specific for me.

446
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I've been listening to an awful lot of rogue legacy music lately, and that's fun and it fits the motif.

447
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Beyond that, it's fine. I wouldn't call it the experience on the level we're talking about, though.

448
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
We've got a couple of people in chat, including Rama and Awesome Unicorn saying Link Between Worlds.

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Of course, of course, it was great.

450
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Let's see, Rama also says DuckTales Remastered. That was a really good soundtrack.

451
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It was really good.

452
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
SG100Matt says Broken Age has a great soundtrack.

453
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And Tal says Banner Saga.

454
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
So those are all some really good picks. Good job, you guys.

455
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Thank you for picking up the slack, chat room.

456
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Thank you for picking up the slack, because I was blanking a little bit on that question.

457
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I was like, what if I played really recently?

458
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I mean, I keep thinking back to older games and so forth, but I can't think of a lot of recent stuff.

459
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah, it's hard, because it's very much a secondary thing, and the easy cop-out is something where the music makes the game,

460
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
whether the obvious answers that we all know here are something like sound shapes or anything else along those lines.

461
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Music is secondary, which usually helps to float the obvious ones to the surface.

462
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Ooh, TigerClaw says, what about the Bioshock Infinite soundtrack? Yes.

463
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I've been listening to the Minecraft soundtrack a lot lately. That's really good, too.

464
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Chiptune artist C418.

465
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Great stuff, great stuff. I know this is really cliche of me to say, but the music in this game really, really, really is good.

466
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Final Fantasy XIV is so good. It's so good. So good.

467
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
One would hope.

468
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
All right, thank you guys for your kickoff topic suggestions. Those were all really great.

469
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So thank you, Internet. You helped save the show. All right, thank you to the folks there that I read.

470
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Let's get into our gaming week, so specifically, what types of video games have you been passing the time with this week?

471
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
DarkSakura.

472
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I played some Final Fantasy XIV, because I actually had a few minutes one night instead of doing everybody else's stuff that I still have other stuff to do.

473
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Wow.

474
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I've been checking up on my village at work during lunch, and that's really about all the time I've had.

475
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I've just been way too tired when I come home and having to catch up on all the stuff that I thought I had an entire month to do.

476
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Tumblr will take like three hours to catch up on. It's totally true, though.

477
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That's not really what I'm catching up on. Tumblr is what I do in the 30 minutes I have when I'm trying to wind down.

478
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Learning is exhausting. Expanding your brain is very difficult.

479
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I think just getting your body back in the habit of going to work.

480
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well, I just want to be on my new schedule already, because it means I get to sleep in and stay up later, because that's my normal.

481
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:29,000
But because it takes so long to drive to work and back, I'm just completely worn out by the time I get home.

482
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I haven't even been to the gym last week, but then again, I've still had this cough.

483
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And thank heavens you won't be working Sunday nights, so you can still do OLR.

484
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh, no. I had an arrangement made.

485
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh, good.

486
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Because we could trade our schedules. We had a day to trade schedules.

487
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Oh, nice.

488
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:53,000
So I said, hey, and he raids. So I was like, hey, if I get Saturday off and you get a Sunday off, we can trade like that.

489
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Got it.

490
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
But then it turned out he gets off in time to get home for a raid, and I have a weekend.

491
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yay!

492
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So because I was like, dude, I know maintaining, and he's in whatever guild he's in is like their top ranked.

493
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Oh, nice.

494
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
On their server. Like they are going for progression and getting firsts. They have a bunch of firsts.

495
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Nice.

496
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So I'll have to have him call in on Horde House one day.

497
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That'd be fun.

498
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He's a cool guy. But yeah, I know I did play something else, because I was trying to, oh, yeah, I was playing fractal to veg out,

499
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:37,000
because what happened is when I tried to move over all my saves from my old Steam install, and my fractal saves for some reason never showed up.

500
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
So I have to start over, which sucks, but oh well.

501
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
All right. If that's it, we'll go.

502
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
That really is.

503
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That's fine. You've been busy. We've all been sick too, which is very funny. Well, not funny.

504
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Jason, what have you been playing this week?

505
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
We've been sick.

506
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Every time I laugh, I start coughing hysterically. It's awful.

507
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:11,000
As you just said, and as I said previously, between my obligations from work this week, like I knew were going to happen, and then the fact that I was completely out on Friday,

508
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I started putting together the video for 536 last night, and my brain was just saying that it wasn't going to happen.

509
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So I decided instead that I wanted to stop talking about making some progress on a game, and I wanted to finish it.

510
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I sat down, and I beat Rogue Legacy, which means completing the final two bosses and story clearing the game.

511
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I am now at the point that I'm new game plus-ing and can continue through with the Nioh versions, whatever the term is for the alternative form of the main bosses,

512
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and then just stat whoring and continuing to gather new upgrades, which I'm perfectly fine with because Rogue likes and I love them.

513
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
That's pretty much it. Literally just about two to three hours last night.

514
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Beating a game is a pretty good accomplishment. That's more than I usually do, so congrats.

515
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
My gaming week. Pretty much more of the same stuff like Final Fantasy XIV. It takes up a lot of my time.

516
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I don't usually review games based off the demo, but I feel like this demo is big enough that I should mention that I did play the Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns demo,

517
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because I was very curious to see where this is going.

518
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
No, because you can't use the Ares costume in the demo.

519
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:38,000
It comes with a new costume that I guess carries over to the game, but otherwise you have like six costumes you can switch between in the demo.

520
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
There is a point to the costume thing. That's what I learned.

521
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
There actually really is a point to that because the little twist on the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns is that your party is lightning, lightning, and lightning.

522
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That's your party. Basically you have three lightnings. I'm not making this up. You have lightning, lightning, and lightning.

523
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's just that you use this, I don't want to call it the dresh fear, but it sure feels like it to me.

524
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You use the L1 and R1 to flip between the different lightnings that you have programmed.

525
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:14,000
So you might have like red mage lightning, dragoon lightning, and like paladin lightning or something in your party, and you can flip between them using L1 and R1.

526
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And then you have like a meter that measures stamina, I guess.

527
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So like you can use, let's say I flip to my warrior and then attack, attack, attack, attack, blitz, attack, attack.

528
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Well then she runs out of stamina, so I have to flip really quick to my black mage.

529
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Now fire, fire, fire, fire, blizzard, button mashing, those.

530
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And while I'm playing as my black mage, my warrior is recovering stamina.

531
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So it's like you play as one, run the stamina bar out, flip to another, run the stamina bar out, flip to another.

532
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
So it's an interesting little twist on the battle system. The demo is like really, really short. Really short.

533
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's like five random encounters, a boss fight, you're done.

534
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And then, oh yeah, 25 minutes worth of cut scenes, because this is Final Fantasy 13 after all.

535
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Because it's Final Fantasy we're talking about.

536
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yeah, especially Final Fantasy 13, right?

537
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,000
So they do try to push a little bit too of their more connected type of thing they're doing with Facebook and Twitter and kind of like an online thing.

538
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Like you're supposed to be able to send like pictures and things online where people will be...

539
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's kind of like a Miiverse-style integration to me, except like items can be attached to the posts.

540
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
That's really what it felt like to me.

541
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And you can put these posts on Facebook, because like I played through the demo twice, because it's so flipping short.

542
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So the first time I played through it, and I figured out, oh, the boss is very vulnerable to blank.

543
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who want to figure it out yourself.

544
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But I figured that out.

545
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So the second time I played the demo, I knew how to five-star that boss.

546
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Because I was like, oh, if I pick up a blank from this guy, I can do nothing but blank and purposely being vague, try not to spoil.

547
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But you'll figure it out when you play this demo.

548
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
So I was able to five-star the boss.

549
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So I uploaded that to my Facebook, except I made it shared only post-privately.

550
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But it's supposed to unlock something in the real game, because I did that.

551
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So it's kind of interesting how it all ties in.

552
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It sounds like they fixed Final Fantasy XIII's battle engine.

553
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Just from what I was watching of...

554
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
From what I've seen of people playing Final Fantasy XIII, just the...

555
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah, you could stop the gauge early, but setting everything up in advance and really letting it just play itself...

556
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I get the difficulty and especially the rating system, but if I take a backseat to gaming, I lose interest.

557
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
So it sounds like they did a fair amount of work to work around that.

558
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Awesome Unicorn says, Rob, you get one costume for getting the demo and another for posting your battle score on the last boss to social media.

559
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Make sure you do that.

560
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
See, I did that, but I didn't see anything unlock.

561
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
So now I'm worried I didn't really get it.

562
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Even though I created my name and everything, and I think I did it.

563
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Knowing me, I probably screwed it up.

564
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Oh well, so there'll be one stupid costume I won't be able to equip in the game.

565
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I mean, it sounds like there's going to be 5,000 costumes, so whatever.

566
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That'll eventually just unlock for you anyways.

567
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Right, right. Or I could pay 50 cents.

568
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Thanks for your support! Everybody gets the costume! Yay!

569
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Alright, so that was the demo.

570
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Otherwise, I can't review the game, because I got to play...

571
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Well, I can say I got to play 40 minutes of it, but really, 10 of it was playing.

572
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
30 of it was watching.

573
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
So anyways, to be continued, because I will pick up the full game later.

574
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Minecraft. I don't know if I mentioned in Minecraft, I am playing on the Vaga Network server,

575
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and I completed a project of mine this week, and that was I built a tunnel with an underground railroad

576
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
that connects my old house to my new house, or where my old house used to be when the server first started,

577
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
right under the giant orange on radio sign that somebody made.

578
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
There's now a secret passage that will connect to an underground railroad that goes all the way to my house.

579
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
The only thing I haven't figured out how to do yet is get the mine cart to work,

580
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
because I don't understand how the power and all that stuff works, and I'm still trying to learn that.

581
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I know some of you Minecraft experts are probably sitting there going,

582
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
God, Rob, it's so easy, but I haven't figured that part out yet, so I'm still figuring that all out.

583
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So I'm hoping by next week I'll actually get the mine cart that actually runs between the two.

584
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And the cool thing is, I didn't use world edit to do it. I built it by hand.

585
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I figured out my coordinates, and when I was building the tunnel, I figured out,

586
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
okay, here's the point I want to build to, and then here's how I'm going to connect it from the other side.

587
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So that was actually a lot of fun. I was actually very rewarding.

588
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And a friend on the VoG network server offered to use world edit to build the tunnel for me really fast,

589
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and I was like, you know what, thank you, but no, because this is actually very therapeutic for me.

590
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Like building this little three by three tunnel is like popping bubbles on bubble wrap or something.

591
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's very therapeutic to just sit there, mine, mine, mine. I see why people get sucked into Minecraft.

592
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
It's fucking bubble wrap.

593
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Why do you think my house descends like 50 levels into the core of the planet?

594
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Because I'm like, oh my god, I found lava! Where did this water come from?

595
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Descending into the deepest, darkest nether regions.

596
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Anyways, I actually downloaded, because it's been forever since I've used Minecraft,

597
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't know if the auto-updater would even work correctly, but I actually downloaded an updated client,

598
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and I don't think I asked Loki to add me to the whitelist, but I will check this out soon.

599
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Even though he's had the baby, he popped on the web chat when I was finishing the railroad the other night,

600
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
he was trying to tell me how to fix my railroad, so he'll be on there once in a while.

601
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I just haven't asked and considered what I already said about last week. There will be a chance I will do it.

602
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I want to figure out how to build a ferris wheel.

603
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I bet it's possible. You know what's funny is that everybody freaking loves railroads and minecarts in Minecraft,

604
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
which is fine, I understand, but it's really funny because when I built the underground one,

605
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
somebody actually built, or is building, an overground one, because I went out on my front lawn,

606
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and I was like, hey, somebody put a minecart here, and it said, it had the guy's name,

607
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm sorry, I forgot who it was, but it had the guy's name, and it said,

608
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I'm building a connection between Rob's house and DarkSakura's house.

609
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So somebody, yeah, without asking, is building a minecart race that gets from my house to your house.

610
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
That's kind of fun.

611
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It's like our own, it's our light rail, it's our monorail.

612
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
We have minecart monorail.

613
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Eff yeah, monorail.

614
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Alright, quickly, what else do I want to say?

615
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Oh, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, free on PlayStation Plus right now.

616
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Check that out, and if you have PlayStation Plus, you really owe it to yourself to check out this game.

617
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It's really a gorgeous game, and a very simple, yet great puzzle mechanic,

618
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
where you control each brother, one thumbstick is each brother,

619
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
so that can really kind of mess with your mind when one's on the left and one's on the right,

620
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
but it's the other way around, and then one button that does action,

621
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
and it feels like an old-school PC game.

622
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
It really, really feels like an old point-and-click type of game,

623
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
except it's just you're using thumbsticks, and the click is the R1 and L1.

624
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
So yeah, I love that. That's great.

625
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, check that out.

626
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Queuing it up right now.

627
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Ron Chan says that Underground Railroad is racist.

628
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
It is a railroad that is underground.

629
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Should I flip?

630
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Stop being all Tumblr, Ron Chan, seriously.

631
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Should I flip it around? It's a railroad underground? All right.

632
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
It's a subway.

633
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
You know what? Yeah, it's a subway. There you go.

634
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Fine, I'm building a subway. You know what I'll do?

635
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm going to paint all the walls in rainbow colors, and it'll be the gay Underground Railroad.

636
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
You can't stop me.

637
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, that's awesome.

638
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yeah. Anyway.

639
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Will you build one under my house, too?

640
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,000
SSG100Matt says instead of the Freedom Train, it's the Fabulous Train.

641
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
We'll see.

642
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
All right. Dungeon Buster's warning me. Be sure to have a box of Kleenex next to you.

643
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I'm only probably about halfway through the game right now.

644
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I hear it's short, but I don't know. I've been playing it for a couple hours,

645
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
and I'm probably only halfway through it.

646
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But I'm also the type that would seriously like,

647
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
oh, there's a bench. I should go sit on it.

648
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Check out the scenery. I spend way too much time in that Brothers game.

649
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
All right. Let's move on.

650
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Let's get into some housekeeping.

651
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Add us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

652
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

653
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
We're also on Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

654
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I already mentioned it earlier in the show, but Shane will be here next week.

655
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That'll be a lot of fun, so tune in for that, our Puppy Bowl Sunday episode.

656
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Also, I want to give a big congratulations to our friends over at Critical Myth,

657
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
which is another show you can hear on the Voice of the Geeks Network,

658
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
voggenetwork.com. They are hitting episode 400 this week.

659
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
They taped it over the weekend, and it's debuting for the live audience.

660
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That's tomorrow, 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern.

661
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
For those of you guys listening to this on the podcast through Stitcher Radio

662
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
or iTunes Podcast or what have you, be sure to check that out

663
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
in Critical Myth's own podcast feed.

You can find all the links over at voggenetwork.com.

665
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
If you like nerdy, cult-type of TV shows, they talk about all of them.

666
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
They talk about all of them, and they do movies, too.

667
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Fun show. Check that out.

668
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
By the way, speaking of shows, because it has to be said,

669
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I finished season three of Sherlock.

670
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Did you?

671
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And I was like, ugh, the whole time.

672
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And then Dan comes in while I'm at the end, he's like,

673
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
why didn't you wait for me?

674
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Aww.

675
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So he's been watching Sherlock today.

676
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Aww. Alright, he's catching up.

677
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for this week,

678
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
and Jason's going to start us off tonight.

679
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And Brothers has been purchased from the web.

680
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Good job.

681
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I just bought Universe Sandbox.

682
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I saw something-

683
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That Rageinator suggested.

684
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That Rageinator suggested now.

685
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
What is Universe Sandbox about?

686
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Colliding galaxies?

687
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
You're God. No.

688
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Alrighty then. Sounds fun.

689
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Yeah, you can change gravity and mess with planets and stuff, so.

690
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Actually, the game I have to get,

691
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
because somebody alerted me to this on Twitter,

692
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
and I forgot who said it, so thank you,

693
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
and sorry I forgot who advised me of this,

694
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
but Sid Meier's Covert Action is on Good Old Games,

695
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and I've got to get that,

696
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
because that is one of my favorite 90s games,

697
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
even though, yeah, Sid Meier, of course, did Civilization,

698
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
a lot of those great games.

699
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Covert Action was kind of a game that even Sid Meier,

700
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I think, doesn't like in retrospect,

701
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
but I loved it, and I played it all the time as a kid,

702
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
so I've got to get that this week.

703
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
So, since we're talking about buying games. Anyway.

704
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Well, when I edit the show and come across it again,

705
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I'll message you and make sure that you got it.

706
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Alright, thank you. Thank you.

707
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Over the last week to a week and a half,

708
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
there was a bit of a kerfuffle,

709
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
because Microsoft was reportedly paying Machinima,

710
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,000
and their affiliates that are part of their YouTube network,

711
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,000
extra rates for positive Xbox One reviews.

712
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
These were being indicated by a tag, XB1M13,

713
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
which apparently has been taken over

714
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and used by a number of people,

715
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
much like Virgin Mary Grilled Cheese

716
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
and every other eBay hilarity product

717
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
that has ever crossed paths on the internet.

718
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
The going rate was that Microsoft was tacking on

719
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,000
for partners an additional $3 per 1,000 views.

720
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
For people who get, you know, at least five digits,

721
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
but more often at least 100,000 views or more,

722
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
yeah, that's pretty big.

723
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It was seen as a bit controversial,

724
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
because the terms were considered

725
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
that it had to be a positive review.

726
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
There would be no payout if an individual gave

727
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
any kind of a negative critiquing review

728
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
against the console for its release.

729
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I assume it extends to titles,

730
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
but we actually don't know that for certain.

731
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
A statement provided both by Machinima and Microsoft

732
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
was that this was a typical marketing partnership

733
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
to promote the Xbox One.

734
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Microsoft bought ad space,

735
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
as one does on keywords and any other ad network,

736
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and Microsoft also followed up again additionally to say,

737
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Microsoft was not aware of individual contracts

738
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Machinima had with their content providers

739
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
as part of this promotion,

740
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,000
and we did not provide any feedback on any of the videos.

741
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
We have asked Machinima not to post

742
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
any additional Xbox One content as part of this media buy,

743
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
and we have asked them to add disclaimers

744
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
to the videos that were part of the program,

745
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
indicating they were part of paid advertising.

746
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
This isn't a new thing.

747
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
A lot of people saw it as astroturfing,

748
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
the term technically is,

749
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
not that Microsoft is the underdog

750
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
by any stretch of the imagination,

751
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
but ad buys are very much a thing,

752
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
and with content networks going the traditional route

753
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
as they have to do in order to have enough content

754
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,000
under their wing to ensure a healthy surge of content,

755
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
this kind of thing, somebody pays

756
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
to be able to be featured as part of that incoming content.

757
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I was really surprised at the amount of flack

758
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
that this whole thing got,

759
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and the amount of shock that people were expressing

760
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
in the community.

761
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
It's not that I necessarily supported or whatever,

762
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
but it's one of those things where it's like,

763
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
didn't you all know that this was already going on?

764
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Like, isn't this, I thought this was common knowledge.

765
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I know we all use ad blockers,

766
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
but have we ever seen a YouTube ad before?

767
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's exactly the whole thing.

768
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Is product placement a new concept?

769
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I don't think so.

770
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
This is, well, yeah, American Idol's a great example.

771
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
A show I just watched last night,

772
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
which I'm sure a lot of you are following too

773
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
because it is the nerdy content,

774
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
King of the Nerds, new reality show, right?

775
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Our friend, Asuka, is on that show, right?

776
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Member of the O.L. Army, Nicole is on that show.

777
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So I had to tune in to see how she did,

778
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
and I was very relieved at the episode.

779
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Let me just put it that way.

780
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I was at a sports bar last Thursday,

781
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
and that happened to be on one of the many TVs

782
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
that was playing.

783
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Well, the reason why I bring up King of the Nerds

784
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
is because I just watched it last night,

785
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
so it was fresh in my mind.

786
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
They had a Radio Shack TARDIS

787
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
where they actually go in the little TARDIS.

788
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
It's really funny because the way they have it set up

789
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
is it actually does look like it's bigger on the inside.

790
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
It's really cute.

791
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
But they go in, and it's like, oh, gosh,

792
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
it's like all these great mechanical engineering things.

793
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I'm a mechanical engineer,

794
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
and everything I could ever want is in here.

795
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The whole thing was a frickin' ad for Radio Shack,

796
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
but I didn't feel like, oh, my God,

797
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm so offended at this.

798
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I feel like I'm being used.

799
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Where is the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen

800
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
that Radio Shack sponsored this message?

801
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
How dare they?

802
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
No, I just accepted that,

803
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
oh, Radio Shack paid for this spot

804
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
because that's what they do now

805
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
because you all fast forward

806
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
through commercials on your TiVo.

807
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Saw another TV show on Friday,

808
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
which has literally made this the whole point of the show.

809
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Price is Right.

810
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Oh, yeah?

811
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
First time I've seen that show in like six years.

812
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh, God, what a great example, though.

813
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Oh, my God.

814
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Everybody's, you know,

815
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
they call out all these brands by name.

816
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
They have to for market price.

817
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Ooh, what a great idea.

818
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
And you see all their logos and everything else at the end.

819
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And everybody loves the Price is Right.

820
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh, my gosh.

821
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Everybody wants to win shit.

822
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yes, and every time they talk about the cars,

823
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
they describe the car.

824
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
It's beautiful four-wheel drive.

825
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You know, they're talking about all this stuff.

826
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
The new Ford Fusion with stylish interior

827
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and deluxe seats.

828
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
What a great, oh, my gosh.

829
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And you'll have to pay taxes on it if you win.

830
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But even in the gaming industry, you guys,

831
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
didn't you know that like positive reviews

832
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
can break embargo days

833
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and, you know, certain big websites

834
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
pay for, you know, the exclusives first

835
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
and vice versa when it's positive.

836
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Like this is not something new.

837
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I hate to be rude, but y'all are being a bit naive.

838
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I think where y'all went wrong,

839
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
and again, I'm in that mood where I'm just telling it

840
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
like it is tonight.

841
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I don't really care.

842
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
You all thought Machinima was an independent thing.

843
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
That's the problem,

844
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
because Machinima brought on all these indie people

845
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
into their corporation that exists to make money.

846
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I think you all feel like that trust

847
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
you thought you were going to get out of an indie

848
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
has been breached a little bit.

849
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I kind of think that, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong,

850
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
feel free, live.vognetwork.com.

851
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But I think that's what this boils down to.

852
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You thought you were getting one thing,

853
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
you're really getting another.

854
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Sorry about it.

855
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And this actually,

856
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
we're actually going to revisit this topic

857
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
a little bit later tonight,

858
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
but it also ties into something we talked about last week,

859
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
which the point just completely slits.

860
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Oh, when we were discussing the Wii U last week,

861
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Dark Soccer brought up the point about the difference

862
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
between a startup company and an established company

863
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
with a reputation and product to protect.

864
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You do something new, you get popular for it,

865
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and you use it to grow.

866
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
You use it to balloon in reach and popularity

867
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
and everything else.

868
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But then if you try it again and fail, what happens?

869
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Unfortunately, probably bad things for your company.

870
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
So you hold on to what's working

871
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
just until you can find something new that works.

872
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Kind of sucks to say,

873
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
but this is literally the cycle of business.

874
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't, there are exceptions

875
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,000
because some people can reinvent themselves, Amazon.

876
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But it doesn't always happen, Barnes and Noble.

877
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I don't know.

878
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
There are exceptions, the devil is in the details,

879
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
but this is how it works.

880
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
You get popular for something

881
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and then you either cling onto it for dear life,

882
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
much like Bobby covered just before us,

883
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
or you finish and close down your company,

884
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
which who wants to do that?

885
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
RageNator in chat at live.bognetwork.com says,

886
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Skye, actually not everyone loves The Prices, right?

887
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I don't, therefore your statement isn't valid.

888
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
You're a terrible one, Mr. Grinch.

889
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Right?

890
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Don't just kind of look at that comment and you're like, well...

891
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
There's so much happiness and cheering and applause.

892
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Even the people that lose are still so happy.

893
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I want to know how that's relevant.

894
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
What?

895
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
He's entitled to his opinion.

896
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
We did bring up The Prices, right?

897
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It's fine.

898
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
No, I was...

899
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
All right.

900
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
MM2K says my favorite comment,

901
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
the best phrase in the entire English language.

902
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I think you're right, Rob.

903
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Thank you.

904
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's also Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.

905
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Seconded.

906
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I'll still allow it.

907
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I'll still allow it.

908
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
All right.

909
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Not Y-O-U-R.

910
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Brad from Pod Culture says Rob gives no fucks.

911
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah.

912
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm going to pay for my mouth tonight, but I just...

913
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
You're right.

914
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I actually had one of those weeks and one of those weekends where it's like,

915
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I don't give a fuck right now.

916
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Your body and mind have already worked hard enough to overcome sickness tonight.

917
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It's just...

918
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Without getting too introspective here on our little podcast,

919
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm learning in life that you really need to do the things that you enjoy.

920
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
And if there's something in your life that you don't enjoy so much

921
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
and you continue to do it,

922
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,000
you're going to start to associate a lot of the negative feelings with it.

923
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
You might start to feel trapped.

924
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
You might not to know like what the escape is.

925
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And there's that like fear of like letting people down or whatever.

926
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
But the reason why I bring all that up,

927
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
doing this show over the past 12 years is one of those things

928
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
that gives me a lot of joy.

929
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
It really does.

930
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
And the fact that you all show up and listen to it,

931
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
you know, sure there's what,

932
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
50 of you guys in chat right now listening live.

933
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
You're still here to listen to what I have to say.

934
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And I'm like flattered.

935
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm honored.

936
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And I get such a reward from doing it.

937
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So thank you really.

938
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And those of you who are listening on the podcast feed and everything,

939
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
thank you.

940
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I do appreciate it.

941
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to get all deep on you,

942
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
but like I guess I kind of did because of that comment.

943
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So let's see, where was I?

944
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Because there was something else I was going to say.

945
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
And it had to do with the whole...

946
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh, I wanted to say to be devil's advocate

947
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
because I don't want people thinking like I'm just

948
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
like kicking machinima while I have the opportunity or whatever.

949
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'm sure there's a variety of broadcasters on the network

950
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
who said, you know, if I don't have anything nice to say,

951
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm not going to say it at all.

952
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
So I think there's probably people that maybe they don't agree with Xbox One

953
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
or maybe they don't like Xbox One for whatever reason

954
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
or, you know, they have a Sony related channel or whatever the thing is.

955
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It's not like you had to do this.

956
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
This was not mandated.

957
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Nobody forced somebody to do this.

958
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
But it was just like, hey, here's a product placement campaign

959
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
that you can participate in and get paid.

960
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And, you know, there's a lot of people out there

961
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
that want to get paid.

962
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And on the heels of YouTube,

963
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
there was actually yet another thing.

964
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
We covered content ID changes and all that kind of stuff in depth.

965
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And there was even before that,

966
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I remember some broadcasters that I follow

967
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
were talking about YouTube's changes,

968
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Google's changes to YouTube notifications for new videos

969
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and something like that that everybody noticed.

970
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Like, I don't want to overstate this,

971
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
but they made it sound like at least a 10% and possibly more

972
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
just straight up drop off of views that they would expect to see.

973
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Just one release to the next, just pfft.

974
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And then with these broadcasters that put out one video away,

975
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
that's pretty damn obvious. Something changed.

976
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And then they got the technical details, figured out what it was.

977
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I don't have all of the details in front of me right now.

978
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
But it's like, you know, you take...

979
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's not that they take money anywhere they can get it,

980
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
but if somebody was going to...

981
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And I hate to say this too,

982
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
but if somebody were gonna...

983
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
If one of these companies were going to give me money

984
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
to pay their consult, I would take it.

985
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And that was a job I would have loved to have

986
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
for the better part of my life.

987
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Still, not entirely sure about that,

988
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
but certainly for the majority of my life,

989
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I would have, you know, done ORLAR like a full-time job.

990
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I would have done this for many, many years of my life.

991
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Would I have done it and, you know, the implicit,

992
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
done it for favors, done it for positive reviews?

993
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
No, that's not the intention.

994
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I like gaming, so I'm gonna talk about what I like about it.

995
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
I've kvetched about things that I don't like with the Xbox One,

996
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
and it has some problems,

997
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
but the games look fucking astounding.

998
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
When I've been playing the games,

999
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
they have been incredible amounts of fun.

1000
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
The controller feels right,

1001
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
and for a company with three gaming consoles to their name,

1002
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
to get it that right and continue to drill it in that well,

1003
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
it means that I like the console, and I'm gonna say nice things about it.

1004
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
How much did you get paid for that? $1.50?

1005
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1006
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
All right.

1007
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'm sure some of you guys have feedback on this.

1008
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I know we've given some very blunt opinions that you may not agree with.

1009
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I welcome feedback as long as, you know, it's tactful.

1010
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Instead of, you know, I don't like emails that say,

1011
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
fuck you, you fucking fuck.

1012
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But if you've got, you know, the opinions,

1013
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
backed-up, thought-out statements, then I welcome them.

1014
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those.

1015
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
All right. Let's move on.

1016
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I've got the next story here.

1017
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And, you know, since, again, it's one of those nights,

1018
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I'm gonna tell y'all I think this story is absolute bullshit.

1019
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But it's something that people are talking about this week,

1020
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
so I'm gonna bring it up anyway.

1021
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Running around the web this week that Nintendo has got a new system in the works.

1022
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Let me start out with this.

1023
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Of course Nintendo has a new system in the works.

1024
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Surprise goes to nobody.

1025
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Sony.

1026
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Because all systems are made in just the year before they come out.

1027
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Sony has a PlayStation 5 in the works.

1028
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Microsoft has a new system in the works.

1029
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Yes, already.

1030
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And the new Kinect.

1031
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
These systems do not come out overnight.

1032
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
We know this.

1033
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So, yes, Nintendo has a new system in the works.

1034
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
But is it called the Nintendo Fusion?

1035
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Just like the Wii was called the Revolution.

1036
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Dolphin Wii U was the Revolution.

1037
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
No, I had that right the first time, didn't I?

1038
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Code names are hard.

1039
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
If this report from Nintendo News is to be believed,

1040
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
then, yes, Nintendo is working on Nintendo Fusion.

1041
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Now, to be fair, this is an independently produced site,

1042
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
and they even start off this article saying,

1043
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
hey, if it's your first time here,

1044
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
we have an impeccable reputation when it comes to delivering information.

1045
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Look, I understand.

1046
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
They believe in this.

1047
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's coming from their trusted source.

1048
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
That's cool.

1049
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm not trying to shade this site because they believe in it.

1050
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I just think, no.

1051
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Because I think, A, they're basing it off a domain registration

1052
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
because Nintendo registered NintendoFusion.com,

1053
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
except that they actually purchased this domain back in 2003

1054
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
because there used to be like a festival.

1055
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I guess Nintendo did a music festival back in the day that was called Nintendo Fusion.

1056
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I don't even remember that festival.

1057
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But, God, we would have been doing the show then,

1058
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
so we would have heard about it.

1059
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
But, yeah, it was a rock music video games festival that was in 2003.

1060
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But apparently, Fusion is a new console that is supposed to bring

1061
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
a little bit more synergy between the Fusion DS

1062
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and what they're calling the Fusion Terminal.

1063
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
And I'm not going to spout off all these specs here,

1064
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
but it is just basically, as you would imagine,

1065
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
it's a stronger DS and it's a stronger terminal

1066
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
that I imagine is out there to compete with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1067
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Do I believe Nintendo has something in the works

1068
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
that is on the level of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?

1069
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yes, absolutely.

1070
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
The big problem they're having with Wii U is that third-party developers

1071
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
don't want to go the extra mile to do stuff for the Wii U game pad.

1072
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
That takes development hours and so forth.

1073
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
That's one of the big problems.

1074
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Even though the Wii U was supposed to be like an Xbox 360 for developing for,

1075
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
you have to be able to think differently with the whole game pad.

1076
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It's not working out with the third parties.

1077
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Whether we like it or not,

1078
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
the third parties don't feel like it's a worthy investment

1079
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
because of what's being sold.

1080
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
If a new Nintendo comes out,

1081
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
it's going to be much more attractive to third-party developers

1082
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
if their console is maybe just a slightly better PlayStation 4,

1083
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Xbox One type of thing,

1084
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
where if somebody builds a PlayStation 4 game,

1085
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
it's super easy to port that over to this Nintendo device.

1086
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
And I think that's a little bit like, duh, that's coming as well.

1087
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But as far as these specific specs,

1088
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
of course they're going to change before this console's actually out.

1089
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And I think it's a bit too easy to be able to say,

1090
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
oh, they were right.

1091
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yep, yep, it looks like the next Nintendo system,

1092
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
it did fuse the DS and the base is a lot stronger.

1093
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
This is like saying, I'm going to wake up tomorrow,

1094
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
and the sky is going to be blue.

1095
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
These are very safe bets, is what I'm saying.

1096
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
These are all things that we're kind of expecting out of Nintendo.

1097
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I think the only way this goes wrong

1098
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
is if Nintendo really comes out of left field and says,

1099
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
hey, we've got this whole new way to play games that we believe in,

1100
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
and we're going to take a risk one more time,

1101
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
which is not outside the realm of possibility.

1102
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
They took the risk with it with the Wii, and they won.

1103
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
They took the risk with the Wii U, and so far they're losing.

1104
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So it would not be out of character for Nintendo to come out

1105
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
and say we have a whole new way to play games.

1106
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
This is crazy.

1107
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided a little bit of a topic back,

1108
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
but Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided early exposure for then, 2003,

1109
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
like you said, for then-developing bands

1110
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
such as Evanescence, Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance,

1111
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Fall Out Boy, and Berlin, and Panic at the Disco.

1112
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Wow.

1113
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Wow! That's a killer fucking lineup.

1114
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I think Evanescence was a bit prominent quite a bit before that,

1115
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
but my mental timeline with the rest of those bands, damn.

1116
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
That was actually a pretty good grab.

1117
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
And this does sound kind of familiar because they demoed games.

1118
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
2003 bands Evanescence Cold, Revice, Finger Eleven, Cauterize.

1119
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Games that were featured, 1080-degree Avalanche, Madden NFL 2004.

1120
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Nintendo GameCube, it's not just a kid's machine.

1121
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
F-Zero GX was debuted at 2003, was demoed at 2003 on Nintendo Fusion Tour.

1122
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Sonic Advance 2, Game Boy Advance, Donkey Kong Country, Game Boy Advance, 007 Night Fire,

1123
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Rogue Squadron 3, Rebel Strike, 2004 bands,

1124
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance, Lost Prophets, Letter Kills,

1125
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
2005, Fall Out Boy, The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack,

1126
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Boys Night Out, Panic at the Disco.

1127
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
You see a trend in these genres, of course, but at the same time,

1128
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
these are pretty, like, this is not exactly anything to snuff out.

1129
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Is it outside the realm of possibility that maybe Nintendo's gonna bring this tour back?

1130
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I mean, I know that sounds like the crazy thought, but, I mean, what?

1131
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
This festival would have happened two years into the GameCube's life

1132
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
when GameCube needed more of a boost with that 20-something audience.

1133
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
They are taking the tack of being their own media outlet.

1134
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
By which I mean, Nintendo Direct.

1135
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And then, prior to the Wii U's release, they had the Nintendo,

1136
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I don't remember what the specific name for it was, but they had the Wii U media tour.

1137
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I went to that in Denver, where instead of, you know, like, advertising in the common areas,

1138
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
they rented out Office Space, whatever venue they could get,

1139
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
and they set up everything for people to play.

1140
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I had quite a bit of fun. I rather liked it.

1141
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The fact that Nintendo is being their own endpoint for all of this media

1142
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
to do something like this again, that wouldn't surprise me in the least.

1143
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Just a couple comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

1144
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Rama says, whether this rumor is true or not,

1145
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
if the hardware isn't on par with the Xbox One or PlayStation 4, it will fail.

1146
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Kaijuto says, I think that Nintendo caters to kids.

1147
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
That's their demo, and right now kids are into small gaming devices.

1148
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
They don't get the console stuff like us adults do.

1149
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
That's why the 3DS is doing so well.

1150
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But it's not like the Wii was 20 years ago.

1151
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
That's the only issue I have with that comment is that, you know,

1152
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Nintendo did have great success with kids and adults with the Nintendo Wii,

1153
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and it's not like it was that long ago.

1154
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I don't know. That's the only thing I'm thinking.

1155
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I don't think we can write Nintendo off as a kids-only company

1156
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
when they just are writing the wave of that success, you know?

1157
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
They do the kids thing well, don't get me wrong.

1158
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
2DS, I don't think any adult understands what the 2DS is for unless they have kids.

1159
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
But the 2DS is a great kiddie device.

1160
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
All right, anyhow, we could debate Nintendo all night once again,

1161
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
but we're going to move on with more stories.

1162
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Yes, once again in the dark saga.

1163
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Well, this is a rumor that was going around,

1164
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
and it was also perpetuated by the K-word.

1165
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Oh, the site that shall not be named?

1166
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Yeah, that GameStop in the US was going to be canceling Wii U pre-orders of Watch Dogs,

1167
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
that the game was supposed to have been cancelled by Ubisoft.

1168
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Now, what actually came out is that a spokesperson for GameStop

1169
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:26,000
actually heard from Ubisoft, and basically what the big problem is,

1170
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
is that they actually had an error on their system that took out their pre-orders.

1171
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Three people that replied to the article that I found this on

1172
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
actually said that they went out and had no trouble with their orders.

1173
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So, it's still there, but as we know, how the K likes to get on the bandwagon.

1174
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Well, I think it also says a lot that I think a lot of us look at a story like this and go,

1175
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
it wouldn't really be that surprising.

1176
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Well, and also, an Italian gaming site called Witalia

1177
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
said that the game was going to be out on everything but Wii U,

1178
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
but maybe it's not getting a Europe release, maybe?

1179
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Who knows? It would be nice if Ubisoft would comment on this.

1180
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Well, it looks like that...

1181
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Yeah, Ubisoft actually just declined to comment, but it was a problem with GameStop.

1182
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:35,000
See, when they declined to comment like that, I hate to give a K article that kind of clout,

1183
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
but when Ubisoft declines to comment, that almost says more than a comment would.

1184
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
That's the only thing, again, I'm not trying to freak out or get tinfoil hatty, I'm just saying.

1185
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Yeah, but it also could be that it's GameStop, and GameStop had already put out a statement or something or the other.

1186
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Alright, well, we'll see if they make an official comment or what happens with the game in the coming weeks.

1187
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
They declined to comment because there's nothing to say yet.

1188
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
The game's not out, there's nothing to talk about.

1189
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:09,000
The comment, look forward to Watch Dogs on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U this April.

1190
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I bet you anything they had employees going in, because guess what I just read online? Is that true?

1191
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Yeah, right?

1192
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And if it gets delayed?

1193
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Though it is a sad thing when employees have to hear it from the news before they hear it from work.

1194
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I think the Ubisoft comment, I would have expected, is exactly what I just said.

1195
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Look forward to Watch Dogs on all these consoles coming April, get your pre-order in now.

1196
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
That would have been the comment that I would have said, oh, okay.

1197
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
It's a nice comment. Absolutely.

1198
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But the fact that instead they chose to say no comment? That's where I go, hmm, that's all.

1199
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Next story!

1200
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Owners of Dead Rising 3 will have seen that they got a massive title update last week, clocking in at 13 gigs.

1201
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
This is on top of the base install of Dead Rising 3 itself already being 19.9 gigs.

1202
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
13 gigs?! Ain't nobody got bandwidth for that!

1203
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Not in some states of the US, for sure.

1204
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Dead Rising 3's base install is 20 gigs as is. Of course, with the Xbox 360, you don't have to install the whole thing before you play.

1205
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,000
But this title update clocked in at 13 gigs, and it was suspected to be linked to DLC.

1206
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:28,000
A couple days later, there was confirmation from Microsoft that the 13 gig update is in fact linked to Operation Broken Eagle.

1207
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:35,000
The update also does incorporate some bug fixes, add-ins, additional smart glass features, so on and so forth.

1208
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:43,000
The kicker is that Operation Broken Eagle, my assumption when I read the first two, the hint and the confirmation article,

1209
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:55,000
was that, oh, it's required for everybody, it's compatibility DLC so that if somebody else buys it, you can still play with them in co-op.

1210
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Operation Broken Eagle is single-player DLC only.

1211
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:08,000
So enjoy your diminished hard drive space and the fixes that incorporate 1% of it.

1212
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But that download is just gonna be there, chillin', and if you buy Operation Broken Eagle, great.

1213
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
If not, well, you lose the space anyways.

1214
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Wow.

1215
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Yeah, that's a hefty one.

1216
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It's funny to think about this now, now that the Xbox One has a Blu-ray drive.

1217
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,000
We're legit talking double-digit figures of capacity instead of a possible max of 9.7 gigs.

1218
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:46,000
DVD 4.7, DVD 9, 9.7, Blu-ray 25 or 50 gigs, where the majority of it is sent to the hard drive.

1219
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
We're dealing with some big shit now.

1220
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I just need to say, I'm really concerned about this, coupled with the whole net neutrality thing.

1221
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I'm really worried about the size of some of these patches, which makes sense and so forth,

1222
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:11,000
because these are full HD games with really 1080 textures. This is gonna be big stuff, no matter what the game is.

1223
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:18,000
4K is right around the corner, even though we know PlayStation 4 and I believe Xbox One as well, they're not gonna play 4K games.

1224
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:25,000
They're not built to play 4K games. That'll be PlayStation 5 and Xbox 2 or whatever.

1225
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Because it can't get any more confusing with those frickin' console names.

1226
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:38,000
It would be hilarious. The most hilarious name would be the Xbox 4, because it plays 4K.

1227
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
So it'd be the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, and the Xbox Four.

1228
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Anyhow, I worry with this whole net neutrality thing. If Comcast is talking 300 gigabyte cap or whatever, that's not gonna be enough.

1229
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
They're not moving at the rates they need to be. I don't know.

1230
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I do serious shit online, but while they don't enforce the cap, they still have the tools in there for me to see my usage.

1231
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I am always above 250, 300, whatever they've labeled it as.

1232
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:23,000
We actually somehow end up below. Maybe I'm complaining too much, but then again, we just got the PlayStation 4, so we'll see.

1233
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:32,000
But with all your MMOs and all of this Skype and broadcasting and all of this online interactivity you have, it is pretty surprising that you of all people would be on there.

1234
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It's not as much traffic as you think.

1235
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:40,000
It's not like it's streaming the visual aspect of the game back and forth, sure. But you do a lot of it.

1236
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
And then Skype and Twitch streaming and everything else at the same time, it adds up.

1237
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I mean, yeah, I'd send whole system backups, but whatever. Differential.

1238
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Anyways, one last note for people who did not know is that Operation Broken Eagle is the first of four DLC packs.

1239
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
First one to come out, well, that much is obvious.

1240
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Operation Broken Eagle is the first. Buy the season pass, as everybody seems to love to do, and you will get three more as they get released over the year.

1241
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000

1242
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Locopoco wants to make sure an important clarification gets out here, saying, well, the thing is, Capcom put DLC on the disc, people are pissed.

1243
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And now Capcom wants you to download the DLC and people are pissed. I think that the 13 gigs are a bit much.

1244
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Well, it sounds like you have to download it whether you're going to buy it or not. That's the problem, right?

1245
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yeah, absolutely. This was a title update for the game itself, completely regardless of whether or not you buy the DLC.

1246
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,000
It will happen as long as you have installed the game itself and booted up.

1247
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Well, let me do a quick story here about, since we're talking next, now we're saying next gen, except it's not really, now it's current gen.

1248
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
This gen.

1249
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Along those same lines, when you asked Jamie what her best game of 2013 was, and she answered, I wanted to chime in and say, but there's still 11 more months to figure that out.

1250
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Fucking not 2013 anymore, right?

1251
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Jesus.

1252
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Alright, so anyway, this gen, or whatever you want to call the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One gen, is that, what is it, 8th generation of games? 9th?

1253
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I believe so.

1254
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Where the hell are we now? Whatever. Current games, big games. Resogun is a big game on the PlayStation 4.

1255
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Latia getting Resogun for free because of PlayStation Plus, although I'm sure some of you did, you know, who aren't into the monthly subscription thing or whatever, a yearly subscription, probably bought the game independently.

1256
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:42,000
But a lot of people getting Resogun for free. So how's the Resogun developer gonna really make money? I mean, I know they get some from PlayStation, I'm sure, and they were funded.

1257
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:57,000
But, Resogun developer is working on some DLC. Have you noticed, by the way, that the games they tend to give away on PlayStation Plus have DLC or have expansions coming, things that, you know, they'll get some money off of.

1258
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Like Borderlands 2, yes, the game is free, but it has-

1259
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
4 DLC packs?

1260
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Oodles of DLC, yes.

1261
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Not to mention all of the 360 avatar enhancements and other customizations you can get.

1262
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Bioshock Infinite has an expansion, right? Not that- I'm not complaining, I'm just saying there is a science to this.

1263
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Give away the razor to sell the blades.

1264
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Ooh, very good comparison.

1265
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I've used that a number of times.

1266
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Yes you have, yes you have. Alright, anyway. So anyway, the Resogun developer, they did confirm in a Facebook post of all places, it was a very innocent reply on Facebook.

1267
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,000
But now everybody's running with it, they are working on DLC for Resogun and an unannounced PlayStation 4 project.

1268
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
So, could literally be anything.

1269
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:46,000
So, yeah. But Resogun was a very popular online title, you know, for the launch of the PlayStation 4.

1270
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
No surprise at all to hear that those guys are very busy.

1271
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
So I look forward to seeing what the DLC will be and what their next project might be.

1272
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Hopefully it'll involve more particles flying everywhere!

1273
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Pew pew pew, explosions!

1274
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
That was particle.

1275
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Particle man, particle man.

1276
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Aw, they might be giants. We love you.

1277
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Shaking my head. No.

1278
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Well, how about we go into some-

1279
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Shaking my head, shaking my head.

1280
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Meanie woman, meanie woman.

1281
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Doing the things that mean girls can.

1282
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I need to see that movie, you know.

1283
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Yes you do. Moving on!

1284
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Okay. So how about some legal news?

1285
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Since we've been in a legal stew already.

1286
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Haha, I went there.

1287
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So, a while back I mentioned about the Madden programmer, Robin Antonick, who sued EA and won like 4 million plus bucks because they used his code.

1288
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Well, apparently that whole decision was just reversed by US District Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco.

1289
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And said, no you don't get it, and no you don't get the interest, and no.

1290
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So-

1291
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:04,000
You get nothing! You leave! Good day, sir!

1292
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Yes. And so his lawyer says, girl no.

1293
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I actually said, the evidence showed that they used his source code without permission.

1294
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
So yeah, they're gonna appeal.

1295
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So basically what they said is that the jurors had no basis for their consultation because they were never shown the game side by side, which is what's necessary for copyright infringement.

1296
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So they actually had no basis for their verdict.

1297
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So does this mean we're headed towards a Supreme Court showdown over Madden? Because that could be very interesting.

1298
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
If they even decide to take it up.

1299
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
But this could set a precedent for programming code.

1300
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I'll never forget when one of the Supreme Court judges referenced Mortal Kombat in one of his decisions.

1301
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:59,000
And that was the whole Schwarzenegger ESA thing that happened here in California, right? Remember that?

1302
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I was like, wow, the Supreme Court knows what Mortal Kombat is. That's so weird.

1303
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Well, it's only 20-something years old. They're catching up. Slowly.

1304
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Yes, but the image you have of the Supreme Court is, with all due respect to our government, the image of the Supreme Court that we get is old fuddy duddies with wigs.

1305
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
You know, and so to hear them talking about-

1306
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Hey, in some countries they still use wigs.

1307
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
They should use wigs here, to be honest. But anyway.

1308
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:35,000
See, now I've got this Monty Python thing running through my head with the two judges taking off their robes to reveal lingerie underneath and going off on a date.

1309
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Only at OLR could we turn a story about a lawsuit into wearing lingerie underneath your robes.

1310
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
It was Monty Python sketch. Whatever.

1311
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
If you referenced it. Alright.

1312
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,000
For the record, by the way, I do have to make a little side note about Cool Job.

1313
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Oh, wait. Tangent on OLR? Get out.

1314
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:59,000
When people at lunch start breaking out into Monty Python songs too, you know you're at a cool job. Just saying.

1315
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and see what lingerie- I mean video games are coming out in a store near you.

1316
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I ain't showing, I ain't telling.

1317
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I don't know that I'm capable of reporting on this information.

1318
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Well at Fredericks they have this lacy red thing.

1319
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Starting in the US. Starting in the US. On January 28th, the whole heap and helping of everything, Broken Age Act 1 drops on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Droid, and the Ouya.

1320
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Which is the first Ouya release of this year. Very good.

1321
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
The Ouya gets a game.

1322
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z. I think this is the first title of any particular status.

1323
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
There have invariably been other smaller, small time releases that have landed just because they were finished and got published.

1324
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
At any rate.

1325
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Also on the 28th, Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z drops on PS3, PS Vita, and Xbox 360.

1326
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Recoil with a K drops for PC.

1327
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Tomb Raider Definitive Edition hits for the PS4 and Xbox One.

1328
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Getting that one.

1329
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
December 20- Jesus Christ.

1330
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Increment everything by one Jason. Please.

1331
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:17,000
January 29th, Recoil Liberator, Xbox Live Arcade. On the 30th, Octodad, Deadliest Catch, Windows, Mac, Linux.

1332
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Yeah, I was like, what's that?

1333
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Octodad?

1334
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Did you not, have you not played this?

1335
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,000
No, I think about Octomom. I hate that name for her because she sounds like a Superman villain.

1336
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:35,000
So Octodad released as, Octodad was a game, I don't know if it was basically supposed to be a demo or not at this point.

1337
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
But Octodad was a game that was released, holy crap.

1338
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
This looks weird.

1339
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Three months ago, where you control a dad in a family who's an octopus.

1340
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And you-

1341
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
The hell am I looking at?

1342
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
You're looking at Octodad.

1343
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
He's carrying groceries.

1344
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
He squirms around, it is entirely, it's not entirely mouse based.

1345
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
You still use the keyboard to decide whether you-

1346
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
He's wearing a suit.

1347
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Clasp things or let go of them.

1348
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,000
If you're controlling him moving or controlling like extension, he's an octopus doing daily life tasks.

1349
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
It is completely insane.

1350
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
He's wearing a tie.

1351
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Yes.

1352
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And he has kids.

1353
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
He has a wife and he has two kids.

1354
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Girl and a boy.

1355
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,000
He is Octodad.

1356
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Are they Octopi too?

1357
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
No.

1358
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
They are all humans.

1359
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Except for Octodad.

1360
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
They must be adopted.

1361
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I played Octodad at PAX East.

1362
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It was in the indie game Pavilion.

1363
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
And as Joe and her mat says, yeah, I also played Octodad at PAX East.

1364
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
So basically he's chicken boo.

1365
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Black Wolf says Octodad is basically an octopus trying to fool everyone into thinking he's human.

1366
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And the antagonist, the primary-

1367
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
He was a disguise to look like human, guys.

1368
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
The primary antagonist of the game is a sushi chef.

1369
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Who-

1370
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Taco is tasty.

1371
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Who intends to reveal Octodad to his family.

1372
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Wasn't that a scene in Monsters Inc?

1373
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Like wasn't the sushi-

1374
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
There was a sushi chef that was the octopus.

1375
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Yes.

1376
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
But you know what?

1377
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
You know what?

1378
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Taco is tasty.

1379
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
All right.

1380
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
All I know is I'm getting this game for absolutely certain.

1381
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So good.

1382
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I want takoyaki now.

1383
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I just want a taco.

1384
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
It came out at the same time.

1385
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Just don't go to Taco Bell and we'll be fine.

1386
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
That's not food.

1387
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Exactly.

1388
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Exactly.

1389
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
It came out like around the same time of these other ridiculously exaggerated control games,

1390
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Surgeon Simulator.

1391
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And it plays very similarly because there's no precision to speak of.

1392
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
He is squirrelly, some might say inky and just loose.

1393
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
So it controls like queue up.

1394
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
It controls like shit.

1395
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:38,000
But it's so much fun.

1396
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Tigerclaw gave us a link in the chatroom that you can play the original Octodad for free

1397
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
at Octodadgame.com.

1398
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Yes.

1399
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And now this game has much more content in the same environments.

1400
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It's going to be very good.

1401
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Highly recommended.

1402
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Let's go to Japan and check out the releases there where you would expect to see the crazy

1403
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,000
stuff like Octodad.

1404
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
But no, that's not a release in Japan this week.

1405
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,000
There are games that include octopuses that are a little bit different.

1406
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Settle down.

1407
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
On the Playstation 3 this week, they get Diablo 3.

1408
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,000
It comes out in Japan this week on the Playstation 3.

1409
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Also out.

1410
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Yeah, the console versions are pretty good.

1411
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
So I'm sure there will be some people checking that out.

1412
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Also coming out on the Playstation 3 this week, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Full Boost

1413
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
because you can't have a week in gaming in Japan without a Gundam game.

1414
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Also, Rosen Maiden.

1415
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Ooh.

1416
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
They're doing a Rosen Maiden game?

1417
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Apparently.

1418
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It's coming out this week.

1419
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Can you see?

1420
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You sure can.

1421
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Let me bring that up.

1422
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
It's regular and limited edition, actually.

1423
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Oh, that's cool.

1424
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
And trying to see.

1425
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
There's no screenshots, sadly.

1426
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Just the box art.

1427
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Rosen Maiden is a story about dolls.

1428
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's actually pretty good.

1429
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan?

1430
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Nothing.

1431
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:54,000
On the Playstation Vita this week in Japan, however, Rosen Maiden is released there as well.

1432
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Maikai Senkai Disgaea 4 Return comes out as well this week on the Vita.

1433
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Ibikore plus Amagami comes out as well.

1434
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
So a few games on the Vita this week on the 30th.

1435
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
On the Wii U this week, the Wii U Fit Meter, the Balance Board and all that,

1436
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
that all comes out on February 1st in Japan.

1437
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
So you have that to look forward to.

1438
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Lastly, checking the 3DS, you have Toshintoshi.

1439
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Girls' Gift RPG comes out this week in Japan.

1440
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I've got to see what this is all about.

1441
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Girls' Gift RPG.

1442
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I've seen this before somewhere.

1443
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
What in the hell is that screenshot?

1444
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
These are like up.

1445
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
This is not a G-rated game.

1446
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Tell me you're surprised.

1447
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Look at that. I can see her taint in that picture.

1448
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
She's pointing at it.

1449
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Is she fucking a bug?

1450
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I don't know what she's doing. That is disgusting.

1451
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Of course, this is where everybody's like, I wish this wasn't a radio show.

1452
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Google this, I guess.

1453
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I'll put a link in our chat room there.

1454
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Maybe Jason can put it on the video. We'll see.

1455
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I don't know. That might get us banned from YouTube.

1456
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
You know where I saw it was J-list.

1457
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Toshintoshi Girls' Gift RPG.

1458
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I don't want to know if she's pointing at her gift in that picture.

1459
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
There you go, chatters.

1460
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Of course, on the app I'm in.

1461
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Oh, no, that's her leg.

1462
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
The app that I'm using, it just pops up the image.

1463
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Oh, nice.

1464
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Wow, I just saw Cooch.

1465
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
There's definitely a gift for some people.

1466
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Moving on.

1467
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Your gift goes squish.

1468
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
It's a fleshy gift. Alright.

1469
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Lalalalala.

1470
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Not attractive.

1471
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
So, on the 30th of January in the UK

1472
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
is Octodad, Deadliest Catch.

1473
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
And...

1474
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Rymdkapsel?

1475
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Rymdkapsel.

1476
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
R-Y-M-D-K-A-P-S-E-L.

1477
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Something vaguely German.

1478
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Rymdkapsel.

1479
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
On the 31st we have Loadout on PC,

1480
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Naruto Shippuden,

1481
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst,

1482
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
extra, extra names, more names added for business.

1483
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
And then that's

1484
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Xbox 360 and PS3.

1485
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And then Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PS4 and the X-Bone.

1486
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And that's it.

1487
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Do we need to start screen?

1488
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
There's a game coming out called Ultimate Gay Fighter.

1489
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Really?

1490
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Well, it's one of those undated games listed down there.

1491
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
For January in general.

1492
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Ultimate Gay Fighter.

1493
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Which means somebody said at one point it would be out in January.

1494
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It's not actually, probably.

1495
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I'm trying to see if there's actually anything on it and there's nothing here.

1496
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Maybe somebody added that as a troll.

1497
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Who knows.

1498
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Alright.

1499
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1500
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
It's me, isn't it?

1501
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
It is you, Jason.

1502
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Xbox 3606 got released for Android

1503
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
in the last...

1504
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Was it just this last week?

1505
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
It's pretty recently.

1506
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And an article went up talking about

1507
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
the Turnerization

1508
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
of video games artistic legacy.

1509
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Basically, in short,

1510
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
it's the fact that

1511
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Turner would buy up

1512
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
cheaper properties and then

1513
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
automatically colorize them

1514
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
to the best of their

1515
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
automatic ability

1516
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
so that they have some additional

1517
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
value that they can add

1518
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
which led to very exaggerated

1519
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
and unrealistic

1520
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
color tones being applied to

1521
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
certain things in the background or what have you.

1522
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
For you younger folks that are listening

1523
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
you may or may not be aware of this

1524
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
so I'll just let the old man tell you for a minute

1525
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
that back when cable was a lot newer

1526
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
like in the 80s and late 80s

1527
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I remember when the Turner classic

1528
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
movies came out

1529
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
it was very controversial

1530
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
because they would colorize the old movies.

1531
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
And so yeah, that's what he's talking about.

1532
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
He's talking about the Turnerization is that you colorized black and white movies

1533
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
to make them look modern

1534
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
and some people think

1535
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
it's cool, some people hate it.

1536
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
And for what it's worth, I'm staring at this screenshot of

1537
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's a Wonderful Life

1538
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
and we actually had a rotation

1539
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
of Christmas movies, holiday movies

1540
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
playing in the office

1541
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
for around the holiday

1542
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
around the Christmas week

1543
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
and they were all

1544
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Christmas life and a Christmas story

1545
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
and Die Hard randomly

1546
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I don't exactly know why

1547
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
but a whole bunch of black and white movies

1548
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
in black and white on rotation.

1549
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And when I read this article

1550
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I was like, yeah I get it

1551
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I know what it means to

1552
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
for all intents and purposes port something like this

1553
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
but now that I'm actually looking at the screenshot

1554
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
of It's a Wonderful Life in color

1555
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
it's actually a little bit weird

1556
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
and this isn't the same thing as like

1557
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
It's a neat comparison

1558
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
I think it's a very neat question

1559
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
to be asking, I like this article

1560
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
a lot I gotta say because

1561
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
when you look at a game like

1562
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Final Fantasy VI on iOS

1563
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
it is kinda like, why did they do this?

1564
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
The argument, I haven't even gotten to the point yet

1565
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Well I know why they did it

1566
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
In the context of Final Fantasy VI

1567
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
you look at comparative screenshots

1568
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
of the original SNES version

1569
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
and then you take the Android version

1570
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
and all of the sprites, all of the characters

1571
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
all of the enemies, all of the backgrounds

1572
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
the overworld, everything

1573
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
was meticulously crafted

1574
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
to the limitations of the platform

1575
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
every single

1576
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
pixel counted

1577
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
and we're talking about

1578
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
what, 320 by 240?

1579
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
that's not even

1580
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
that's not even

1581
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
100,000 pixels on screen assuming

1582
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
that was even the resolution

1583
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
we're talking tiny, tiny, tiny

1584
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
that whole era of gaming, Game Boy, NES, SNES

1585
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
that's like what a watch does for

1586
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
resolution these days

1587
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
seriously, the pebbles are actually a little bit better

1588
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
than that, I think

1589
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
until the

1590
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
optical media generation

1591
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
began to be polygons and objects

1592
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
and depth of that kind of stuff

1593
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
basically Playstation, Saturn, etc

1594
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
back in the cartridge generation

1595
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
small factor cartridge generation

1596
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
everything, we just

1597
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
covered this with Pokemon and towns

1598
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
everything is so specifically meticulously

1599
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
crafted to get all of the detail

1600
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
possible in, you know

1601
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
as much size as you can do

1602
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
it's a fucking wonder that Resident Evil ever fit

1603
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
onto an N64 cartridge with

1604
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
voice acting and the characters

1605
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
and everything else, but you're looking at these screenshots

1606
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
of Final Fantasy 6

1607
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
SNES and Android

1608
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
and SNES is

1609
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
for those of us that played it

1610
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
familiar, and especially very definitive

1611
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
of Square of the saga, of the era

1612
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
but then you look at the Android version

1613
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
and it's muddy

1614
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
it's a little bit washed out

1615
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
there's a little bit more vibrancy to it

1616
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
but at the lack of

1617
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
any single pixel discernible

1618
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
detail that was, you know, making

1619
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
the point that they were trying to convey

1620
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
the water is a bit murkier

1621
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and calmer actually in this particular shot

1622
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
it looks like, honest to god, it just looks like

1623
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I think there's a certain look they're going

1624
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
for, but it looks like bad Photoshop

1625
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
filter throughout the whole game

1626
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I mean, it's really what it looks like

1627
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
and it's interesting, because this kind of thing

1628
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
does not happen all the time

1629
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
there's three different things that can happen

1630
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
it can either be completely unchanged

1631
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
like all of the Final Fantasy re-releases

1632
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
on the Playstation, it can be

1633
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
done for the sake of moving it

1634
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
to another platform, a poor port

1635
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
like we're making the point of Final Fantasy 6

1636
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
and it's not a port

1637
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
of an existing game, but Final Fantasy

1638
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
4 DS was actually

1639
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
really impressive in what they did with it

1640
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
to still keep the motif of the

1641
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
original game and bring the quality

1642
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
up three generations

1643
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
four generations, one of the two

1644
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
but it's

1645
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
it's interesting to try to consider

1646
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
what the actual process was

1647
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
of redoing all of these

1648
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
assets because you can

1649
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
on a different platform, not to mention you

1650
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
have to, to fit just the technical

1651
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
differences of resolution and everything between

1652
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
the SNES and Android

1653
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
but presumably because

1654
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
you're just

1655
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
doing it to make it look like it

1656
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
was and slightly

1657
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
better when you lose

1658
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
you're basically

1659
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
losing culture, you're losing

1660
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
design, you're losing the point

1661
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
of the reason that these

1662
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
games were created in the first place

1663
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
yeah I

1664
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
think there's a lot of people reacting to Final Fantasy 6

1665
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
like wow this is a cheap cash

1666
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
grab cash in game, I'm not

1667
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
pleased with this, because you know Final Fantasy 6

1668
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
is kind of sacred text

1669
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
to a lot of people, that is like the best video game

1670
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
of all time to a lot of people

1671
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
certainly the best in the Final Fantasy

1672
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
series to many people

1673
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
a friend of mine posted something

1674
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I don't know if it

1675
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
he's the master

1676
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
at lack of context yet stunningly

1677
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
good timing

1678
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
the greatest benefit of modern consoles

1679
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
is their ability to emulate the old ones

1680
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
so if this kind of

1681
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
thing is as big of a turn off as it is

1682
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
to you rightfully so

1683
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
there's still the opportunity

1684
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
to play the original version

1685
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
if you don't have the original medium yeah it's gonna be

1686
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
a little bit different but you can still

1687
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
get so much of that specific detail back

1688
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
she's saying that she still has

1689
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
all the original consoles and the original carts

1690
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
and everything to play this on

1691
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
we just got plastic protectors for our games that were in the box

1692
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
and one of the games in the box says Final Fantasy

1693
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
quote 3 unquote

1694
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
and you can find a way to do this kind of thing

1695
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
and it is a shame that the

1696
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
waters are a little bit muddied

1697
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
it's

1698
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
it's how the company

1699
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
has decided to take the game forward

1700
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
into this new era

1701
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
literally two decades later

1702
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
awesome unicorn in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1703
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
says it's the same way that

1704
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Theatrhythm and the Kingdom Hearts browser game looks

1705
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
they must have some artist at Square Enix

1706
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
who just loves that style

1707
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
and I'm saying this comment but I imagine

1708
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
by some artist at Square Enix you mean

1709
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
their outsourced vendor in China

1710
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
just saying

1711
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Simpsons is animated by a studio in Korea

1712
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
100% anymore

1713
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
anyhow

1714
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
let's move on one other

1715
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
story here

1716
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
because we're going to get into

1717
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
we're going to get into what

1718
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Jason just talked about again a little bit later

1719
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
but I want to quickly talk about this

1720
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
a big announcement from SOE

1721
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Sony Online Entertainment

1722
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
not to be confused with the folks

1723
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
that are behind the Playstation 4

1724
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Sony's entertainment division

1725
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
but

1726
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
SOE does a lot of their online things

1727
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
EverQuest, DC Universe Online

1728
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
and so forth

1729
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
well SOE is going to be doing

1730
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
this all access plan

1731
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
they've just announced this

1732
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
and the all access plan will include

1733
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
top tier membership level

1734
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
in all SOE games

1735
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
that includes EverQuest

1736
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
EverQuest 2, DC Universe Online

1737
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Planetside 2, Vanguard

1738
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
EverQuest Next

1739
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
and EverQuest Next Landmark

1740
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
and that will be one low monthly rate

1741
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
of $14.99

1742
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
there will be of course more savings

1743
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
if you do 3, 6 or 12 months at a time

1744
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
that's custom for most MMOs

1745
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
this is kind of interesting that they're doing this one all access pass

1746
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
now it probably should be noted

1747
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
that I believe all these games are free to play anyway

1748
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
so it's not

1749
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
or they are now, they may not have always been

1750
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
like EverQuest used to have a fee with it

1751
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
and so on

1752
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
and so did DC Universe for a short while

1753
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
but they're all free to play now

1754
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
so you're really paying this fee to have basically top level access

1755
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
you know

1756
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
which is going to be the extra perks

1757
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
and inventory and character slots and so forth

1758
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
that you would expect for all these games

1759
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
so this is interesting that you have that one

1760
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
excuse me, that one subscription fee there

1761
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
so

1762
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
ah yeah, it's going to happen

1763
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
about April 2nd they say

1764
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
any existing membership will be automatically

1765
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
upgraded to the new plan

1766
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
that's good news for people that might be paying separate fees

1767
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
right now for top level access and say

1768
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
EverQuest and EverQuest 2

1769
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
and so forth, so pretty cool

1770
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
so, alright

1771
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
anyhow

1772
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
let's take a moment to

1773
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
travel back to when, you know, there was no

1774
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
online entertainment

1775
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
that was, that wasn't

1776
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
you couldn't call in online

1777
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
unless you had Sega Channel

1778
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
that's how you had online

1779
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
X-band, which was hilariously bad

1780
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
only the rich kids had that stuff

1781
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
not me, or if it was like the very

1782
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
close to early 90s

1783
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
you had AOL, you know

1784
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
in DOS

1785
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
so alright, here it is, your classic game

1786
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
of the week

1787
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
for all this fancy online

1788
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
connectivity crap

1789
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
you'll need it

1790
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
go outside, DarkSocker's going to dive into

1791
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey

1792
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
you should be playing this game, or you're

1793
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
you're dumb and stuff

1794
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
well, to keep up with my theme

1795
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
of using games that have been represented

1796
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
in Namco High, and I'm getting a little tired

1797
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
of Namco games, this might be the last one

1798
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
for now, I love you Namco

1799
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I love you Namco, but still, I've done a bunch

1800
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Dragon Spirit

1801
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
it was

1802
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
a 1987 scrolling

1803
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
shooter game that was

1804
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
released by Namco

1805
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
it was very loud, sorry, we have a dragon shooting

1806
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
fire over here, sorry about that

1807
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I'm not sure if I'm attached to it, but

1808
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
no, I didn't have an intro for some reason

1809
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
but it

1810
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
was released by Atari Games in the US

1811
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
and it runs on the Namco System 1 hardware

1812
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
that was later ported

1813
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
to the Amstrad CPC

1814
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Commodore Amiga, Commodore 64

1815
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
DOS, Atari ST, X68000

1816
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
the PC Engine and TurboGrafx

1817
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
and the ZX Spectrum platforms

1818
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
so basically

1819
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
kind of the story is that there was

1820
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
a

1821
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
serpent demon named Zawel

1822
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
that escaped its imprisonment after

1823
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
a thousand years and kidnapped Princess

1824
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Alicia, so a soldier named

1825
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Amul has to

1826
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
rescue her and destroy Zawel

1827
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
oh, there's the intro

1828
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I just thought it was, it's really pretty, pretty epic

1829
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
it's a dragon taking off

1830
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
from a cliff, and the music

1831
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
in the game is pretty good, I mean

1832
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
oh

1833
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
it takes

1834
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
a minute to get into it, so

1835
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
anyway, so basically

1836
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
you have to, you can

1837
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
collect up to 13 additional

1838
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
powers, apart from what he comes

1839
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
with which is breathing fire and dropping bombs

1840
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
he turns into the blue dragon, by the way

1841
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I forgot to say that, cause anyone who turns into

1842
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
a blue dragon and isn't in the game blue dragon

1843
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
is pretty cool

1844
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
so he can

1845
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
burst flames, drop

1846
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
bombs, which I guess would be

1847
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
dragon poop, dragon poop has to be pretty flammable

1848
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
and

1849
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Amul is pretty big when he's

1850
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
just doing the flying through the screen

1851
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
he takes two hits

1852
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
before losing a life, and three in some

1853
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
versions, the power-ups

1854
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
give you extra heads that may double

1855
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
or triple your firepower

1856
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
but they also

1857
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
increase your exposure, so while you

1858
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
were stronger, you were also a bigger freaking

1859
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
target, and

1860
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
bless this game for doing that even though it made playing

1861
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
it really freaking frustrating

1862
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
so yeah, there were other releases

1863
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
there was a sort of sequel on

1864
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
the Famicom that came

1865
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
out as Dragon Spirit the new legend

1866
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
which was a port

1867
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
that took place a generation after the

1868
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
original game, there was an arcade

1869
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
sequel called Dragon Saber that came out in 1990

1870
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
that allowed for two player simultaneous

1871
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
play, Dragon

1872
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Spirit was released on PC Engine

1873
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
and TurboGrafx-16

1874
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
and it was very close to the

1875
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
arcade version

1876
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
and the sound quality of that

1877
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
I must say, since this is a game that I do own

1878
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
it's really freaking good

1879
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
and SSJ-100

1880
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Matt in chat says that I always thought those were Dragon

1881
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Vomit

1882
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
yeah, because Dragon Vomit

1883
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
is flammable and kills people

1884
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
so

1885
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
there was also

1886
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
an emulated version that came

1887
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
in the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary and

1888
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Namco Museum volume 5 for the Playstation

1889
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
also

1890
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
the PC Engine version

1891
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
was added

1892
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
to Nintendo Virtual Console in 2007

1893
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
and on December 8th, 2009 the arcade

1894
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
version came out as part of the Virtual

1895
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Console arcade in Japan

1896
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
and on November 4th

1897
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
2008 came out on Xbox 360

1898
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
with the Namco Museum

1899
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Virtual Arcade

1900
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Playstation Network does have a release, it's a downloadable

1901
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
game for PS3 and that's under Namco

1902
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Museum essentials

1903
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
and as part of the Pac-Man 30th Anniversary

1904
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
in 2010, Dragon Spirit

1905
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
was released as part of Pac-Man's arcade

1906
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
party, 30th Anniversary arcade machine

1907
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
along with

1908
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga

1909
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
and a bunch of other games

1910
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
so there you have it, Dragon Spirit

1911
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
and it's a really

1912
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
fun little arcade shooter, it's just not

1913
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
quite the

1914
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
the usual thing one expects

1915
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
yeah, I like this game

1916
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
a lot, it's in that Namco

1917
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
collection on Playstation 3 that's

1918
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
got some neat games in it

1919
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I've played this a lot on there

1920
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
I almost wonder if this partly didn't

1921
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
inspire other

1922
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
there's another game that

1923
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
involved writing

1924
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I want to say it was Psychic Storm

1925
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
but maybe not

1926
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
but I honestly think

1927
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
that this just added such a unique

1928
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
feel

1929
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
to a genre

1930
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
that's been out for quite some time

1931
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
and we don't maybe have as many shooting games like this

1932
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
that survived, you know, anymore

1933
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
we still get some of the Raiden games

1934
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
but I would love to see a new

1935
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Dragon Spirit

1936
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
there it is, your classic game of the week, Dragon Spirit

1937
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
an arcade game

1938
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I'd like to add, actually, Dungeon Buster made a good point

1939
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
that it had a health bar

1940
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
which was pretty unusual for the time, but like I said

1941
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
it was a two hit

1942
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
you know, two hits you die

1943
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
but that was your health bar

1944
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
and a lot of life

1945
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
alright, well, that is going to do it for the first half of our show

1946
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
but we've got plenty more show to come

1947
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
including the FUGO Question of the Week

1948
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
talking about the Turnerization of Games

1949
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
opinion piece, which website was that from?

1950
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
BAV Club?

1951
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I just want to make sure they got credit

1952
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
we're going to talk about

1953
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
that big

1954
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
that big name lawsuit

1955
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
that everybody's talking about this week

1956
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
we're going to get into that fuckery

1957
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
it's such a sweet story, love

1958
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
gross

1959
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I see what you did there

1960
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
we also have your mails, FUs of the Week, your phone calls

1961
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

1962
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
right after this

1963
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

1964
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
where we are

1965
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
having episode number 537

1966
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
in progress for this

1967
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
January the 26th of

1968
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
2014

1969
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
myself, DarkSakura, and voice of the show

1970
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Jason here with you guys tonight

1971
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
not here tonight

1972
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Loki, if you missed our announcement

1973
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
in part A, Loki and Mrs. Loki

1974
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
welcomed Daniel Layton

1975
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
their new son to the world

1976
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
earlier this week

1977
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
on Tuesday, so Loki will be off

1978
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
until he decides he's ready to come back

1979
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
which knowing Loki will probably be next week

1980
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
but we won't hold him to it

1981
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
he'll come back when he's ready

1982
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
alright, we still got plenty of news to take care of

1983
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
so let's get into it

1984
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
some rapid fire news

1985
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Jason, if you wouldn't mind starting us off today

1986
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
oh yeah, I guess I did a really good job of distracting myself

1987
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
and not paying attention to the fact that I'm starting this

1988
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
okay

1989
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
following the discussion of Final Fantasy 6

1990
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
on Android

1991
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Final Fantasy 6 on Android has a major freezing glitch

1992
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
it was released last week to the Google Play Store

1993
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
and the new version

1994
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
comes with graphical improvements

1995
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
yeah, we knew all that

1996
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
spoilerific, maybe

1997
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
possibly, but

1998
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
to cut a long story short

1999
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
and to obscure any of the details

2000
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
the glitch

2001
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
prevents gamers from completing the game

2002
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
play if you want, it happens

2003
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
it happens

2004
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
man, I

2005
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I'm unfortunately kind of running out of my

2006
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
knowledge with Final Fantasy 6

2007
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
and I really don't want to give away any kind of a key

2008
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
plot point

2009
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
the game freezes in Thamassa

2010
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
if you're there

2011
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
and you don't want to have to redo the game

2012
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
stop playing there

2013
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
wait for an update to become available

2014
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
update it, the problem will be fixed

2015
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Square Enix recently registered the

2016
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
seeds of salvation in the US

2017
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
as the

2018
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
speculation continues to abound

2019
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
the current theory

2020
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
is that this is a

2021
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
western localization for Dragon Quest

2022
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
to be used

2023
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
for, this trademark could be

2024
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
the Nintendo 3DS remake of Dragon

2025
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Quest 7, or maybe even

2026
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
for the suite of smartphone remakes

2027
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
like the Unity powered Dragon Quest 8

2028
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Journey of the Cursed King

2029
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
we'll see a trademark

2030
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
a trademark may not go

2031
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
anywhere, just like a patent or anything else

2032
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
we'll see what they wind up doing with it when the game

2033
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
becomes available

2034
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
more hints towards a re-release

2035
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
of Majora's Mask are being dropped from

2036
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Nintendo in A Link Between Worlds

2037
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
director

2038
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Hiromasa Shikata has teased

2039
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
in an interview with Game Informer

2040
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
that the remake could be

2041
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
coming because having

2042
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Majora's Mask in Link's house was a

2043
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
special request from Aonuma's

2044
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
production team

2045
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
now why would they ask us to do

2046
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
that?

2047
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
well we'll just have to wait and see

2048
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
and this can't possibly be a surprise

2049
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
hello Ocarina of Time 3D

2050
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
it's a matter of getting the game

2051
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
to look correctly and since

2052
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
I missed it the first time around I am very much looking

2053
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
forward to playing Majora's Mask 3DS

2054
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
on the 3DS

2055
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
if it happens

2056
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
if it happens

2057
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
gee let's think about this

2058
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
something that finally happened

2059
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
after months and months and months and months

2060
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
and months and months of waiting is that

2061
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Blizzard made Hearthstone

2062
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
in open beta

2063
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I installed it and didn't play it

2064
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
wrong company

2065
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
after pretty much everybody

2066
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
who wanted to play the beta was already in the

2067
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
closed beta Blizzard finally

2068
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
opened the super special secret club

2069
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
of people playing Hearthstone namely everybody

2070
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
to the world

2071
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
so yeah

2072
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Blizzard has opened up

2073
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft so for whatever reason

2074
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
you just forgot you wanted to play it at some point

2075
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
you can actually download that and

2076
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
check that out fun

2077
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
it's only available however in North America

2078
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
right now so when will the game

2079
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
officially launch knowing

2080
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Blizzard it will probably be in 2017

2081
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I didn't know Blizzard and Valve

2082
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
were so similar Blizzard

2083
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
does things soon

2084
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
which again

2085
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I just don't care tonight so I'm just gonna tell you

2086
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
big reason I cancelled my

2087
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
World of Warcraft account is because that expansion

2088
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
is not happening in the next few months

2089
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
there is gonna be nothing to do in

2090
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
World of Warcraft for about six months until that

2091
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
expansion gets here no no no no

2092
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
rep rep grinding Rob rep grinding

2093
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
oh yay and the

2094
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
raids that aren't really that much fun anymore

2095
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
but anyway I digress

2096
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
didn't mean to turn it into a

2097
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
hate fest I don't hate

2098
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
hate is a strong word it's just

2099
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Warcraft

2100
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
and I are seeing other people right now that's all it is

2101
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
you're seeing other MMOs

2102
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
that's right moving on

2103
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I did not realize

2104
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
this was a Steam feature

2105
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
I'm using my little quotey hands feature

2106
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
because I've never preordered a game on

2107
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Steam but apparently if you were to preorder a

2108
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
game on Steam you would

2109
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
actually have to contact customer support to cancel

2110
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
that preorder you couldn't just like click a

2111
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
button that's like wait never mind or cancel

2112
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
well

2113
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
no more will you have to do that as the

2114
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
refund an item button is now

2115
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
displayed on Steam so if you wish

2116
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
to cancel a preorder

2117
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
you can do so just as easily

2118
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
as you can place the preorder

2119
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
which I always thought was the way it should be

2120
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
but whatever

2121
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
so there you go well now it is hooray

2122
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
hooray one thing

2123
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
that I'm sure many of you didn't order

2124
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
because this would cost a lot of money

2125
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
I think this actually ended up going for over

2126
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
$90,000 it was a copy

2127
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
of the super rare

2128
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Nintendo World Championship

2129
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
NES cartridge

2130
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
and this cartridge really looked like shit

2131
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
there's no other way to put it but this thing looked like it had been in

2132
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
a dumpster somebody had scratched

2133
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
the label off and written in a

2134
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Bic pen Mario

2135
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
because I guess

2136
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
the first game in Nintendo World Championship

2137
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
was Mario you can tell like mom or dad

2138
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
did this it's Mario

2139
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
but anyway so it was found and

2140
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
there's only 116 of these cartridges

2141
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
in the world so they always

2142
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
go for a crap ton of money even when they

2143
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
look like such garbage like this

2144
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
game did on the outside it's

2145
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
a pearl on the inside because it's

2146
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
a very rare little tournament game

2147
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
so yeah

2148
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
let me see if I can find the final amount

2149
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
right now here on eBay oh it went for

2150
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
$99,902

2151
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
I want to know who paid that you know what do you want to bet

2152
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
they're not going to it was just a troll bid

2153
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
it was probably 4chan that placed that bid let's be honest

2154
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
alright

2155
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
there you go

2156
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Dark Sakura sorry the moment you

2157
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
pass it over to me and my lungs

2158
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
protest alright

2159
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
yeah yeah

2160
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
well

2161
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
there is something that was and I

2162
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
was very impressed by this when I

2163
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
saw it today in my browsing

2164
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
is that there is

2165
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
going to be a preview for Castlevania

2166
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Lords of Shadow 2

2167
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
but this is specifically going to happen

2168
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
in Australia

2169
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
and the reason being

2170
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
is that it's also a blood drive

2171
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
so if you are in Sydney

2172
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
on Thursday the 30th

2173
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
from 5 o'clock onward

2174
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
if you go to the Elizabeth Street donor center

2175
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
at 20 Elizabeth Street

2176
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
you can not only play Castlevania

2177
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Lords of Shadow 2 you could possibly

2178
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
save up to 3 lives

2179
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
for every pint of blood you can it's usable

2180
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
by up to 3 people

2181
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
so eat a lot of spinach

2182
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
and you know steak that morning

2183
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
and make sure you pass your

2184
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
hematocrit and give blood

2185
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
and let us know how the game is

2186
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
does Australia allow the gays to donate blood?

2187
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I don't know

2188
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I don't live there

2189
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
I think that's stupid

2190
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
it is stupid

2191
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
well in other news

2192
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
there is something showing up on the Wii U

2193
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Virtual Console this week and that

2194
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
is Mighty Bomb Jack

2195
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
the NES game

2196
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
also known as the scourge of Game Center CX

2197
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
GX? CX

2198
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
whatever

2199
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
well basically you just use bombs as a weapon

2200
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
and you jump and look for treasure and do stuff

2201
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
so hooray it's 5 bucks

2202
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
which is about what you'd pay

2203
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
for it at the flea market

2204
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
and then

2205
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I want

2206
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
dammit Rob why do you link me stuff

2207
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
because when it

2208
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
says these two magic words I automatically

2209
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
know oh this is a story Jamie wants to see

2210
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
there is a mod

2211
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
for the Starbound beta

2212
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
that has elements

2213
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
from Mass Effect

2214
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
so now it's

2215
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Starbound Mass Effect edition

2216
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
and it is officially my favorite

2217
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
mod on the Citadel

2218
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
just saying

2219
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
but it actually

2220
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
adds in the

2221
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Biotics so you can

2222
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
lift and

2223
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
slow down things and I guess

2224
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
singularities and what not

2225
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
and it converts your ship to the Normandy

2226
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
to the original SR1

2227
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
from the first Mass Effect

2228
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
so you have all kinds of different

2229
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
races showing up there

2230
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
and you just need to use the

2231
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Kawa's Xbox

2232
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
mode character creator

2233
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
and the simple extend the character creation

2234
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
mod and the stuff is up on

2235
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
the Starbound forums so let me know

2236
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
if it works

2237
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I may or may not be trying this tomorrow

2238
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
hahaha

2239
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
alright

2240
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
uh

2241
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
dar2 is in our chat room saying I thought the

2242
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Mass Effect fans on OLR would like that yeah I saw that

2243
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
too and I said very yes

2244
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
was my response

2245
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
alright let's go to

2246
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
the Foogle question of the week

2247
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
you take Facebook, you take Google Plus and you slam those

2248
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
words together and you get what we call

2249
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Boogle

2250
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
as I promised this week's

2251
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
question on Foogle relates

2252
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
to the Turnerization of video games

2253
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
article that Jason

2254
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
read earlier from ABClub.com

2255
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
so we decided we would ask our

2256
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
listeners what do you

2257
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
think about remaking classic games

2258
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
do you think it's a good thing for the classic

2259
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
games or would classic games be better

2260
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
left untouched and resources

2261
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
spent on new games

2262
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I'm going to read just a few of these answers from Facebook

2263
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
so I'm going to tell you guys please go check out

2264
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
facebook.com slash orange launch radio to read all

2265
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
of the answers on the show but I'm so happy

2266
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
to see Princess Irene answering

2267
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
the question this week our good old friend

2268
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Princess Irene is back and she said

2269
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
so succinctly in her very Irene

2270
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
style her reply is

2271
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
it's total bullshit

2272
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
which I can't do in her voice because I haven't heard her voice

2273
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
in years

2274
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
it's total bullshit is what Irene said

2275
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
about remaking classic

2276
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
games

2277
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Daniel S says they can

2278
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
remake games all they want it won't take

2279
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
away from what they made long ago

2280
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I just wish devs would pay more

2281
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
attention to the consoles they're porting to

2282
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
that and support the game post

2283
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
launch stupid Chrono Trigger

2284
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
IOS port is stupid

2285
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I vaguely remember there being some

2286
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
series of bugs or just like

2287
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
the selection or something

2288
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I forgot there was a Chrono Trigger port

2289
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I'm pretty sure we covered it

2290
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I stopped downloading those IOS remakes

2291
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I just stopped, I couldn't

2292
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I threw up my hands and said I can't

2293
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
and that was it

2294
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Moving on to Awesome Unicorn who says

2295
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I support remakes and reimaginings that offer significant changes

2296
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
or improvements over the original

2297
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
a la the Final Fantasy 4 DS remake

2298
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
or the Lufia 2 DS reimagining

2299
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Mobile ports of Final Fantasy 5 and 6

2300
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
just feel like they've been changed simply so new artists

2301
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
can list the games on their resumes

2302
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Want to put a significant work into

2303
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
improving the graphics and gameplay experiences?

2304
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Please feel free to do so

2305
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Want to make a quick buck? Save yourself the time and effort

2306
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
put your game on Virtual Console or Playstation

2307
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Network and start working on something else

2308
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I like it, that's an order

2309
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Our good pal Jeremy

2310
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
from Koopa Club answers the question

2311
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
and says remaking a classic game is totally fine

2312
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
if done correctly

2313
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
A good Square Enix example

2314
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
is the DS remake of Final Fantasy 4

2315
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
or Dragon Quest 5

2316
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Pretty much everybody is making exactly the same point I did

2317
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
The Final Fantasy 4 DS remake

2318
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
is absurdly good

2319
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Which really started with the 3 remake

2320
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
and I think a lot of us were hoping

2321
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
I think a lot of us were hoping

2322
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
for that with 6

2323
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
and then we get this

2324
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
and we're like cash in

2325
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Ziba replies

2326
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
and says I love remakes

2327
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
especially ones remade for

2328
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
IOS because I get to play them on the go

2329
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
SSJ100Matt

2330
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
says when a game is remade

2331
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
for the right reasons and the right way

2332
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
it can be great

2333
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
When it's used as a quick, half-assed cash grab

2334
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
then it only hurts the legacy and image that game once had

2335
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
A great way to remake a game

2336
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
is with the help of the community

2337
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Chrono Trigger resurrection

2338
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
had a lot of promise

2339
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
made by fans and independent people

2340
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
wanting to share the favorite game with a new generation

2341
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Sadly it was stopped

2342
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
before it could be finished

2343
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Well because they were going to do that IOS port

2344
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
that we all forgot about

2345
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
My friend Shane

2346
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
who's going to be here next week says

2347
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
I think it's okay to remake a game if it's stupidly

2348
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
hard to get your hands on a copy

2349
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
and you've already given up hope of a straight up port

2350
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
coming to some device

2351
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Something like C code in 2 or whatever could benefit

2352
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
from such a practice

2353
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
The graphics was super dumb to do though

2354
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It's already on a lot of different platforms

2355
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
and they made it look worse with odd script changes

2356
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
So bad

2357
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
I'm hearing all of that in Shane's voice

2358
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
So bad

2359
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Gamergirl says

2360
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I don't see anything wrong with redoing some games

2361
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
because it gives people who haven't played the original

2362
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
nor can they find them a chance to play

2363
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Looking at a few of the answers

2364
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
from Google Plus

2365
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Let's see

2366
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
ActDeft gave us a haiku

2367
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
version, we love haikus

2368
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Remakes are okay

2369
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
but if the devs are lazy

2370
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
the port will be bad

2371
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Flaco Jones

2372
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Remakes are okay

2373
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
No it's fine

2374
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Don't make me police the police

2375
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Flaco Jones says

2376
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
I'm fine with remakes but I think the original

2377
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
version should be bundled in there

2378
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
as well so the classic game can still be

2379
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
experienced and appreciated

2380
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
That's a good way of doing it

2381
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
I like that idea

2382
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
AJ Twist lastly on Google Plus says

2383
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Remakes are good as long as there are

2384
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
no significant changes that change the

2385
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
gameplay or story. Changes to the story

2386
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
that make it better to understand are always

2387
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
welcome in my opinion. I think some

2388
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
remakes should include an original port

2389
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
so we can better appreciate the new and

2390
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
old versions. Kids need a reason

2391
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
to play some classics

2392
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Flaco Jones answer is actually pretty interesting

2393
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
because Cave Story has really epitomized

2394
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
this. It doesn't

2395
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
exactly have the lifetime and the multiple

2396
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
generation. It doesn't span

2397
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
multiple generations to see what's gonna happen

2398
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
but Cave Story started

2399
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
as and still is an indie title

2400
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
but its groundswell has just continued

2401
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
to grow and grow and grow over the last

2402
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I don't even know when it

2403
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
originally came out. I want to say two years now

2404
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I want to say 2012

2405
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
but there's like three different versions of the game

2406
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
There is the original pixel

2407
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
art and very crude

2408
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
synthesized music

2409
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
and then they kind of refined it

2410
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
and upgraded it and made it look

2411
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
less blocky but still

2412
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:59,000
a motif of that style

2413
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Yep

2414
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
They improved

2415
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
everything, made it, added yet

2416
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
another depth of detail, gave it more

2417
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
style, improved the soundtrack and really brought it

2418
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
up and apparently there's

2419
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
even a third tier where the music

2420
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I've heard the music, it's more

2421
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
it's more full production

2422
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
fully featured production instead of

2423
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
like little synthesized

2424
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
designs and then

2425
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
the graphics are

2426
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
fully fleshed out

2427
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
but still kept

2428
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
in a blocky style

2429
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Three

2430
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
very distinct styles

2431
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
in two years is pretty crazy

2432
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
but every version lets you select

2433
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
from any combination of them

2434
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
both independently graphics and sound

2435
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Alright

2436
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Those were some of the answers from Facebook and Google Plus

2437
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
I read about half of them tonight just for time's

2438
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
sake to keep things moving so I'm sorry I didn't read all

2439
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
the answers, thank you to everybody that took the

2440
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
time to answer and I encourage all of our listeners

2441
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
to read what people had to say over

2442
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
at facebook.com slash orange launch radio

2443
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
and google.com slash plus orange launch radio

2444
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Alright, let's travel on

2445
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
with some more news

2446
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Loki

2447
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Loki

2448
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Sorry, I'm so used to seeing it

2449
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
on the show roll

2450
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Alright, not Loki

2451
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Loki imposter

2452
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Bigger beard Loki

2453
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
As spotted on

2454
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
LinkedIn from the profile of

2455
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Rob Stokes, the senior level designer at

2456
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Harmonix

2457
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
an unannounced Kinect game

2458
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
for the Xbox One has allegedly

2459
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
been cancelled. In mid-2012

2460
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Harmonix originally announced that they had

2461
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
several projects in the works that were not related

2462
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
to Rock Band or Dance Central

2463
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
or Fantasia Music Evolved

2464
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
but no further details

2465
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
were given on any of these outside

2466
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
of a spotted job listing looking for a

2467
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
combat designer in 2012

2468
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
to be used for next generation

2469
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
hardware. Last year

2470
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Harmonix stopped dropping

2471
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
DLC weekly for Rock Band

2472
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
and went through two waves of

2473
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
layoffs. The only comments

2474
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
provided when asked about

2475
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
changes to their upcoming lineup were

2476
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
responsible for the highest rated Kinect titles

2477
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
for Xbox 360 with our Dance Central

2478
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
franchise and we're very excited

2479
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
by the possibilities of the new motion sensing

2480
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
technology for Xbox One. Right now

2481
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
our Kinect development is focused on the already

2482
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
announced Disney Fantasia Music Evolved

2483
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
a title which we believe further innovates

2484
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
in both the motion gaming and music space

2485
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Nothing else to confirm today other than

2486
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
a heads up that we've got a lot of stuff happening

2487
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
that you'll hear about soon

2488
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
and by soon they probably mean

2489
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
six months from now at E3, five months

2490
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
from now

2491
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
An unknown game gets canned

2492
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Well rest in peace

2493
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
game we never knew you

2494
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I mean but

2495
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
I don't know I

2496
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I'd hate to be all like doom and gloom but I kind of

2497
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
worry about Harmonix like you know the Rock Band

2498
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
bubble kind of burst we haven't really

2499
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
seen a lot from them lately I know there's this

2500
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Fantasia thing which is gonna be a big deal but it's

2501
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
it's still not here and now they're canceling

2502
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
projects we've heard about layoffs like

2503
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
and it's not like Harmonix

2504
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
makes a bunch of stinkers it's just like you know

2505
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
the Rock Band bubble kind of burst like

2506
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
They don't

2507
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
They don't make a bunch of

2508
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
stinkers but I don't think they get the critical acclaim

2509
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
like we would all hope that we would

2510
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
all prefer that they did

2511
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Let's be honest frequency and amplitude were amazing

2512
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
games they weren't exactly the

2513
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
biggest sellers

2514
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
But Rock Band was huge

2515
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Rock Band was an absolute run away

2516
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
And Activision really screwed that whole

2517
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
thing up but anyway it's neither here nor there

2518
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Yeah

2519
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Well good luck with whatever Harmonix

2520
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
is working on maybe they'll be able to

2521
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
blow us away at the next E3

2522
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
We love you Harmonix and we look forward to seeing everything you do

2523
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
for now and

2524
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
as long as you continue to be able to do it

2525
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Which we hope is a very long time

2526
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I somehow doubt that Harmonix's

2527
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
next game would be called Music Saga

2528
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Because

2529
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Thank you

2530
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
I'm bowing

2531
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Because as I'm sure many of you have heard this week

2532
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
King

2533
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Is it king.com or king? I guess they're

2534
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
king and they're located at king.com but anyway

2535
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
This company, you know what they're Zinga2

2536
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I'm gonna call them Zinga2

2537
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Because that's what they are to me Zinga2

2538
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Has decided to

2539
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Trademark the word candy

2540
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
They now

2541
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
And they got it

2542
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
So they basically own the trademark on the word candy

2543
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
When it comes to video games I mean if you want to sell

2544
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Candy in the grocery store that's one thing but you will make a

2545
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Video game with the word candy in it that's another

2546
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
And by the way they also

2547
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Got the word saga

2548
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
So if you want to make a game with the name

2549
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Saga in it you will have to

2550
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Answer to king

2551
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
The makers of the banner saga learned in this the hard way

2552
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
When king sent them a cease and desist

2553
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
In king's defense

2554
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
King came out and said well

2555
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
We're not really like we really

2556
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
We don't really think the banner saga is like

2557
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Trying to infringe on our trademark

2558
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
We have to do this because if we don't

2559
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Defend it then people are gonna come

2560
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Along and you know

2561
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Will lose the trademark and then people

2562
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Will try to make their you know

2563
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Clone games

2564
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
And to be fair

2565
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
On the iOS marketplace and the Google

2566
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Android play market

2567
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
There's a lot of shitty clones

2568
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
To try to ride the success of these games

2569
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
But where do we draw the line people?

2570
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I've even seen those at 3am shitty advertising too

2571
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And you all

2572
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I know you're all sitting there expecting me to say

2573
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
LOL

2574
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Square Enix, Saga Frontier

2575
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
LOL, 7th Saga

2576
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
LOL, Candy was a song

2577
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
In DDR, etc, etc

2578
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I mean yeah I mean it's

2579
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Ridiculous that they own the trademark on

2580
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Those words because

2581
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Especially in the case of Saga

2582
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
There's so many other games

2583
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
That have nothing to do

2584
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
With a game that was ripped off

2585
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Fucking bejeweled in the first place

2586
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Again I'm just keeping it real tonight

2587
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
It's a little silly that when their game is a rip

2588
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Off in the first place they get the

2589
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Right to these words

2590
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I think I

2591
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I played Candy Crush

2592
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
A little bit I couldn't even tell you how much

2593
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I'm pretty sure I thought it was a

2594
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Zynga game and I stopped

2595
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Only for

2596
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Not only for lack of interest but also in the

2597
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
The great Zynga

2598
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
But

2599
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Not petition

2600
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Boycott?

2601
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Thank you the great Zynga boycott of 2013

2602
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And the previous fucking 3 years

2603
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
2 anyways

2604
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
The thing about

2605
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Them saying that they have to go through

2606
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Due process and they don't actually want it to happen

2607
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Is that it doesn't work out that way

2608
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Either they

2609
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Either the

2610
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
The person they charge follows the cease and desist

2611
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
And makes a name change or

2612
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Cans the project out right

2613
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Or the person they charge with it rebukes

2614
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
And King loses the

2615
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Trademark

2616
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Only if they

2617
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
Only if the

2618
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Party doesn't like

2619
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Countersue or whatever the appropriate

2620
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Motion is will the whole

2621
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Process just get settled and dropped

2622
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
But if anybody balks at this

2623
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
They're gonna lose the trademark

2624
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
That's what happens

2625
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
They shouldn't have been given this trademark in the first place

2626
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Oh absolutely, everything else about this

2627
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Is fucking absurd

2628
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
They should have been given the trademark for

2629
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Candy Crush Saga

2630
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Because Candy hasn't

2631
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Existed for I don't even know

2632
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
How many decades

2633
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Candy Land

2634
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
How does

2635
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Who owns the Milton Bradley suite now

2636
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
God they've all changed hands so many times

2637
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Somebody should have a yell it out

2638
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Is it Hasbro?

2639
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
They have every right

2640
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
To make the game Candy Land

2641
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
As a pour on iPhone

2642
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
If they want

2643
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
I fucking double dog dare King

2644
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
To go sue the makers of Candy Land

2645
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Yep

2646
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
And then it'll throw the whole thing

2647
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Honestly what I would like to see happen

2648
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Is Milton Bradley

2649
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Or whatever holdings

2650
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Go after them

2651
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Just to prove a point I would love to see that

2652
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Hasbro you were correct

2653
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I would love to see them prove a point

2654
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Just to go bitch please

2655
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Um

2656
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
You know it's

2657
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Weird though because in a roundabout way

2658
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
It's actually given a lot of additional exposure

2659
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
For Banner Saga which is um you know

2660
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
That's a good thing for them

2661
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
But yeah it's just so ridiculous

2662
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Like those people that are working hard

2663
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Making the Banner Saga they should not have to deal

2664
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
With this fuckery

2665
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
That's the real problem it's a waste

2666
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Of resources

2667
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
This is not their fucking problem

2668
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
It's really gross

2669
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
That they're having to even deal with this

2670
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
The only silver lining is that the entire

2671
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Internet community backs them

2672
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
And so it's a great amount of exposure

2673
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
For their game at least take solace

2674
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
In that a lot of people heard about Banner Saga

2675
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
That wouldn't have heard about it otherwise

2676
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Let's be real

2677
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So that's the positive

2678
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
So what are they going to change it to like Banner story or

2679
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
But here's the other problem with

2680
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Zynga 2

2681
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Is just like the mother ship Zynga

2682
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
They have a history of fucking copying

2683
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Games

2684
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Candy Crush Saga is a copy of

2685
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Jewel Quest

2686
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Which in turn is a copy of Bejeweled

2687
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
So yet they want to prevent

2688
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Other people doing what they did

2689
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Anyway in my opinion

2690
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Allegedly just throwing those words out there

2691
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Just in case

2692
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
But it is on record that King

2693
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Supposedly

2694
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Copied another game

2695
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
And they called it Pack-a-void

2696
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
They tried to go after another developer

2697
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Back in 2009 because they wanted to

2698
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Basically buy their game and put it out

2699
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
But King put out a statement this week

2700
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Because you know Reddit's going to find it

2701
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
4chan and all the internet community people

2702
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
They're going to find it and they're going to bring it to light

2703
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
There'll be a NeoGaf post and then everybody goes

2704
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Yeah take them down, take them down, show King

2705
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Stick it to the man and so forth

2706
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
And that's exactly what happened is that it came out

2707
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
This developer said hey King tried to buy my game

2708
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
In 2009 then they just copied it

2709
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
And put out Pack-a-void instead

2710
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
So King had to put out a statement

2711
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
King does not clone other people's games

2712
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
King believes that IP

2713
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Both our own IP and that of others

2714
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Is important and should be properly protected

2715
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Like any prudent company we take all appropriate steps

2716
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
To protect our IP in a sensible and fair way

2717
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
At the same time we are respectful

2718
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Of the rights and IP of other developers

2719
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Sorry just letting that comment sink in for a minute

2720
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Before we launch any game

2721
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
We do a thorough search of other games

2722
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
In the marketplace as well as review of

2723
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Trademark filings to ensure that we are not

2724
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Infringing anyone else's IP

2725
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
However for the avoidance of doubt in this case

2726
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
The game which was coded by a third party

2727
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Developer five years ago has

2728
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Been taken down

2729
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Let's see I believe

2730
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
What happened is that

2731
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
The developer who made this

2732
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Clone actually

2733
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Came out and said yeah

2734
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
King kind of hired me

2735
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
To do this and I had to do it quickly

2736
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
And I had to get it out before the

2737
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Original game Scamper Ghost was set to be

2738
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Released essentially

2739
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
So

2740
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
What happened is that they came out and said

2741
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
King contracted the third party

2742
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
To make the game he made it at their

2743
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Request to their specifications so King is

2744
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Responsible I'm fairly certain 99%

2745
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Of people everyone except King

2746
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Would agree that Pack Avoid is a clone

2747
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Of Scamper Ghost and that was a statement

2748
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
From Matthew Cox

2749
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Who was the developer who

2750
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Made Scamper Ghost

2751
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Essentially so

2752
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
I mean it's

2753
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Ridiculous that they were given this trademark in the first

2754
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Place

2755
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
The old laws are not

2756
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Working when it comes to intellectual property

2757
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
In this country I'm gonna say

2758
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
In this country a bunch of the laws aren't

2759
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Working when it comes to anything

2760
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Well seriously I think

2761
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Well at least we're not in an all out full blown

2762
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
War I mean there are some things that are

2763
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Working but you're right there's a lot of

2764
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Fucked up shit period

2765
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
There's a lot of broken things that need to just be completely

2766
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Thrown out and revamped

2767
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
No one wants to

2768
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Alright

2769
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Ah

2770
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
There you go

2771
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I think we all agree it's

2772
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Fuckery does anyone want to try

2773
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
To take the devil's advocate position even if I'm having a hard

2774
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Time in this circumstance I mean

2775
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I understand there is a lot of clones

2776
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
There's a lot of people and there's some guy that

2777
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Spoke out that made

2778
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
A game and get a load of this name

2779
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
What was the guy

2780
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
He made a game call and he's been contacted

2781
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
By King's legal team the creator of

2782
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Quote all candy casino

2783
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Slots jewel craze connect

2784
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Big blast mania land

2785
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Yeah that's not SEO bait

2786
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Look girl

2787
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
You're the reason why

2788
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Zynga 2 has

2789
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
This leverage

2790
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
To be like those types

2791
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Of games are the reason why even though

2792
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
A slot machine game may have nothing to do

2793
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
With candy although I'm surprised candy crush

2794
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Saga is not you know rip that off too

2795
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
But

2796
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Like you know even though the the slot

2797
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Machine game may be kind of different let's

2798
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Be real that name is

2799
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Fuck you're fucking baiting people with that name

2800
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
That's why they got that trademark

2801
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Is because of you

2802
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Just think about that for a minute

2803
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
I guess that's as far as the devil's advocate

2804
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Position I can go

2805
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Let's move on let's do something happy

2806
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
I need happy news dark soccer give me some happy news

2807
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
Happy is like me I don't have any

2808
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Oh yeah I do have happy

2809
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Well you know we talked about Ubisoft in

2810
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Part A well how about some more

2811
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Ubisoft news

2812
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
They are going to be adding

2813
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Roughly a hundred

2814
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Jobs for their Quebec

2815
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
City studio

2816
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
They're planning on investing

2817
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
25 million and

2818
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
About 460,000

2819
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Of that is from the government of Quebec

2820
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
That's going to strengthen

2821
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
The company's infrastructure

2822
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
So they

2823
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Are they already have about

2824
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
360 employees and they're going to be

2825
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Bringing on about another hundred so

2826
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Yay for boosting

2827
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Canada's job market

2828
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Because they've been hit hard too

2829
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Right yeah so I

2830
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Just think when we have a story about that there's jobs

2831
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Being added as opposed to taken away that's a good thing

2832
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
That's good news

2833
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Like hearing that so congrats

2834
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
To Ubisoft that means things are going well over there

2835
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Indeed

2836
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
And you know I

2837
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I honestly hope to see

2838
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I mean clearly Ubisoft

2839
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Is running kind of you know

2840
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Strongly right now so I'd like to see what

2841
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
You know the spells for the future

2842
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
I'd like to see you try to say you don't have the resources

2843
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
To port things to Wii U

2844
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Yeah

2845
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Oh burn

2846
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Had to

2847
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Alright Jason what do you got

2848
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Minecraft's sales have exceeded

2849
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
One million in just

2850
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
A month

2851
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
It's first month of life on the PS3

2852
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Um

2853
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Since its release

2854
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
As an overall recap since its release

2855
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Eleven million units of the PC version

2856
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
Have been sold as of last June

2857
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
So even that figure is

2858
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Probably pretty grossly out of date

2859
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
At this point

2860
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
The Xbox 360 version has another

2861
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Ten million sales

2862
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Ten million players which I think

2863
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Is a bit of a misnomer

2864
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
Attached to sales but at any rate

2865
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
The Xbox 360 version has another

2866
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Ten million players

2867
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Has another ten million

2868
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Players joining that number

2869
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
There's a lot of people that own both or all three

2870
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Like I own the 360 version and the PC version

2871
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
But Notch still says that it ain't gonna make it

2872
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
To the Wii U

2873
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
So we continue to cry

2874
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
But eleven plus ten plus one and invariably

2875
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I would throw out very

2876
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Like another four million or something like that

2877
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Just PC sales alone

2878
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Not half bad for the

2879
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
For the survival

2880
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Blocky create everything

2881
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Yourself kind of adventure

2882
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I'm looking forward to seeing those crisp

2883
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Graphics on the Playstation 4 when that

2884
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Version is released

2885
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Pixel art like you wouldn't believe

2886
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
It'll look exactly the same

2887
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Of course that was a joke

2888
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Well I would imagine some of those limitations

2889
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
When it comes to you know the space you have to work with

2890
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
And so forth like that's gonna change but

2891
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I was reading something I don't know if this

2892
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Translates to the console versions

2893
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
I'll save I need I wanna

2894
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Read more about it I'll save it till the end of the show

2895
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Okay good sales for the PS3

2896
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
It's gonna be a powerful source again

2897
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Powerful force against the PC and Xbox as well

2898
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Ummm

2899
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
You think it's not

2900
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Gonna jump up to the double digit millions?

2901
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Oh on the Playstation 3 and 4

2902
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
The only reason it wouldn't is because

2903
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
I think most people that are interested in it

2904
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Have already bought it on PC or Xbox 360

2905
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
But I mean don't

2906
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Underestimate what a huge flipping game

2907
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
Minecraft is I am always surprised

2908
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I think I talked about this in a prior week but I overheard

2909
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
One of my co-workers talking

2910
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Like you know the middle-aged

2911
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Ladies that I work with one of them was talking about how

2912
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
She was playing Minecraft got addicted to it over the holiday

2913
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
And like not the type of gal

2914
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I usually expect to be playing video games when I heard

2915
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
She was playing Minecraft I was kinda like that's kinda rad

2916
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
She was talking about the creepers and you know

2917
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Trying to dodge and she's like you gotta build houses

2918
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I was explaining it to another person you gotta build these houses

2919
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
And stay away I was

2920
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
You know this game is huge

2921
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I was actually gonna wear a different shirt tonight

2922
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
But the fact that I had this on

2923
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Is pretty coincidental

2924
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Two three weeks ago

2925
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
I was at Wells Fargo

2926
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
And the lady that I was working with

2927
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Asked me about my shirt

2928
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
I'm wearing

2929
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
If anybody has checked out the

2930
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
GitHub shop I'm not gonna go too crazy with it

2931
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
But GitHub has a bunch of themed shirts

2932
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
The shirt that I'm wearing right now

2933
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Is a pixel art version

2934
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Of the Octocat

2935
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
The GitHub mascot and it's in a

2936
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
8-bit pixelated version

2937
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
And so the person that I'm working with

2938
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Sees this and she's asking me

2939
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
If it's Minecraft and I had to kinda

2940
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
I had to kinda dance around the issue

2941
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Because I was like

2942
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
It's that kind of a style

2943
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
It doesn't have anything to do with Minecraft

2944
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
But they were both inspired from the same thing

2945
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
And you know

2946
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Of all of the things that

2947
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
8-bit would mean something to someone

2948
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
The fact that Minecraft

2949
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Can kind of be that common

2950
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Thread of understanding

2951
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Is reasonably interesting

2952
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
And to notch

2953
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
And to notch's credit

2954
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
It is very

2955
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Obvious, very definitive

2956
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
And it is very well done

2957
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
When you're seeing Minecraft stuff at Walmart

2958
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Yeah right?

2959
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Yeah

2960
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
That says a lot right there

2961
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Well I don't go to Walmart

2962
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
But that's the course that Angry Birds took

2963
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
So yes, I agree with that statement completely

2964
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
I don't like to give them my business

2965
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
But I was there helping Becky

2966
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Find stuff for her son for Christmas

2967
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
That's fair

2968
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I ended up there too for something

2969
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
It was the one place in town

2970
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
That supposedly had a Playstation 4 camera

2971
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Because I've been trying to get that one

2972
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Oh my god, it is impossible

2973
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Sorry for the tangent train

2974
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
It is fucking impossible to find a Playstation 4 camera

2975
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
They are all gone

2976
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
I was on a tip

2977
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
On Twitter, I went to Fries.com

2978
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
To order a

2979
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Playstation camera which they said would ship

2980
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
January 26th

2981
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
And I was like, alright, I'll wait the week, whatever

2982
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
So I placed the order, you know, 70 bucks or whatever

2983
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
New update, 2015

2984
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
No, I get an email, we're sorry

2985
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
We're not going to be able to ship on the day

2986
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
We'll hold your pre-order if you want to cancel

2987
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Call such and such a number

2988
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I was kind of irritated

2989
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Why did you advertise something you knew you couldn't

2990
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Uphold?

2991
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
I was a little irritated at that

2992
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Anyhow

2993
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I mean, I don't need it

2994
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I want it for broadcasting

2995
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
That would be fun and doing other things

2996
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
But it's not changing my opinion

2997
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
It's a little frustrating

2998
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
They're so flipping hard to find

2999
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Anyhow, let's talk about something that will be

3000
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Maybe a little easier to find

3001
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
When it comes out

3002
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Sanity?

3003
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Sanity 2? This game is

3004
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Slightly punishing

3005
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Some people see it as, you know, it's like

3006
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
The Dark Souls of 2D platformers

3007
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
But anyhow

3008
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
They first announced the

3009
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Sequel for WiiWare and PC

3010
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
And now they're going to raise

3011
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
$200,000 to try to get this

3012
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
It looks like it will probably, actually I'm kind of

3013
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Curious where they're at right now

3014
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
120, nope, go away

3015
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
127,000, 26 days to go

3016
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
26 days to go

3017
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
So four days they've already

3018
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Comfortable funding

3019
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
Now that I've mentioned it here

3020
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
They'll get another 100,000

3021
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
But anyway

3022
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
Yeah, if you like

3023
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
The retro adventure games

3024
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
You're going to get a kick out of this

3025
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
For $15 you get

3026
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
The Steam and DRM free copy

3027
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
Of the game on release

3028
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
So it's basically pre-ordering a game that will be done in a year

3029
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
If they get certain stretch goals

3030
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
They're looking at 3DS and Vita versions

3031
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
At 1.15 million

3032
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Wii U, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

3033
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Versions at 1.65 million

3034
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

3035
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
At 2.35 million

3036
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
Those stretch goals are quote

3037
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Subject to negotiation

3038
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
Be interesting to see how that goes

3039
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
So yeah

3040
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Pretty cool

3041
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Fans of La Mulana like Dark Tetsuya

3042
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I know are very happy about that

3043
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Alright

3044
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Pretty happy to see it's a new character too

3045
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Sugi, fun stuff

3046
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
This game is really

3047
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
In the same vein of everything that we've talked about before

3048
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
This game is so incredibly

3049
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Meticulous as well

3050
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
From when it was originally released in 20

3051
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Shit

3052
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Before 2010 it was originally like

3053
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
2007

3054
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Or so

3055
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
And the PC remake

3056
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
That they made is

3057
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
The Wii version was rather tame

3058
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
But the PC remake that was released last year

3059
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Or 2012 I can't recall

3060
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I remember the Wii one was delayed

3061
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Dramatically improved

3062
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
And yet another game with a storied history

3063
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Of something that has just been

3064
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Refined and refined and refined

3065
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
For the better

3066
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
And now they're continuing forward with new content

3067
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Perfect, wonderful

3068
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Alright

3069
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Well let's look at the wonderful content that sits inside our mailbag

3070
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Mailbag at

3071
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails

3072
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
Every week Dark Sakura dives in the

3073
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Mailbag head first

3074
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
And pulls out a couple emails that she

3075
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Believes are worthy of repeating

3076
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Here on this program

3077
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
How many emails do we have tonight? Three

3078
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Three emails

3079
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
I haven't checked for anything else and I'm only going to read these three

3080
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Probably just a bunch of spam

3081
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Howdy gang stars

3082
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Howdy

3083
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
I'd like to expand on the thoughts that I tried to express

3084
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
In the FUGL question of the week from last week

3085
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
I was unable to do so due to the confines of an outdated

3086
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Artform that only exists in the modern world

3087
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
For the purposes of nostalgia

3088
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
QQ more

3089
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Also known as Haikus

3090
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Haikus

3091
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
For people who didn't catch that

3092
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Like I didn't catch that mic

3093
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Just now

3094
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
By the way Haiku is not outdated

3095
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
It is still in use

3096
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Nintendo has a unique place in the marketplace

3097
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
But only

3098
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
But one only also held by Sony and Microsoft

3099
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
In addition to being a video game developer

3100
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Nintendo is

3101
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
As is well known a console creator

3102
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
While their role as a video game developer

3103
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Allows them to be much more unique

3104
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
In how they approach the market

3105
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Nintendo's role as a console creator is much different

3106
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
In that role Nintendo must not

3107
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Offer a product

3108
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
That is tailored for any specific use

3109
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
Or function

3110
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
They must instead provide a product that allows for

3111
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
A wide variance

3112
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Of products and services

3113
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
A narrow focus on specific tasks

3114
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
And function serves to only limit

3115
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
The products the company other than Nintendo

3116
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Can utilize on their console

3117
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
If not incentivize companies

3118
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
To avoid the console altogether

3119
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
For that reason

3120
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
Nintendo should work to broaden the kinds of products

3121
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
And services

3122
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
That companies other than Nintendo can put on their

3123
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Current console the Wii U

3124
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
One of the ways they can do this is by providing

3125
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
A decent stable and safe online environment

3126
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
That can be utilized through the Wii U

3127
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
And I need to renew my chat room

3128
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Because it's not working

3129
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Where was I?

3130
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
It doesn't have to be a robust service

3131
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Like Xbox Live or PSN

3132
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
I help my nieces spend hours a day

3133
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Playing games on the Disney website

3134
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
They don't have to sign in or provide any

3135
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Information in order to play

3136
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
My nieces can just call up the Disney games website

3137
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Click on whatever particular game they want to play

3138
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
And enjoy

3139
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Perhaps Nintendo could come up with something like that

3140
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Also boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, additionally boobs

3141
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Stay black, Redertainment

3142
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
For history's sake

3143
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
January

3144
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
No, January

3145
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
19th

3146
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Last week's

3147
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Fugu question of the week

3148
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Redertainment's haiku was

3149
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Create a better platform

3150
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
For online gaming

3151
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Also boobs, boobs, boobs

3152
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
At least his email

3153
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
His email did truly expand on that

3154
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Because he added more boobs

3155
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
No

3156
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
I don't necessarily disagree with what he's saying

3157
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
At all

3158
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
They've got to figure out how to get those third parties back

3159
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
The thing about

3160
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
The very last point about

3161
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Creating a safe environment

3162
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Is what the definition

3163
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Of a safe environment

3164
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Is going to be

3165
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
What you just described

3166
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Your nieces being able to go on Disney and play games

3167
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I don't know this for certain

3168
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
But I'm pretty damn sure that yes

3169
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Games become available just like

3170
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Getting a disc into the Wii U

3171
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
Or downloading something from the shop and going to it

3172
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
That's an online environment

3173
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Kind of

3174
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Super Mario 3D World and the Miis

3175
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Gravitating around

3176
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
That is an online environment

3177
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
That those online aspects come into your game

3178
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Xbox

3179
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Microsoft and Sony provide a

3180
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Robust messaging and communication system

3181
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Alongside matchmaking

3182
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Multiplayer, etc, etc, games

3183
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Um

3184
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
As soon as you allow

3185
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Two people to communicate

3186
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
It is inherently unsafe

3187
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Period, that's why every single game has

3188
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Online interactions not rated by the ESRB

3189
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Because people will say

3190
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Type, gesture, do whatever

3191
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
They can possibly do

3192
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Based off whatever they want to do

3193
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Indeed true

3194
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
So it's difficult, that's all I'm saying

3195
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
It's quite difficult

3196
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Yes, let's

3197
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
But thank you for the email, it's very

3198
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Very pointed considering the

3199
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Lengths of the debate we went to last week

3200
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Thank you and I agree with the boobs

3201
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Seconded

3202
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
This email comes from Andy R

3203
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Hey OLR

3204
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
First time writers who forgive me for any

3205
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
Grammar mistakes, okay

3206
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Just wanted to say that I agree with Jason

3207
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
About the Wii quote failing

3208
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
As a game console, it didn't succeed

3209
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
On the strength of its library at first

3210
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
It succeeded at being

3211
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
The Tickle Me Elmo of Insert Year Wii

3212
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Came out

3213
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Even my parents bought one and there's no way

3214
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
They would have bought any other video game console

3215
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
It was a runaway success because

3216
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
It managed to strike a chord

3217
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
With a casual crowd who tend to be more

3218
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Fickle about what catches on and what doesn't

3219
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
Wii U has failed to capture

3220
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
That market again, myriad of reasons

3221
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
In my opinion

3222
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
And I don't think it ever will at this

3223
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Rate, it's now the more hardcore gamer

3224
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Crowd feels scorned after

3225
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
How the Wii was largely marketed

3226
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
To a different crowd

3227
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Anyway, just my two cents, I don't think Nintendo

3228
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Is necessarily in dire straights

3229
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Mario Kart and Smash

3230
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Still have a chance to turn things around

3231
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
And at least get the gamer crowd back

3232
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
On board, they'll keep cranking out

3233
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Their first party games and I think they'll be

3234
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Fine by the end of the generation

3235
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Can I just, I just want to say real quick

3236
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
While you cough up a storm there, the whole

3237
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Tickle Me Elmo comparison, like I

3238
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Get that angle, like the Wii was kind of like

3239
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
The hot thing that year, so like I get the position

3240
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
There, but could you kind of say the same thing about

3241
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
The Xbox One and the Playstation 4 this year?

3242
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Nope. Why?

3243
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Because what's the

3244
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
There was nothing really to rival

3245
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Sorry, there was nothing really to rival the Tickle Me Elmo

3246
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
When it came out, I'm just saying

3247
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
In terms of that type of toy and things that

3248
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Had that much hype, but now we've got

3249
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
First of all, direct competitors

3250
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
So there's two of them

3251
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Offering comparable deals

3252
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
And each with their dedicated fanbases

3253
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
It's really

3254
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
An

3255
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
It's like

3256
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Comparing

3257
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Apples and oranges

3258
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
To a

3259
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
A potato

3260
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Well, but

3261
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
To be fair, the Wii and the Playstation 3

3262
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Came out the same year, yet the

3263
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Wii dominated the conversation based off

3264
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
The strength of Wii Sports and the other launch titles

3265
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
This generation's consoles are still on the shelves

3266
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Maybe not so much the PS4

3267
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Because of stock for the overseas

3268
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
For the overseas launch

3269
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
But this is exactly the point that I was trying to make

3270
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Is that the Wii was gone

3271
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
For so long

3272
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Yeah, you could pre-order

3273
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
You'll get stock when you get it

3274
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Like the 360 had been the year before?

3275
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Gotcha

3276
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
It's really hard for me

3277
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
To have a mental

3278
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
A particular map of this

3279
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Because I've been a latecomer to every single console

3280
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I've never done it on launch day

3281
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I've never tried to get it on launch day

3282
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Failed and had to

3283
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
Continue to follow up to actually

3284
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Take physical stock

3285
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Of when this stuff is available

3286
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Yeah, they work out

3287
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Supply issues

3288
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
They ramp up, people buy them with less frequency

3289
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
And they start to show up again

3290
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Jamie just made the point

3291
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
That their dedicated camps

3292
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Are responsible for these

3293
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Millions of sales in the first month

3294
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Yep

3295
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
100% true

3296
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
But the Wii persisted

3297
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
The Wii was the perfect storm

3298
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Because it had this huge up front

3299
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Rush that had an incredibly

3300
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Long tail and incredibly long wind down

3301
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
And

3302
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Something I came up with

3303
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Listening to last week's episode again

3304
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
They had good

3305
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Late

3306
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Late life releases

3307
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Galaxy was absolutely phenomenal

3308
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Uh

3309
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
Fucking

3310
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Every single Wii game

3311
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
I have on the shelf literally just

3312
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Erased from my mind

3313
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Nintendo had a good late life library

3314
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Which is

3315
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Stereotypically Nintendo

3316
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
These releases keep going the entire time

3317
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Which only boosted its numbers

3318
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
But that initial surge of

3319
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Everything

3320
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Was all because of a new audiences

3321
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
And Wii Sports

3322
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
Carried over to Wii Fit

3323
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Let's move on with the rest of the email

3324
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Oh yeah we didn't finish that did we

3325
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
No we did not

3326
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Also quickly on the topic of the Magic the Gathering movie

3327
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
You guys were comparing it to Battleship

3328
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Or Clue or other board games

3329
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
But there's already a strong narrative in the game

3330
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
There have been a ton of books and comics that flesh out the story

3331
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
And they've even got an entire team devoted to making sure

3332
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
That all the properties stay true to the world

3333
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
That game has created

3334
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Pausing here

3335
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
I did read a lot of the Magic the Gathering comics

3336
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
When I was really into playing it

3337
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
And

3338
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I just

3339
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Wasn't that interested in the backstory

3340
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
It was just a fun game to play

3341
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Piggybacking on your pause here

3342
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
I get the whole

3343
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
It's not Battleship or Clue

3344
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Okay I get that angle

3345
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
I kind of think about Dungeons and Dragons

3346
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
Obviously there's a very rich story there

3347
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
There's the books and everything else

3348
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
And then the movie came out and it was kind of

3349
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
This crap

3350
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
And I wanted to like it because Tom Baker was in it

3351
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
And a lot of times those books

3352
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
And everything else they kind of get ignored

3353
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
I mean the World of Warcraft movie is going to

3354
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Face this problem, you know how much of the books

3355
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Is it really going to pay attention to it

3356
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
There is a rich story

3357
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
For the Warcraft stuff too

3358
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Star Trek and Star Wars, this new Star Wars

3359
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Movies, it ain't going to follow any of the books

3360
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Well they already said that the books are pretty much

3361
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Now Apocrypha

3362
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
To finish this up

3363
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Almost all the blocks

3364
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Magic term for three consecutive

3365
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Expansions tell a story

3366
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
And while it can be tough to figure

3367
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
That out just through individual cards

3368
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
It is there

3369
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Just pointing it out because I doubt this will be like

3370
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
A Yu-Gi-Oh type thing

3371
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
And definitely not something like Battleship

3372
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
I know we're being cynical

3373
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Because a lot of video game movies turn out like garbage

3374
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
I think it would be awesome if the movie

3375
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Turns out really well

3376
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Like if they can actually pull it off

3377
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
It would need a freaking Lord of the Rings treatment

3378
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
To make it good

3379
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Honestly

3380
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
What does that say about all the negative critique

3381
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Of The Hobbit though

3382
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Yeah but then again

3383
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
The Hobbit is a children's book

3384
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
Therefore it was actually

3385
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
A relatively short story

3386
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Did not need

3387
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Stuff pulled from

3388
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
The side books and short stories

3389
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
And every other little doodle

3390
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Tolkien happened to put on paper

3391
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
It needed to be one fucking movie

3392
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
I love this comment from Bobby in the chat room

3393
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Land will be tapped in a theater near you

3394
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Love it

3395
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
I get it

3396
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
I just keep having flashbacks

3397
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Of how many hours of my life I wasted

3398
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Playing Magic

3399
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Finally Rob

3400
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Why so much hate for the non indie podcast

3401
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I listen to a ton of podcasts each week

3402
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Some indie and some not

3403
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Even the ones that are affiliated with the company

3404
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
I listen to people who love video games

3405
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
And talk about video games

3406
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Thanks and keep up the podcast

3407
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
As Andrew are

3408
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Thanks for asking that actually

3409
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
So I can kind of set the record straight

3410
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
On some things here

3411
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Hate is a strong word

3412
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Hate is a very strong word

3413
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
I don't hate non indie podcasts

3414
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I don't hate them

3415
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I really like to support indie podcasts

3416
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
And my fellow people that go out there

3417
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
And really work their butts off

3418
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Because indie podcasters

3419
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Have to work ten times as hard

3420
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
To achieve something that

3421
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
A corporate backed podcast

3422
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Can achieve very easily

3423
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Whether the quality be good or not

3424
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
And that's just the way it is

3425
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I'm not saying that out of a jealousy thing

3426
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
But it really irks me in the indie scene

3427
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
When I see people

3428
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Striking each other down

3429
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Why are you fighting with each other

3430
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
And having these silly little wars

3431
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
When we have to fight

3432
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
There's so much to get noticed anyway

3433
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Amongst these corporate backed things

3434
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
And look to the story we talked about earlier

3435
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
With the whole

3436
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Paying off

3437
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Paying for the plugs

3438
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Product placement and so forth

3439
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
It kind of gets into some of the other things

3440
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
You really have to consider are a factor

3441
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
When you talk about corporate games

3442
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Does that mean all the people

3443
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
That work for these corporate companies

3444
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
And work for corporate podcasts are shrills

3445
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
No no no

3446
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
That really pursued their passion

3447
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
They do it for a living, I applaud them

3448
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
There's a lot of very talented people that do

3449
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Happen to do it for a living

3450
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
I don't necessarily need to be

3451
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Plugging them because they've got their audience

3452
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
They're easy to find, you know where to look

3453
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
But I will say

3454
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Again, having a night where I'm just going to

3455
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Tell it like it is, there are also

3456
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Some people out there in the industry

3457
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
That are doing these shows

3458
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
That don't have that level of passion

3459
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
On some shows

3460
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
That's been very obvious to me

3461
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
As a listener, maybe I'm just

3462
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Old or picky, I don't know

3463
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I definitely have heard those corporate based

3464
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Podcasts where somebody was only there

3465
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Because they had to be

3466
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
And that just

3467
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
When we

3468
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Put so much effort into this

3469
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
And do it for nothing

3470
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
That really stings sometimes

3471
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
When you hear people talking up

3472
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
This particular podcast where people plainly

3473
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
And obviously don't want to be there

3474
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
That's the really tricky part

3475
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
However, granted, that is the minority

3476
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
So

3477
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
I think that's great that you have your shows

3478
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
That you support and listen to

3479
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
And there are some great corporate based shows

3480
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Out there, but I just

3481
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
I choose to support those that have to

3482
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Work a little bit harder to get noticed

3483
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
I would add to that that

3484
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
The situation is getting

3485
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
A bit more diverse and by the same token

3486
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
A little bit muddier because

3487
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
The rise of YouTube and

3488
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
It's the same story over and over and over again

3489
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
You affiliate, you partner, you whatever

3490
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
But these

3491
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
You know, corporate backed

3492
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Networks that

3493
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Pick up individual

3494
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
I don't quite know the business

3495
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Details of it, but corporations

3496
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
That pick up

3497
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Indie producers

3498
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Because their content is

3499
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Engaging and they have an established base

3500
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
And they

3501
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Do so so that they can provide

3502
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Um

3503
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
So that the

3504
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Said originally

3505
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Indie can start doing things

3506
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
For the company, for the corporation

3507
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
But it also

3508
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
The theory is that it's a two way street

3509
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
The individual is able to

3510
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Continue doing what they're doing

3511
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Take on additional responsibilities with the company

3512
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
But also do events

3513
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
Personally taking advantage of company

3514
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Resources

3515
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
And also literally

3516
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Legal protection, YouTube fuckery

3517
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
To some extent, that kind of thing

3518
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
There's a lot of interesting

3519
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Indie organized

3520
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Networks on YouTube

3521
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
And various other locations right now

3522
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
And it's

3523
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
It is really hard

3524
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
To figure out

3525
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
On what side of the coin

3526
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
These people lie

3527
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Sometimes

3528
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
But the point is that

3529
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Be there for the content that you enjoy

3530
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
And that you can tell the people enjoy as well

3531
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
That means, that probably means

3532
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
You're having a good time listening to it

3533
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
It's really the whole point

3534
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
There are some people out there very passionate about

3535
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Games who are gamers and

3536
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Are very good at what they do

3537
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
And have a lot of good things to say

3538
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Unfortunately, not everybody's in the game industry for those reasons

3539
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
And that's a harsh reality

3540
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
That

3541
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
You know, you'll find out for yourself

3542
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
If you go to some of these press events

3543
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
And see it first hand

3544
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
That's all I'm going to say

3545
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
That individual lives in Arizona

3546
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Or did by the area code

3547
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Thank you Andrew

3548
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Well, last email

3549
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Give away his home address while you're at it Jason, jeez

3550
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Well that's not in the email

3551
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I would if I, no no no

3552
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
I did want to say thank you for the email

3553
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Because the beginning said it was a first time emailer

3554
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
So I love those whole long time listener first time callers

3555
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
First time writers?

3556
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
And your grammar was excellent

3557
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
What's up gang?

3558
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
So funny enough

3559
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
I just got done posting

3560
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
On the Frugal Question

3561
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
And my email is kinda sorta about the same thing

3562
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I'm playing through Devil May Cry

3563
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
The 2013 one

3564
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
And I've come to realize

3565
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I love the raw gritty and cocky new Dante

3566
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
And the game itself as a whole

3567
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I was wondering what your thoughts were on the game

3568
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Haven't played it, that's just me

3569
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I remember when the game released

3570
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
And it was, cool topic of the month

3571
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Was to hate the new Dante

3572
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Do you think that gaming in this generation

3573
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Has an unfair advantage

3574
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Due to the internet negativity

3575
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I remember when the only gaming news

3576
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I would get was just for magazines

3577
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Oh well I guess we were just getting old

3578
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
It was a P

3579
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
I have to admit I have not

3580
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Played the new Devil May Cry

3581
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
It went cheap on Steam, I was thinking about buying it

3582
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
It's free on Playstation Plus right now actually

3583
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Let me, he's gonna hate me

3584
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Alan!

3585
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Alan! Help!

3586
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Help me!

3587
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Cause he has played it

3588
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Can you hear us in there?

3589
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
Do you know what we're talking about?

3590
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
We're talking about the new Devil May Cry game

3591
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
And none of us have played it

3592
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
But I know you have played it

3593
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
And what did the emailer want to know about the Dante

3594
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
First question was

3595
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
I wonder what your thoughts were on the game

3596
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
And he said that he liked the new Dante

3597
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
It has

3598
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
Like

3599
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Everything is super edgy

3600
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
And grim dark

3601
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
And the new Dante

3602
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Drops the F bomb a lot

3603
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
And it's very try hard in that regard

3604
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
But as far as the play style

3605
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Like the art direction

3606
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
And the settings, I really enjoy that

3607
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
The new Dante, he's cute

3608
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
I mean you get to see him naked

3609
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
I'm downloading this

3610
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I don't care

3611
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I will say it does do a very good job

3612
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
At bringing a quality to, well you know somewhat

3613
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
To objectifying the man

3614
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
I would like to see him objectify some more

3615
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
And

3616
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
There on the PC version

3617
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
There are mods, not nude mods

3618
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Damn!

3619
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
But I think there's a shirtless mod

3620
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
How do you know about this stuff you perv?

3621
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Cause when I got it on Steam for like

3622
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
17 cents, I googled Devil May Cry mods

3623
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
And there's a site for it

3624
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
I think you might have googled

3625
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
More specifically than that

3626
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Just saying!

3627
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
I think a lot of the original franchise

3628
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Devil May Cry fans are upset

3629
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
About the reboot

3630
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
It's because there was no real resolution

3631
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
To the original franchise

3632
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
The new Dante is a lot

3633
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
He's different from the original one

3634
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
In kind of shitty ways

3635
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
So there's some anger there

3636
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
It's a fun game

3637
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Thank you for letting me pick on you, appreciate it

3638
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
I just like that the whole Devil May Cry thing

3639
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Actually came from a Resident Evil

3640
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Type thing

3641
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
My last experience with Devil May Cry

3642
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Was playing Devil May Cry 3

3643
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Failing so hard

3644
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
That I unlocked easy mode

3645
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
And I have not played another one since

3646
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Not because

3647
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Not out of personal scorn or anything like that

3648
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
But because I didn't get a PS3

3649
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
For two or three years

3650
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
And still to this day

3651
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
My PS3 library is

3652
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Literally nothing compared to the 360

3653
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Devil May Cry 4

3654
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Eventually came out on the 360

3655
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
But not until after it's PS3

3656
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Oh my god, it's still 50 bucks on Steam

3657
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
It's free right now on PS3

3658
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Yeah, but I don't

3659
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
I don't play my consoles

3660
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
My hand hurts

3661
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
At any rate, PlayStation Plus

3662
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
I picked it up

3663
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
I will definitely pick this series back up

3664
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I don't know, I've loved this series

3665
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
I don't remember much of the second one

3666
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
But I'm sure I enjoyed it

3667
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
I definitely love this kind of play style

3668
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Terrible at it, obviously

3669
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Easy mode

3670
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
But I now have Devil May Cry reboot

3671
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
And I'll pick it up

3672
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
As soon as the opportunity presents itself

3673
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
But it's in my library

3674
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
So I can, in theory, do that

3675
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Whenever I want

3676
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Yeah, whatever

3677
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
I'm paying 50 bucks for it

3678
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
There'll be an Uber sale soon enough

3679
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Oh, there was more to that email

3680
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Yeah, Rob, geez

3681
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
PS, on a side note

3682
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
I just finished Brothers A Tale of Two Sons earlier this week

3683
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
If you've not played this game, pour yourself a nice glass of wine

3684
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Sit down and prepare to play

3685
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
One of the most beautiful games you will ever play

3686
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
It is three hours of an amazing score

3687
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Gorgeous graphics

3688
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
And one hell of a memorable story

3689
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Congrats, Loki, on the new edition

3690
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
And that comes from Travis

3691
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Not our Travis D, but a Travis H

3692
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
The same one that we answered on Google earlier, right?

3693
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Yes

3694
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Thank you for the email, Travis, appreciate it

3695
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
And another recommendation

3696
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
For Brother A Tale of Two Sons

3697
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Yeah, but oddly enough

3698
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
His name just like sent a song

3699
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Sailing through my head

3700
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Because for the moment I first read his name

3701
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
I actually read Trevor

3702
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
So now I have the magical Trevor song stuck in my head

3703
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
So thank you, Travis

3704
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Alright, thank you to all our emailers

3705
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Mailbag at orangesontrated.com

3706
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
This is the place to send your thoughts for a future episode

3707
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Alright, in the meantime

3708
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
We got to get to our FUs of the Week

3709
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Let's do it

3710
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Why do we do the FUs of the Week?

3711
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Because we're mad and stuff

3712
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
This is bad

3713
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
This is justice

3714
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
This is punishment

3715
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
This is fucked up

3716
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
FU to free pastries that I can't eat

3717
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
That's it

3718
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
It's tragic

3719
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
It is tragic

3720
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Because I'm being a good girl

3721
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
My FU goes to not knowing when to say when

3722
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Jason

3723
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I don't know

3724
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
I don't know

3725
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
I don't know

3726
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Jason

3727
02:42:53,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Is this the part where I kill the pity party by saying that because San Francisco is kind of sort of vacation for me

3728
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
For a month vacation

3729
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Since it's vacation for me I relax my diet a little bit

3730
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
And then I'm gonna do this kind of stuff

3731
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Be more serious about this stuff when I get back home

3732
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
No, FU to being sick

3733
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:15,000
It actually impacted this week a hell of a lot harder

3734
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:19,000
This week was gonna be really important to me

3735
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
And it still was a lot of shit

3736
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
A lot of productive shit happened

3737
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:29,000
But I had a really bad feeling about it going into Friday

3738
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:37,000
I was having trouble staying awake during the day every single day this week

3739
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:42,000
And then me and a bunch of coworkers go out for a nice time on Thursday night

3740
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
And I get back into my hotel room

3741
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
I'm more or less fine

3742
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Friday hits and I'm just destroyed

3743
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:52,000
And so were about 20 other coworkers of mine

3744
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,000
Probably even more than that that I haven't seen or talked to to actually know the final numbers

3745
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
FU to being sick

3746
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
FU to being miserable

3747
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:04,000
FU to the kind of sickness that doesn't let you sleep laying down

3748
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Sitting up to sleep does not work so well

3749
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Thankfully I'm basically over it

3750
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
FU to somebody else who may have gotten me sick

3751
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Maybe, not really

3752
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
There was another one

3753
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I've said this probably for the last two to three weeks

3754
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
FU to sleep schedules

3755
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:25,000
I'm gonna be up all night tonight of my own doing because I'm like that

3756
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Finishing off 536 because I don't want to get in a rut of being behind YouTube videos

3757
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:38,000
FU to having to catch up and having to sleep and having obligations and everything else

3758
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Sorry to hear you, well I was sick too

3759
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
I should have given a nephew to being sick myself

3760
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
But luckily it didn't last long

3761
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
That's the good news

3762
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Basically better yesterday and then today I woke up

3763
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I felt pretty damn good this morning

3764
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
And that's the best part about being sick

3765
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:00,000
Even though I couldn't do too terribly much to recover

3766
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:05,000
As soon as I did, oh my god, it was so rejuvenating

3767
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

3768
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR

3769
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3770
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
That's all one word, OrangeLoungeRadio

3771
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
But not just yet, we're gonna first do just a couple more stories here for you

3772
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Before we open that up

3773
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Bethesda has announced last Thursday the members of the VoiceOver cast

3774
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,000
That will be working on The Elder Scrolls Online

3775
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Which is due to come out three days after April Fool's Day

3776
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Why did I read it that way? I don't know

3777
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:35,000
I felt like it

3778
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Everybody knows what day April Fool's Day is

3779
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
And if you don't, well

3780
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:42,000
You'll find out what, you'll find out when it happens

3781
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:45,000
The cast members as announced

3782
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:48,000
I'm just gonna go, I'll do it all

3783
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
John Cleese as Cadwell

3784
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
The cheery and endearingly mad lost soul who is not afraid of anyone

3785
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Bill Nighy, High King Emmerich

3786
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:00,000
A merchant prince whose determination won him the throne

3787
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,000
Kate Beckinsale, Queen Iryn

3788
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Leader of the Ald...

3789
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:08,000
Man, I'm very good at pronouncing these, aren't I?

3790
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Leader of the Aldmeri

3791
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:13,000
There's some real garbage words in The Elder Scrolls

3792
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
They're classical

3793
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Leader of the Aldmeri Dominion and Queen of the High Elves

3794
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Alfred Molina as Abner Tharn

3795
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:26,000
A wily old wizard who is head of the Empire's Elder Council

3796
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Linda Carter as Azura

3797
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:33,000
The Daedric Princess from Skyrim who is a popular part of the lore

3798
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
Fuck yes Wonder Woman

3799
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
These are, these are, these are

3800
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
A celebrity cast exactly as they said

3801
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
Michael Gambon, The Prophet

3802
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:44,000
A blind man who guides the player through their journey

3803
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
Can we talk about this?

3804
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
I get it, mystical history and all that kind of shit

3805
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
But a blind man who guides the player through their journey

3806
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Come on!

3807
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Sorry

3808
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
I don't understand, what's the...

3809
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
A blind man who guides people

3810
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Well, why not?

3811
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I'm in one of those moods

3812
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Malcolm McDowell as

3813
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:11,000
You think it's fine? What about, like you see the blind fighters

3814
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:14,000
Yeah, it's possible

3815
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
There's the stories, people, echolocation

3816
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
I've even heard of blind people riding a bike

3817
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
I get it, I don't know

3818
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
We've got blind people who listen to the show

3819
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
And do the video game

3820
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:28,000
Like the crazy video game clears

3821
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Like on Killer Instinct and stuff

3822
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
I'm trying to think of the games that are out there

3823
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Where they do everything

3824
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
It's so impressive

3825
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
Okay, I'm being an idiot, I accept that argument

3826
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
I don't know, something about these descriptions

3827
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
Something about these descriptions

3828
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
The way they worded it

3829
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
The way they worded it

3830
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
They worded it, they got to you

3831
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
Malcolm McDowell as

3832
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
The Daedric God who schemes to

3833
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Enslave the mortals of Tamriel

3834
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
Some extras

3835
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
Peter Stomer

3836
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
The Skulled King, a monarch who led his people

3837
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
Into an unlikely alliance

3838
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Jim Ward as

3839
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
A renegade high elf wizard

3840
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Exiled from the realm for raising the dead

3841
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Jennifer Hale as

3842
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
A Nord high giant who

3843
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
Along with the prophet, aids the player

3844
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Michael Richardson, Sai Sahan

3845
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
A noble martial artist and

3846
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Master swordsman

3847
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
Getting it, I don't care what it is

3848
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
This is a pretty amazing cast

3849
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
And then the mosaic of all of the actors

3850
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
And actresses, voice actors and actresses

3851
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
At the bottom, even if you don't recognize the names

3852
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
You're gonna recognize these faces

3853
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Good for them, Bethesda

3854
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Fucking awesome work, thank you

3855
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Akuma JP is talking about

3856
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
You see it in almost all Chinese movies

3857
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
What's wrong?

3858
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Yeah, it was

3859
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Hold on, cause you got support here in the chat

3860
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
SSG100Matt says, I think Jason just feels the notion

3861
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
Of a blind prophet leading someone is cliche

3862
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
And overused

3863
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
These are all completely valid

3864
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
I

3865
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Distilled into its simplest

3866
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Form, it seems hokey

3867
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Predictable and typical

3868
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
But that's also what makes it the best possible

3869
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
Thing, because the fact that without sight

3870
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
You can do anything of this nature is

3871
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Absolutely stupendous and

3872
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Amazing of the individual

3873
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
You're all correct, thank you

3874
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
It's true

3875
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
A white flag, I surrender

3876
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
I surrender

3877
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Alright

3878
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
Well, one thing

3879
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
We need to wrap up the show cause we're dying over here

3880
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
One thing we can all agree on

3881
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Is that the Super Nintendo is rad

3882
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
And Super Nintendo is still having

3883
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Games made for it, which is pretty cool

3884
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Super Fighter Team

3885
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Is a retro publisher

3886
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
And they are shipping a Super Nintendo

3887
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Run and gun platformer named

3888
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Nightmare Busters

3889
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
And if you pre-order the game you will be

3890
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Seeing this shipped to your house very very soon

3891
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
This game was originally supposed to launch

3892
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
In 1994

3893
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
You thought Duke Nukem

3894
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Forever had a long development

3895
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Two decades in the making

3896
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
That's quite a bankroll

3897
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
No more Duke Nukem jokes

3898
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Anyhow, it never happened

3899
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
And yeah, a completed version

3900
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
Was discovered years later

3901
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
And Super Fighter Team started taking the pre-orders

3902
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
Of the cartridge

3903
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
If you want it, it'll cost you just $70

3904
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Plus shipping

3905
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
How many years is $70?

3906
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Well, keep in mind that if you inflate the cost

3907
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Of what the cartridge used to cost back in the day

3908
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
It was about $70 in today's money

3909
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
It's very strange, I don't remember

3910
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
I still have some very beat up

3911
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
SNES boxes

3912
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
I don't really remember the cost

3913
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
A new SNES game

3914
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Probably because my mom and dad bought it

3915
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
But that was my age

3916
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
When I had my SNES

3917
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
Oh, when Street Fighter 2

3918
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
And Mortal Kombat with those complex

3919
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Chipsets that were in them

3920
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
They were like $69 or even

3921
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
I think it might have been $79

3922
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
I remember exactly how much the killer instinct

3923
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Cost when I got it

3924
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
It was exactly $60

3925
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
I got it at Montgomery Ward

3926
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
If that doesn't age it

3927
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Didn't Phantasy Star IV on the Genesis

3928
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Cost like $99 or something

3929
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Like really expensive?

3930
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
I don't know that it was that much, was it?

3931
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
I don't know, for some reason my mind goes

3932
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Tigerclaw, look it up for us

3933
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Every once in a while I just hear

3934
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
These figures and it's

3935
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
It's outrageous by today's

3936
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Standards, yet it seems somewhat

3937
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Expected and also you account

3938
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
For the fact that cartridges aren't in mass

3939
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Production, which means they're more expensive

3940
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
To produce

3941
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
It's a strange conflict of trying to

3942
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
Figure out where exactly

3943
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
My mind is in regard to

3944
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
How appropriate this cost is

3945
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
But it looks fun, looks like a fun game

3946
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Good on them

3947
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line

3948
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
It's open now, 1877 Game OLR

3949
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

3950
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
If you want to give us a call and talk about any of tonight's topics

3951
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
Or anything else we might have discussed tonight

3952
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Please go ahead and give us a

3953
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Call, it is the show after all

3954
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Where every gamer has a voice

3955
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Let's see

3956
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
I'm going to try and pull up any tweets

3957
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
I didn't see any earlier though

3958
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Remember how I said I was going to save an

3959
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Article for the end of the show?

3960
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Oh yeah, I do

3961
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Gee, thanks

3962
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
In my defense

3963
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
Two days away from being sick

3964
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I'm not at 100% yet, not that I remember

3965
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Thought you were going to help to bridge things together

3966
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
Alright

3967
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Let's go to the phones

3968
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
Because we do have a call coming in, hooray

3969
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3970
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
It's DJ Ronimaz, how is everybody in the studio today?

3971
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Hey good, good to hear from you buddy, what's up?

3972
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
We are all equally recovering

3973
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
I feel that

3974
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
I feel your pain

3975
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
I just finished rebuilding my entire machine after my hard drive crash

3976
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Late last night

3977
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Oh

3978
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Yuck

3979
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
But it's okay, all my important data

3980
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Including the porn, was saved

3981
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Yay

3982
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Okay

3983
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
I got a couple of things I want to get off my chest

3984
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Then I'm going to get up on out here and let other people call in

3985
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Fair enough

3986
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Now, I was trying to call in last week

3987
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
And get in this whole Wii U

3988
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Debate and debacle

3989
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
And

3990
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Granted, the Wii U is

3991
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Not a disaster

3992
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
According to what some people are saying

3993
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Because people forget

3994
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
For every console that Nintendo sells

3995
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
They make a profit

3996
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
Compared to other manufacturers

3997
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
In Microsoft, they take a loss

3998
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
So whether people think that Wii U

3999
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
Is an abysmal failure

4000
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
Nintendo is still laughing all the way to the bank

4001
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
I thought that wasn't true anymore after they did the $50 price cut

4002
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
I could be wrong

4003
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Well, maybe after the initial

4004
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
$50 price cut

4005
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
But then as parts get a little bit cheaper

4006
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
I mean, in the beginning they were losing money

4007
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Off the 3DS when they did the initial price cut

4008
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
But now

4009
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
They're making profits off the 3DS

4010
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Because

4011
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Parts become cheaper, make your money back

4012
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Alright, I'm with you

4013
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
So I am saying

4014
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
When Nintendo gets their next console out

4015
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
It's gotta have that hardware power

4016
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Of what's out there now

4017
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
They can't be like

4018
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Skimming on the cheap and be like

4019
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Well, we'll be the budget console

4020
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
For everybody

4021
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Well, wait a second

4022
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
If they match the current generation by the time the new one rolls around

4023
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
What will that have bought them?

4024
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Well, what I mean is they need to

4025
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
Not match, but make it to the next level

4026
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
I mean, you see what I'm saying?

4027
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
They have to add a little bit of hardware prowess

4028
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
To make them step above everybody else

4029
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
That's what I'm saying

4030
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Got it

4031
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Alright, fair enough

4032
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
We've got to come in our chat room

4033
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

4034
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
AkumaJP says, I'm so sick of this topic

4035
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Why do we keep debating the Nintendo stuff into the ground?

4036
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Even when people

4037
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Like, love to get

4038
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
People out there that really get pleasure out of just

4039
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Kicking Nintendo when they're down, I think, sometimes

4040
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
People like to see the giants fall

4041
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
I guess

4042
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
Very much

4043
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Well, why don't you tell us more about that porn collection

4044
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
Well, there is a reason why I had to go get a

4045
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
3TB hard drive

4046
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Any cons coming up that you're getting excited for?

4047
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
Yes, I will be

4048
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Going to Katsukan next month

4049
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
And I will be debuting

4050
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
Dr. Luigi

4051
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Oh god, Katsukan, oh man

4052
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
Man, it was years ago when I went to Katsukan

4053
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
I had such a good time though

4054
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Yes, and somehow, mysteriously, the picture of you as the

4055
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
Black Mage disappeared

4056
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
So I have to go digging for it

4057
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Oh no

4058
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Well, it's probably for the best, let's be real

4059
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
I've got to work on a cosplay for Dragon Con

4060
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
Because Travis Donovan is fully expecting

4061
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
That I'm going full on cosplay this year

4062
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
I've got to figure that whole mess out

4063
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
I don't know what I'm going to do

4064
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I'm going to lose a little weight first

4065
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
It will determine if I'm going to do sexy cosplay or not

4066
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
You need to do Joker

4067
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
Joker? Oh, I was like

4068
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
My mind went to Batman Joker

4069
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
Oh, Joker from Mass Effect

4070
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Yeah, I guess that would be pretty mean

4071
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
We can get you the SR2 hat

4072
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
That might be something

4073
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Especially when Donovan and Jenna

4074
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Do the whole Miranda and Shepard thing

4075
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
I guess the Joker would fit right in with that crowd

4076
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
So, why not

4077
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
Awesome

4078
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
I said hi

4079
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
Will do

4080
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG Network

4081
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Listen in, kids

4082
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
It's what's good

4083
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
For LG, you know

4084
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Alright, take care, buddy

4085
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
Alright, take care

4086
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
1877 Game OLR

4087
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

4088
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
If you want to give us a call

4089
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
And comment on whatever's been going on in the news

4090
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Bobby Blackwolf, I forgot, had sent me

4091
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Some messages earlier saying I should

4092
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
And I thought this was really funny

4093
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
He noticed that earlier in the show

4094
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
Guitar Hero 3

4095
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Was trending on Twitter

4096
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Isn't that weird? Guitar Hero 3 is years old

4097
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Yeah, it's depressing

4098
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
The reason why

4099
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Because Metallica just played

4100
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
One at the Grammys

4101
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
And all the little kids were going

4102
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Hey, this is from Guitar Hero 3

4103
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
Even though

4104
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
It's like one of the biggest

4105
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Facepalm right now

4106
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
Is like of epic proportions

4107
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Oh no

4108
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
You're talking about songs that like

4109
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Defined the

4110
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
No

4111
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
No, no

4112
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
It's sad

4113
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
But it's hilarious at the same time

4114
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
Do I need to get the

4115
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
I mean, at the same time, that's not a surprise

4116
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
And

4117
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
It's great that they're saying

4118
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Guitar Hero 3 specifically

4119
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
I don't know if it was on that, but

4120
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
I'm surprised you could unstick your hand

4121
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
From your face with that

4122
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Alright, I gotta go to the phones

4123
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Quickly, quickly

4124
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Hold on, hold on

4125
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Just one thing

4126
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
You be quiet, I hung up

4127
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
One thing that has to be said

4128
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
Is that

4129
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
If anyone ever doubts that

4130
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Metal music isn't

4131
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Music music

4132
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
You need to listen to that whole fucking Metallica album

4133
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
It's black album, isn't it?

4134
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
No, I don't

4135
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Was one all black? Oh, Ride the Lightning

4136
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
Alright, Zaku's calling back

4137
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Are we ready for Zaku this time?

4138
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Yes, it's all working

4139
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Alright, here we go

4140
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Hi Zaku

4141
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
How's it going?

4142
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Because I'm too lazy to turn on my PC at night

4143
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
That's fine, what's up buddy?

4144
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Ah, nothing much

4145
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Just kicking back

4146
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
What is that you're playing over there?

4147
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Is that Forza?

4148
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
No, Gran Turismo

4149
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Oh, Gran Turismo, okay

4150
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
What's up?

4151
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
Ah, nothing much

4152
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
Just, you know, as I said

4153
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Still playing, getting through my PS3 as usual

4154
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
But, other than that

4155
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
I managed to pick myself up a

4156
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Pretty spiffy racing wheel that I'm gonna pick up tomorrow

4157
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
From eBay

4158
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
Yeah

4159
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
So, figured I may as well get used to

4160
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Like, the last throws of playing

4161
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
On a controller

4162
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
But other than that, it's like

4163
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
I'm still kind of like

4164
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Still kind of shocked

4165
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
That the patent office

4166
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
Would go so far as to give

4167
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
A single company the trademark

4168
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
For an entire word

4169
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,000
That's like giving Crayola the patent

4170
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Or the trademark for the color blue

4171
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
I mean, for King

4172
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
To get that much, wield that much power

4173
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
You know there's gonna be other people

4174
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:28,000
Obviously Hasbro

4175
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Or anyone who's already

4176
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Had products with the word candy on it

4177
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
In the past and want to target mobile

4178
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:36,000
Or pretty much

4179
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:38,000
They're pretty much in the crosshairs

4180
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:40,000
Because once they do, they'll get the C&D's immediately

4181
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
Well, I would actually like to see

4182
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
I think Hasbro would fight that

4183
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:46,000
And I would actually kind of like to see that happen

4184
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
I think a lot of us would be

4185
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:50,000
Rooting for that kind of throwdown to happen

4186
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,000
Well, Dark Soccer had joked

4187
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:54,000
During Bobby Black Wolf's show earlier

4188
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:56,000
That Disney should do a game based on King Candy

4189
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,000
I like your macross shirt by the way

4190
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
From Wreck it Ralph

4191
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Doing a King Candy game

4192
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
And I was like, yes, Disney should do that

4193
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:06,000
Because Disney's legal team

4194
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Is a force to be reckoned with

4195
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
And that would be a fun little court case

4196
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:12,000
To watch go down

4197
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
But who's hand

4198
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
King ended up greasing

4199
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
In the patent office?

4200
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
There has to have been some sort of

4201
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Backroom deal

4202
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:24,000
Of sorts

4203
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Definitely a little bit of hand skin ball

4204
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
Going on over there at the patent office

4205
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Thanks Ralph

4206
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
There's no way

4207
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
You would be able to get

4208
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
The trademark for a single word

4209
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:38,000
That's so common in

4210
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Universal

4211
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
Well

4212
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Even English

4213
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
There's no way you would have done that

4214
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Without having to grease someone's palm over there

4215
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Well, Bethesda

4216
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
Bethesda trademarked the word

4217
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:54,000
There went my dreams

4218
03:00:54,000 --> 03:00:56,000
Of making the boob scrolls

4219
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
But still it's like

4220
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:00,000
Candy

4221
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Which is something that it's really

4222
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Really delicious honestly

4223
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
Not just delicious

4224
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:08,000
It's a noun

4225
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Of something that's already common

4226
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
How could you

4227
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Trademark something

4228
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
That is so ubiquitous

4229
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
That even candy makers

4230
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:20,000
Are in danger because if they try

4231
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,000
To promote their

4232
03:01:22,000 --> 03:01:24,000
They try to create a promotional app

4233
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
The technical answer

4234
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:28,000
The literal reason why that's allowed

4235
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:30,000
Is that they don't have carte blanche

4236
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
On anything that has the word candy

4237
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
They have carte blanche on video games

4238
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
And interactive media

4239
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:38,000
That uses the word candy or saga

4240
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
Well there goes

4241
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Any hopes for Hershey's

4242
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:44,000
Doing promotional games on mobile

4243
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
I'm gonna ask the real tough

4244
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Questions here at Orange Lounge Radio

4245
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,000
How did they not

4246
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:52,000
Get the trademark on the word crush

4247
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
Why are we not hearing about the word crush

4248
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
Because that makes me think if that's the unsaid thing

4249
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Because you know they tried it

4250
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
So why are we not hearing about them getting the trademark

4251
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
On the word crush

4252
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:04,000
I really hope it's because of grape crush

4253
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
I really hope

4254
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:08,000
The people that made crush soda were like nope

4255
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
More of an orange person myself

4256
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
But I digress

4257
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Isn't crush already

4258
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Not already a trademark

4259
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
So it kind of conflicts

4260
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
So I think they would have to give them candy

4261
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Because no one else has trademarked

4262
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Or let alone used it as a brand

4263
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
As a single word

4264
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
I mean it's getting to that point

4265
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
It's almost bizarre

4266
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
That they gave them

4267
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Something like that

4268
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
That could easily be invalidated

4269
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
As long as

4270
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
They try to go after the

4271
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Wrong entity

4272
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
Like Disney

4273
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
But it goes to show that

4274
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Our patent system

4275
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
Is completely broken

4276
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
It's where you can

4277
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
I mean the point is that

4278
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
If you have software patents

4279
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
And then you have trolls going after you

4280
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
For having certain features that are

4281
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Obiguous to all other

4282
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Mobile phone platforms

4283
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Like barcode scanning

4284
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Or even sending

4285
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
Communications like network calls

4286
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
Someone must have

4287
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
You know that process

4288
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Even sending secure calls

4289
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
Zaku

4290
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Since I'm asking the tough questions here tonight

4291
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,000
How do we fix it?

4292
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:26,000
We all sit here and say it's broken

4293
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
How do we fix it?

4294
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Well I mean this is something that Congress would have to

4295
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
Enact laws for

4296
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
But it's not

4297
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
The same one that got us in

4298
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Is going to get us right back out

4299
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
Out of the frying pan

4300
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
And into the fryer

4301
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
It's gotten paid for by

4302
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Special interests

4303
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
So there will be people, there will be certain entities

4304
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
Certain software companies that wouldn't want

4305
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
The status quo to change

4306
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
It would benefit from having

4307
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
To patent software

4308
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
Ideas

4309
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
Instead of the whole

4310
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Instead of actually building something

4311
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Or creating a single idea

4312
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
That can be patented as opposed to actually

4313
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Creating the code

4314
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
Alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show

4315
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
It is broken

4316
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
And I'm gonna complain some more

4317
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
Take care buddy

4318
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Have fun with your steering wheel

4319
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
All new way to play

4320
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
Take care buddy

4321
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
I think that it's gonna do it for calls tonight

4322
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
Cause we're well past 9 o'clock

4323
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Here and we only gotta work tomorrow

4324
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
So we're gonna

4325
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
Quickly I think I saw a tweet come in here

4326
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
At the last moment

4327
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
It was a story I wanted to address

4328
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
And I should have

4329
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
Mentioned it earlier in the show but I didn't

4330
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
Cause you know

4331
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
I was too busy ranting about something

4332
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
When I said I prefer Orange Crush

4333
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
I was actually talking about the R.A.M. song

4334
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Playing at drums on Rock Band

4335
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Also

4336
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
I was thinking about

4337
03:04:54,000 --> 03:04:56,000
Pineapple Crush was really

4338
03:04:56,000 --> 03:04:58,000
Actually the superior brand of Crush

4339
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
Pineapple Crush was amazing

4340
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
We do have a couple quick tweets here

4341
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Let me get to it

4342
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
Tigerclaw tweeting us saying

4343
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
So we brought them up earlier in the show

4344
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
Because they're gonna have that online

4345
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
The subscription pass that works for all their game

4346
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
But it's gonna come at the cost

4347
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
Of Free Realms

4348
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:18,000
Closing down

4349
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
That game was pretty shitty anyway

4350
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
It's on the PS3, it's awful

4351
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Star Wars Clone Wars Adventures

4352
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
Vanguard Saga of Heroes

4353
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
And Wizardry Online

4354
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
All shutting down

4355
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
Most of them on March 31st

4356
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
But Wizardry will be last to close

4357
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
On July 31st

4358
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Rest in peace

4359
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:40,000
SSG100Matt says

4360
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
What?

4361
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Oh yeah there was something about this

4362
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
They conspired to sell

4363
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
Counterfeit game packs for the UltraCade

4364
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Unit

4365
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
It also involved global VR

4366
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
And MAME developers

4367
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
He reached a plea deal with the state of California

4368
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
And the sentencing has happened

4369
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
41 months in prison

4370
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
How about that

4371
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
I don't even remember why we were so mad at him

4372
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
In the first place

4373
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Because they were replacing our legit old machines

4374
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
And they were making people pay for MAME

4375
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
I just want to give a shout out though

4376
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Because we had some nice people pimping our stuff tonight

4377
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
So I just want to give a nice shout out

4378
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
To some people that were pimping our stuff tonight

4379
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Pixel Pacas

4380
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
Said not interested in watching the Grammys

4381
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Listen to the video game podcast OLR

4382
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
Thank you Pixel Pacas

4383
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
That was quite kind

4384
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
It was very kind, so did Koopa Club

4385
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Said almost the same thing, forget the Grammys and listen to

4386
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
OLR Live instead, though if the Grammys

4387
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
Were like best grandma awards

4388
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
Then we totally watch it

4389
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
You know what though, I do have to say

4390
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
And thank you to Tumblr for keeping me in the loop

4391
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
Daft Punk

4392
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
Did they win stuff?

4393
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
Best Album

4394
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
Oh did they win Best Album?

4395
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
Good for them

4396
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
I know they were nominated

4397
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
They won 4 Grammys and

4398
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Paul McCartney won a couple

4399
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
Actually

4400
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
There was an amazing tweet earlier

4401
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
That can sum up my thoughts on Macklemore

4402
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
Perfectly

4403
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
This is my personal opinion

4404
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
What was the retweet?

4405
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
I had retweeted a user named Randall Chris

4406
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
Macklemore dropping

4407
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
The actual queer musician from

4408
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
Same Love so Madonna can

4409
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
Sing the hook instead is so comically

4410
03:07:34,000 --> 03:07:36,000
Appropriate

4411
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
That sums up my thoughts exactly

4412
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Thank you

4413
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
Anyhow

4414
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
That's gonna do it for

4415
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Another show here at

4416
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Orange Lounge Radio, thank you guys for downloading the show

4417
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
And checking it out, really appreciate it

4418
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
And I do say this at the end of every show, if you liked what you heard

4419
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
All we ask, help grow

4420
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
Our family, I talked to her a little

4421
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Earlier in the email segment about we are an independent podcast

4422
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
We do have to really work hard for the

4423
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
Exposure we do get, word of mouth is

4424
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
So valuable, please

4425
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
Consider leaving us a nice review in

4426
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
iTunes or Stitcher, tell a friend

4427
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
Or five about the show, help spread the word

4428
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
It really really helps and it has

4429
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
Kept us going for the past 12 years

4430
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
We live and love

4431
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
Pay your tribute

4432
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
Jason

4433
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Thank you again for being here

4434
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
As you have been

4435
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
Really appreciate it, thank you for stepping up into

4436
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
A full blown host role tonight

4437
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
I did reasonably well

4438
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
Other than completely resetting

4439
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
My brain in part B and thinking

4440
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
Oh shit, I was supposed to read these articles

4441
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Something's happened

4442
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
To be fair, I called you Loki

4443
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
At one point

4444
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
That reset happened

4445
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
Immediately after you called me Loki

4446
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
It happens to the best of us

4447
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
It all works out

4448
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
Stay healthy folks

4449
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
Our one listener

4450
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
Stay healthy, keep it together

4451
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Drink your orange juice

4452
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
Or whatever

4453
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
That is what I was doing all day yesterday and today

4454
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
My final thought tonight is

4455
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
I'm gonna have to shave this beard in a couple weeks

4456
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
And it's gonna be sad

4457
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
You need to shave your beard

4458
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
You just need to trim buddy

4459
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
I need to shave the beard

4460
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
That's the problem

4461
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
You need to shave something fierce

4462
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
Alright, and last but not least

4463
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

4464
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
It's winter, I ain't gotta shave shit

4465
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:28,000
That's it guys, thank you so much for downloading

4466
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
The show, we will be back next week

4467
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
On the big day, the day of the biggest game

4468
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
Of the year, Puppy Bowl Sunday

4469
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
We'll be back next week to talk about

4470
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
Video games and probably

4471
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
Say aww and shucks at those

4472
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
Cute puppies and kittens

4473
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
Have a great night everybody, we'll see you next time, bye
