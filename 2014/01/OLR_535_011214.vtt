Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, we're talking money. Money money money money money. Some surprising financial developments have taken place.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
We've also joined this generation of gaming consoles. Our thoughts, your chat comments, calls, emails, and tweets on this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio with this episode number 535 for January the 12th of 2014.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

00:52.000 --> 01:03.000
Unfortunately not here tonight. The one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. She unfortunately came down with a sinus infection today so she felt with her new job starting very soon she should probably take the night off.

01:03.000 --> 01:12.000
Which I understand. She is however in our chat room so if you want to say hi to her she's commenting along with the show at live.vognetwork.com

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
But that's of course only for the live listeners. Sorry for the podcast folks. But if you wanted to say hi to Jamie you could always send an email. Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
But we do have on the skype line tonight say hello everybody to Techmaster Loki.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Hello.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Hey Loki how are you doing?

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm doing good. Still on baby watch.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
That's right. Still Loki baby watch 2013 slash 14 still in effect.

01:34.000 --> 01:42.000
Although for those of you that have been tuned out for a little bit over the holidays Loki has been joining us for about the past month over skype.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
Because Mrs. Loki is in that last section of the baby making phase where the babies literally do any day now.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah pretty much. I mean she's at the point now where she's just waiting for labor to start.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.000
So she's off work and you know if the baby doesn't come naturally next week they're going to induce her a week from Monday.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
So one way or another we will have a baby by the 20th.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
So you're going to have a Martin Luther King Jr. Day baby possibly. Quite possibly.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I guess.

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
Very interesting. Although it could be before too.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah it's on or before so anytime.

02:21.000 --> 02:31.000
This is very likely. Should we place bets on this? I'm going to bet before. I think the baby's going to come during OLR's time slot.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.000
So it's going to make it cancel out on the show at like 4.30 next week.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
So no I'm fully expecting you probably won't be here next week.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
So this very well may be the last Loki show we have for a little bit.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
But just in case I don't get an opportunity to say it again.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Best of luck and may everything go swimmingly and can't wait to see your new healthy baby in the coming weeks.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
And tell Mrs. Loki we're all thinking about her here.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Will do.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
In the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com Blackwool says are we placing salty bets on Loki baby?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Quite possibly. Quite possibly.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
SSJ100Matt says I'm sure Nellie would love it if it happened during the show.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
And DarkSakura is in our chat room still having her voice at live.vognetwork.com says guys this is Nellie.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
That baby has stubborn genes.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Well she's been, we've been trying everything you know all the like home remedies to get the baby out.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
It's like okay spicy food. Nope not really doing anything.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Pineapple juice. Nope.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
So it's just, it's just not coming out. We just have to wait.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
But you know he's bigger already than Josh was when he was born so they don't want him to go too much longer.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
So it's definitely the 20th or earlier.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Sure makes sense.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
Brad our buddy from PodCulture is in chat saying no it'll be tonight. We'll hear oh shit gotta go.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.000
I doubt it. I mean she was not having any contractions a few hours ago so I doubt that it'll be tonight.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
That would, that would really be something if I, cause DarkSakura I had to call out just a couple hours ago and then I lose Loki mid show.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.000
I would be left here with nobody but the mighty fine VXJSnXVXYZ.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And what a terrible thing that would be.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
I mean I know then it would just be like alright I guess I'll have to just do the whole damn show between the two of us.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Well you know.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It would be, that would be quite a bit of an experience.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It would be an experience.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Hey my phone has Skype. What are you talking about?

04:24.000 --> 04:34.000
I could just see Loki trying to do the show on mobile Skype on the way to the hospital with Nelly like turn that god damn thing off.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
In the background.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
That would be hilarious.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Or in the room with the rhythmic beep beep.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Right.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
And then as he's starting to talk beep beep beep beep.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
How are you doing, Jason?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm doing good. It's another, another mighty fine week.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
What's new in your world? What are you up to? Enjoying, do you do any like tourist trap things while you're out here in San Francisco?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
No, I'm not touristy in the least.

04:57.000 --> 05:06.000
Like my, my life is literally like a five to six block radius of the apartment that I'm staying at and the office.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
And then it's a commute south to hang out with people or north up here to help out with the show.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Oh you gotta expand your horizons in SF a little bit.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Peer 39, come on, everybody's gotta go there.

05:15.000 --> 05:24.000
I've been, no I've done this kind of stuff before. My dad used to live in Gilroy and I visited for a summer so I did Alcatraz, I did Treasure Island, I did Peer 39 Fisherman's Wharf.

05:24.000 --> 05:34.000
Um, I've, I've been to these places whenever things are going on at work I'm um obviously I tag along so I can socialize with all my coworkers immediate or not.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
And um, I've, I've been through this kind of stuff. Left to my own choices, eh, eh, eh.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Fair enough.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I have other things I want to do.

05:44.000 --> 05:52.000
When I'm working away from town, like when I went to Phoenix last year was the big trip I took for work, I, I probably did the same thing where I didn't leave like a small little radius from where we were.

05:52.000 --> 06:00.000
And I mean the big difference with this now is that since I'm coming up on two years at work and also two years of coming out to the Bay Area,

06:00.000 --> 06:10.000
like I kind of have my groove and I've been having conversations with people about whether San Francisco slash anywhere California is going to be home or not at some point.

06:10.000 --> 06:21.000
I don't think it is but I'm definitely seeing the feasibility if nothing else. I don't think I want to live here but I see the fact that I can if I'm so inclined.

06:22.000 --> 06:31.000
And so I have my routines now. I have my, I have my office, I have my job that I go into. I come back and I'm starting to get into producing more and more content.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Sure.

06:32.000 --> 06:40.000
And I'm, I'm taking advantage of, you know, being, being able to do things while still being around people while I'm out here.

06:40.000 --> 06:49.000
Because as soon as I get back home, I'm 25 minutes. Yeah, I'm at least 25 minutes from any coworker and only their houses.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
So it would be, you know, it'd be like a pretty personal person, socially personal thing that I would have to, I would have to make plans with to go do anything with them.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
And it'll just be a lot different. So the life of a telecommuter. So soaking it up as much as I can right now is really the gist of it.

07:03.000 --> 07:10.000
That's fair. I understand. Talking about all the Pier 39 kind of, kind of made me think of back when orange Ontario was a station.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
And one of my favorite days was the day we broadcast from the DDR tournament that was at Pier 39. We actually were live like all day long.

07:16.000 --> 07:26.000
We used to, we haven't really done anything like that in a very, very long time. But I can't think of the last time we were like live for like an entire day outside of maybe the marathon episode and maybe like an E3 thing or something.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
But that would be, you know, back when we were with, you know, other, other, it wasn't just us, it was like other shows coming together to do that.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.000
But I remember that Pier 39 DDR tournament was quite an experience. I had a good time.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
How did you even do it back in the days of like shitty wireless leads and everything else?

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Isn't that funny? Like, yeah, like now you look back and you go, how the hell did we pull that off?

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Well, we have tethering, we have MiFis. Back then we had to plug our computers into things for internet.

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
I guess the arcade was a really good sport about it. And they thought it was really cool exposure for them to be able to say that something like that was happening.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
And they had like a DSL was like all the rage.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
It was a really, really, really long Ethernet cable. I remember they had to run it.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
We had to go to Radio Shack and get like a 50 foot Ethernet cable. It was huge and ran it that way.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
And keep in mind, Orange Launch Radio was running our big thing right when we first launched. We were a modem friendly.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
We were a 28.8K friendly dial-up radio station. So that was the thing.

08:21.000 --> 08:33.000
There's still some relevance of that. It's happening all over again because cell phone speeds, cellular connections are not always terribly fast in all parts of the US and outside of the US as well where we do have listeners.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, that's true. That's true. But my how times have changed. My how times have changed.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Actually, that arcade is now a sports bar because I've been back to Pier 39.

08:42.000 --> 08:52.000
I went there. You actually suggested it the day before saying, oh, no, not the day before the day of St. Patrick's Day.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
I had a Saturday to myself the day after my interview and I was just kind of going around and I figured I'd go back to Pier 39 and kind of see what I remember.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
Like I said, I was out here for a summer when my dad lived in Gilroy. That was 2000 somewhere around there.

09:06.000 --> 09:15.000
And since I had done this before, talking to people that I know in the area that have been through San Francisco and just kind of solicited suggestions, you suggested Pier 39.

09:15.000 --> 09:22.000
So I hopped a ride, caught a ride to get down there. And it was pretty it was not a bad sports bar.

09:22.000 --> 09:29.000
There are still some pretty cool, good looking and well maintained arcade machines. No music games, not not even a little bit.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
You've got to have your deer hunter game, your requisite deer hunter game.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
They had one of the new Terminator, Rise of the Machines, whatever it is. And, you know, obviously the the obligatory basketball hoops, skee-ball type thing.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
But the takeaway is that they actually seemed to be taking care of the machines because they looked pretty good.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
All the screens were fine. There was no signs taped up on the over the coin mix or on the screens or anything like that.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
Still a worthwhile place to go if you find yourself walking up and down the pier.

10:03.000 --> 10:12.000
All right. Well, let's as much as fun is to talk about tourist traps and the fair the fair amount of arcade games you may find at them, we should probably go back to talking about gaming.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight and then we'll get into our gaming weeks and all that good stuff.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
So, hey, my kickoff topic tonight, I literally have it on the show roll.

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
Tonight's kickoff topic is ass and titties, ass and titties, ass and titties, ass and titties.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
OK, here's the thing, though. No, really. No, no, hold on. Don't change the station. Don't change the station. This does relate to gaming.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
No one's changing the station or the kickoff topic is ass and titties.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
They're turning it up.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
We're going to talk about ass and titties, everybody.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
They're trying to find the webcam stream.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
OK, so here's the thing. Not my ass and titties. Hold on.

10:43.000 --> 10:52.000
OK, here's the thing, in all seriousness, and yes, we are going to talk about ass and titties because last week I made a big deal on the show about,

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
OK, guys, I finally jumped the shark and I ordered my PlayStation 4 and my PlayStation 4 will be here on Tuesday.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
So sure enough, there's the new parallelogram is sitting on the TV stand.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
My PlayStation 4 is all hooked up and with all its gaming goodness and I've had a good old time on the PlayStation 4 this week.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
So which console did you end up removing?

11:12.000 --> 11:19.000
Oh, yes, I was playing television stand Survivor on Twitter this week where one of the consoles got voted off the island.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
The Xbox 360 was voted off the island, actually.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
However, it is not out of the game. It's been exiled to Master Bedroom Island is what's happened.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
But now Sony has officially asserted its dominance over the living room.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
For now, until I get the Xbox One, which I don't want the Microsoft fanboys to be all like, nah, but here's the reality.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
I haven't really touched the 360 in a while.

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
The last big, big thing I remember playing on it was either Minecraft or the most likely the Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC was probably the last big thing I played on 360.

11:51.000 --> 12:00.000
And with PlayStation 3, there is still the Final Fantasy 10 remake coming and there's the Kingdom Hearts 2 package that's all coming out next year.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
So those I knew were things that I would want to still have on PlayStation 3.

12:04.000 --> 12:13.000
I couldn't think of anything on 360 that I would want to play next year that badly that isn't also on PC or something else.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
Am I missing something, Loki? Did I miss an obvious choice?

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
Well, there's two. I mean, if you're not getting an Xbox One right away, there's Plants vs. Zombies, Garden Warfare, and Titanfall.

12:23.000 --> 12:28.000
Titanfall I do want to check out, but that is on PC eventually, right?

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
It's PC the same day, but I guess you probably want to play it on PC.

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
Yeah, so either I'll check that out on PC or, again, the PlayStation 3 will have to be voted off the island when I can finally afford an Xbox One.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
I just think that'll be more like summer.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
And then by that point, I will have at least played the Final Fantasy 10 remakes.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
Kingdom Hearts 2 we'll have to see. I might unfortunately have to just play that in the bedroom or figure out something else.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
I had joked around that the Wii U was up for elimination, but not really because I still play enough Wii U.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
I had people over this week and we were having a good old time with Nintendo Land, of all things, but I'll get into that later.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Because Ass and Titties. You guys got me distracted from Ass and Titties.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Here's the thing.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Miracles do happen sometimes.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
On the PlayStation 4. I'm sure you all know one of the big features on the PlayStation 4 is that you can livestream your games.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
We've even talked about this on the show, that it's not only the games that you can stream, but people have figured out that they can stream from Playroom,

13:25.000 --> 13:34.000
which is just kind of the play space, if you will, the camera area where you have just silly little, like, make robots spawn and interact with.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
They have silly little things like this with Kinect too.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
There was, on Xbox, they had something very similar to this. They even showed it off at 1E3 and I don't remember the name of it.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
Do you remember the name of the Kinect showroom that they had?

13:46.000 --> 13:53.000
Well, they have, like, a Kinect, I forget what it was, they have some sort of Kinect Party thing.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
They've got, I don't know if it is Kinect Party.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
It was all download. They had something, somebody in chat will yell it out over at live.vognetwork.com soon enough.

14:02.000 --> 14:13.000
So, okay, so I'm screwing around and I'm looking at the PlayStation 4 livestreams and one thing I noticed right away, it is really easy to just, I mean,

14:13.000 --> 14:21.000
you power up the PlayStation 4 and it's all integrated, like, you just, your little bar shows up that shows all the little games that you have downloaded

14:21.000 --> 14:29.000
and, you know, the PlayStation Store or the Netflix Amazon link and all that stuff and then PlayStation 4 Live.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
So you go in there and you will automatically see what the top channels are.

14:32.000 --> 14:38.000
And so I've been just kind of looking around and seeing what people are doing in the Playroom streams.

14:38.000 --> 14:46.000
And I'll tell you what, it is a real toilet bowl of the internet, what's going on in those Playroom streams.

14:46.000 --> 14:55.000
Last night, I kid you not, I'm not making this up, I actually was playing around with the, because, you know, the Vita will livestream from your PlayStation 4.

14:55.000 --> 15:01.000
Like, it'll, you can actually do the whole second screen thing. It's, like, very similar to the Wii U and the Wii and it works very well.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I was very impressed with that.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
So I was lying in bed about to go to sleep and I'm playing around on the Vita and I'm doing the PlayStation 4 and I look at the livestreams

15:08.000 --> 15:14.000
and I tune into this channel that has 500 viewers that's just called, like, Party or something like that.

15:14.000 --> 15:22.000
And it's these three bros and one girl that are in a room and I can't really understand what they're making out because, you know,

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
they're all loud and boisterous and those microphones are pretty sensitive, so all I can hear is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
You know, they're all kind of laughing.

15:29.000 --> 15:40.000
Well, suddenly, the girl gets up, walks over to the camera, pulls down her top, plays, like, does the whole little, like, you know, the ending of Elvira

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
where she, like, does her, spins her titties around a little bit, like, she does that.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
She does, I don't mean to be, like, too explicit, y'all, but this is, like, this is unfolding in front of my eyes.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
I was like, oh my God, this is really happening on PlayStation 4.

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
She picks up one of her boobs and starts licking it and that whole thing and does these very explicit types of things on the TV

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
and then she laughs and goes back and sits down and I'm just thinking.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
But what were the robots doing at this time?

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Somehow the robots weren't there. I don't know how that happened.

16:08.000 --> 16:18.000
So then I changed chan- I was like, okay, so I changed the channel and I look at somebody, there's somebody else's stream and it's, it's, it's called,

16:18.000 --> 16:25.000
I was like, wow, there's all this, like, boobs and, and, and Alan and I were kind of joking, like, are there any dudes that are getting naked on there?

16:25.000 --> 16:32.000
So sure enough, we see a channel that's called, like, Workout Session or Workout With Me or something.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
So we go to the room and it's this dude that's sitting there and he's wearing nothing but gym shorts, right?

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
And he's, like, he's doing sit-ups and he's talking to the camera about, like, how he's trying to get in shape and all this,

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
but he sounds, like, really out of it kind of to me, like, like, I don't want to say he was on drugs, but-

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
But you might say that he's a resident of Colorado.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
Yes, yes, he might be a resident of Colorado. It's, it struck me as he was very possibly in Colorado.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
No offense, Jason, it's just your state's a little infamous for something right now.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm aware of these things.

17:03.000 --> 17:11.000
So here's the thing, I just, I just happened to notice that as he's doing sit-ups, I was like,

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
I think he's very happy to be doing these sit-ups, if you know what I mean.

17:17.000 --> 17:25.000
So my point in telling these stories, I'm not just trying to, like, titillate you with all these stories about girls and boys

17:25.000 --> 17:32.000
and the things they're doing on camera, but I was just, like, this is a fucking Fox News story waiting to happen.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
This is a ticking time bomb before somebody, I mean, that's how easy it was.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
I turned on the PlayStation, went to the PlayStation 4 live, like, it's, like, literally, like, three button presses before I'm there.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
Now, am I saying that, oh my gosh, this is gonna be a problem and all this stuff?

17:50.000 --> 17:58.000
Well, I do think that parents should be monitoring what their kids do, and I think if parents turn on the parental controls,

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
they can probably block access to this and all this stuff, but you and I and everybody else knows that is not gonna happen.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
Real quick, so this is stuff, is this going out over Twitch, or is this just via their internal, like, streaming thing?

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
I swear that the boob thing was on Twitch.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
Now, I know we reported on this show last week, or, sorry, not last week, but a couple weeks ago that Twitch had removed Playroom,

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
but you can see when you're actually in the PlayStation 4 channel, there's a little icon that indicates if the stream is coming from Twitch or if it's coming from Ustream.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
You see the little logo, and you can also filter, and it actually looks like there's room that they could put more into it,

18:35.000 --> 18:41.000
so if those two services were to get overwhelmed or a third one pops up, but I swear the boobs were on Twitch TV.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
Which I was like, how did they do that? Because I thought Playroom was banned.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Maybe there was another trick or something, I don't know.

18:47.000 --> 18:54.000
It's not that it's banned, it's that it's delisted from the directory on the website, is my understanding.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
So the PS4, you can still get everything that's being streamed from other PS4s, but if you were to get on your computer,

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
go to Twitch.tv and search for the game Playroom, it will not show up.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
That makes a lot more sense.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.000
You can probably still, even if you know the name of the account, I assume that you can still watch the channel from your computer.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
But to browse to it and find it is too much of a liability that they delisted it.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
But yeah, most of them are going through Ustream, Loki, to be honest.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Alright, I was curious.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
But here's the other thing, it wasn't just the livestreams that were appalling, it was the chat.

19:28.000 --> 19:37.000
It was the chat. The chat was just like, I was almost offended and appalled by what I was seeing in chat.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
Like when that girl was showing her boobs and everything, all the chat was like,

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
show your pussy, was basically what they were saying in chat.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
And I'm sitting there going, and it wasn't just like show your pussy, it was like show your pussy you fucking whore,

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
and show you fat slut and all this stuff, and I'm just like this is gross.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
This is gross behavior. And it's like one of those train wrecks.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
Like I should not be watching this, I should not be supporting this, this is dirty, this is wrong.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But it's like you can't look away.

20:05.000 --> 20:10.000
So I'm just thinking to myself, I'm like this is a Fox News nightmare waiting to happen.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
And it's all going to get blamed on PlayStation 4 and this is not going to end pretty.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
Because there's a part of me that's really excited about the potential of what this could do for broadcast.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
You know I'm a big champion of independent broadcasting and independent stuff.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
And earlier today I went in there again before the show, I was kind of showing Jason,

20:28.000 --> 20:37.000
and there was two dudes on there doing a show in Playroom that was like our gaming show every Saturday at 7 or something like that.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
And they actually decorated their little kitchen to look like a studio and all this,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
kind of like what we used to do with OLR back in the garage.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
And I was like okay that's a pretty good use of it.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
And the chatters there were relatively pretty respectful.

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
But I'm thinking it's only a matter of time before Sony's going to have to moderate what they push to the front page.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You know what I mean?

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
Like I just, yeah it's something else.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
I used the Twitch Xbox One app and they had the Playroom in the list of games but there were no games in there.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
I saw a Playroom stream two days ago with a woman and she was playing with her kid and she was responding to all the nasty comments.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
That is the vast majority of those streams.

21:23.000 --> 21:31.000
It's just people sitting there in front of the TV while we're all staring back and saying the nastiest shit and they're just responding to it.

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
And they just watch the chat go by and respond and this is like, is this what gaming has become?

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
No, it's what the internet is when the situation arises.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
It's that whole, you know we've joked about this on the show before, but it's time to penis, right?

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
Whenever you put a new peripheral out there, how long before somebody puts their dick in it or on it or whatever?

21:57.000 --> 22:04.000
And sure enough, dick, tits, whatever, it doesn't matter, they're private parts, it doesn't take very long at all.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
This is just that whole thing in reality.

22:07.000 --> 22:17.000
How long does it take for somebody to whip their boobies out or for somebody to practically be running around with no pants on where it leaves nothing to the imagination?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
You know what I mean?

22:19.000 --> 22:26.000
I don't know, it's just fascinating, but is this going to end positively for gaming? I don't think so.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I think this is a ticking time bomb.

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
And if Sony doesn't change this quickly, it's going to get real ugly.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
Real ugly when one of the big stations reports on this.

22:36.000 --> 22:42.000
Well at least if there's any benefit to this, it's that the local news won't pick up on this for at least another couple of years.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
So we're still okay.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
That's true.

22:46.000 --> 22:53.000
Scottatron in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, awesome, so dude bros and a few morons are going to ruin it for everybody, typical.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
Alan Alchemy says, but it was just spools of sewage directed at any woman.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
Anyone who still thinks that being a woman on the internet, quote, isn't that bad, needs to see this shit.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
It is literally everywhere and instantaneous.

23:07.000 --> 23:11.000
I hate to say it, but absolutely. I mean, it's pretty appalling.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
I'll second that.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
It's pretty appalling.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Now, are the men objectified too?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
A little bit.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Sure, especially the dude who is working out.

23:20.000 --> 23:29.000
You know, he was getting the gay thrown out, which is a whole nother, you know, stop saying that, you toilet bowl commenter or whatever.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
But I mean, they get a lot of that too.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
But it is, it's really bad.

23:33.000 --> 23:41.000
You know, when somebody's got a stream where it's like, you know, OMG a girl and all the comments are just like the most misogynist of things you can imagine.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
It's pretty gross.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, what Sony needs to do is put on some sort of explicit tags on streams that are showing mature content.

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
Kind of like how Twitch TV lets you change a setting on your account to warn people that you're showing mature rated content.

23:56.000 --> 24:04.000
I think Sony needs to, I think they need to moderate what playroom streams they push to the front page.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
I think what Sony needs to do in a firmware update is they need to filter out at least.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
Now granted, I think in any game what's going to eventually happen is that even in the little camera window people are going to go crazy.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
But I think for now to avert a real crisis, what Sony ought to do, they need to filter out the playroom streams.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
And maybe you can still search for them if you know the name or whatever.

24:24.000 --> 24:32.000
Or that Sony will only push playroom streams that they know are doing relevant content, let's just say.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
I think the way that Microsoft implemented this and Bobby talked about two or three weeks ago is actually really relevant.

24:38.000 --> 24:47.000
This doesn't disagree with your point, but that if anybody is reported and verified as having been doing something with this, they get delisted. Period.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
And not even allowing people to search for them if you're going to do this kind of thing.

24:53.000 --> 25:04.000
I'm kind of conflicted because ratings are a thing, parental controls are a thing, and you shouldn't outright punish someone for doing something.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.000
But until an alternative exists, if anybody is caught doing something like this, just delist them.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
They can still stream, they won't get any feedback, they're going to stop streaming.

25:13.000 --> 25:23.000
What they should do is just have, when they're reporting these people, instead of having these anonymous reports, have it capture five seconds of what they were watching.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.000
That way they can say, okay, yeah, that's definitely not appropriate.

25:29.000 --> 25:41.000
I'll go a funny step further and say that when one user reports a second user, that the first user should not be able to see the second user anymore at all.

25:41.000 --> 25:46.000
Just to prevent, like, it's still on, I'm going to report them again even if nothing's going on.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
That's diving down a whole other rabbit hole.

25:49.000 --> 26:00.000
The only concern I have, and maybe I'm being a little too tinfoil-hattish with this, but I just kind of see the reality of this as it's as easy for me to see tits on my PlayStation 4 like I did last night.

26:00.000 --> 26:08.000
It's as easy for me to do that as it is to turn on cable and go to, you know, CNN on the cable box.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
It's exactly as many button presses as it was.

26:11.000 --> 26:16.000
And my thought is that everything on the cable box is regulated by the FCC.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.000
I think some of it's a gray area, especially late at night, because I know Comedy Central used to show, like, the underrated movies and stuff.

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
But all that dialogue aside, it's moderated and it's filtered and it's government-controlled.

26:29.000 --> 26:35.000
But this stuff on PlayStation 4, and I don't think we want to see it necessarily government-controlled.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
And, you know, the Internet is a worldwide thing.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
How do you control with the government something that's worldwide?

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
But my mind is just going, something's gonna give here.

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
And if Sony doesn't do it, somebody else is gonna step in and it's not gonna be good news anywhere.

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
And if Xbox gets this streaming thing soon enough, considering every Xbox owner has a camera in their house,

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
the problem very well will only be worse for Microsoft if they unveil this whole thing.

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
Because I'll tell you what, those PlayStation 4 cameras are harder to find than the fucking system.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
I don't know how these other guys are finding them. I can't find them anywhere here in a 100-mile radius.

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, they are very allocated by Sony. They're getting ready for their Japanese launch, so all their accessories are hard to get right now.

27:22.000 --> 27:27.000
Yeah, so I'm just saying, it's gonna be very, very interesting.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000
Alright, going to live.vognetwork.com.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Alan's saying, the dudes get, let's see your dick, happy face.

27:36.000 --> 27:43.000
The woman's get, you're fucking fat, let's see her dirty bleep bleep, you ugly bleep bleep, this boring slut, show us beep beep beep.

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
It's kind of a false dichotomy. Yes, people ask the dudes to do dumb shit, but it's not soaked in gross insults.

27:50.000 --> 28:00.000
I will agree with that to an extent. I think there's still gross insults on either side, but is it unfortunately weighted way more towards the women?

28:00.000 --> 28:05.000
Yes, I would agree with that, and that's very unfortunate. But that is the reality of what we're seeing right now.

28:05.000 --> 28:13.000
Bobby Blackwell says, less Rob, the PlayStation 4 will push further to the left in the bar the stuff you used the most, or most recently.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
Live with PlayStation could realistically be the first thing you could click on if you use it enough. That's very true.

28:19.000 --> 28:26.000
And DarkSakura, of course, saying hello in our chat room, saying sorry, all the pussy talk reminded me to feed Midna.

28:26.000 --> 28:33.000
Glad we could help. Glad we could be of service there over at live.vognetwork.com.

28:33.000 --> 28:38.000
Alright, and Act F says, people will bitch if Playroom gets shut down or something.

28:38.000 --> 28:47.000
Well, there is quality stuff to be seen on Playroom. Unfortunately, it's just not the stuff that's at the top of the list or the most easiest to access.

28:47.000 --> 28:55.000
The two dudes that were doing the live show about video games was like about three pages down if you scroll down.

28:55.000 --> 29:03.000
They only had like 20 viewers, whereas last night the girl with her cha-chas was at 500 and the dude wearing the gym shorts was like 250.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
So, there you go.

29:07.000 --> 29:15.000
DarkSakura says, it's built into society and it can be combated, but it has to start at home.

29:15.000 --> 29:27.000
Alright, anyway, so I just wanted to get that out because I was just like, it's going to be one of those things where you're going to see it on the news and we're all going to be like, that isn't gamers.

29:27.000 --> 29:36.000
That has nothing to do with gaming, but it's going to be the gaming community that takes the heat because I'll tell you what, it's going to be one of those ignorant local news people.

29:37.000 --> 29:45.000
And yet, I say ignorant because I bet you anybody, this reporter will not be a gamer themselves, so it will be somebody who doesn't know what they're talking about when it comes to video games.

29:45.000 --> 29:54.000
It will be an ignorant TV reporter that gets up there and says, well, you won't believe what gamers are using their PlayStation 4 for and it could shock you.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
That's the story that's coming.

29:57.000 --> 30:12.000
And it's going to be like, you know, I bought my kid this console for his birthday and this is the filth he saw immediately when powering it up and he came calling back to me and saying, mommy, I don't know what's going on.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
It's going to be like one of those, just like all those porn on the 3DS stories.

30:18.000 --> 30:28.000
Tall in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com with a very firm comment here that I think is important to address says, I would disagree. This is a part of gaming culture.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
You know, despite what I just said, unfortunately, I do think he's right a little bit.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
I think it's a part of human culture. This is by no means a specific thing whatsoever.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
That's very true.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
You will find it everywhere because it is human life.

30:45.000 --> 30:50.000
It is a very ugly pointing the mirror at ourselves, at a society in a way.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
That's a very good point.

30:53.000 --> 31:01.000
But certainly you see a lot of that in the game, you know, just the way that women have been treated in the past and the insults that people hurl at each other on Xbox live.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
I mean, that all has been a part of gaming culture, but you're right.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
That's almost part of human culture as it is too, unfortunately.

31:08.000 --> 31:17.000
Cosplay circles, you know, anime in general, anime, unfortunately, kind of especially because of the subject of the show, anime and manga both.

31:17.000 --> 31:31.000
But also there's an argument to be made with gaming is that with the improvements and realism and everything else that technology is being used to benefit gaming is also making this thing more accessible, easier, for better or for worse.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Heavy stuff.

31:34.000 --> 31:40.000
I don't know if there's an easy answer to this and I'm glad I'm not the guy that has to make these sorts of decisions.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
But it's going to be fascinating to see how this next year plays out with these consoles.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
If you have further thoughts, please feel free to email us.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
Mailbag at OrangeOnTrader.com or you can also tweet us.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Twitter.com slash OLR.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
You know, I'll tell you this.

31:52.000 --> 32:03.000
I had that before I even saw the guys doing their little gaming show, I had that idea where I was like, dude, if I got one of those PlayStation cameras, we could do OLR through the PlayStation.

32:03.000 --> 32:09.000
And we would get like, we would easily be able to be like in the top and it would get, be like a whole new audience.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
We get all these new listeners. Oh my gosh, it would be great.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
But then I'm thinking in the back of my head after I'm watching some of these streams, honest to God, my reaction was, do I want some of these people listening to OLR?

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
I don't think it's a bad idea to be honest.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
I mean, yeah, there's going to be idiots and stuff, but they won't stick around.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
They may show up for a little bit, but then they're like, oh, hey, someone's showing their ass on this one.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
And then there'd be guns.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
True. True.

32:30.000 --> 32:38.000
And I would honestly, I would just hide the chat because you know, in PlayStation 4, you can either shrink your screen down so you can see the chat or you can just have the thing be full screen.

32:38.000 --> 32:44.000
And I would honestly probably just have it full screen with it written on the whiteboard or something to join chat, go to our moderated chat room.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
But I don't know.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
I mean, again, I'm just, I'm brainstorming aloud.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
This is not nothing we're actually thinking of doing.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
But I'm sure there's a lot of other podcasters having the same thought.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
I don't think I'm some type of like genius who thought of this idea first or something.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
No, absolutely not.

32:58.000 --> 33:03.000
I think a lot of people are weighing, how can I use this technology to do my thing?

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
One last little bit of this is that it doesn't even take anything particularly specific for this to happen.

33:09.000 --> 33:15.000
I was watching the wrap up of All Games Done Quick, Awesome Games Done Quick last night.

33:15.000 --> 33:25.000
And as they were finishing their official broadcast stream, there's a thing in the speedrunning community, probably maybe the game streaming community at large,

33:25.000 --> 33:33.000
where they take a featured stream with a lot of viewers and they want to pay it forward, so to speak.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
They want to take the traffic and send it on somebody else that's worthy.

33:36.000 --> 33:45.000
Awesome Games Done Quick was wrapping up and so they wanted to send it to another guy that they recognized with good Super Metroid speedrunning talents.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
And so there was a person transcribing stuff on the screen.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
He accidentally linked to somebody else that was playing Legend of Zelda NES.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.000
And I pop over to the channel because I'm kind of curious, thinking it was going to be Super Metroid.

33:58.000 --> 34:04.000
And it's just dude sitting on his chair, full screen, you know, majority screen playing Legend of Zelda.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.000
And first of all, the chat was scrolling 10 million miles a second.

34:09.000 --> 34:14.000
But second, there was also like approachingly raunchy stuff.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Mob mentality, I guess, sort of thing.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
Just kind of like the fact that they were trying to have their second to shine, they were trying to have their moment.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
And they were trying to one-up the other people that were saying specific things.

34:26.000 --> 34:35.000
And he was just, and the guy that was playing, when he noticed that his screen was scrolling by, he kind of walked up to the camera.

34:35.000 --> 34:44.000
Whoa! And then just kind of went back to playing the game and something probably happened like 10, 20, 30 minutes later whenever there was a lull in gameplay.

34:44.000 --> 34:50.000
But literally nothing was happening except somebody was playing Legend of Zelda NES of all things.

34:50.000 --> 34:58.000
And people come in and just start going crazy, expressing themselves in a matter of speaking.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
You know, I'm glad you bring up though the whole awesome games done quick thing.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
Because obviously what they accomplished over the weekend, well over the week really, was a really cool feat.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Because they ended up raising a million plus dollars for cancer research.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
A million bucks, two times their target for the week.

35:13.000 --> 35:20.000
Thank you for bringing that up because I think that brings a very nice little bookend to the story about the cesspool of live streaming and the bad that comes from it.

35:20.000 --> 35:27.000
And then we have this really great like, but we can't throw it all away because there's these great things that come from it too.

35:27.000 --> 35:34.000
I mean that whole thing is a direct, you know, kind of reflection of the live streaming culture as well.

35:34.000 --> 35:39.000
Is that, you know, thanks to that, you know, you've raised all that money and that's the real good that can come out of this too.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.000
So, you know, just things to think about. It's not all bad I guess is my point.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
In fact there's some real, real, real good stuff coming out of it.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
As with anything, people can take advantage of it for better and people can exploit it for worse.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Very true, very true.

35:52.000 --> 35:58.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into how is your gaming week and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
You want to finish off your week Rob?

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
I guess I should start, huh, since Jamie's not here and I did bring up PlayStation 4, right?

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
Okay, so going into our gaming weeks, my gaming week.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
So yes, I got a PlayStation 4 and besides all the stuff I just brought up, I have been playing some games on it.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
You know what's funny? I actually don't have any disc based games right now.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
I'm going to be getting some. A friend of mine is getting me a good deal on a couple games.

36:19.000 --> 36:28.000
But right now I'm just kind of enjoying what's able to be downloaded on the PlayStation Store and what's available through PlayStation Plus.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
So I played like a good seven or eight games on PlayStation.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
I mean I downloaded stuff that, excuse me, I already had on PlayStation 3 that was cross by like Flower.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
Which, yes I can tell the difference playing it on PlayStation 4.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
It's just a lot crisper and even more vibrant.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
I mean generally it's the same game, especially a game like Sound Shapes.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Really didn't look any different to me at all.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
But Flower you could see just a little bit more.

36:53.000 --> 36:57.000
It was very subtle but it was just that much crisper and looked that much better on PlayStation 4.

36:58.000 --> 37:05.000
I will say a game that I really enjoyed on PlayStation 4 that I was really surprised because this game didn't really get that good of reviews.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.000
But reviews aren't everything. It's sometimes about how you view a game.

37:09.000 --> 37:16.000
I actually played all the way through a game called Contrast that's available for free.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Or at least it was. I don't think it is anymore.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
But it was available through PlayStation Plus for free.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
And I had that. And I actually played that from start to finish.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.000
What's interesting about it though, the only reason I probably played that on PlayStation 4 is that it was free.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
Because the game is also out on 360, PC, PlayStation 3.

37:35.000 --> 37:44.000
And PlayStation 4, the graphics, it looks good but it doesn't really look that much better than what you would see on PlayStation 3.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
But I wasn't expecting it to be much better because it's available on those systems.

37:48.000 --> 37:54.000
But I liked it's setting a lot. I liked the style of the storytelling.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
I loved the mechanic about how your character can become a shadow.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
And basically the shadow kind of blends into the wall.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
And you solve these puzzles and move around in the shadow.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
And then you can phase out. And then you get later in the game you phase objects in with you.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
And that's how you move things around.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
It's a really interesting little mechanic.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
The game's a bit buggy, unfortunately.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
You really see some graphical bugs as you're going through it.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
I have a really bad feeling this game was rushed.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
Probably to try to make the PlayStation 4 release.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
But yeah, there are some bugs.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
But nothing that broke the game for me.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
Yes, I did see some graphical glitches.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
But it was nothing that broke the game or took me too far out of the environment and being able to see it.

38:37.000 --> 38:44.000
Which I really love the style of the French carnival sort of theme that the game had to it.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
It was really cool.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
And it's short. It's a short game.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
You could probably play the damn thing start to finish in about...

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
You could speed run it probably in like 45 minutes if even that.

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
But I think a normal person playing through it, it'll probably take them about 3 hours to play through it.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Depending on how good at platformers you are.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
It wasn't anything too, too difficult.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
But I thought the story was good enough.

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
And the ending kind of made me go, oh, that's kind of neat.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I was left feeling pretty good about the ending.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
Even though in the last section I was like, alright, they're trying to wrap things up pretty quick.

39:19.000 --> 39:23.000
So I think it was a little bit rushed, which is too bad.

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
But for the most part I enjoyed the game, especially for the price of free.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
And I enjoyed my time with it.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
So yeah, I did play through that start to finish.

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
I also played Resogun, which I know a lot of people on PlayStation 4 are playing.

39:36.000 --> 39:41.000
And the only thing that kind of bugged me about Resogun is...

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
I was almost overwhelmed by all the buttons there were for a little shooter.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
Because you have the overdrive and the bombs and everything.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
And I don't think the tutorial in the game is really that good.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
But I figured it out eventually.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
And I guess through a little bit of trial and error I was able to figure out how it works.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
Like, oh, okay, you shoot the little green ships.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
And that's what breaks the guys out of the cage.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
So when you see those, okay, now I've got to go pick up the guys.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
That took me a little bit to kind of get the hang of in some trial and error.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
But once I got the hang of it, Resogun's a pretty fun game too.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
And then one other game that I've been playing...

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Well, I've been playing the two pinball games, of course.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
But those I've already talked about on prior episodes of the show.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
I would say the one other game I've been playing a little bit of on PlayStation 4 is Don't Starve.

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Which is the free game right now for January, which of course is also available on Steam.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
A lot of people playing that on the PC.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
Don't Starve is kind of neat because it's almost, in some ways it's kind of like Minecraft.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
Where you're trying to go around the world and collect things and craft.

40:43.000 --> 40:47.000
And you've got to do things so that the creepers don't get you in the middle of the night.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
It's almost like that same type of thing.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Except it's more in a 2D world.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
But I don't want to make people think it's Terraria because it's not.

40:55.000 --> 41:02.000
It plays a lot more like a overhead, kind of like Zelda-esque, if you will, type of game.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
But you're like gathering things and crafting and trying to survive through the night type of thing.

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
The only thing that bugged me about Don't Starve, and some people are going to criticize me for this viewpoint.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
But I don't care because it's my viewpoint.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
And this bugs me about games.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.000
The game had no tutorial, no explanation, nothing.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Just throws you in and you've got to figure it out.

41:22.000 --> 41:28.000
Okay, I understand that that's the charm of some games and some games are better for that.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
But I'm going to be honest with you guys.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
I didn't like Minecraft for the longest time because of that exact same thing.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
When I first played Minecraft, I was like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
What the hell is this?

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
What am I supposed to do in this game? What's the point?

41:41.000 --> 41:47.000
It wasn't until I played it on the 360 that it had a short five minute tutorial thing where I was like,

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
oh, this isn't so bad. I get this now.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Oh, Minecraft is actually kind of fun.

41:52.000 --> 41:58.000
I think Don't Starve, although I get that the whole joke is the object of the game, Rob, is don't starve.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Okay, yeah, I get that.

41:59.000 --> 42:05.000
But I think even just a couple, a little short explanation about this is what the game, this is what you're supposed to be doing,

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
would have helped a little bit.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
But not everybody is going to agree with me there.

42:09.000 --> 42:16.000
Some will argue that that's the whole charm of the game is being able to see it unfold what the game really is as you're playing.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
But I'm going to tell you, in my mind, that was a little bit of a hindrance in the beginning.

42:20.000 --> 42:26.000
And sure enough, there's Bobby in the chat room saying, they said that that was by design, the lack of a tutorial.

42:26.000 --> 42:31.000
Well, I'm saying that was not a good design choice, in my opinion, and I'm entitled to my opinion.

42:33.000 --> 42:40.000
He's also saying that the PS4 counterparts of Contrast and Flower, both compared to the PS3,

42:40.000 --> 42:46.000
and in the case of Contrast, the 360 version are both maintained framerate and smoothness much better.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Oh, really?

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
Which is interesting because I always seem to remember new consoles, especially new architectures,

42:51.000 --> 42:59.000
kind of lagging in certain ways and not being able to keep up just because the optimizations and efficiencies haven't really been worked out.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
But apparently that's not the case for these.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Okay, at least somebody agrees with me in chat.

43:03.000 --> 43:09.000
Fifth Dream says, yeah, I can't get a hold on Don't Starve, and I don't feel like going to Game Facts to get a manual.

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
That's how I feel.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Let's see, SSJ100Matt says, I'm glad you enjoyed it though, Rob.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Yeah, I had a hard time figuring it at first.

43:16.000 --> 43:21.000
If it weren't for me playing it at PAX East and watching others play it, I wouldn't have gotten it either.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
So there you go.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
Yeah, I did play a little more, and I was starting to get into it.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
I was like, okay, I get it a little more, but it's one of those games I need to go back and play more.

43:30.000 --> 43:35.000
Because honestly, I played Don't Starve for maybe an hour or so, but then I was like, I need to go back and finish contrast.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
So I did.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
Otherwise, PC, I've still been playing a lot on PC.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
I know I've been going on and on, but I've actually been doing a lot of gaming this week.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
I just want to give a shout-out to this game as well, because I was playing an awful lot of it this week.

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
And I continue to play Path of Exile, which is the free-to-play game that's an awful lot like Diablo.

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
Honestly, I think Path of Exile is a better game than Diablo 3.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.000
And one of the things that they do, that Diablo doesn't do, is that they do these races, they do these league races.

44:05.000 --> 44:11.000
And I did my first race this week where it was a one-hour, it was called One Hour Endless Ledge,

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
where you would play the ledge levels of the game that were just over and over.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
There was no caves or anything, you just play those levels over and over.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
And it was who could level the highest in an hour.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
And it was my first time, I didn't do that great.

44:24.000 --> 44:30.000
But I didn't die, it was all in hardcore mode, and I got to level 12 or 13 without dying.

44:30.000 --> 44:35.000
Now the people that were doing really well, they got all the way to level 26 and so forth,

44:35.000 --> 44:41.000
so I ended up maybe in the middle of the pack above a bunch of dead characters.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
But I was still pleased with my progress, and I had fun with it, which is the most important part.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
So yeah, if you like roguelikes, Diablo games, you really owe it to yourself to try Path of Exile.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
That game is great, and I can't believe it's free.

44:54.000 --> 45:01.000
All of the microtransactions are either additional inventory space or cosmetic things,

45:01.000 --> 45:07.000
and they've been making it work, because people have been supporting them after playing a lot of the games.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
That's great.

45:09.000 --> 45:15.000
Alright, over at live.vognetwork.com, Nate432 says,

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
Is Killzone any good to get for PlayStation 4?

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
Again, I don't have any disc-based games yet.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
That's probably in the next week, I'll have some of those.

45:24.000 --> 45:29.000
I've been hearing good things about Killzone, but I have not checked it out myself yet,

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
so I really couldn't say anything about that game.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
DarkSakura in our chat room reminding us, speaking of Diablo-like games,

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
Torchlight 2 is on sale right now.

45:39.000 --> 45:48.000
Yeah, Torchlight 2 is also a really, really great game in that same family as Diablo 3 and Path of Exile and so forth,

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
and that's really good.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Okay, I've yammered on enough.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
There was even more stuff I played, but I've yammered on plenty.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Let's go to some more gaming weeks.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Well, let's see, this week I played a little bit of Minecraft.

46:02.000 --> 46:08.000
In fact, right now I'm spying on the people playing Minecraft right now on the VOG Network server,

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
thanks to the dynamic map that we have on there.

46:11.000 --> 46:16.000
I did play that too, and I'm glad to see more people are using it this time, it's great.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah, we've got three people on there right now, so that's fantastic.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
So I've been doing that, I'm actually doing some planning and stuff,

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
just trying to fix the mob arena thing that we have in there,

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
doing new classes for that, and one of the things we kind of came across today is

46:33.000 --> 46:40.000
I may force upon everybody a resource pack, which will adjust some of the skins in the game

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
to maybe change some of the weapons they have, firing other objects,

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
instead of making them look like hoes, it'll look like a gun or something,

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
so I may put that into effect at some point.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
So I have that, and then, what else did I play? I played a ton of different things actually.

46:59.000 --> 47:03.000
I played Grand Theft Auto 5 this week, I went back and played some of the online in there,

47:03.000 --> 47:11.000
and so far so good there, I leveled up to like 42 I think on Xbox,

47:11.000 --> 47:19.000
and so I played through that and then passed my first survival mode in there, so that was pretty cool.

47:19.000 --> 47:27.000
I played a little bit of Child of Eden, because I actually bought the digital version off eBay

47:27.000 --> 47:31.000
for like 6 bucks a while back using some of my eBay points or whatever,

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
and so I actually played that a little bit because Josh wanted to see me play games,

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
and he wanted to see that game, so I'm like ok fine we'll play that,

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
and so I played that a little bit, it's still fun,

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
and let's see I also tried, there was a couple indie games I checked out,

47:49.000 --> 47:56.000
I did play Time Viking and Space Raptor, which is, it's silly and cheap,

47:56.000 --> 48:01.000
but great music in it, so fun little dollar indie game that you can buy.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
I noticed that like mostly indie games on Xbox Live, indie games as far as like the top ranked ones,

48:06.000 --> 48:13.000
they're all Minecraft type games, or some sort of Deathmatch type games,

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
it's Avatar Deathmatches or Minecraft, that's everything.

48:17.000 --> 48:21.000
Minecraft games are the new hello world for game development.

48:21.000 --> 48:30.000
Pretty much, let's see, I was going to say also, what else did I play,

48:30.000 --> 48:35.000
I played a little bit of Call of Duty, and actually went back this week also

48:35.000 --> 48:42.000
and was working a little bit on Saints Row IV, so I played through that a bit.

48:42.000 --> 48:49.000
What else, I was redeeming some more Steam codes that I've been sitting on for a while from some old Humble Bundles,

48:49.000 --> 49:01.000
so I'm now up to 197 games, and I thought I played some other Steam games that I had, maybe not,

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
but I'm going to try to get through this backlog of games I have maybe this year,

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
and try to play at least everything once.

49:11.000 --> 49:17.000
Alright, well good luck in that goal, especially trying to get through that huge Steam library I know you've got going on there.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Oh yeah.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
A lot of discussion in our chat room over at live.voguenetwork.com around Torchlight 2,

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
there's a couple people interested in it while it's still on that Steam sale,

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
so I see a few people kind of jumping on that, so that's pretty good.

49:27.000 --> 49:34.000
Let's see, Fifth Dream says, I got Child of Eden physical copy for like $4, I haven't played much yet though.

49:34.000 --> 49:38.000
So, looks like you can find that on pretty good sales at some places.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
Before we get into Jason and what he's been playing this week,

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
well DarkSakura wanted me to pass along, because DarkSakura wanted to talk about her gaming week with y'all,

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
and so DarkSakura did not go into-

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
She obviously sent you a virus over IRC.

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
She has passed me her sinus infection somehow through the inner tubes.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.000
DarkSakura says Animal Crossing and My Japanese Coach, she's been playing,

49:59.000 --> 50:05.000
and Russian Dancing Men, aka WeebleStuff version of VibRibbon.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
I have no- is that-

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
She was talking about that last week.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
I've never heard of that, it's kind of neat.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
Well, it wasn't exactly a big topic, but she said it was coming out and she needed to play some of it this week.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Gotcha.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
So she did.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.000
And DarkSakura says, and Minecraft, my Normandy is amazing.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
Yeah, I know, when I logged into Minecraft, I went into the VoG server this week,

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
and I saw that Normandy that you guys built DarkSakura, that is damn impressive.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
It's huge.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
There's a huge Normandy, that ship.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
But the only problem with the Normandy is, there's no door on it.

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
So the only way to get in, somebody finally cut a hole in the ceiling,

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
so I noticed it when I was flying over, I was like, oh, somebody put a hole in the ceiling.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
So I went in and I was like, damn, this thing is huge.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
So that was very impressive.

50:49.000 --> 50:53.000
In fact, I think somebody had left a sign that said, holy shit.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
And so I left another sign that just pointed at it and said this.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
I'm with stupid?

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
Yeah, something like that, something like that.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Well, listen, let me be honest.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
I didn't actually make that, it's a schematic file.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
I just was testing out one of the plugins I have,

51:06.000 --> 51:10.000
which is like a little NPC character that goes around and builds stuff off a schematic.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
So I don't want to have like 50 Normities, though, on the map,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
so that's why I'm not saying how to do it.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
But I will have different schematic files that people will be able to generate.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
You can actually do it instantly with WorldEdit,

51:23.000 --> 51:28.000
but it's more fun watching an NPC run back and forth and actually build it block by block.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
I don't know.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.000
No, that is, I would like to see that in progress sometime.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
That's pretty cool.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
So there's Dark Soccer's gaming week.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
All right, now we can go to Jason.

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Jason, how was your gaming week?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Since it's been forever since I've played it

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
and since I'm a little bit interested in a lot of the stuff that's been added in,

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
I actually downloaded, went back to Minecraft.net and downloaded the client again,

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
and I didn't do anything else with it.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
So I didn't play Minecraft this week.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
I actually jumped into this gaming, this generation of console gaming.

51:58.000 --> 52:03.000
We, for a long time now, the office has a couple of Xbox 360s, a couple of PS3s,

52:03.000 --> 52:07.000
and more often than not, the game that a bunch of my coworkers play is FIFA.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
Earlier in the week last week, or Friday the week before,

52:12.000 --> 52:17.000
sometime very recently, I walked into our little gaming section of the office

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
and there was a whole bunch of green boxes stacked in one of the chairs.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
And I walked over to it wondering what it was,

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
because it seemed kind of familiar, and sure enough, it was an Xbox One and two controllers.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
While I'm still in the office, we'll have all four,

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
and I can actually put the controller that I bought for myself to use.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
When the system by itself came in, there was only Forza.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
We're left to our own accounts, so if I want to buy any games

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
and be able to play them there, I can.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
I didn't.

52:46.000 --> 52:52.000
I downloaded Dead Rising, Killer Instinct, and what was the other demo?

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
Lego Marvel, but I didn't actually get a chance to play that.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.000
So, since Forza was the only title there and I was interested in checking it out,

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
I got the whole system set up, which was kind of a nightmare,

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
because when you turn on the system, you get a picture of the controller

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
and a little pulsating thing over the guide button,

53:13.000 --> 53:16.000
or whatever they're calling it, this generation.

53:16.000 --> 53:22.000
It'll also start showing you the pair button on top if you have to pair it with the system.

53:22.000 --> 53:25.000
So I did that, and it recognized that the controller connected,

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
and then the controller would zoom in and there would be a pulsating light over the A button.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
And I hit it, and it didn't do anything.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
So I tried the other controllers.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
They synced, but the A button didn't do anything.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
TLDR, I reset that console probably six to seven times.

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
Just restarted, not deleted everything and started all over.

53:47.000 --> 53:55.000
I restarted that console at least six times before I could actually get the controller to sync and start it to join the wireless.

53:55.000 --> 54:02.000
To its credit, the entertainment center that we have in the room is basically like a gigantic shielded cage,

54:02.000 --> 54:07.000
so we had to wind up setting the one on top of it so that it could get enough signal to play.

54:07.000 --> 54:14.000
But then there was the 500 meg firmware patch, initial firmware patch that took longer to download than it should have,

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
even after we resolved the wireless problems.

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
A couple strange connectivity issues that I'm, because we used the wireless at work,

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
I'm pretty damn sure is a 360's fault and not ours, but I digress.

54:25.000 --> 54:32.000
It was a hassle. It took two to three hours process that was completely nonsensical.

54:33.000 --> 54:37.000
I don't expect it to happen again if and when I actually wind up buying that console this generation.

54:37.000 --> 54:40.000
Okay, Forza, really, really, really good looking.

54:40.000 --> 54:46.000
BlackWolf made a comment when he was talking about this game a couple weeks ago that the outrage,

54:46.000 --> 54:52.000
the worst thing of Forza is the crowd and they look flat because I think they actually are,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
or certainly they don't have body depth.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
And he said it wasn't a big deal because you don't focus on the crowd.

54:58.000 --> 55:05.000
I'm gonna disagree with that because when I was playing, whenever I play a driving game,

55:05.000 --> 55:14.000
I will either play over the shoulder Birdseye style or I will play in the car itself.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
What other ways are there, Jason?

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
There's technically, so the difference is...

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Dog style, hanging out the side window.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
Ace Ventura, cracked windshield style.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
That's the first time I've heard dog style used in a clean context.

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
I was trying to quip that myself as well.

55:33.000 --> 55:39.000
So to be fair, there's two in-car views with car decoration without car decoration.

55:39.000 --> 55:45.000
And there's various levels like, like, you know, Daytona had the four styles.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
It's basically, those really are the only two ways.

55:47.000 --> 55:52.000
In the beginning, Jason, it just kind of sounded like some car out of the car.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Sometimes I like to be inside and sometimes I like to be outside.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
From space, RC style.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
Sometimes I like warm weather and sometimes I like cold weather.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
Sometimes I'm in the front seat, sometimes I'm in the back seat.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
It's Sunday, it's Sunday.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
So I was playing in the driver's seat.

56:09.000 --> 56:15.000
And the track that I remember most vividly is the Top Gear test course.

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
And the announcers, you know, they're all over that game.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
And the people stick out like a sore thumb.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
Their colors are a little bit off.

56:25.000 --> 56:31.000
And when you're coming up like, you know, you're coming into a turn that's practically a U-turn.

56:31.000 --> 56:36.000
And so you come in on one side of the people, wrap around them and head off.

56:36.000 --> 56:43.000
And when they don't rotate or when you should be able to see the depth of the people and they look off, it's distracting.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Maybe that means I'm not paying enough attention to the road.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
Probably true, but I still picked up to it.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
If it's obvious enough, though, that you kind of look at...

56:51.000 --> 56:54.000
And I've done this in games before where it's like, maybe it's not really a big deal.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
But I'll kind of look at it and go, okay, that looks weird and out of place.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
I've definitely done that before.

57:00.000 --> 57:08.000
When they're putting in the effort to model all of the raindrops on the car and all the different reflections and stuff.

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
But they can't spend a couple polygons extra on the people.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.000
To be fair, there are probably thousands, but the comparison you're making is very relevant.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Did it ruin the game, Joe?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Oh, hell no. It absolutely did not.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It stuck out and it was...

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
You just wanted to disagree with one of Bobby's points here on the show.

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
I am totally okay with that, Jason.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
I... yeah.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Love you, Bobby.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
And at the same time, I also knew about it leading in.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
So, oh yeah, I did see that.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Whatever.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Confirmation bias. I don't know.

57:41.000 --> 57:44.000
But it was still an absolutely gorgeous game.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
I had a whole bunch of fun with it.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.000
To the extent that I can have fun with a simulation racer.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
I'm very much more of an arcade racer.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
I played around with a coworker where I turned all of the assists off.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Ah, that game sucked.

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
Without Anilock breaking and the guide arrow.

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
One little piece of disappointment that I learned is that I thought...

58:06.000 --> 58:11.000
So when I started playing the game, I knew there was a little bit of assistances in breaking, automatic transmission, all that kind of stuff.

58:11.000 --> 58:18.000
But it wasn't until I raced a coworker that I found out that straight up breaking is assisted for you, too.

58:18.000 --> 58:26.000
That kind of disappointed me because that's like half... well over half the challenge of racing is appropriate breaking for drifting and turns and all that kind of stuff.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Can you turn it off bit by bit, though?

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Yes, absolutely.

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
Because I remember... I was like, in Forza Horizon, you could choose what assists you wanted.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
I'm also... and also, you know...

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
There's brakes in this game?

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
What was that?

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
I've never used brakes, so I don't know.

58:38.000 --> 58:42.000
I thought those were the walls that we ran into.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Brakes are for wusses.

58:44.000 --> 58:51.000
And also, to be fair, I have never played a Forza title before. Ever. This was my first one.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
Horizon is so good. I really hope they do Horizon 2 for Xbox One.

58:55.000 --> 59:01.000
Honestly, if they come out at E3 and they're like, Forza Horizon 2 this holiday, I'm gonna be like, I just bought an Xbox One.

59:01.000 --> 59:06.000
Well, you have six months to save up, so five months you can manage.

59:06.000 --> 59:07.000
Totally fair.

59:08.000 --> 59:13.000
But, yeah, I had a really fun time. I started racing on above average.

59:13.000 --> 59:21.000
I liked the fact that I could blow past Black Wolf's Drivatar within the first lap of the race.

59:21.000 --> 59:30.000
Not to keep hammering on Bobby's points, but it's my only frame of reference right now because I haven't played the Xbox One Forza myself.

59:30.000 --> 59:35.000
I know he talked a lot about how the Drivatar system was really... what's your thoughts on that?

59:35.000 --> 59:49.000
I think that's a very hard thing to judge because I just now played the game, I don't have the reference of knowledge of how much detail Bobby went into that game.

59:49.000 --> 59:56.000
So what he did or didn't use assist-wise, what difficulty level he raced on, I have no idea.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I do remember him talking about consistently being about halfway up the field, like 7-6, something like that.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
At least that's what I remember.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I pretty consistently, on the 100% defaults with all assists and on average, could hit first or second without too much difficulty.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I started playing around with some of the assists, then I also turned the difficulty to above average, which is just one step up.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I think there's still two more ahead of it. Fourth, fifth.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Don't be showing off your skill too much here.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:35.000
My real question, I guess, in this is, is the Drivatar system a good thing or a bad thing in your opinion?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I like it because of the bonuses and benefits that it provides to a particular account, to a particular player.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
And the driving felt... I read a lot into the fact that, oh, you're racing a real person instead of AI.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
That's horseshit. It's learned AI.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But it still felt right because there were still the right kind of challenges and the differences between the tracks that people would take.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It wasn't just 12 competing cards on the perfect guideline, and they would actually take insides and outsides when they shouldn't necessarily do that.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:19.000
So it kept the same sort of variety that I've learned from simulation games, and it still felt like a good, challenging race.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I guess that's what it boils down to.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And as those cars can continue to race, they provide credits, in-game credits, back to the player, which seems fun. A benefit for everybody.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Any other Xbox One titles you were just checking, like Killer Instinct?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
A little bit of Killer Instinct, and I am also completely terrible at that game too.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
I went through, I played a couple training matches. Yeah, whatever, I'm okay. I remember a little bit from the SNES days.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:55.000
I started grinding through the dojo, and I got 15 or 16 stages in, and I was starting to understand the mechanic.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
But I was literally just pouring through, this is how you low punch, this is how you low kick.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I've heard that Killer Instinct has a really good tutorial though.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
It's incredibly granular, it is incredibly comprehensive.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000
But it was the last thing I played before I left, so I was kind of running through it as quickly as possible, maybe not reading as much of the detail and getting into it.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
But I want to revisit that, obviously I still have a chance to.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Played a little bit of Dead Rising 3.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
It's Dead Rising?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Oh god, Dead Rising demo has a 30 minute limit, or 20 minute limit, one of the two, and two execution limits.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
You can only start the demo two times.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I don't get it.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
This seems like, like, I...

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
They don't want people to just play the demo over and over.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000
You can't even play, like, give us more than two executions so we can understand if we're gonna play the game differently, let us play the game differently.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But a two execution limit with a time limit is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I mean the DS demos have what, 30? But it's the full game.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Any demo with a limit of how many times you can execute it is fucking stupid.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Yeah, I've played, I've played Sonic, Mario and Sonic at the Summer Olympics, one of the two.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And I knocked down, like, six or seven rounds of that while I was trying to decide if I wanted to pick up the game or not.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:30.000
That's, that's liberal that if you play the demo 30 times, I don't know, I don't see a situation where that's bad.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
But the DS games aren't the full, wait, is the Xbox One demo the full game, or is it just like the first 20 minutes?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I doubt it.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Okay, I was gonna say.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
It drops you in the action and there's no story to speak of.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Okay, because the DS demos, like the ones that I've played, like Kingdom Hearts, Dream Drop Distance, and The Resident Evil, you know, that's just a small section of the game.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Especially the Kingdom Hearts one was not really that in depth, and it still has a 30 play limit.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And it's like, I would maybe need two, but I honestly got a feel for this off one.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I don't know who the, what the character's name is, I don't know why he's doing what he's doing, I don't know where it's taking place, because I don't think it was Willamette or, or, uh...

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
No, it's a whole separate story.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Yeah, and I kind of gleaned a little bit just from the communication that's happening and whatnot, but there are no details of the game.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:22.000
They just start you, which is great, but the two execution limit is still gonna bug me, because I can only play it in theory one more time before I leave.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And I, because I didn't have enough time to play it the first time, that means I have to really make the most of the second time, and then I'm screwed.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Which is very strange to me.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Um...

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Anything else quickly before we get into, I wanna, we've been running for about an hour, so I just wanna make sure we get to news.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Well, if somebody didn't have to talk about so many lewd acts, no, no, no.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Look, the viewers want ass and titties, I'm sorry.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
We gave it to them.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I think that that's certainly the most important. That was the notable parts of my week.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Although I would, I would like to hear more about Xbox One, I just, I'm gonna have to come visit and see it in action.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Do it.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I really did not get a feel for PlayStation 4 until I really got to see it in action, which honestly wasn't until I really got one myself.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And just got to really see how the interface has just, and I imagine it's gotta be the same on Xbox One.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000
It's the same for everything. How can you take something in when you're not in your own, like, comfort zone to sit down there and take it all in?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Exactly, but one thing I noticed about PlayStation 4, and I'm sure you noticed this about Xbox One, is that there was a lot that I was doing on PlayStation 4,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
where I was like, oh, this is what PlayStation 3 needed to do.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Like, queuing up a game to download, and it downloads the game and the patches while you're in standby mode,

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
it just does it, and then it's installed, ready to go the next time you turn on your PlayStation 4.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
That's what we all expected the PS3 to do.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Two quick other anecdotes.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000
A coworker of mine was talking about how slow the installation process is on the Xbox One.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And I agreed with him at the time, but I forgot that Forza is a 6 gig install, and it was gonna take a long time.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
The fact that I was playing after half of it got installed, pretty damn nice.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
I was playing in less than 10 to 15 minutes, if I recall correctly.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And, hey, Weiland, Xbox, turn off. Sorry.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Related to this, another coworker of mine, we were...

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Did you see the video? I don't know if this is where you go with it. Did you see the video on YouTube of the guy who's...

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.000
He actually went into Call of Duty, and his name, his gamertag, was Xbox shut down.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
And so he did this...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Hey, it's Xbox, sign off.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Oh, that's it, thank you. Xbox, sign off.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Sorry to anybody who's listening on Xbox One, I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
And you thought what I did was bad.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I know, unplug your Kinect for a minute, because I gotta tell this story.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
So his name is Xbox, sign off.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
And, like, all these people, while he's playing Call of Duty, because you know how people will tend to call people out.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Hey, Xbox, sign off. Off.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Okay. No, but he would be jumping up and down in front of players, and people would be like,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.000
What the hell are you doing, Xbox, sign off?

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000
The reactions were pretty fucking funny, I gotta say. Anyway, sorry, tangent.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.000
So we were, again, crowded around our gaming room, and me and coworkers were just kind of socializing.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
And we started talking about something that I wanted to show a video of.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And so I'm, you know, I'm facing my coworkers away from the Kinect, and I just kind of turn my head over to the left.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Xbox, launch YouTube.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
One of my coworkers looks at me and busts out in laughter.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And then the TV starts doing things, he's like,

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Whoa! How'd you do that?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
I was like, I just told you, dude. I just told you and the Xbox.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And then he busted up in laughter again, because he didn't realize it was actually gonna work that way.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Kind of fun, relatively natural voice.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:46.000
The fact that there's no dictation, speech to text, is obnoxious.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
There is for being searching, there is not for anything else.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
So far as I could tell, so far as I could figure out.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
A couple of other weird nitpicky things, but I've used my Kinect with the 360 quite a bit.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I enjoyed it. There's better integration on the Xbox One.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I'm gonna take advantage of it.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Hopefully they fix these rough edges for the shitty troll commands.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Alright, let's get into, since we've talked about our gaming weeks,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
and quite extensively gone over some of the new consoles,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
I'm curious, those of you guys that have been getting your PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
what are your guys' thoughts on everything?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Certainly would open up the email bag for that.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Other housekeeping I want to mention, don't forget to follow us on Twitter.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We also have a Facebook page.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
We will be here next week.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
The roadshow we've been talking about doing this month

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
is gonna have to be put on the back burner for a little while.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I'm hoping we can reschedule that for the summer at some point,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
but it's not gonna work out.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
With all the personal stuff people are going through on the show right now,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
it's just not gonna be able to be happening.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
But I'm hoping something like that can be rescheduled for the summer.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
We'll see. That would be exciting.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Alright, anyhow, let's get into gaming news.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Loki, why don't you start us off tonight?

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Yes, so this week at CES, there were some announcements from Sony.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And during their press conference, they announced a few things,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:19.000
including PlayStation Now, which is what they're calling their brand new Gaikai service.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
It's gonna be launching this summer,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
and it's basically meant to bring streaming of PlayStation 3,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
PlayStation 2, and PlayStation games to the PlayStation 4, PS3, Vita,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and other devices, including tablets, TVs, and I'm not sure about phones,

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
but definitely other devices, Android and iOS and stuff like that.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
So very cool.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
And they were even showing off a demo at the convention

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
where people were playing The Last of Us on a Vita.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And apparently it worked pretty well.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
But it's hard to say right now how it's actually gonna work in a real-world environment

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
since they had the server basically down the hall,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:07.000
but it looks pretty cool and something that I'm looking forward to,

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:12.000
especially since I have a big library of PlayStation Plus games.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It'll be interesting to see how well those will stream.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Yeah, it's one of those things where you really don't know how it's gonna go

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
until you are able to get your hands on it.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000
And I just think there's so much potential for variables.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
And even though PlayStation might be able to get this thing working flawlessly in their bubble,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
how's it gonna work in the real world?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000
For people that live out maybe not in a major city, is it really gonna be that good?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
How's it gonna work?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Well, they said it's basically that you only need five gigabits down,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
I think is what the minimum was for it to work.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
That's still high for some people.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
For a lot of people it's not bad.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
For some people that's still high.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
True, but networks are improving and speeds are getting faster.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Yes, that's true.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So maybe by the summer it'll be rolled out in more locations,

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
and it's not necessarily something that everybody wants to do.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I don't know, I think it's a neat idea.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Yeah, I'm curious to see too what pricing looks like.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
I love the idea of possibly a Netflix-style library for PS1 and PS2 games.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
That would be freaking awesome.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
The other thing is they mentioned that there may be some sort of rental program built into there,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
as well as some sort of subscription program that would be separate from PlayStation Plus.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I'd be wondering too if I bought games on, let's say on PlayStation 3,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I actually bought PlayStation 1 games in the store,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
because there was a couple of those I bought.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I think about Castlevania Chronicles and City Code and One.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
If I bought those games in the store, would I get access to those on PlayStation 4?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I would think that you probably would.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
You would think, but maybe not.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
I don't think it should be a given.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I mean, look at Virtual Console.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
You have to pay a dollar to upgrade on Wii U.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Yeah, but look at a lot of the stuff that Sony's done.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Most of their stuff is cross-buy anyway,

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000
so they were kind of the people that brought that to the forefront as far as,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
hey, you buy it on one console, you get it on all of the consoles.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Nintendo hasn't really picked up on that yet.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.000
They figured, hey, we can charge you a few extra bucks for this Virtual Console title,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.000
because one, we overcharge you from the get-go in the first place,

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:31.000
and two, we did things to it this time, so you need to pay us more money.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
I was going to say the same thing with the cross-buy initiative.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I think it's a pretty safe thing to say that Sony will be as loose with it

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:44.000
in terms of compatibility that they can with regard to things like compatibility.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Well, we'll see. More details probably on this in the coming months.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Did they say that this was coming out sooner rather than later,

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
or is it the type of thing where we won't see more until E3?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Summer.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So E3, you'll see a lot more on this.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Maybe they'll unveil it, or they'll roll it out at E3. Who knows?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
All right. Well, meanwhile, in the world of Xbox One,

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Xbox One, you can view Twitch streams on Xbox One,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
but you can't broadcast ass and titties yet on Xbox One.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And a lot of people are asking, well, when is that going to happen?

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Well, a tweet from Twitch TV themselves indicates that it might be a little while.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
A tweet that went out earlier this week said,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Xbox One direct broadcasting. There is no ETA at this time for Microsoft.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Expect a few more months. If we know sooner, we'll update.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And there's no reason for this. We don't know what the real holdup is or what's going on.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
We don't know if maybe Microsoft might actually be seeing what's going on on Sony's system

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
and some of the things we talked about at the beginning of the show.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Maybe they're getting some cold feet about some of it. I don't know.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Or it could just simply be a programming. I mean, we don't know.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
We could make things up until the cows come home.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
But it doesn't seem like it's going to be happening anytime soon.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
I want to say I saw a related story where an executive said,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000
We promised it before E3. So this thing could not be out until April or May or even early June at this point.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Or maybe I think they could still get away with putting it out at E3 and still come out looking good.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I think maybe it's just more complicated because the way they have their systems set up.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
The fact that it's like three operating systems running on top of each other.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:28.000
That they may not know how. It may be hard to. What exactly do we show on this?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Is it just going to show everything or is it going to show just the game?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Or we can also have this stuff that's snapped in there because remember it has an HDMI in on it.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
That could be maybe there's some sort of abuse to that.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
They're just trying to make sure they can filter all that stuff out maybe.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Maybe. We'll see. So I'm very curious to see how different it looks when it comes out.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Or if it's going to be very similar to what you see on PlayStation 4.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Well it's going to look like Metro I'll tell you that much.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Which is a whole bunch of squares so maybe it's not too terribly different from what the PS4 did.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Is everything a table of blocks and tables and squares and maybe not so squares? It's just the easy thing to do.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Even the PlayStation one is kind of blocks and squares though.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
It could be worse. It could be like the Vita where everything circles.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
You mean Google Plus style?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Alright.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.000
State of Decays developer Undead Labs has signed a multi-year, multi-title agreement with Microsoft Studios.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:36.000
A lot of the speculation of what this means is that Undead Labs can start proceeding.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.000
That they got the green light for an MMO that is still going under the name Class 4 right now.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
But that doesn't really suffice the multi-title agreement.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
But that's the odds on favorite to take place.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
New contract which is a nice antithesis to everything that was happening last week with everything just kind of disappearing.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So at least we're getting a positive outlook continuing into the year.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I would just like to see an actual, I guess we will see an MMO on the Xbox One once the Elder Scrolls Online launches.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
But maybe something else on there?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
It'll happen.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I mean online is prevalent and powerful enough now that if they're not doing it they're missing out.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Well I don't know how it is on Xbox One because I know Killer Instinct is their big free to play thing that's out.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And I don't know what else is there but I did notice there is a pretty big push on PlayStation 4.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:41.000
There's several free to play things, like I knew there was DC Universe but I didn't realize there was Warframe.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
There's one other one that's like a free to play first person shooter on there.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.000
There's already like a handful of free to play things on PlayStation 4 so I don't know.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Anything that you may have picked up from PlayStation Plus is only sweetening the deal.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Yeah really.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Well I don't know, to be honest these free to play games that are available on PlayStation 4 I don't know if they're system sellers.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
They're all available on PC.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Well maybe not system sellers but let's compare your experience of starting to mine.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I played one, two retail titles now with FIFA.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I've played two retail titles now and everything else was a demo.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:23.000
The marketplace on Xbox One didn't rub me the right way just in available titles and especially arcade titles in general.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Yeah they were out there but they weren't particularly prevalent and it felt like I would look through, I would thumb through the catalog in ten seconds and I had seen everything and I was done with it.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I think, I don't think PlayStation 4 is as much better as you might think.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:46.000
There's still, I mean the good news is a lot of the stuff that's there, there's a lot of free to play stuff with the pinball and so forth and the PlayStation Plus stuff since they didn't have Drive Club.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Remember, Contrast and Resogun weren't supposed to be free but they ended up pushing those through as free because they weren't able to get Drive Club out for the launch.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:04.000
And these are new consoles, they haven't had a chance for the catalog to come up or new titles and not just classic whatever backwards compatibility system they do have.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Yeah, still to come.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Alright, let's go to Loki.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Alright, so of course the MPD numbers have finally come out and before that there were some pre-end of the year announcements of sales and for 2013 the Nintendo 3DS software sales of course increased and they've sold 11.5 million units in the US.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And I guess they're planning to announce their third quarter earnings later this month but right now they're saying that's a 45% increase in software sales from 2012.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Which, yeah, there's a lot of good titles that came out this year and even I would think a lot of stuff that was coming out at the end of the last, well 2012, like Mario Kart 7 and Super Mario 3D Land or whatever it was.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Those are some good titles so they've had a pretty good year I'd say.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Moving on from that, let's get our first look at next gen sales.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
The 3DS had a good year but did they say anything on the Wii U at all?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Oh no, Wii U what?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Yeah exactly, that's what worries me a little bit is when Nintendo doesn't really say anything about the Wii U then you kind of go, hmm.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I think we've all known this though that 2013 was a rough year for them.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Well, but then there was that wank that came out last week about how VG Charts had said that they outsold the Xbox One in the last week.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Wasn't that like literally like two days of the end of the year though? Plus it was an end of the year story.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Just saying.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Colin, 2012, 2012 was a wash, 2013 was a year.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Let's put it this way, they outsold the Xbox One for the entire year but the Xbox One has been out for a month and a half versus the Wii U that was out for the entire year.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Oh, I didn't even realize that the time, that's just plain silly.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:20.000
That's what they were talking about. Not in that same time frame as when, you know, not in that six week time frame, they're talking about the entire year.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So yeah, that's not that impressive.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Alright.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Speaking of the Xbox One though, the Xbox One hit 3 million sales before the end of the year.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000
And that's actually sold through and not just sold to stores.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:45.000
They of course, they passed the 1 million mark on the first day of retail across 13 markets because they launched globally.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000
And it only took them 18 days to make 2 million.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:21:06.000
And of course, to go along with that, Sony announced during their press conference at CES that they've sold 4.2 million units of consoles worldwide as of the 28th of December.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And I guess they were saying that they were meaning to ASL another, they sold 2.1 million units across December.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000
So that's pretty good. I'm not sure what they're forecasting though for 2014 but they definitely hit their number.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I think they were originally saying they wanted to hit 3 million by the end of the year so not bad.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Yeah, they're still pretty hard to find so 15 million units! Pinky's up. Anyone knows.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Well it's going to be interesting because I think, like I mentioned before, I think we're running into a similar situation where there's not a whole ton of content coming out.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I mean they've got actually a little bit more for Playstation 4 and Xbox One versus the Wii U.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000
The Wii U I actually posted on Twitter. The Wii U is running into the same damn problem it had before with last year where there's nothing coming out.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:21.000
There's literally 4 titles, 4 retail releases between now and April. And they're not big titles either.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I mean there's Donkey Kong so that's going to be coming out but the rest of them are really small third party titles that have been delayed.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I mean Hello Kitty I guess you want to save the game of the year for that but there's 4 titles coming out in 3 months.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000
That's kind of the same problem we had last year. That's not going to move systems.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Yeah that's not good. That's not good news. But I mean that's unfortunately a direct result of the third party abandonment of Wii U.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Yeah.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Alright well let's move on to... I don't know if this is better news but Jason what do you have for us?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:11.000
I was reading an article over the course of the week, an op-ed posted on Polygon by Ben Kucera.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:27.000
And basically what it boils down to is that we've made a big deal about how these super crazy 3 fourths, 80%, 90% sales, we live for this kind of stuff on Steam, Desura, GOG and anything else.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:39.000
And that a couple of people have expressed how they feel like it's unfair to the original authors, to the original developers, designers, the publishers and everything else of a video game.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
And basically this article struck me as really interesting because it reminded us, it reminded me of a really specific point.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:56.000
There were some games that were less than 6 months old that went on sale, usually not more than 50% at most and usually much less.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Probably from what I recall of looking at the catalog definitely closer to like 25, 30, 15% those kinds of things.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:18.000
And what it boils down to is that when you release a game, unless you have a crazy resurgence cult smash, when you release a game you make up, you recoup any sales you're going to in the first month or two.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Because after that people have probably forgotten about it.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:29.000
That's changing with MMO and other long living kinds of games but you know the rush to get the game is going to happen in the first month or two.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000
And immediately after every other additional sale is as good as it's going to get.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
If it's full price, great.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:51.000
But if the long tail is made up of a ton of people paying less than that, it's still worth it because it will be more exposure because more people will be willing to pick it up when it's at a discounted rate.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:25:06.000
So any, at least some individuals feel that if you feel that these sales are an outrage to popular games that would otherwise make a lot more money, probably not.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Because they've already made what they're going to make in large part.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Everything's reported as the first week, the opening week, the opening month.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:23.000
After that, it's not exactly as defined and it's really just up to the long lasting nature of the game for them to be able to continue raking in any additional income.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
That's very true, is that most games are judged within its first month of sales.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:36.000
You get very, very, very few games where it's like, oh this game was a slow burn but it ended up doing okay.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Or you know, oh this game made a big revival later on.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Like maybe a game like Katamari Damacy did that, but how long ago was that game, you know?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And Mario is going to be in a pretty similar situation. We were talking about how 3D World was not doing particularly well.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:00.000
It was the lowest selling game in its launch window in its first week or first month than any other previous Mario game and there's been a steady decline of that.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:11.000
But as more people pick up the Wii U and this kind of stuff becomes available, it will have, it should have a good, you know, resounding success over the long term.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And Nintendo stuff doesn't get discounted that much. Like I don't know that I've ever seen a Mario game in the bargain bin.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
That's true.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.000
So those games more than anything else have a chance of riding out good two, three year.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Although they might have to discount the system again.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
I think they're going to have to.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Give away the razor to sell the blades.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Yeah.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Why can't they just have like Steam sale type sale on virtual console games? I mean, that would be fantastic.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:47.000
They were for a hot minute. Like they were doing that 30 cent promotion. Like, you know, where the games, which is, you know, practically free.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Because 30 cents is nothing. But yeah, they didn't, they didn't, that went for just like last year and they haven't really done anything like that since.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:07.000
I know Wii U does do sales once in a while, but it's, you know, so does, so does the Xbox marketplace and so does PlayStation four, you know, it's, it's really nothing different than what you see there.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
So, all right, Jason, I think you have something else for us.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Yeah. Double header.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Double header.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Continuing financial news and results and everything else. Basically, as of the conclusion of the year, due to many other non-gaming facets of Sony, Sony's stock fell to a rate that Nintendo had a wider market cap than them.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:41.000
This is also in the, oh, what's the Japanese stock exchange called, the Nikkei, I think.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Sony, Sony's market cap dropped to 1.86 trillion yen, which is about 17 and three quarters billion.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:59.000
And Nintendo's market cap was still above 1.93 trillion yen, about 18 and a half billion, 18,500 billion.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
If that number actually makes sense in your brain, it barely does in mine.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But the, and this is, this is, this is in large part, conceded as the fact that Sony is a huge company that has stakes in not only gaming, but also in media, both music and movies.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Publishing as well as development, as well as licensing and everything else that the, you know, that the Sony conglomerate covers, where Nintendo has largely shrunk down to a single purpose.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:44.000
So it's kind of spectacular to see that somebody that does less is able to withstand a company that reaches all of digital entertainment in the modern era.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:52.000
And going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says, poor Sony.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:29:03.000
You know, I don't think anybody's really crying for Sony in this case, because, you know, Sony's still selling a shit ton of PlayStation 4s, and it's probably a better story right now than what the Wii U's got.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000
And everything that is successful can be spun off.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:19.000
You know, these are all subsidiary companies and everything else that can be sold off selectively, so that other places post better gains, and the hemorrhaging wounds are skirted out.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Sony has survivability one way or another, and by no means does this spell bad for Sony. They'll survive.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Yeah, and they will. But this also goes a long way for the people that are like, oh Nintendo should just throw in the towel and make mobile phone games.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:41.000
It's like, did you forget about the 3DS? You must have just forgot about the 3DS. You must have just forgot that it's there.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:50.000
There's even some companies like EA that have, you know, not only have they cut off Wii and Wii U, they're also done with the 3DS.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:57.000
You know what, though? The news isn't that great for EA. Two words, Loki. Battlefield 4.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
And no NCAA, so that's even less money coming in.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.000
I have a really, really, really quick comment about that.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Sure.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:16.000
A new coworker just started last week. You wanna guess, in the context of EA and Battlefield, you wanna guess what his username on Twitter is?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Fuck EA?

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:20.000
DICE. Who's the company that develops...

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Oh no.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
You'll never guess the kind of tweets he's been getting in the past month in large part.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
They make for good stories, though.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Oh my gosh.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Pretty hilarious.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
He must have in his bio line, I did not make Battlefield.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
There's actually three different kinds. There's a rapper in Texas or something like that.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000
And then EA, DICE. And then reality TV show somebody's cousin or something? I don't know.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But he also starts to retweet some of this stuff so the people that actually know what's going on...

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
It makes for great stories. I've been laughing so hard.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000
Is this him here?

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000
That's him.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Blaming me for Battlefield 4 will get everything fixed.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I love that he has a sense of humor about it.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
He's taking it in stride. He's a wonderful guy.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
It's great.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:13.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Zones Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, ball.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:23.000
And let's see what unfinished games are coming out to a store near you very soon, if anything. Loki.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Nothing this week.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Thankfully though, after this week, once we get into the 28th, we'll actually get some games coming out.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I was going to say, the end of this month, the Tomb Raider HD edition, whatever they're calling it, is out, right?

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.000
And then February, you get the Rayman.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Definitive Edition.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Yeah, Definitive Edition. You get the Rayman ones too.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.000
My mistake. Nothing for two weeks. I forgot. There is still another week in there, so wow.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Yeah, it's still a drought. But once we hit the 28th, then there will actually be game releases every week, so that's good.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Alright, we're starting to get back into it.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Alright, speaking of getting back into it, Japan finally seeing some releases after a couple, a little bit of a drought for them.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
So Japan does have a few things right now.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:11.000
A lot of it though is price reductions, although there is some new stuff, but you do have price reductions on Borderlands 2, the Game of the Year edition.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Musou Orochi 2 and Shinsekoku Musou 6 Empires, all kind of going into their best hits.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
The only new game I see on PlayStation 3 is Short Piece.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Tsukugime Ranko no Ichiban Nagai He comes out this week.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Like a miniature version of One Piece?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Bandai Namco. What, Short Piece?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
That was a dumb joke.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Yeah, it sure was.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Well, I'm trying to look at screenshots of this game to see kind of what it is, because I don't know, is this like an anime?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:44.000
It kind of looks like it might be based on an anime. I'm just not as familiar with those, but I see a lot of anime-looking cutscenes here.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:49.000
What the hell game is this? Oh, Bullet. It's got to be a shooter. I see a bullet meter.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
And a...

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
What?

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Is that a giant dog game?

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
It is. It is a giant dog.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
It's here to wreck your day.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000
The things when you can't put screenshots together, my god.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Can you put that on the YouTube for people or something?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I certainly can.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Such destruction. Many shooting. Wow.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Very bullets.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000
Very bullets.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Much dodge.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
There you go. Bullet dodge.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
Bullet dodge.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:25.000
All right. On the Xbox 360 in Japan, the only thing of note there is that Borderlands 2 goes to the Game of the Year edition there as well.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
On the PlayStation Vita, nothing this week.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:37.000
On the Wii U, nothing this week. In fact, they don't have anything until February when Puyo Puyo Tetris comes out in February on Wii U.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Let's see. On the 3DS, Vitamin X Evolution Plus.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I don't think that's a drug-dealing game. I think that's just something else there.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
On the 3DS, and lastly...

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000
They don't have drugs in Japan.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Classic game, like Dr. Mario.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:58.000
On the PSP, Chō no Dokuhana no Kusari Taisho Iroki Ibun comes out from Prototype.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Yes, they are still a steady stream of PSP games in Japan.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:06.000
So, go figure. This looks like kind of like a... I don't know if it's like a romance game.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Definitely a dating or visual novel game.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Yeah, but that looks like objection.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Objection!

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:17.000
I love that Phoenix Wright in that scene there. It's love and lawyers or something. I don't know. There you go.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
How about the UK, Jason?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Kind of a light week continuing. It'll be a nice time whenever these releases start to really ramp up later this year.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
But tomorrow, possibly today already with the time zones.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000
On the 13th, Nidhogg on the PC. On the 14th, The Banner Saga reaches PC.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:44.000
On the 15th, they finally will be getting Assassin's Creed Liberation HD on the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Dr. Luigi on the Wii U.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Lastly, on the 17th of January, Mario Party Island Tour comes to the 3DS.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And that's that.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week. Loki.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Alright, so Nintendo, they've won a patent lawsuit.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:12.000
This was actually one of the companies that was suing them based off of the, I want to say a patent that had to do with the Wii Balance Board and the censors in that.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:25.000
And as part of it, not only did they win against IA Labs, but IA Labs was forced to pay them compensation for their legal fees and stuff and had no money to do so.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
What did they do instead? They went ahead and bought up all of IA Labs' patents.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000
So, they're not going to be doing that again.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
That is a shockingly good turn of events.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Well, judgments aside about whether or not their patents were or weren't deserved in the first place, the fact that they couldn't pay is something I've not really heard of.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And for Nintendo to just kind of bring in all of those and not have them sold off to somebody else that turns around and does the same damn thing.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Good news for Nintendo.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Yeah.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Very good news.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:01.000
Alright, one more story for you guys about arcade games.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Ironically, after we kind of reminisced a little bit on last week's show about some of the big pompous things, like prop cycle and things like that.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:17.000
There was an interesting article that was ran on USgamer.net this week that talked about what the 10 biggest grossing arcade games of all time were.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Actually, no, I take that back. It wasn't this week, it was actually last week.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.000
It kind of slipped under the radar though, so it was called to our attention this week.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
But I wanted to go over it because, hey, arcade games.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And I also thought it was interesting because not a lot of the games were modern.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:41.000
I don't know if you've peaked at this story at all, but Jason, if you were to guess, and Loki, I don't know if you've peaked either, but if you guys were to guess, what would you say would be some of the biggest arcade grossing games of all time?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I would easily put those for any of the tabletop and various format games from the late 80s, early 90s.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:55.000
At least a couple of these would be owned by the Donkey Kongs and DigDogs and Jousts and Rally-X.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:04.000
More recently than that, oh god, I would assume that at least one of them has to be, like, some kind of game.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
But that's about all I could really guess.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.000
I would have said for sure Pac-Man, because that game was so huge in the 80s, don't underestimate it.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
And Street Fighter II, for sure, because that game...

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
That's what came to mind as a classic fighting game that probably made it.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:28.000
I would have also guessed newer games like Capcom vs. SNK 2, I would have guessed Soul Calibur, I would have guessed Driving Games, I would have thought Initial D.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I would have guessed Dance Dance Revolution, to be honest, would be on this list.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I would sooner say Daytona USA than Initial D.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But maybe it's because games like that have several incarnations.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
There's the original Pac-Man, yes, there's Ms. Pac-Man, but there really wasn't much beyond that.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Whereas, you know what, there's like 17 Dance Dance Revolution games, and Driving Games and so forth.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Well, here it is. Here's what the top games are of all time, time, time, time.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Now, keep in mind, this is also with adjusted revenue.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000
And that's a big factor too, because when I tell you number 10 is Space Ace, you might go, huh?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:11.000
That's for a game that was critically acclaimed, but not exactly the highest success, because it's very strange nature.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
It also took two or three quarters to play the game.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Which, you know, back in 1984, whenever this game was out, yet now two or three quarters is kind of commonplace.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Back in 84 it was very rare, so, you know.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Number 10 was Space Ace, number 9 was Time Traveler, and by name alone, I was like, what the fuck game was that?

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000
And then I was like, oh god, it's the hologram game that Sega put out.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
This game was awful. I would have never guessed it was in the top 10.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.000
But because it was the hologram game, and that part of it was pretty cool, you know, it eats up quarters.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Because people are like, OMG, it's magic.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Number 8 was Tron, which I would say is a pleasant surprise.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I would not have guessed that that would have been in the top 10, but it was, so I go, okay, cool.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Number 7, Dragon's Lair, for the same reason as Space Ace.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Number 6, Defender, which I think sometimes we forget how big this game was.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
A game like Resogun? Heavily inspired by Defender.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
So, you know, how does...

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Number 5, Donkey Kong, as you would have guessed, which, you know, I'm sure.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Number 4, Street Fighter II.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Number 3, Street Fighter II Championship Edition.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
So they are counting them as separate games, and that's kind of interesting that, you know,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000
but if you were to put those two together, it would probably be damn near number 1.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Number 2, Space Invaders, which, as you remember, is probably bigger in Japan than it was here,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
but it was still a big deal here.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And then, of course, number 1, Pac-Man, which I'm sure is a surprise to nobody.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I'm surprised Daytona's not on there, because there's Daytona machines everywhere.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Number 1, Pac-Man.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:51.000
If you adjust the inflation on how much this game has made since its launch in 2013...

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Keep in mind, these machines still make money. Still.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000
You know, because every barcade's got a Pac-Man machine, and people go,

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
LOL Pac-Man. I even do. I play Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man if I see a machine.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000
I'm like, oh, what the hell? For old times' sake, right?

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Let's see if I can get to board 256 today.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Paperboy, Marble Madness, and Punch-Out pretty much, and Tapper at the drop of a hat if I see it.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:17.000
3.4 billion dollars. Billion.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:23.000
Avatar is like the highest-grossing movie ever made, and it's only made about 1 billion. 1.1 and change.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Pac-Man's made 3 billion plus.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
That's also in a much smaller window. As soon as Avatar's gone, it's gone.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Home video, yeah, whatever, but same kind of argument as retail games.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Outside of a certain window, they're done, and then you just pick up the onesie-twosies afterwards.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
Alright, let's do a little bit of reminiscing since we're talking about arcade games.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Let's do a little more reminiscing in a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Every week, Dark Sakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds the game that she thinks,

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
hey, you kids should be playing this game this week, dammit.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
But this week, she missed.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.000
But this week, she got sick. She OD'd on playing too much of the game she was going to pick for you guys,

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
which I admit was a really cool game, so I almost said, oh, I'll just do her game for her,

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
but then I'm like, ah, but she might want to talk about it.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
So we're going to shift her game to a future week when she's back,

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:21.000
and I'm going to take over, mwahahaha, with a game that I have chosen for this week's Classic Game of the Week.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:27.000
And the Classic Game of the Week that I have picked this week is a game called Arkon.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Alright, Arkon, the light and the dark.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Arkon was probably best known on the Nintendo.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
It was an NES game, so a lot of people know it from the Nintendo,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
and the video that you guys are going to see on YouTube comes from the Nintendo version as well.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
But I also remember this as what?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
A Commodore 64 game.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.000
This is a Commodore 64 game that a lot of people mistake as a chess game when they first look at it,

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
because it does look an awful lot like chess.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
You have a lot of, like, pawn style pieces that are in the front,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
and you have stronger pieces that are in the back and so on,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:07.000
but, you know, Arkon is the type of game that could really only be done in the digital era,

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
because the game board shifts and changes colors,

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:14.000
and your pieces have spells and all this crazy stuff in the game.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:20.000
This game you probably also would know as the game that has the battle arena,

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
not to be confused with battle chess,

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.000
but when two pieces meet up, they actually do battle with each other.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
They actually go into an arena, and you use the controller to move them around,

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000
and, you know, if you just have one of the little pawns, like one of the little goblins,

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
and when you hit the button, he's just going to go with a sword.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Oh, we're going to see a battle taking place right now, actually,

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000
with a unicorn and a little goblin guy, and that goblin guy is hosed,

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:45.000
because he just has a little club, but you can beat the unicorn over the head with it,

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
but the unicorn can, like, fire projectiles.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Of course, the unicorn is going to win in that particular case.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So that's kind of how the battles work there.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
So, I mean, it's very much unlike chess in that regard.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Just because you move on to a square doesn't mean you're necessarily going to capture it.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
So, the original development of this game was for Atari 8-bit computers in 83,

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000
but it was ported, of course, to the NES, the Commodore 64.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:14.000
It was also on the ZX Spectrum, the Amiga, IBM PC, Macintosh, PC-88, Amstrad CPC.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Whoo, it was on a lot, a lot of different systems.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:20.000
How is it possible to port to that many different systems back in the day?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
In the 80s, that was common.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.000
I mean, yeah, games were simpler, but, I mean, come on.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Today, we at least have, like, modern technologies to make that kind of thing easier.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
One or two dudes did it.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.000
In fact, the designers of Arkon, three guys,

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I'm sorry, actually not, I shouldn't say three guys,

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
because there was actually a woman as well.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Ann Westfall was one of the designers of this game.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.000
John Freeman and Paul Reich III all did this game, so that's pretty cool.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
So, you might think the game is chess, but of course it's not.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
The pieces are, you know, moved around by the player,

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
and some have different moves than others,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.000
but of course getting rid of a piece is not automatic,

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
because sometimes they will do battle.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:06.000
The squares on the board actually can affect the battle,

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
because if a dark player is on a dark square,

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
then they're going to get a bonus,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.000
but if they're on a light square, they're going to have a hindrance.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And some of the squares on the board actually change color,

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.000
so that's kind of interesting.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And then you also have some really cool pieces,

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:25.000
like the shape shifter will actually just become whatever piece it's fighting.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:28.000
And then like the phoenix was exploded,

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
it didn't have projectiles at all,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
it actually just turned into a ball of fire and slash a shield.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Each side also has a spell caster that kind of serves as the king or the queen,

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000
depending on what side you're on.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
The light side gets the wizard, the dark side has the sorceress.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And they have different spells that can be used,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000
such as like teleport and heal and things like that.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Either to win, you either destroy all of the pieces on the opposing side,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000
or you occupy all five power points.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
But that wizard I mentioned a minute ago, or sorceress,

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
is in one of those power points,

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
so you really are going to have to take that piece out if you really want to win the game.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
So, there you go.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:10.000
The game was very well received when it came out and got pretty high reviews.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:15.000
In 1996, Computer Gaming World said it was the 20th best game of all time.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
IGN named it the 50th best in 2003,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
so a lot of people remember this game pretty fondly.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000
There were sequels that came out to the game as well.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
There was Arkon 2 Adept,

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:32.000
there was Exciter was the third game, although people don't know those as well.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
However, people might know some of the remakes.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:40.000
1994 had Arkon Ultra, which was big because it had modem play.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I wanted this game so bad when I was a kid, but my parents wouldn't buy it for me.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I was so mad.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Real teenage problems, right?

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Thanks, ma'am.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
But now that I'm a big kid and pay my own bills,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000
I can actually go and buy Arkon myself,

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
because there's actually a version of it on Steam that's available.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And that is, I think, Arkon...

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
There's different rewrites of the game.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.000
There's Arkon Evolution that was in 2008.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Everything on Steam is all Arkon Classic.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:15.000
But I think it's Arkon Conquest was the game that they actually put out.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
There's a version on iPhone as well.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
And then, yeah, there's Arkon Classic.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000
But no, there's a version that's actually on Steam right now

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
that's like a newer version. I have it in my library.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
It's still called Arkon Classic.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
No, there's a different one. I know there is.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Is there Arkon Ultra, maybe?

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
I searched for Arkon, and there was the trailer, the demo, and the full title

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
all called Arkon Classic.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Maybe you still haven't got delisted, something like that?

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Yeah, I doubt that.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
And Tigerclaw in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Do you think this game needs a next-gen remake?

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Well, it's kind of already had one.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Well, there's one on Steam right now.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So let me see if I can actually find it.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Maybe it is Arkon Classic, but I thought...

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:03.000
By Classic, it does not look like the classic Spectrum NES C64 version.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
It is Arkon Classic. I thought it had a different name to it.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.000
It's just a graphically improved version of the classic gameplay, by the looks of it.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
That's still really cool, though. Yeah, I've played a little bit of this.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
It's pretty cool.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
And yeah, the boards can take different shapes,

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
and you can do some different things with that, so...

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Very cool.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Did you ever play this game, Loki?

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
No, I never played Arkon.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Oh, I love this game. Did you play it, Jason?

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000
It was a fun game.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
I've seen it. I think this is one of those games

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000
that I didn't understand how to get started of it, so it didn't last very long.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
But I've definitely poked at it.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Again, here's my whole thing where it's like,

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
there's no tutorial.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Was there ever in the 90s?

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Yeah, in the 80s. I guess there really wasn't.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
So, there you go.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Tigerkongchat says,

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Has there ever been a speedrun of Arkon?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
I wonder how long it would take to beat.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Yes, there are on YouTube, and I think the answer is a minute and a half.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I mean, especially with long-moving, diagonal-moving characters,

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
you can make a little bit of room and get there in a hurry.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000
SSJ100Matt noted that the company founded by one of these developers

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
went on to do some of the Skylanders games.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
So, these guys are still involved with gaming in some way or another.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Anyway, one of my favorites.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I played a shit ton of this on the Commodore 64,

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
and then when it came out on the NES, I was like,

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
there's music, and the graphics are so good.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
This is next-gen, baby.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.000
On the NES.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
So, yeah, this is a game I remember fondly,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
so that's why I picked it, Arkon.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I guess for the NES, since that's the version I played there,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
because it had the Commodore 64 version,

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
that didn't have the background music,

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
but I remember the Commodore 64 version fondly,

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
although the original original version,

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
of course, on a completely different system altogether.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.000
So, there you go.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
There's your classic game of the week.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
We're going to take a break, but when we come back,

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
there is plenty more OLR to come, including rapid-fire news,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:54.000
the FUGL question of the week,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:58.000
and, of course, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio,

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
when we come back with more of OrangeLoungeRadio,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
right after this.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Welcome back, everybody, to OrangeLoungeRadio,

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
live on this Sunday evening, January the 12th of 2014,

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.000
with the 535th episode of our show already in progress.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Again, we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000
voggenetwork.com, Sunday nights at 6 Pacific, 9 Eastern,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
and a lot of you guys in our chat room,

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.000
over at live.voggenetwork.com,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
participating with tonight's show.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
We've been reading a lot of fun little comments.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Some of our topics we were talking about earlier in the show,

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
generating a lot of chat.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Well, they appeal to a lot of people.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Some good discussion there.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
DarkSakura, not here tonight, but she is in chat,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
so the live listeners can at least interact with her.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Podcasters, you can always send an email

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
if you're listening on the podcast,

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
be it either on the podcast feed,

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
or through Stitcher, or what have you.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Now, some things to look forward to on upcoming episodes

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
of the show of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Next weekend is a three-day weekend,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
so I'm hoping that means maybe a little bit...

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000
The road show may not have happened,

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
but maybe a little bit of liquor will happen next week.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000
A safe, of course.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:08.000
We're not going to get crazy like the people on PlayStation 4,

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
but it might be a little bit of liquor on next week's show.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Dunk show.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That should be fun.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000
In a couple weeks, coming up on February 2nd,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I think it is, if I got the date right,

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.000
February 2nd, he may have just left Hoard House,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
but he's going to be here in person on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Shane Olinko is going to be here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000
He has not been on OLR outside of a call.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:31.000
It's been a very long time.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
It's probably been about five years,

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
so we're going to get caught up a little bit there

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
and give him crap for leaving Hoard House and all that stuff.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
No, I'm kidding.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000
What games are you going to try to push on you guys now?

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
I don't know. Oh, no, I do know.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
He is bringing his PlayStation 4 copy of Skylanders

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.000
because he's convinced he can get me addicted to that stuff,

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000
and I'm like, no!

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Don't do it.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
That'll be the first week that everybody gets a reprieve from my voice.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
If you're going to get hooked on something,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
at least make it Disney Infinity.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I thought that was your last show, was that same night?

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000
No, a week before.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.000
My current plan, and of course this can still change

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.000
because work's going to determine how long I stay here,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:13.000
but I'm currently planning on being back on the road on the 1st,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.000
so this time that weekend I should either be listening to everybody's wonderful voice

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:22.000
as I coast down the mountain back home or not.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
We'll find out then, of course, when it happens.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So that's going to be a fun show in a couple weeks when Shane's here.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
I'm sorry you're not going to be here.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Maybe the work situation will change. We'll see.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Miss you, Shane.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Yeah, it's no secret that Shane and I are really close friends.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
We talk every day and so forth,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:41.000
and despite everything that happened with Hoard House and so forth,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:46.000
I'm glad that he can still kind of have his voice heard and so forth and be on the show,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
and I just know it's going to be a really awesome time.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:49.000
So it'll be good.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.000
This is the first time I've seen him in person in probably like three years.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000
That'll be fun.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000
So already thinking of all the places he's got to do in California when he's here.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Where do all the out-of-town people want to go when they come to California?

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
RVGL.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
No, we're past that.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Now when you go back to golf land, you're like, this is sad.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000
What are all the places you have to do in California, Jason?

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Disneyland.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Unfortunately, we're not going to have enough time or money to go to Disneyland.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Alcatraz.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
No, no. You're thinking too big.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Think of like restaurants and stores.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
They don't have other places.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000
In-N-Out.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
In-N-Out is the big one.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:31.000
In my defense, I'm not used to that being...

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000
It's not exactly California exclusive because when I was in Arizona, I went as well.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
There certainly are none in Colorado that I know of.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.000
The other thing, this is the other big thing that Shane really loves in California.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
And I'm like, really?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Out of all the restaurants, you missed that?

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Chevy's.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Like Chevy's is kind of bad.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Like I don't...

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000
That's...

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Is that a chain in California?

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
It is a chain.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
They might be in other states, but I know it best with California.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000
For those who don't know Chevy's, it's a Mexican restaurant basically.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
But it's kind of whitewashed.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000
And when I say kinda, I mean like really?

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
But I know what it is.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
It's that fucking corn substance they serve with every meal that some people go apeshit bananas over.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
And I think it's gross.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
That's just me.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:18.000
How do you describe Chevy's to an out-of-towner, Loki?

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Um...

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
No idea.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
I mean, with the franchise...

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I don't know. I don't really eat there.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
We live in California. You can get better Mexican food at thousands of other places.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
It's a round table instead.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
They have decent wings.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.000
All I know is that Chevy's is right across the street from a hotel that I stay at pretty often when I'm around San Francisco.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Oh nice.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Things change from location to location and franchisee to franchisee, but I was not impressed.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Oh, as Joe and Hunter Matt says, they're in Times Square. I didn't even know that.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I didn't know they were nationwide. Alright.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000
I'd like to think I have a pretty discerning palate and taste buds for Mexican and Mexican.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
They don't have them in Kansas.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
The margarita wasn't half bad.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
The drinks are never gonna be that bad. Alright, look.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
We can talk about food and restaurants.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Oh, well, foodie-o.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:12.000
One more. I gotta mention this though, because you know Shane's making a big deal out of he's gotta go to Espituse.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
You know what that is?

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I've never heard of this before.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
That is the Brazilian Grill.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Where they bring the big hunks of meat on the swords to your table and slice it off on your plate.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:28.000
And Shane goes crazy about, like, the gross disgusting raw meat and the chicken hearts.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Yes.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Oh my god, yes.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000
I've eaten, I've eaten, I tried it.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Chicken hearts are so good.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I tried it. And then I, you know what?

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
The week after I tried them, they ate them on Survivor.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
And I was like, I just ate that for real.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
That's not particularly surprising.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Like, non-ironically.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I have asked my coworkers about two types of foods in the Bay Area, in San Francisco specifically.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000
Brazilian, and I want to say I didn't get any positive answers.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
And Mongolian, which I still don't have any answers for.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
But there is a place in the Bay Area.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I am totally inviting coworkers to do that.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Good Mongolian is hard to find.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Yeah, but that's great.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
But I've just never heard of any place's existence at all.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Alright.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I'm hungry.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Food, food, food, food.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.000
There's another Brazilian place down in, uh, Fair Oaks or Citrus Heights, actually.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:15.000
It's, like, off Madison.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Yeah.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:17.000
No, it's not there anymore.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:18.000
Touch of Brazil.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Oh, really?

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
No, not there anymore.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Now they've reopened so many times, though.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Alright, let's move on.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.000
We gotta get back into games.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000
I could talk food all night, but we gotta work up an appetite by talking about games.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000
3 hour show, Rob.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Rapid fire, I know.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
We've got, like, 45 minutes left because we've got a late start tonight.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Alright, Loki, go ahead.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Alright, so there's a new mod for Bully that kind of changes the game entirely.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Remember, Bully may have been the Rockstar Games kind of, you know, watered down version of, like, almost like a Sandbox Grand Theft Auto type game.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Well, now it's Bully Zombie Edition where you can add guns to the game that didn't have guns to begin with and zombies into it.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Because, you know, every game's better with zombies.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
So, um, you can actually check it out.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000
They have a ModDB page.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.000
If you go to moddb.com slash mods slash bully dash zombie dash edition.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.000
And you can find the information on that as well.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Kind of tucked away in the announcement that we were talking about a little bit earlier for the 3DS numbers and what they sold in 2013.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:35.000
There's actually an announcement that they're localizing Disney's Magic World, which is a game that came out in Japan called Disney Magic Castle by Magical Life.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
And it's by Namco Bandai.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000
And what it basically is is kind of like Animal Crossing crossed with the Disney characters.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000
There's, like, farming in the game and you can customize all sorts of things.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:53.000
But, uh, I'm sure Rob and Jamie will probably be all over it because it's Disney and Animal Crossing kind of mixed together.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
Hey! Hey! That assessment is completely accurate.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:03.000
It's supposed to be coming out March 11th on the eShop and in retail.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And then, last but not least, also another 3DS story.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Apparently some hackers have found a way to get past the region locking on 3DS systems.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Although this exploit is only available in firmwares 4.1 to 4.5, which are about 9 months old at this time.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:30.000
So, if you do have that and have, like, a cartridge loader that you can load different things in there, you can actually bypass the firmware.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:40.000
And if I remember correctly, and now I'm not entirely positive because I read up on this a couple times, I think if you update your firmware it still stays unlocked.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
I'm reading conflicting things about it, though.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000
But, um, it's interesting, though, that you can be able to do that.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:54.000
And this doesn't in, you know, any way enable piracy. It just enables you to play games from other regions.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
So, that was pretty cool.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
I figured it was only a matter of time before somebody would hack that to get what they wanted, you know?

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Going back a few topics, one may say they made a mod with zombies in it.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
Alright, traveling around for some other news.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Starting off with Super Smash Brothers, the next game in that series, which we still don't know the exact name.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
But we do get little details on that each and every day.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:27.000
And director Mashihiro Sakurai has confirmed that trophies will be returning for the Wii U and 3DS game.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
But here's the little twist, because of course this next game is on both the Wii U and the 3DS.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
The trophies will be version exclusive.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000
And handheld games and characters will be mostly seen on the 3DS version.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:44.000
And the Wii U will see more console and Wii-related versions.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
So that's kind of a neat little twist on it.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:52.000
And a way to get people to buy both, which I'm sure they're looking for as many reasons as they can for that.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Or because they can't figure out a way to make them actually interact with each other. It's more like it.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Could be, could be.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:04.000
We'll see. I think this is going to be the big, big thing that Nintendo's got a show at E3 this year, so we'll see.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Majesco has announced that they will be bringing WayForward's Double Dragon Neon and Slender the Arrival by Blue Isle Studios to new platforms under the Midnight City Indie label.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Double Dragon Neon will be hitting Steam with a new online co-op mode.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I guess this was not on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, which surprises me.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:33.000
I thought it did have those, but maybe it was only local, like a Wii U game or something.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Slender the Arrival will have post-game flashback levels, and it will be coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Oh, that's really exciting. I hope that comes out soon.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Midnight City will also be putting out a game called Krautscape, which is a tactical racing game.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:56.000
So, pretty cool there. When you hear about all these labels going under, it's nice to hear new ones sprout up, especially with, you know, Slender the Arrival's a really fun little game.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:00.000
It's, you know, indie and lots of fun livestreams with that, so.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Also, lastly, here in Rapid Fire News for me, love this.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Super 3D Noah's Ark is being reprinted for the Super Nintendo.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:22.000
It was a Wolfenstein remake, reimagining type of thing that was done with, like, you know, Noah, as in, like, the biblical Noah.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:28.000
Where, yes, it was a first-person shooter, but you pelt animals with fruit to put them to sleep.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Apparently, the game was actually based off the Wolfenstein 3D source code. That's pretty amazing.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:43.000
It's, looking at the screenshot, it's a funny way, because bodies persisted back then, it's a funny way to rewrite what's really going on in that.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:59.000
So, anyway, originally this game had to go through a crazy little pass-through system to get against Nintendo's lockout, but now it's going to be on a real cart for only $69.99, if you want to own Super 3D Noah's Ark, which, let's be real, it really wasn't a good game anyway.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:09.000
But, you know, it gets a lot of lulz. There's also stuff that you can buy on the PC if you're curious in Wisdom Tree and the types of biblical-based video games that they do.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:19.000
Spiritual Warfare is one of the games that you can buy there. It's a Christian-based Zelda game, I guess. I don't know. I got nothing.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Oh my god. That is a blatant ROM hack right there.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
That's the stuff I want to see on Twitch. Alright, Jason.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Jpop lovers, idol lovers, rejoice. There is a new game featuring AKB48 coming out, at least in Japan, probably unlikely in America, who knows who AKB48 are.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:52.000
It's going to be a shooting game, and AKB48 are going to be zombies. Or at least that's the understanding of it so far.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Based off of other shooting games and arcades right now, and it's the style of shooter where you have...

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000
It's a sit-in shooter where you're enclosed with curtains and all that kind of stuff.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:09.000
I'm sure there's a lot of crossovers like this in Japan. I really wish there were more things like this in America.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Because being able to take a pop culture icon, for good or for bad, to be able to be put into this situation seems hilariously good.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Mega Touch is throwing in the towel. If you've ever been at an arcade that has a bar in it, or any other kind of a place where games are just kind of relegated to countertops and whatnot,

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:42.000
you've probably seen in Mega Touch, those tiny little touch screens. Well, they're actually like 15 to 20 inches usually.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Touch screens that have the little games like you would see on Facebook nowadays.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Photo Hunt, where you have two pictures and you spot the differences. Various number solitaire, not like window solitaire, but the classic pyramid solitaire kind of games.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Mega Touch was just a quick action series of arcade games.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
It was a bunch of shitty little games, but you just, you know, you're at the bar...

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I haven't had a lot of fun with them.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:13.000
You're at the bar, you're drunk, you want to put a quarter in the machine and smack the penguin.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:19.000
One of the games where you try to get him as far as possible with detrimental, not an obstacle course.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
My favorite Mega Touch game was, can you tell the difference between the two pictures?

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Photo Hunt.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.000
That's it, Photo Hunt.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:32.000
But Mega Touch is done. They're calling in the towel, despite the fact that their TVs and their technology have gotten better and better as the years go on.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:39.000
And their screens and their systems really have looked better and better as I've seen them every once in a while over the past couple of years.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:49.000
But they're done, they're throwing in the towel, the system's touch-based do start to have problems with gunk and various other bad things like that.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:54.000
And they're kind of pricey, $3,000 for just a little set-top box.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:04.000
If that could come down a little bit, it would be a pretty interesting thing to see in homes or non-fully public kind of places.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Because there's a lot of fun to just sit down and kind of start poking with that kind of thing.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I want to say that I've even heard some of them have internet connectivity and long-range leaderboards and that kind of stuff.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
They had a profile system and everything, I was always very adamant to use it.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000
But alas, for them as it stands, no more.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Now bring out Photo Hunt on the PlayStation 4.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I already have Photo Hunt on my iPhone and iPad and that's good enough for me.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
I'm pretty sure it's in MAME and stuff already too.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Yeah, I guess I could get it on an iPad.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Yeah, there's actually a lot of really fun versions of it.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Metal Gear Re-Vengeance. As most games of this generation are, the quality settings let you go up to 1080p, 1920x1080.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
But there is a coder.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Did you hear that too?

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
Is everything okay, Loki?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000
The cat knocked over water.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
Well, at least there's only water.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
She's kind of a jerk.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
This is like the third time she's done it today.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Cats usually are.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
That picture we were looking at in the break is suddenly a lot more relevant.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
My wife wants to announce that the cat is free for any takers.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
I'm not joking, don't laugh.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
OLR Adoption. What did she say?

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
She says, I'm not joking, don't laugh.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
We're laughing with you, not at you.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Very important. Go ahead.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Most games of this generation have a max of 1080p and that is still considered the high end.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:39.000
4K displays are coming out, but that's bleeding edge if you actually have them for at least a little bit longer.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:52.000
But there is a coder by the name of Durante that has been fixing the available resolution of visually high quality games like Dark Souls, Deadly Premonition, and now Metal Gear Rising Re-Vengeance

02:05:52.000 --> 02:06:01.000
that works around the 1080p resolution cap and actually allows you to start experiencing these games in 4K.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I assume this is all in upres because I don't think any company would include 4K assets in a game and literally never let you use them

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:11.000
because that would balloon the size of the game in a heartbeat.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:19.000
But it is still pretty damn nice as these games are looking better and better and these impressive displays are coming out in huge swaths.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:29.000
The one for Revengance is not necessarily going to be released because apparently there's some rumors going around that Konami may be doing this themselves.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Well, not as of the conclusion of CES, we know that much now, but in the next couple of months in the lead up to E3 and that kind of stuff as 4K displays start to become more prominent.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Whether it's released officially or released unofficially, that will be seen in the not too distant future ultimately.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Alrighty. Let's take this opportunity to visit our Facebook and Google pages in a segment we call the FUGL Question of the Week.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Every week we ask a question of our communities over at Facebook and Google Plus and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Let's get to it. This week's question is about that article we talked about in part A with the top 10 grossing arcade games of all time.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:24.000
So we decided to simply ask, what game in the arcade do you think you've dropped the most quarters or tokens into over the years and why?

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:32.000
And here's the thing, when I originally posted that question, about five minutes later I was like, oh god, everybody's going to say DDR.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.000
DDR, DDR, DDR, DDR, pop it, DDR.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000
That isn't the case. That's not the case at all. So I'm very happy with the way this turned out.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Let's go to our first answer. Funny enough, it's from Shane over on Facebook saying, with no question I'd say the game I dropped the most quarters or tokens in would be DDR.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:52.000
However, I think the more interesting answer would be my number two game, which would be Time Crisis.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:00.000
I spent all my time playing and beating those games in the arcade. They were one series I felt never translated well to the home consoles, so I had to play them in the arcade.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:03.000
That's a really good answer and I also think I've never beaten a Time Crisis.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Elliot B says, being a youngin, I haven't been around many arcade cabinets, plus I think they may have dried up in the UK faster than the US, but as a kid I would never pass up the opportunity to play any version of Metal Slug.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Clover Nikon responds and says TMNT Arcade. Oh god, so many quarters on that.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Joe G responds, or sorry, it's Haseo Sumerugawa, put that at the beginning if you want me to read that first, says Street Fighter versus X-Men or probably various pinball tables.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Fifth Dream says, I spent a lot of times in arcades in the 80s and 90s, so Centipede, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Final Fight, Double Dragon, but the toss up would be between Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Street Fighter II.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Delvin B, our buddy from video game Realness, love that show, responded and said, very surprised that Mortal Kombat was not in the top 10.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000
You know, I was surprised by that too, because I always thought it gave Street Fighter II a pretty good competition, but I guess not.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:12.000
But there were a ton of fighting game clones around that same time because of Street Fighter's success, just like there were a ton of Pac-Man clones at the time too.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Do you remember Primal Rage?

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
I do remember Primal Rage, absolutely. I remember when that came out for the Atari Jaguar.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I think they were a bit worse on consoles, I'm thinking like Clay Fighter and that kind of stuff. The ones that actually made it into the arcade were good.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
There's Fighting Street and that whole lawsuit.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Alright, anyway.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Delvin responds and says, number one, Killer Instinct. My best friend and I would go to arcades and beat anyone that was already playing and then take over, which led to people lying to us and trying to beat us.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Ultra combo, and number two says, would be the original X-Men arcade game with six players. So much fun playing through with six friends when we were kids.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Eddie K replies and says, Street Fighter II Championship Edition or Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Degenerate Johnny says, I have to admit I was more of a console gamer than an arcade gamer, but I put the most quarters in Mortal Kombat 2.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:10.000
But if you asked me what game I put the most money into play, I would say Michael Jackson's Scramble Training. It was a rare Starfighter game that was available in Sega World.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Each game session cost 10 pounds, which was equivalent to $15 at the time, and I went through three game sessions.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
I've never heard of this before.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Me neither, me neither.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Giavadea says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Simpsons, and any game that had a gun I could point and shoot with. Didn't matter what the game was about, I could play with a gun and that's all I cared about.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Anthony C replies and says, I don't want to know how much I've spent on DDR.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Andy R replies and says, Technica, no contest. When Technica 3 came out, I just moved closer to an arcade that had it.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:50.000
Thanks to the crew race and bi-weekly updates, I was putting in at least $10 a week for several months. RIP DJ Maxx series.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Because they shut down the platinum crew.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Yep, just over the new year, right?

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000
DJ Rama S says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, hands down. It was so much fun to play with four peoples.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:04.000
And in my old neighborhood, each machine has a different amount of lives per quarter you put in.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Our buddy Rene from Koopa Club also says there's a lot, just to name a few.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Gauntlet, Quartet, Dragon's Lair, DDR, Beatmania, and so on and so on.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Most of these games were the recipient of my money, surely because they were quick and fun and offered a fair amount of replayability.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:25.000
The largest recipient was the Addams Family pinball game, because I love the Addams Family and I love pinball.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Pinball is the foundation of my gaming experience, so there you go.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:31.000
That is one of the best pinball tables. So, so, so good.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I think that's supposed to come out for the pinball arcade. It's one of the big, big things we're waiting for.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Tiger Claw says Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Turtles in Time.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Terminator 2 was a huge quarter muncher as well.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Raginator says, I've had a number of arcade games, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Do you see a pattern here?

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Smash TV, Final Fight, and so on and so on. My list could easily go on for quite some time, but in the interest of time, I shortened it.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Burr says, I was never a huge arcade fanatic, but I could never say no to a Bubble Bobble machine.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Something about that game just makes me happy to feed it quarters. Probably the music.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Codeman says, what did he say? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Oh, he said Turtles in Time specifically, though.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:18.000
There was something about playing it with my friends in the arcade that was wasting all my parents' money. It felt gratifying.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Lawrence Z said, I know it's not the same, but Xbox Live Arcade has taken a ton of cash from me.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.000
It is not the same, and many would blame that on the reason why arcades have been struggling.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000
But, you know, like somebody else has said before, you know, if you're younger, you may not have that same frame of reference.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Or where you are in the world.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Xbox Live has been around for ten years now. You know, some of the, you know, if you're sixteen, then Xbox Live has been around since you were six. Something to think about.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Critical Myth says, Galaga. Without question.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.000
Austin replies, Dance Dance Revolution. Otherwise, Soul Edge.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Thomas C says, I never had access to a legit arcade as a kid. One of the games I played the most was Mortal Kombat. Hundreds of dollars spent in that cabinet.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Dark Tetsuya says, DDR. I also one night sunk several dollars of quarters into Golden Axe.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Veronica Isabel replies and says, Does Ski Ball count? I used to play that all the time when I was a kid.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Hell yeah, it does.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Yeah, sure. Sure it counts. Why not? Ski Ball is still fun as an adult.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Michael H says, I love playing NFL Blitz at Dave and Busters. It was always a quarter muncher back in the day. Even I liked NFL Blitz. And I don't play a lot of the sports games, but that one was fun.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
You know which one I love though is NBA Jam.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Yes.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I remember when that came out on Super Nintendo too.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
The arcade, arcade sports were amazing.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:44.000
And lastly on Facebook, S2100Matt says, DDR. But I did play the heck out of TMNT, Turtles in Time, Stun Runner, and Tapper when I was a kid.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Let's look at Google Plus. So TMNT definitely dominated the conversation there. We have a few answers on Google Plus.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Robba replies and says, If I take DDR and laserdisc games off my list, Crazy Climber was the quarter muncher for me.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:08.000
The dreaded falling I-beams after completing the first building were that one chaotic element that could end my game quickly. I remember that game. Those were good times.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Retertainment says, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So Google Plus thinking the same way, right?

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:24.000
I was a kid when the turtles were popular, so I wanted to play that game whenever I saw it as a kid. It was the hardest game to play and I'm a stubborn person, so I kept on pumping quarters in the machine until I ate out of money or my mom got done shopping.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Act Dev says, DDR and I still play on occasion. There's also a ton of SNK games like Metal Slug and The King of Fighters.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Sam H says, Moon Patrol and Sinistar ate a ton of my quarters.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Beware, I live.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
The game was awesome.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:44.000
And lastly, Black Dynamite says, Time Crisis 3. We're ending where we started. Time Crisis 3.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.000
If you're playing someone else, it takes a lot of skill and coordination. Totally worth sinking the several dollars and quarters to conquer.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
You know, those are all great answers and I love doing the reminiscing, which is why I read them all.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I have to admit though, shocked that the game I probably would have named next to DDR and music games, if you throw those out for a minute, because obviously the game I would have named, nobody mentioned.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Super Iron Man Ivan Stewart's Off-Road.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.000
You know what's really scary is I was going to say exactly the same thing.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.000
Get out.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Dead serious.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Absolutely.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:24.000
I have dropped, I was on a cruise in 94, I don't even remember for sure.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And there was a $5 bill behind the off-road machine that was chilling there.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:36.000
So I picked it up, I cashed it out and I put every single quarter into off-road.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
That game was so much fun.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000
You cannot replicate that free rolling wheel, the pedal.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:46.000
That was a big fucking deal when that came out on the NES too.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
That four player multi-tap.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Because finally there was no more fucking grey car that would always beat you.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:58.000
So that was very, you know, funny enough you mentioned one of the places you like to eat when you're here in California, Round Table Pizza.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
That's where I, because all those pizza parlors have little arcades, right?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000
I spent an unhealthily amount of money on Iron Man Super Off-Road.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Last July a bunch of coworkers of mine were out in Denver for a conference and we went out to the 1UP, our local barcade in Denver.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
And a coworker of mine, I don't remember if he had or hadn't played it at all before.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:26.000
But I taught him the credit tricks to be able to max out your car in Super Off-Road real quick.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
And he loved it.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
And you know, there's something about that wheel, the pedal and everything else that just makes that game unique.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
And nobody else has done it.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000
But to be fair, I also spent a shit ton on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Yeah, same answer.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
I had to be hipster and not say that.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Loki, you have a quick answer before we move on?

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
What did you drop all your quarters in?

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Besides DDR. No fair saying DDR.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Maybe... well I did play a lot of Gunblade back when QZAR had it.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Good call.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:57.000
So maybe that.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Good call.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Alright.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Now I'm thinking about some of those arcade games we used to play at Golf Land besides just DDR.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Like the grid. I remember when a bunch of us would get on the grid and play that with a shooter.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:12.000
The joysticks are of maybe iffy caliber.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:17.000
But MGL in Arizona has the grid and I was playing a couple rounds of that too.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
So good.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.000
When arcades have the right games, arcades are still alright.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Good times.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Alright, let's get back into some news.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
We're going to try to move through this a little bit quickly guys.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Yeah, because we're running a little late in the show and I want to be able to take some calls.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.000
So let's try to move through this a little bit quickly. Loki.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Alright, so EA has now changed their stance on SimCity mods.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And they're now gracefully allowing you to mod their files if you ever so feel like doing that.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
But there's some restrictions.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:59.000
And basically the mods that you can create, that they are allowing you to create, are stuff like skins and skins.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:06.000
So pretty much mods that do not affect multiplayer simulation or jeopardize gameplay.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
How generous.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Yeah, to which I say, if you're modding the game in the first place, why do you need their permission to do that?

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I don't know, why?

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:20.000
You should. Just do what you want.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Yep.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I wonder when they're going to really discount this game. Is it already down to 20 bucks?

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I don't think it's dropped in price really.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Wow.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.000
I mean, I'm sure, I think it's maybe been on sales.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Yeah, I think it's been on sales, but I'm just kind of surprised.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
It's interesting they're still trying to breathe life into this.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:46.000
They really don't want that game to kind of have the black marks on it that its launch kind of gave it.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
But they never really recovered from that.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Diablo 3 to some extent never did either. Well, a little bit.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.000
And the new expansion I think is really going to be a reboot for that game.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Yeah, it's down to $39.99.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Or, I mean, on sale $33.28 I guess right now is what it is on Amazon.

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Wake me up when it's $10 or $15.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Well, yeah, it's just, yeah.

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Maybe this holiday it'll finally be down that low.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:17.000
You know, a lot of people give shit to Nintendo, including me, and I have in the past,

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.000
and I think we all have a little bit about their lack of online support.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:27.000
But, you know, the producer of Super Mario 3D World, Yoshiaki Koizumi,

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:31.000
recently made a comment about Nintendo and the fact that they have experimented with online

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:35.000
because some people are saying, why isn't Super Mario 3D World online?

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:41.000
You know, yes, and I left this out of my gaming week just because I was talking too much about ass and titties at the beginning of the show.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:46.000
But actually I had, you guys who remember OLR, like way back in the day,

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Princess Irene was here with her now husband, Nathan, we're here this Friday.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:58.000
We were just getting together for sushi, and then we came back and played Mario 3D World on Wii U and Nintendo Land.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
We had a lot of fun, good times.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:03.000
But, you know, you can have good times with some of that stuff online too,

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
and Nintendo's always kind of resisted that in favor of the living room experience.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Well, producer of Super Mario 3D World said, quote,

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:14.000
we've been testing online multiplayer since the days of Super Mario Galaxy.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:18.000
But with this title, we really wanted to deliver an experience that you can share with family, friends,

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:23.000
or your boyfriend or girlfriend in the same place, like you did with the original NES.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:30.000
We really want players to have fun in front of the TV, talking while they help each other out, or get in each other's way.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:33.000
I don't see why they couldn't have both.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:37.000
I'm kind of with you, I'm with you a little bit, Loki,

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:44.000
and I'm even okay with the extent that they stick to their guns, that, you know, it's a living room experience.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
But here's the problem.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Nintendo hasn't proven that they're capable of any online excellent experience.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:58.000
What is a made-by-Nintendo game that is a must-play online?

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:02.000
Maybe Mario Kart Wii? I don't know.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Maybe. That's probably the best they've done, to be honest.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Mario Kart 7?

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
So, yeah, I mean, there's not a whole lot.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:13.000
I think they're trying a little more with the Dr. Luigi and so forth,

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.000
but, you know, I think that's another reason why a lot of people kind of give Nintendo shit when it comes to online.

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000
And there was a very interesting story that was on, was it, U.S. Gamer or Eurogamer?

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:26.000
One of those sites where one of those people that was like,

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:30.000
I worked for a third-party developer when the Wii U was introduced or whatever,

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:34.000
kind of throwing some shade at Nintendo and talking about how it was.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.000
And apparently, when somebody had asked Nintendo about Xbox Live or PlayStation Network,

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:43.000
their comment was, well, we don't know what those systems are. We don't use them.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
And it's like, know your fucking competition, you guys.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.000
Like, you have to. Come on.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:55.000
And the perfect experience I can think of is Final Fantasy XIV.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.000
The first version was so awful, but when the guy came in that said, you know what?

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Yeah, I've played World of Warcraft. I've played EverQuest. I've played all that stuff.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.000
And this is what the people really want. That game came out so much better for it.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
You have to know your competition a little bit.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Look at, that's Microsoft's business, is taking the competition and making it better.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.000
We're trying.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Trying.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:20.000
Most of the time, to be fair, most of the times they're pretty successful with it.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Anyhow, over at live.vognetwork.com, still some people mostly reminiscing on the games

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:31.000
we were talking about earlier with the arcade games, but we do have some comments on this.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Tigerclaw says there are a couple of Nintendo games that have online multiplayer on Wii.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:42.000
Just a couple, though. Tigerclaw says Excitebike World Rally had online multiplayer,

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.000
but Excitebike World Rally was no Halo.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Or excuse me, Halo 2, to be fair.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Well, that's the bar.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
You know what I mean? Well, yes, it is the bar.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:58.000
No, I'm agreeing with you. That's quite a leap, because I'm trying to think.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I don't think I have ever put the Wii to use for multiplayer.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
I don't have a Wii U yet.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Man, I missed out on Mario Kart, but I know a lot of friends that were doing that routinely,

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:15.000
and that's probably one of the only answers that I can really come up with.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Not the least, the frickin' friend code system.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:30.000
I agree with this much that Nintendo does not have the same caliber of online components in gaming.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000
All right, well, you never know.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:36.000
That could be the thing that Nintendo's gonna come out at E3 and say,

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.000
we're rebooting the Nintendo Network, and this is how it's gonna blow your mind.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Yeah, don't make bets on it.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Don't hold your breath.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Jason, what do you have for us?

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:54.000
A little bit of news on the Steam Controller, and that Valve wants the controller to be more capable

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:58.000
than just a gamepad with its mental math.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:03.000
12 buttons and however many sticks slash D-pads.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:08.000
And they're interested in being able to make a controller with the flexibility

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.000
like the Steam Machine Controller that has touchpads and not D-pads

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.000
that are multipurpose with movement and action buttons and everything else.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And they're very interested in finding a way to be able to take a complex game like Dota 2

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:27.000
and be able to have it controlled with just purely the Steam Controller.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:32.000
That's pretty difficult to do because you have to use damn near half of the keyboard

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:38.000
and then the mouse independently, and there's just purely not enough buttons.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000
But if some can be relegated to gestures, combinations, or other sorts of things

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:45.000
that would make sense with this controller design,

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.000
they're interested in finding out exactly what that is.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Yeah, the trailer that we got was just classic mouse compatibility mode

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:59.000
for Papers, Please and Civ 5, and then a little bit of keyboard.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
It technically wasn't even really keyboard integration for Portal

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
because you'd need a left button and a right button.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Whoo, that's hard.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:11.000
So it's an obvious answer that the controller will be heavily mouse

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
and also traditional controller-centric,

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:18.000
but they are looking for ways of scaling it and being able to have it take on

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.000
larger tasks for more complex input games.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.000
I'm curious to get my hands on one of those, but it's going to be very interesting.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:31.000
I want to see how a game like Civ 5 or something really transfers over to that

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:34.000
that's really, really, really with the keyboard and mouse.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000
Or even Dota is still a game that I can't imagine not playing that with keyboard and mouse.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.000
That would be a hindrance.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000
But they seem convinced they can make it work, and maybe they can.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
They sure as hell are going to try it.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I don't mind first-person shooters on controllers, so it works okay enough for me.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I know some people really hate it, but it's all right. I don't mind it.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.000
All right, Loki.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:03.000
All right, so actually as I saw this article here, it reminded me to go ahead and do that online.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:09.000
The Steam family options have come out of beta, so now you can actually share your library

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:17.000
with up to ten people, and you can actually go enable that under settings and stuff,

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
and go check that out.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:24.000
So that allows you, of course, if you're not familiar with it, to basically have somebody

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.000
play any game that you own on your account, and they can actually download the full game

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:35.000
and try it, as long as you're not playing anything else in your account at the time.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:45.000
You kind of seem to have landed with little fanfare.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.000
I had no idea that this had gone live until somebody had posted it for tonight's show.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
I would have thought that Steam might have done a big announcement, but I guess not.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000
It made a splash when it was a beta, and now it's here, hooray.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.000
But it's also, as Bobby covered before, it also has kind of limited domain,

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.000
where if you're multiple people under the same household,

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
have it better than the people that wanted to exploit it for free games.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Yeah, but what were people really expecting?

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000
And that's why the fanfare isn't any bigger than it is.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.000
I guess so. All right, moving on.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:18.000
And the last story before the mailbag.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Konami is looking to jump into the 3D dome screen game

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.000
with a game they're calling Steel Chronicle Ganesh.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Basically, they're trying to bring back the huge sit-down cabin...

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:41.000
I completely forgot the word that I was going to look for.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000
The huge pods that you sit down, much like Battletech,

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:49.000
if you ever played that at a nice big warehouse, arcade, bar, everything entertaining place.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
DragonCon.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
I've never been to a con that has this kind of stuff.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
They have a DragonCon room, but never that specific.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:58.000
Bobby made it a point to walk me down there to say,

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
look at this, look at what they bring in for this.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Good man. Because those things are so much fun.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:08.000
So, of course, these games come at a premium price tag.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000
The article quotes $40,000.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Because not only is it a sit-down pod with multiple displays,

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000
tailored controls for a flight sim,

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
or maybe it is a mech battle game.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Hard to tell. The screenshot is pretty small.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.000
But it's also a, instead of just a 30-inch CRT,

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.000
excuse me, that the classic Battletech machines use,

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:38.000
these are modern, curved, 3D tall displays,

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
so you have greater field of view.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:43.000
It looks amazing. I would love to play a game like this.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:47.000
When you get the right control mechanism to be able to put management

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.000
into this game alongside just the rest of the action,

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
these games come out so well.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Find your cash money arcade and suggest it to them.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
It's really funny that in last week's show,

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:01.000
we were kind of mourning the loss of the pompous arcade game

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
with all its big peripheral, a story like this comes out where it's like,

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.000
we're not dead yet.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I don't think anybody said that it's gone or that they wouldn't play it again.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000
It's just less often.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Well, I kind of said they were dying, but I didn't want them to go.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Plus, we're on the heels of CES,

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
where this kind of stuff would have been shown off,

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
which is where most of these articles are coming from.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.000
There's a big arcade coin-op show that happens later in a couple months,

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
isn't there? There's like a Vegas coin-op show, too.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.000
A coin-op expo sounds somewhat familiar, maybe.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Something along those lines.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
Looking forward to Konami. Make it happen.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Make it happen. All right.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:37.000
And Konami has made a bunch of pompous arcade games with big peripherals.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
As we are well aware.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
As we are well aware. All right.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000
When are we going to see the Silent Hill arcade game come anywhere near us?

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
The Castlevania one.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
I want to shoot Pyramid Head in the face.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000
It'll be fun. I don't know. I guess never.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
All right. Let's get to the mailbag.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And every week you send emails,

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.000
and Dark Sakura dives in the email bag head first

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
and puts on her hazmat suit and tries to find an email

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.000
that looks safe for the air or two or five to read.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Dark Sakura is not here this week,

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:13.000
so we've decided to make Jason jump in the mailbag head first

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
and swim in there.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Oh, it's tough to wade through all of this.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Yeah, all those mountains and mountains of email we received last week, right?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.000
All the spam that's junking up the bag.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.000
All the delivery sports.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000
All right.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Nasty Canasta writes in to back up Mr. Sky

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
and says, hi, Olar.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I'm here to back up Sky.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Maybe, sort of, probably.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000
On the last episode, Sky got a Twitter sass from Cuoco Jones

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:46.000
along the lines of, you bought a PS4 to play Don't Starve?

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000
To which I say, girl.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:52.000
But seriously, what's wrong with buying a console or a computer

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:55.000
to play something that one considers to give them lots of...

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
that can...

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Sorry.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
I think a word or two is missing.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Just short-circuited my brain.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000
What's wrong with buying a console or a computer to play something

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:10.000
that one considers will give them lots of replayability

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
and a unique experience for such a small cost?

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.000
$400 plus a small cost, but I digress.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.000
While Don't Starve is not a Call of Duty or an Assassin's Creed,

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Don't Starve could entertain you way longer than either of those.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I will tell you all right now that if I were to own a PS4

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
in the very near future,

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:32.000
the one game I'd plunk my nerdy fanny down to play the most

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000
is Binding of Isaac Rebirth, which happens to look like an SNES game.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.000
I've played the current version of Isaac for over 800 hours.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.000
And also isn't out, to be fair.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
I'd al...

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Uh... lost my place.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:49.000
I've played the current version of Isaac on the PC, of course.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
That's the only place it's at right now.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
I've played the current version of Isaac for over 800 hours

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:57.000
and look forward to Rebirth over Diablo 3,

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Infamous Second Son, and many other high-profile titles coming soon.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.000
I guess what I'm saying is, don't shoo away these seemingly smaller games

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
with lower budgets mainstream or indie.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.000
You can get a lot out of them depending on how well they're made.

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:12.000
And a quick question for Loki.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Will there be any Left 4 Dead 2 PC vog...

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Will... wow, man, I'm doing a really good job at reading this.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000
It's not an easy job she does, is it?

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Especially... plus the rush and also looking at the clock

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
and I need to stop looking at the clock.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Quick question for Loki.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Will there be a Left 4 Dead 2 PC vog game night soon?

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Since that was given away for free over the holidays,

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
lots of folks should have it,

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.000
but getting into the group you want will be a bit of an issue in online campaigns

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:43.000
since they only allow four players for normal style

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000
and then, of course, versus with zombie control maxes out at eight.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
Also, get Rob and Jamie to play.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Rob! Rob! Zombies, Rob!

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I did download it, so yeah.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
I'm horrible at those games, though.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I had Left 4 Dead 1 and I was so bad at it.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
You just gotta have fun with it.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Probably not. That's what my guess would be, probably not.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
We can set something up.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.000
Talk in the vog group on Steam, we'll see what we can set up.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I like the idea.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Pitch it on the forums, let's make it happen.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:14.000
I'd rather play with cool people that email the show than strangers.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Yeah.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
By the way, just responding to the part earlier there,

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
I think when Flaco was sending me that Twitter,

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
he really was just trying to be sassy

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:26.000
and I think it just came from a place of sarcastic Twitter tongue in cheek.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I don't think he was totally serious with it.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
It was also coming from a place of girl.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Yeah, I think it was a little bit.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Just to say, I don't think it was as pointed as you might have thought it was

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
or I may have made it seem last week.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:42.000
But I think we all know now, thanks to earlier in the show,

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:45.000
that I bought my PlayStation 4 clearly for what?

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Ass and titties.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
It's the time of the show where we get angsty.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
And why do we get angsty?

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Because we're people and people are mean.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
Well, since Dark Sakura isn't here, I'll let Jason start.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Jason, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.000
I want to say I have one on the drive up here and I don't remember it.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
It's been a pretty good week.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:27.000
FU to forgetfulness.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:32.000
FU to forgetfulness, FU to routine in some ways at the same time too.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Eh.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.000
My FU goes after this cough that I've been slowly developing throughout the weekend.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
I better not be getting sick.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
I better not be getting sick.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
This is the second time you've said that in like four weeks.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
I know, maybe I'm just always sick.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
It's funny because my throat is feeling kind of weird too.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
We're still going to curse Al and he's leaving his germs behind.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:53.000
FU to the fact that you do those YouTubes so you remember what I say on this show way better than even I do.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Loki, what about you?

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:59.000
FU to the cap because she's an asshole.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:05.000
And FU to the new chunks they're generating on our Minecraft map because they kind of suck.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
They do kind of suck, I'm sorry to say.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:10.000
It's like all I got was ocean the other day.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Well, that's the thing is they tweaked the whole generation so that it's supposed to make less ocean.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
And that's all we're getting is ocean.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Lame.

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Alright, DarkSakura has passed along her FU.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
It is two sinus infections.

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Seems obvious enough.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:29.000
Let's keep it up for being here tonight so fair enough.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Alright, let's go on.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then guess what?

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Guess what?

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
It's Skype line time at 1877 Game OLR.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
But first, Loki.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Well, this is kind of shocking but I guess people that do follow the MLB 2K games have kind of seen this coming.

02:35:53.000 --> 02:36:00.000
They have, or 2K Sports has decided to go ahead and discontinue the MLB 2K franchise.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Just I guess the last game didn't do very well and actually the last few games haven't done very well.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000
So, it is done.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:16.000
So, if you want to play baseball, you've got to get a Sony console.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:20.000
So, wait, it's only on that particular console?

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Well, no. MLB 2K was the only baseball game that was on the Xbox 360.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Because Sony's game is only on the Sony platforms.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.000
So, those were literally the only two baseball games to come out each year.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
I didn't realize they were the only two that were coming out.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:36.000
I guess so.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
In my mind, I was thinking of others.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:45.000
But, you know, my mind goes back to a much more classic gaming time when you had things like Baseball Stars and all this other crazy stuff that was coming out too.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
So, wow, that's too bad.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Yeah.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:53.000
What about like, don't they have like, isn't there like foreign baseball leagues that get video games too?

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Well, they used to have, was it the Power Pros baseball game that was from Konami?

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:05.000
But, you know, Konami cut out pretty much all of their, you know, non-Super AAA franchises.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
So, their lineup is really slim.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
But, yeah, we don't see any more of that stuff anymore.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.000
And, you know, the thought is maybe EA will pick it up.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.000
I don't know, they could use another franchise to be honest.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
But, it's hard to say.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Alright.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Well, who says that big news in video gaming doesn't come out of CES?

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Because at Consumer Electronics Show this past week, some big news on a big game was dropped this week.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
About a big guy.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
About a big guy.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Mama Shaq, Shaquille O'Neal, actually came out and said Shaq, Shaq-Fu 2 is happening.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.000
It's coming soon and the graphics look crazy.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.000
That is the, and actually, I guess some of the estimate is a joke if there be a sequel to Shaq-Fu.

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
And Shaq said, yes, it is coming and the graphics look crazy.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:58.000
Now, don't forget, there were trademarks filed in mid-2013.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:05.000
This is not the first time we have fantasized about a new Shaq-Fu because there was a trademark for Shaq Fighter.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:12.000
So, those of you that were hoping for Shaq-Fu 2, Electric Boogaloo, you might get your wish.

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Awesome.

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.000
The gaming world needed Shaq-Fu 2, I think.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I don't think they realized how badly they needed it.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Alright, that pretty much does it for the news.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:27.000
But we're going to go to the Skype line.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Going to, well, first I'll go to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Dungeon Buster says, Shaq-Fu 2, the game that no one asked for.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.000
And Rama in our chat room says, no, no, no, fuck no.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000
And SSJ100Matt says, why do I feel he's trolling?

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I don't know, but we're going to go to the phones right now over at 1877 Game OLR.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:52.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
Hello, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
You have some explaining to do.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Hi, Shane, how are you?

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Fine.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Fine.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:02.000
What's up?

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.000
You're explaining.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:08.000
Go quell the thought that, you know, some drama unfolded.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Okay, so I knew the minute that I said that.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Okay, so here's the thing.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:14.000
Shane is mad at me.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
Are you mad at me, Shane?

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:17.000
So mad.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Shane is mad at me because when I was talking about Hoard House,

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:24.000
I said something like all the things that happened at Hoard House.

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000
And the minute those words left my mouth, I was like, God,

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
that made it sound a lot worse than it really is.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.000
And so here you are to clear the air.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Yes, nothing bad happened.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
I left because I left.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Nothing bad happened.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:37.000
The end.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:38.000
Nothing bad happened.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
I agree.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000
No, and I'm agreeing with you.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Nothing bad happened.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:42.000
It's just, you know.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:43.000
Hi, Jason.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.000
I can see Jason.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I know.

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:46.000
We have the whole webcam thing on Skype now.

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
So, but yeah, no, nothing.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:52.000
I mean, you just weren't into it anymore, and that happens, right?

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Yep, that does happen.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:54.000
And it did happen.

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
You shouldn't do things that aren't fun.

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Exactly.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
That's my entire life.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
That's why I don't always go to work.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Well, what, okay, for real though, what's on your mind?

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.000
What have you been up to besides quitting podcasts?

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Playing Final Fantasy XIV, a whole bunch.

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
But that's not why I called.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:20.000
I wanted to take a moment of silence to honor the memory of DJ Max

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.000
because it is, with the exception of the mobile game that they put out,

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:28.000
that's like Technica, the entire franchise is dead.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000
It's not just Technica that's dead.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
It's the portable games.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
It's DJ Max Ray on the iPhone.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:34.000
That's gone now too.

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Aww.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:36.000
Yes.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
And that was my favorite music series.

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Absolute favorite.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
100 percent.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Well, I don't know.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:47.000
How would you send off a game like DJ Max?

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Lots of drinking and crying.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Yeah, lots of drinking and crying.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Did you do some drinking and crying on New Year's when they shut it down?

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.000
I was drinking and not crying, but not for anything to do with DJ Max.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Fair enough, fair enough.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:04.000
Yes.

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:07.000
All right, anything else on your mind, Shane?

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
No.

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Oh, you missed Santa Ramen.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000
That's another reason I'm going to come out so I can eat ramen.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Because I've never been there.

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Oh, well, we're going to all go and have really, really good ramen.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:22.000
If I can be off work when you want to go, that'd be great.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:26.000
Every day that I'm there, I should have put in more requests for time off.

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:27.000
All right.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:31.000
And my deepest apologies, Shane, if what I said earlier in the show offended you.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
It was super offensive.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000
It was like something I would see on TMZ or something.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Oh, whatever.

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.000
I don't read TMZ, but if I read TMZ, that's where it would be at.

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000
You read Perez Hilton.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000
That's worse.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Nope.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I don't read that anymore.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Because it's super dumb.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Good.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:48.000
Because it is super dumb.

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:49.000
I read Kotaku.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
That is super dumb, too.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000
That's even worse.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:55.000
I'd rather you read TMZ and Perez Hilton together than read Kotaku.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:56.000
All right.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Ouch.

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:58.000
All right.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Let's see.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:02.000
SD100MattChat, let me read this comment real quick before I let you in.

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
Yeah, because I can't see chat because I'm playing Final Fantasy.

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Okay.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:11.000
SD100Matt says, the Technica people I know are very begrudgingly going to re-rave.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Not a fan?

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:21.000
I don't want to say bad things about re-rave, but it's not a good game, and it sucks.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Well, there's always Neon FM.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:28.000
And he criticizes me about being too dramatic and saying shit on this show, and then he

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:29.000
goes and says something like that.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:34.000
There's a couple good songs that I've played, and I don't think the note charts are good.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:37.000
I'm sorry, because I know people that work on that game, but I don't think the note charts

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
are good whatsoever.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:42.000
But they have a few good songs on the stupid iPhone game.

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
I'm sure it's in the arcade or whatever.

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
But, no, that game is crap.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.000
I do want to play Neon FM, though, because it still has a lot of good music, it looks

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:53.000
like, and that's good enough for me to want to play it.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:58.000
I don't care if the game sucks, because it doesn't look that great, but it still has,

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:01.000
I think, The Nine and Alien 6 on there, so I'm happy.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
I don't think it'll really come out either, though.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:04.000
We'll see.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
All right, Shane, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:07.000
That's fine.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:08.000
All right, bye.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:13.000
All right, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
a call, and the phone lines are open again.

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Let me go to Twitter topics in the meantime, or I don't know, Loki, do you have any last

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
minute news while I pull up the Twitters?

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Uh, yeah, I think I had something here.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Oh, I was going to say, Tony Hawk Underground 2 is getting a massive mod that they're building

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:36.000
for the PC version that not only is going to add a ton of new features to it, but it's

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:40.000
going to upscale it to 1080p, which I think is kind of cool.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:43.000
The only problem is, where the hell do you get that game now, because they don't sell

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.000
it on Steam or anything.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:50.000
I guess for those rare people that were able to pick it up, or pirates.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:53.000
I guess, yeah, but it looks pretty cool.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:56.000
All right, let me go to some tweets, and I'll check in with you again, Loki.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:00.000
Again, 1877 Game OLR, whoa, oops.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
That's what I get for getting to mute Skype.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Sorry about that, guys.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:04.000
This is all-

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Movie magic.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:08.000
All right, this is all still a brand new setup here, so let's go to the phones and see who's

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:09.000
there.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:10.000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
It's the one and only DJ Ron Mass.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Hi, Rama, how you doing?

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000
I'm doing good.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Now, since you got your video camera on-

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:18.000
We do.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
I'm going to turn mine on.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Oh, my gosh.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
It's an actual video conversation.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I can actually reach out and touch him.

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:32.000
All right, but this makes for excellent radio, Rama, excellent radio.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I want you to know that I upgraded my PlayStation 3 to a 500 gig hard drive.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
How did you do that?

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Say what?

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:44.000
How did you do that?

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I went out and bought one.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:49.000
I pulled the old one out of the fat one, put the new one in.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.000
I didn't know you could do it that easy, because I need to get a new hard drive in my PlayStation 3,

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:54.000
because I'm out of room.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Yeah, it's that easy.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000
We'll talk later, and I'll tell you how I did it, because I was able to do it in about an hour.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Or I'll just make Loki do it for me, because he just said it's easy, too.

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I put a 500 in mine, and I had a 20.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Nice, nice.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:13.000
So you modded your PlayStation 3, and what all games are you playing on it?

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
I signed up for PlayStation Plus.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:18.000
I'm like, okay, let's see what the big thing is about.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
I sign in, I look at all the free games.

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:27.000
It's like the pearly gates have opened, and I'm looking at all these games.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
I'm like, Devil May Cry, download.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Borderlands 2, download.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Something domain game, download.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:39.000
I'm looking at this one game where I think I have it on Xbox Live, but it's free, download.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:47.000
I just have a shit ton of games sitting on my console waiting for me to play at least a little bit of after the show.

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:50.000
PlayStation Plus is a great deal.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
It's really a great deal.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.000
I know that some people are not happy about the whole online multiplayer pay-to-go thing that they instituted with PlayStation 4,

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.000
but it's still a better deal than Xbox Live, in my opinion.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Xbox has a way to go to catch up with that.

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:10.000
When you say it like that, I'm reminded of that one meme of the Red Wedding from Game of Thrones,

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:15.000
where you see three people didn't read the book, didn't read the book, read the book.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
It's like this. You got the same three people.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:22.000
You got one person played Xbox Live, played Xbox Live, didn't play Xbox Live.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:27.000
So those who are on Xbox Live, it's like, well, we kind of knew this shit, so what the fuck?

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:32.000
Bob Coffee in the chat room wants your PSN account.

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
I don't know if you want to give that out over the air,

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:37.000
but just know that there are people that would like to play games with you online.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Well, it's the same screen name I've always had when I called in here on my podcast and wherever.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000
It's DJ Ronma S. I'll even type it in the chat room later.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:50.000
I'll even throw it up on the forums if need be, too.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:57.000
But I realized that after my trial is up, which I will renew, all the free games are gone,

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:01.000
and I'm like, it's not free! These are rentals, dammit!

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:07.000
That's right. That's right. You got to keep paying the Sony people or they're going to take them right away.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:11.000
So look out. Good times.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:14.000
All right, Ronma, anything else on your mind tonight?

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:18.000
My top three games for 2013. No special order.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Number one, Project Cross Zone.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.000
This was the only game that stopped me from playing Candy Crush Saga for months.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Why? I didn't hear a lot of good things about that game. Why that game?

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:39.000
Haters. They're probably mad because it plays like tactics, but the battle is different.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.000
When you're battling, you're actually doing punchier commands where you're fighting the opponents,

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:50.000
whereas normal tactical games, you don't do that. It's like, they fight, and that's it.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Project Cross Zone, you're going in, you're comboing, and you're doing attacks left and right.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
I love that shit.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.000
All right, you're in your second game?

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
DuckTales Remastered.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
And why DuckTales Remastered?

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:14.000
I felt like a kid playing it again. I have a personal challenge for myself to hit $30 million in the game,

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:21.000
because when I had it for NES, I could sit there, go through every single level, and crack $30 million without breaking a sweat.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Fuck that Vesuvius level, though.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I love the Vesuvius level.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:29.000
No, it's great, but I just say fuck it because it's so fucking hard.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.000
The only hard part was when I was trying to get to the end, and I'm playing through the game,

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:39.000
I'm like, I know where everything is, and I realized, oh, they added this, they added, ooh, they added this stuff here,

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.000
and then when you're dragging a duck, and I'm like, I'm thinking, oh, they got Transylvania,

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:49.000
I'm hopping around, trying to get my ass up the damn screen, and I'm like,

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.000
let me switch to the analog controls so I can make my way up there.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.000
Took me two tries, and I finally made it to the end.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:59.000
Took me a couple tries, too. And lastly...

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:03.000
The Legend of Zelda, A Link Between Worlds.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Thumbs up for you, good sir. That's a great choice.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Yes, I just have one thing to say about that.

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:12.000
The ice level, sliding back and forth, playing this while you're riding the subway.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Fuck you, Nintendo. Fuck you.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Alright, on that note, Rama, we gotta let you go to get more calls.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:19.000
Alright, cool.

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.000
Take care, buddy. Always good to see you. Take care.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:23.000
You got it.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Bye.

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Bye.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
We will probably try to sneak in one more call.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:35.000
Let me quickly run through some tweets.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:38.000
We got a few tweets here. Tigerclaw tweeting us at OLR.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Last of Us and Assassin's Creed nominated for WGA Awards, Writers Guild of America.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:47.000
You know, we've seen more and more video games show up in those awards.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:48.000
So that's great.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Last of Us getting a lot of accolades, a lot of Game of the Year awards.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
No surprises there whatsoever, and I know Assassin's Creed...

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
The story of GLAAD last week.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:57.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:03.000
ActDeft tweets us, Kirby Triple Deluxe is sold out on Amazon Japan and is topping the charts in Japan.

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:06.000
So, you know, ActDeft is a Kirby fanboy.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:10.000
So it's probably nice to have that validation that Japan is literally eating him up.

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:11.000
So that's great.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
No, I hope the game is successful here as well.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:19.000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, we can probably fit in one more call.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:23.000
BobbyBlackWolf, our buddy who tapes before us, had to tweet us a picture.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
He said, yeah, I had to. Why not?

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:28.000
He is playing in his Super Nintendo on the Oculus Rift.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:31.000
He's playing what? Super Noah's Ark 3D.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:36.000
He got that through, I'm sure, perfectly legal means to play on his Oculus Rift.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.000
That Super Nintendo emulator is pretty fun, though, because you can actually look around.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Like, you see in the little screenshot he sent us on Twitter, and you can see this, too, if you look at the OLR account.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Let me do a retweet there so you can see that on the OLR account.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:51.000
He actually, if you look down, you see yourself holding the Super Nintendo controller, which is kind of funny.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:56.000
I realize that I didn't understand the picture because you can see your hands on the controller,

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:01.000
and I thought it was a picture that was split in two, and it didn't occur to me until just when you were talking about it.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:04.000
It's a living room simulator emulator.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Yep, that's exactly what it is. He let me play a Mario Kart on it, which was a lot of fun. Good stuff.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Let's see, 13xForever actually tweeted us in response to the FUGL question from last week.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:21.000
Here's my response to the Create Your Own Fighting constructor, and he gives us a link.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:27.000
Let me open that link, but right now we gotta go to the phones because we do have another phone call coming in, so I want to get to it.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:30.000
So, hi there, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Hey there, it's VidPower.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Hey, there you are. Now I can hear you. Hey, VidPower. My God, I haven't heard from you in a long time. How are you?

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:41.000
Good, good.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
Good to hear from you. What's up, buddy?

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
I want to talk about CES again this year.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:48.000
You went to CES this year, right? Because that's right in your backyard, right?

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Totally.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000
How was it?

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Awesome, awesome. I got to check out the PlayStation Now service from Sony.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Oh, even though they were streaming it from, you know, just down the hall, but that's okay.

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Yeah, exactly. Well, you know, it worked, you know, seeing as it was down the hall. So, you know, it worked, and it was kind of cool.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:16.000
I was playing The Last of Us, and you could see the video quality, like, you know, it's like depending on the network.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:24.000
So, you know, it like degrades in quality depending on your network. But, you know, it worked. No lag, which was the most important thing, I thought.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:29.000
That was the most important thing I was going to ask is, is there that kind of lag that you would expect?

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Because that seems like the all-important thing. Like, is there lag?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:39.000
There, I did not feel any lag. That was like the first thing I wanted to try out was, well, you know, seeing as that's down the hall.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:43.000
But yeah, yeah, it was, I was impressed. I was very impressed.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Now the question is, is that going to work from here to Alaska? Or is it only going to work when it's down the hall? That's the crazy question, so.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:58.000
It was, it was kind of cool because they had it running on a new Bravia model, and there was no PlayStation 4 connected whatsoever.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:04.000
So, it was, it was completely streamed to their TV, and they also had a Vita set up, so, you know.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Nice.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Pretty cool, and it worked.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:13.000
But there wasn't like a whole lot of gaming stuff at CES, right? There was just kind of that, or did you get, did you get to catch some other stuff while you were there as well?

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:20.000
In terms of, like, new, like, games, the only new game they had there was Infamous Second Son.

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:28.000
And, you know, that was fun, that was fun. I had never played too many Infamous games before, but yeah, it was pretty fun.

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:32.000
And that only comes out in like two months from now, so it was a nice little preview.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:45.000
Everything else is just like old, older games that have already been out, you know, like Knack, or NBA Live, or games that are already out right now, so nothing new.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Okay, I gotcha. Now, did you get to see Michael Bay fucking up on stage, or was that invite only?

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:59.000
I did not get to see that, no. I saw the video, though, but that was, I totally missed out on that whole shebang.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Was he walking through the show floor with his head hung low, and all that?

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Maybe, maybe. Maybe.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
I'm sure he was hiding out backstage for the whole rest of the competition.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:16.000
That was the most, that was so crazy, and, you know, not to be a bitch, but my immediate tweet, because if you're gonna be a bitch, do it on Twitter, that's where everybody's a bitch.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:22.000
So, my first thing, I went and I wrote a tweet, and I said, I said, Live ain't easy, is it, Michael Bay?

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.000
So, anyway. Alright, I had to say something about that.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Yeah, that was good.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:34.000
Now, okay, since you're in Vegas, surely you know the answer to this question. Is there some type of coin-op show that happens in Vegas every year?

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
It's like an amusement expo or something, right?

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Uh, I think you might be referring to AOU, uh, is it the amusement operators?

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Yes, yes it is. That is it. Thank you. I knew there was something like that.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.000
See, I just have to ask the guy that's in convention, Convention City, there.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.000
TigerClan, our chatroom, saying that the teleprompter broke, that's why.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Well, you shouldn't have to have the teleprompter to make or break you, my gosh.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:08.000
You know what, though, it isn't easy. To be fair, when I did that, it was the UmLoud thing a couple years ago,

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:13.000
when they asked me to be, like, the man on the street thing for the livestream, I was kind of scared shitless.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Like, it is really hard when it's a video, and you know that people are watching you and stuff.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Like, this is easy, because I can't see you.

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:23.000
But when it's in video, it's like, I don't know, it's so much different, it's weird.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:28.000
So, I can't give Michael Bay too much shit, but...

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Anyway, well what else? Tell us one more funny CES story before we let you go.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:43.000
Um, they had a DDR setup for this, like, health, it was like a health company.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Oh, like the DDR in school thing?

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a DDR in school, like, setup, which I was surprised to see. That was kind of funny.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:56:00.000
That is pretty awesome. See, kids today, you know, when I was your age, kids, playing your DDR in school,

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:05.000
when I was your age, in the wintertime, we did square dancing. That was our DDR.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:10.000
And instead of arrows scrolling up the screen, it would be the female PE teacher out there going,

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:15.000
All right, everybody, now do-si-do. And yes, she sounded like that.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:19.000
All right, anybody. Anyway, VidPower, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show,

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:22.000
but it sounds like you had a great time at CES, and I appreciate hearing from you.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:27.000
So, your next mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go to the adult expo that's taking place,

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:30.000
I think, right now, and report on that too, okay?

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
All right, I'll see what I can do.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:35.000
All right, appreciate it. All right, take care, buddy.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:36.000
Bye.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
All right, that again is VidPower there on the Skype line,

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
and that is actually going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:44.000
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but we're running a little bit behind tonight,

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
so I want to make sure we can go ahead and wrap things up.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:51.000
Quickly, Loki, I'm going to check in with you. Are there any other last-minute stories?

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Because I've got to finish these tweets. I didn't finish that one guy's tweet, unfortunately.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
No, there's nothing really.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:04.000
All right, let's see. This is a tweet that, again, 13X Forever sent, saying the Create Your Own Fighting constructor.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:10.000
I guess this is actually a link to a game that will let you actually create your own 3D.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:14.000
This is better, though. This looks better a little bit than Moog. What is it, Moogan is the name of that or whatever?

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.000
This is different. This is EF12. It's a playable 3D fighting game,

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:25.000
and I guess with the engine built in it, you can actually mod the hell out of it and make your own, like, 3D fighters.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:29.000
You could put yourself in it if you want. So that seems like a more advanced type of game.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:39.000
They had something similar on PlayStation 2, I want to say. It was by the same guys that did the RPG Maker as Fighter Maker.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:43.000
But there's some really terrible games they made out of that.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Playism-Games.com, if you want to check that out. Thanks for that tweet. Appreciate it.

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
I'm trying to see if there's any other tweets.

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
Apparently it's on Greenlight as well.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Oh, is it?

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
So says the tweet. I haven't seen the actual listing yet.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.000
I heard they Greenlit a bunch more games there.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Let's see, I'm going to do one more here from Redertainment, saying,

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.000
Is tweeting about a post on Tumblr which is about a tweet meta meta?

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Yes, probably.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.000
Oh god, that was in reference to last week's show. That's really funny.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:19.000
He linked to the tweet with the guy. He actually ended up following me on Twitter, which is pretty cool.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
The guy who did the Metroid thing.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Cyanic.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Don't put me on the spot.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:30.000
There, cymaticbruce.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Alright, that's going to do it.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
I literally just put it in the video like 24 hours ago.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Don't forget.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
That's going to do it for the Twitters tonight.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R if you want to send us a tweet for a future week.

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:47.000
That's it. It's 9.20 here at O-L-R central.

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:51.000
So we got to wrap up and get on out of here for the night.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Jason, I want to thank you once again for being here and appreciate you really.

02:58:55.000 --> 02:59:02.000
You guys don't know this, but Jason had to step up with about five minutes notice to take over Jamie's stories tonight.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
So I really appreciate that.

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
I'm here. I manage.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:12.000
It's nice being able to get out there and opinionate and pundit it up a little bit more.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
It's fun. Good times. You did a good job.

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
So thank you for being here. Your final thought tonight, sir?

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:21.000
My thought tonight is as much as I'm not looking forward to driving back home, I want to be back home.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Three three little weeks.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:30.000
Well, Loki, as much as I'd hope to see you next week, I have this funny feeling we're probably not going to see you next week, although I suppose we might.

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:37.000
So let me just say in advance, good luck with everything and wishing you and Mrs. Loki all the best in this next journey.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
And yeah, we'll be thinking of you.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
We want to know the name as soon as the kids here.

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:42.000
All right. Of course.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:45.000
I already know the name, but I can't say anything until he's born.

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
I understand. I completely understand.

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
Your final thought, Loki?

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:53.000
His name's Rob Brower.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:57.000
I wish. That'd be cute. That's a good name.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:00.000
I ate free coffee this week, so that's good.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Free coffee! Yay!

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
And I have a coffee truck parked out in front of our work.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:07.000
Nice. I want a coffee truck outside of my work. No fair.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:11.000
And my final thought tonight. I'll say what I always say at the end of every show.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:15.000
If you like what you hear here at Orange Laundry Radio, don't forget to tell a friend or five about the program.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Help us spread the word. You know, word of mouth is all we've got.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Independents have to support each other.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:29.000
And as long as you're not whipping your titties out on PlayStation 4, chances are, or your wiener.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:30.000
I'm equal opportunity here.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:37.000
As long as you're not whipping that stuff out on PlayStation 4, I probably will support your independent broadcast because I'm all about getting the voices out there.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
So remember, just support any broadcast.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Even if you didn't like this show, there's tons of other people doing a similar type of thing with just as much passion.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.000
So please support all those hardworking independent broadcasters out there.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:51.000
If you like what we do, the best way you can support us, tell a friend or five about the show.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:59.000
If you seriously can't think of anybody to tell, a nice review goes a long way on a site like iTunes, a site like Stitcher.

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Those reviews, especially the Stitcher ones, really do go a long way.

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:07.000
And we've been having really good success on Stitcher lately thanks to those reviews, so I really, really appreciate it.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
And Jamie would like to say blah.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Is that her final thought?

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:11.000
That is her final thought.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:17.000
Feel better, DarkSakura. We missed you tonight. We hope to see you real soon, okay?

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
Really appreciate that.

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:24.000
That's it. We're done. We'll be back next week and we'll do it all over again.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:27.000
So until then, take care everybody.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Don't be a jerk online. Keep it in your pants, please. Please.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:35.000
