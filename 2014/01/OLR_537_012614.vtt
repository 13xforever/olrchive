00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, the news is exciting as it ever is. However, we'd like to take this moment to send our congratulations to Loki, along with Miss Loki and Baby Loki, on the arrival of newest Baby Loki this week. Congratulations! And now, on with the show.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
That's right. Congratulations. This story is happy.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Yay! Congratulations!

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Voice makers, confetti.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Hooray for genetics.

00:40.000 --> 00:50.000
Celebration. Hey, welcome back everybody. My internet friends and everybody out there. Tune in to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here to talk with you over the next few hours about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host. Say hello, of course, to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Blarg.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
How are you doing?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Blarg!

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Blarg. That was a very happy kind of blarg.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes, it was.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm okay. I'm just tired.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
I know you have been settling in at Cool New Job, and things are going very coolly.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Since I am not going to be telling anybody where I work.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
It's fine. I don't either.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I've decided that it is called Cool Job.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Cool Job.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
And that I really like Cool Job.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
I'll call mine Fun Job, and you can have Cool Job.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
You have Fun Job, I have Cool Job.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Alright.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
But, but, but, but...

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Jason can have Hand Job.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Hahaha.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Alright.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
But, but I have to say...

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Wow!

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Oh hey, Jason. How you doing?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Wow!

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I...

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
No, your job's really cool, though, too.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
I just have to say one little thing, though.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
I have been walking around in my N7 hoodie, and have been called Shepherd no less than eight times during the last week.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
They get it.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
That's a good sign of a good workplace.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yes, it is.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
That's a good sign.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Hey, Jason. How you doing?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Hi.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
I mean, I shouldn't be averse to that, because that falls in line with the trend of things that are at least mildly pleasant.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
One would hope.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
A hand job is a very good thing.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
So, you know what?

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
It's okay. I couldn't think of any other insert, insert here job.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Oh wow.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
And Dark Soccer's doing the hand jive.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm doing the hand jive because, like, what was that?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
A happy ending massage video.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Hahaha.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Oh god, that's a great YouTube.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Alright, anyway.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I smell a future fortune cookie.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Perhaps, perhaps.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
That one is so visual that it doesn't work, so.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Voice of the show, Jason, back here for another week.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Hello.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
Celebrating wintertime, which, welcome to California winter, by the way, where it hasn't rained for 45 days.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
I was here for the brunt of it.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
I talked about the miserably cold, like, second week of December, and in the Bay Area, it is getting much nicer, though.

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
It's been nominal all week, and will continue to be.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
But we are going to have you at least one more week, right? We're going to have you next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday?

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
I... actually don't know.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Alright.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
I don't know, I literally have no idea what's going to happen next week because I have been...

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
We did talk hand skin ball last week, and that is still the...

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Hahahaha.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
Maybe your job is hand job. Hahahaha.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
You didn't even, you didn't even tell that to be funny.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I can't even pick the right words to make that even remotely better anymore.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
You know what, just ignore my comments. Ignore my comments.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Pig skin ball. Hand ball. Egg ball.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
These words are not making face.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
I'd just call it wank ball and be done with it.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Alright.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
I do intend to be part of some of a Super Bowl party with some friends next week.

03:33.000 --> 03:40.000
I don't know when it will start, if I'll duck out at the half. I have no idea what my specific plans are.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
We will play it by ear, like we usually do. Like I usually do, anyways.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Well, we will be having a Puppy Bowl party next week.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
I'll go ahead and say, I was going to tease this during the segment later where we talk about the plugs and stuff,

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
but I will be saying, live in studio on Orange Lawn Tradio for the first time in several years.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
It's probably been about five years since we've had this guy on Orange Lawn Tradio.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Many of you know him, however, from his time on Hoard House.

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
Shane will be here live next week on Puppy Bowl Sunday.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
So that's going to be a fun show. Or as Shane would say, whatever.

04:14.000 --> 04:23.000
You know what, I know we're calling it Puppy Bowl Sunday, but my usual nickname for the bigger event that day is going to be...

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There is no bigger event than where Keyboard Cat plays halftime.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
For the more nationally accepted event...

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Fine.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
Could possibly be accurate. The Super Bowl.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
The Super Bowl.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
The Super Bowl.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
The Super Bowl.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
All right. So anyway, we do need to say, of course, Tech Master Loki, not here in studio tonight.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
As you probably guessed, he has the night off because...

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
He better be rubbing his wife's feet.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Because Mrs. Loki did deliver the child on Tuesday.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
So congratulations to Loki and Mrs. Loki on the newest addition to their family.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
And I can tell you the name. The name is...

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
They named their child because remember he was teasing. It had a video game reference in it.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
So they named their child Daniel Layton.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
That's right. The kid's name is Professor Layton, which is kind of awesome.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
You know what my husband said?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Huh?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Good name.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
I know, good name, right?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Because I married a Dan.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Well, you and Dan have talked about when that day inevitably comes.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
I don't know if you're still like serious about this or not, but...

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
It's probably not bloody likely.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
You were tossed around the idea of Richter as a name, right? At some point?

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
Yeah, and then we've decided that if we had a girl we'd go after a name each for one of our grandmothers.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
And then a name each for one of our uncles.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Ah.

05:45.000 --> 05:52.000
Because we are very proud of our uncles and he does not want a Daniel Peter 3.0.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
I see. That's fine.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Because Dan's a junior.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Ah, okay.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
So half the family calls him Pete.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Okay.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Because his dad is Dan. But not me.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
Professor Layton, they're setting him up for a lifetime of a student loan debt.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
I think... right.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
I should, just to clarify, they do spell Layton a little differently.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
L-A-I-G-H.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
No, I think there's an E in it in 7A or something like that.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.000
And so I don't think they actually named it off the video game character. I think it's just one of those things.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
Well, yeah, they don't want their son to get sued for copyright.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
I mean...

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah, we'll talk about that later.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.000
I'm pretty sure Mrs. Loki probably said, what about this name? And then Loki probably went, yes, yes, that name will work.

06:31.000 --> 06:41.000
I do have to say though, and I've made this observation just as a Jewish convert, that while Mrs. Loki is not super observant, all of her children have had Jewish names.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So I have... that has not gone unnoticed.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
So there you go.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
And they sound like normal names to me. So two ways.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I do not know when Loki will be back.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
He can take as much time off as he needs, and I'm sure we all understand. So that's that.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
We'll miss him, but we're all thinking about him and his growing families. That's amazing.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Anyhow...

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Nellie, I'm sorry, is gonna be...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Go ahead, quickly.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Is gonna be... tired.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, well...

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Like I said...

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
They all are.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
He better be rubbing her feet.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
They are all gonna be tired.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
He better be getting her whatever she wants, and he better be waking up a baby.

07:19.000 --> 07:27.000
So anyway, let's talk about our growing family. You guys in our chat room, the always present other panelists on the show.

07:27.000 --> 07:36.000
Live.vognetwork.com is where we tape live at the Voice of Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
And if you do happen to be listening to this show live, head on over to our chat. Again, that's live.vognetwork.com.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
And you may get your comments right on air. Sometimes epic debates on this program have started from a simple chat comment.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
So bring it, y'all.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.000
Go into our chat room. We'll let Locopoco start us off, commenting on the name. Daniel Layton.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
Locopoco says, you must solve this puzzle or else you get no dinner.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
That's cruel, but funny.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Alright, Raginator says, so no tingle Layton then.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
I think Loki was going to stay far away from the name Tingle, that's for sure.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Some folks talking about the Super Bowl, and Brad from Pod Culture reminding us it's going to be the Weed Bowl.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
And Rama's saying it's the Smoke-A-Bowl.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
I call it the, I don't give a shit bowl, how about that?

08:30.000 --> 08:37.000
I just, yeah. You know what, we've got our thing, video games, some other folks have their thing, football.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
Some people have both, which is cool. If next Sunday's a big deal for you, have fun with it.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
You know, just be safe, drink in moderation, don't drink and drive, all that stuff. Have fun with it.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
We'll still be here doing our thing though.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
So I did not finish last week's video because I was quite sick and quite busy this week.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Fired!

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
But, how have I never heard of Super High Impact before?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
What?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
You hadn't heard of that before?

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
I have never played, seen, heard of it before, and I looked up footage for use in the video.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
And I just lost, pleasantly lost 30 minutes of my life watching the game being played.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It's the game that growls at you.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
It was the most ridiculous, greatly ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, it's a fun game, isn't it?

09:24.000 --> 09:30.000
That's the only football game that we had at my house for the longest time, was Super High Impact.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
It was the other one for me, Tecmo Bowl, was the only one I could, you know.

09:33.000 --> 09:40.000
I think it may have been, just based off the name, I was maybe averse to it for like, fighting game reasons or something like that.

09:40.000 --> 09:48.000
But, I've played a lot of one-offs in my life, I've played a lot of alternative sports games in my life, missed that one somehow.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
I will be correcting this sometime soon.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
It actually was pretty fun, I mean, my brothers and I would play it.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
And I just liked that it would growl at you every time you picked a play.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
You'd go, grrrr, make that noise.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
So, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
We have several, actually, tonight, because I kind of hit a creative block tonight when I was trying to put together the show role.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
I was like, what are we going to talk about for the kickoff topic tonight?

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
So, I did what I sometimes do when I hit a creative block and I crowdsourced.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
I went to my Twitter feed and I said, guys, you must be a social media expert.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Apparently, right?

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
I went to my social media feed, I went to my Twitter and I said, hey guys, what should we do for a kickoff topic tonight?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And so, I got a few answers and I got some really good stuff.

10:30.000 --> 10:37.000
And so, I want to just quickly, I don't want to have any long 45 minute kickoff topics like we had last week, right, Jason?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
Well, funny enough, my buddy Ian, or AtariBarbie on Twitter, actually said, Nintendo financials.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
And I said, you should probably go to last week's show, buddy.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Thanks, though.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
But I understand. It's a three hour show. He's probably behind.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
But AtariBarbie sent me another one that I thought was a really good kickoff topic.

10:57.000 --> 11:03.000
So, let me start with this one. So, quickly, asking everybody here in the room, what does game of the year mean?

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
You know, this is January. You've got a lot of podcasts, a lot of media outlets catching up on there.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
What was my 2013 game of the year?

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
And, you know, and I even talked about this a little bit on last week's show because I said, damn it.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
You know, I mentioned my top five games of the year in the last show of December.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
But then I played Guacamelee. And I was like, you know what, Guacamelee, whatever.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
That really should have been, wait, didn't we find out that in Spanish, I'm pronouncing it right, anyway.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
I played that game and it was like, shouldn't that have been one of my top five?

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
It very well probably should have been. I probably actually would rank that higher than Spelunky at this point.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
So, although Spelunky is very good too, but my point is, you know, these things change.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
So, what does game of the year really mean?

11:45.000 --> 11:53.000
What does it mean when, I don't know, IGN does their big game of the year or, you know, Koopa Club podcast,

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
which Ian is a part of, does their game of the year? What does game of the year really mean?

11:57.000 --> 12:06.000
Game of the year means to me that it has that sort of association for fond memories.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
It's something that you'll come back to actively or passively.

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
If you're in the mood for it, great. If you're just looking for something to do and it seems to kind of,

12:16.000 --> 12:25.000
you know, fill that need for being able to take in artistic or otherwise meaningful detail,

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
that you'll go back to it for that.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
As we said in our top three, it does not just have to be this year.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It just has to be something that you played in this year.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
And with the ever-growing size of libraries, you can miss things.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Like, I just found out that I missed something for two decades running.

12:42.000 --> 12:50.000
It's a game that resonates with you in whatever way that's meaningful to you.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It's as simple as that.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
I really think that, you know, game of the year, and we kind of talked about this disclaimer before we did ours,

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
it's really, there's no right or wrong answer, clearly.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
It's whatever game to you had the biggest impact on you for that year.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
Or, you know, the game that you look back and you say, dang it, that was my best gaming experience.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
And everything I did the entire year, that game frickin' just smacked me with a two-by-four,

13:14.000 --> 13:20.000
either with emotion, with beauty, with gameplay, replayability, whatever it is.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
So mine would be Mass Effect every year?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Possibly, honestly.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
When you look back on 2013, what video game are you going to say, man, that game defined 2013 for me.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
That was a great year for gaming.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
That was practically all I played was fractal.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Is that a bad thing?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
No.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Just because she didn't go with the artistic choice of Gone Home?

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
Or she didn't go with the mainstream choice of The Last of Us?

13:46.000 --> 13:52.000
Well, I think I picked Stanley Parable as one of my games because it made me giggle.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.000
But here's the thing, when you're talking to you as an individual versus, you know, you've got,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
I know Polygon did their list and had some interesting feedback

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
because they chose to name Gone Home their top game of the year, for better or for worse.

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
Or GameSpot, which I believe also named Zelda, Link Between Worlds, just like I did as my game of the year.

14:11.000 --> 14:20.000
When you have an organization, it's a little bit different because now that list represents your company, your organization.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It's part of your branding.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Yeah, it's part of your branding. It really is. It's part of your editorial and so forth.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
And I'm going to take, look, I'm going to take a lot of shit for what I'm about to say, but I'm just going to tell it like it is.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
This is honest, Rob. I'm just going to tell it like it is.

14:38.000 --> 14:49.000
Polygon's choice of Gone Home as game of the year makes a lot of sense for that organization because both those things are kind of, well, you know.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Quirky, quirky.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah, all right, yeah. You know where I'm going with this, right?

14:52.000 --> 15:00.000
A little bit, you know, whereas, you know, you got something a little more mainstream like GameSpot, you know, picks a little bit more of a mainstream choice or whatever.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
You know, it's just, it kind of does match the branding of the organization in some ways.

15:05.000 --> 15:10.000
So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

15:10.000 --> 15:18.000
Black Wolf says, I remember getting crap from a listener because of what I chose as my game of the year did not move the industry forward in quotes.

15:18.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, but Black Wolf, you are your show. You have every right to whatever the hell you want to pick as your game of the year and nobody can really refute that.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
That is your game of the year. That's my opinion anyway.

15:28.000 --> 15:37.000
Well, because it is an opinion and opinions aren't wrong per se.

15:37.000 --> 15:42.000
It's opinions are something based from feeling which actually can't be necessarily quantified.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
So he's right to pick whatever he wants.

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
Black Wolf in chat says, I liked Gone Home and I also like Polygon.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
Don't get me wrong, I like both those things too. Gone Home was a great experience.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.000
Not my game of the year necessarily, but that's just because there were so many great games last year.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
That doesn't mean Gone Home was not a great experience. It was.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And I gave it a positive review and I talked about it the first time.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.000
It's just the, it's kind of come to be accepted as the, how do we say it, pretentious choice?

16:10.000 --> 16:15.000
I mean, I'm sorry to the developers of the game that worked very hard on it, I'm sure.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
But I'm just saying it kind of has that reputation right now of being the pretentious choice.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
So, you know, it makes sense that a pretentious news organization.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Anyway, let's see. I'm just telling it like it is tonight.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I've been sick all week. I don't care.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Well, Biologist calls him like a season.

16:30.000 --> 16:35.000
Locopoco says, my game of the year of 2013 was Killer Instinct and not The Last of Us.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
Why? Because Killer Instinct is the type of game I love most and The Last of Us just doesn't.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
It's just personal preference.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.000
And you know what? If you're a fighting game fan, I fully expect that a game like Killer Instinct would top your list.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
That game is gorgeous.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Right?

16:50.000 --> 16:59.000
Like from, you know, I, I don't think I still have my Killer Instinct cart, but for the fighting games that I got in, that I actually got into, Killer Instinct ranks up there.

16:59.000 --> 17:08.000
I was never particularly any good at it, but I still have concrete memories about it that I know exactly what the game was, how it played, what it looks like.

17:08.000 --> 17:15.000
Not so much the N64 because I never owned one, a little bit maybe, but the SNES and the arcade versions 100%.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Booting it up on the Xbox One blew me away.

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
It was, you know, I, just knowing the progression of fighting games.

17:23.000 --> 17:34.000
The fact that Street Fighter IV went in a slightly different direction where Tekken and, holy crap, what's the other fighting game series?

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Um...

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Soulcalibur?

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
No, there's an, uh, something, something alongside Tekken that's been frequently updated.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
I want to say King of Fighters.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Yeah, the King of Fighters series has been.

17:47.000 --> 17:54.000
It's very obvious I'm missing it, but like, as many fighting games with a continued series that have come out and have been more realistic and more realistic.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
Street Fighter went more exaggerated and cartoony.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Fucking unbelievable.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
I'm thinking Virtua Fighter.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Mortal Kombat and Injustice is what I'm thinking of.

18:03.000 --> 18:13.000
Um, um, and so as all those games got more realistic and, and I want to say dark, but you know, just these, just these really serious tones.

18:13.000 --> 18:23.000
Street Fighter went super cartoony and then Killer Instinct with all of these fake creatures still has so much depth and detail that is 100% gorgeous.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.000
Um, shifting to another topic here, Kaishudo in chat says, my game of the year is Grand Theft Auto 5.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
You know, I believe that was Loki's pick for game of the year.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
And believe?

18:32.000 --> 18:38.000
Right. And we all kind of sat here and went, duh, we could have, we could have named Loki's top three because his top three was what?

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Like Saints Row 4, uh, Grand Theft Auto 5.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
I mean, it was the, the, the Loki games you would expect, right?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Absolutely.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Just like the fighting game fans, you know, are going to pick and so on and so on.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
So anyway, a pinball fan probably really enjoyed a pinball arcade, you know, whatever.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Anyway, good topic.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
And thank you.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
And everybody should listen to Koopa Club.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
It's a fun, fun show.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
By the way, I should have also added the Metallica pinball table to my list.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I didn't realize there was a Metallica pinball table.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
It's kind of rad.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
Yeah, they had it at, um, uh, California extreme last year.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Awesome.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Had a big thing for it.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
It was actually really cool.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
Let me do a quick, uh, suggestion that came from, I love this username on Twitter.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-T.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
But the username says John.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
So I'll, I'll say John.

19:21.000 --> 19:29.000
John said, yeah, for Pokemon games, how come they don't have the Pokemon talk like in the show instead of the horrific chiptune growls?

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Well, maybe I should roll that question over to next week when Shane's here because Shane's a Pokemon expert.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
He'll, he'll be able to answer all that.

19:34.000 --> 19:40.000
But I, my understanding, it's just limitations of the hardware because you have to remember that series dates back to the original Game Boy.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
And that really, you couldn't do voice for 150 characters in the Game Boy.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
Well, and the fact, and I think I had covered it when I did Pokemon as classic game.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
Hint, hint.

19:50.000 --> 20:01.000
That, um, it was actually a big thing that he got the growling noises to go out by, um, using the, uh, the midi processor to have them make any of those.

20:01.000 --> 20:10.000
Yeah. That's the other thing about that series is that with all of the core games being on portables on, you know, non optical media, it's kind of at a disadvantage for storage space.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
So to fit the entirety of the world, the entirety of the textures, the entirety of the items, all of the other data that goes into making up those games.

20:18.000 --> 20:25.000
They, and not to mention relying on, um, synthesizers, synthesizers instead of samplers or mixing those up.

20:25.000 --> 20:32.000
Uh, the, the limitations and the capacity is not exactly at a premium in the Nintendo mobile world.

20:32.000 --> 20:39.000
Uh, I will say Pokemon XY though does have the actual Pikachu saying Pikachu, which is the most recognizable one from the cartoon series, obviously.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
I wish they would have done more, but I, they crammed a lot of stuff into that little 3DS card.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
All what, 650 or something like that?

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, right. So, you know, when you start to get that many, I think they kind of had to pick and choose which ones they're going to give voices to.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
So there you go.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Alright, two more kickoff topics here from Twitter.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
Uh, this next one comes from my pal Ronnie Talbot on Twitter.

21:00.000 --> 21:10.000
Uh, Ronnie was on Horde House, uh, a while ago, and he was actually, a lot of people have known him because he was on, um, uh, a reality show called Big Brother here in the US.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
So we're, we're Twitter friends after that. Cause when he was a nerd on big, I like trashy reality TV shows and he was a nerd.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
So it was like, Ronnie, what's up? We should be friends. And now we are.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.000
Um, so Ronnie sent me a suggestion and I know he was bitching about this on Twitter the other night.

21:24.000 --> 21:32.000
Ronnie says, how about why is the gaming community so cannibalizing in games like League of Legends?

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
They are so rude to each other. They never consider the concept of everyone sucks in the beginning.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.000
They expect auto awesomeness. Hashtag not gonna happen.

21:42.000 --> 21:49.000
That is so true though in so many online games and you know, I don't know, maybe this is more of a Horde House topic, whatever. Let's bring it up here.

21:49.000 --> 21:58.000
There's oftentimes really toxic communities if for new players, you know, like if you're not good GTFO, right?

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
And I'm always kind of like, well then why do you play in public rooms if you don't want to play against all skill sets?

22:05.000 --> 22:13.000
If you want to play against people that are good, find the good people and set up private matches or something like it always just kind of blows my mind how mean people are.

22:13.000 --> 22:27.000
But especially in a game like League of Legends where teamwork is so important to success, like people get really ticked off when they get a new player because they'd rather throw their hands up and say, oh, I quit than trying to teach somebody how to play.

22:27.000 --> 22:40.000
A reason is probably the fact that games like that are quantifiably skill based and when they face someone of noticeably lower skill then it's considered a waste of their time.

22:41.000 --> 22:49.000
And when those games more or less have a minimum of 20 to 25 minutes, that's a reasonable chunk of time.

22:49.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, you can steamroll them more often than not, but Starcraft, I don't know that I've really seen it so much in Starcraft.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
You get those attitudes, but usually at the end and not at the beginning, not that that's different from the point that he was making.

23:03.000 --> 23:13.000
But quantifiable multiplayer games and yeah, I don't know where to go beyond that.

23:13.000 --> 23:19.000
I think it's as simple as when you don't have to look that person in the eye, it's much easier to be a dick to them.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
Well that defines every single game ever, which is probably also quite a bit of truth too.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
That's just the freaking internet. That's the internet.

23:26.000 --> 23:38.000
When you get in one of those hyper competitive things where your success is dependent on your team, when you get somebody that's going to quote bring you down, a lot of people get frustrated and throw their hands up and quit and they don't want to take that patience.

23:38.000 --> 23:44.000
I remember watching you stream Final Fantasy XIV one night and you guys were shaming your party.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
They don't know what they're doing!

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
You have to teach this tank!

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
What the hell man?

23:50.000 --> 23:57.000
I guess we're no better, I don't know, but another big difference is that we didn't say it like you're terrible.

23:57.000 --> 24:06.000
And you legitimately were teaching them so that they would actually be able to get through the instance or whatever was actually going on that night.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
The Titan fight was what we were doing that night.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
I'll take your word for it.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
Anybody who's played XIV knows the thrill of the Titan fight, so anyway.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I'm just nodding my head right now because...

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Smile and nod, smile and nod.

24:19.000 --> 24:30.000
The anonymous internet kind of sucks sometimes for that and I really wish those people who are not going to have any patience for new people would go find their little team and go play with that and nothing but that.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
Because there's going to be new people and you just have to deal with it.

24:34.000 --> 24:41.000
Like in Final Fantasy XIV, which I play an awful lot of, if I'm going to use the Duty Finder, I'm going to probably get people that are new.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Because they're using it too to find the people.

24:43.000 --> 24:53.000
So I've got to wait for cutscenes, I've got to explain fights, and sure I might get frustrated but I'm not going to take it out on said person because everybody's got to learn somewhere.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
I also remember...

24:57.000 --> 25:05.000
It was a little different, E3 2004, I was wandering around with you when they had the Final Fantasy XI...

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Oh, the year I won the computer?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
And you were...

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Because you were...

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
I'm waiting to see what words... choose your words carefully, Jason.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
Yeah, because I've been doing that so well tonight already.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
It wasn't like...

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
Hand skin ball.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Thanks for the reminder.

25:24.000 --> 25:31.000
It was not nearly as bad as what I just referenced with Final Fantasy XIV.

25:31.000 --> 25:36.000
You were still... you were disappointingly frustrated because the collective of people...

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
You didn't have a lot of confidence in your team, sir.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
You were just like, I want to be able to do this because I know what's actually going on.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
I want you guys to be able to keep up with me.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
And so it was that excitement.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
I wanted to win, dammit.

25:49.000 --> 25:56.000
Absolutely. It was the frustration born out of eagerness, which is completely legitimate and always happens.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
And again, with that slant of, you actually know what the hell is going on.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
You're a fan on the floor that's here because you enjoy the game.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
You already have experience with the game.

26:05.000 --> 26:10.000
But by no means did you boss, take over, browbeat anybody else you were playing with.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
Yeah, I didn't walk up to a total stranger on my team and go, why do you suck so fucking bad?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
You lost this round for us!

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Just kill yourself! And that's what people say in online games.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
You know, I would never do that.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
I might roll my eyes when they're not looking, but you know, that's the extent of it.

26:25.000 --> 26:31.000
I want to say I remember that you kind of threw hints to whoever was closest next to you.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Maybe? I could be making that up.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
I would hope, because helping them would help me win.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
If I'm like, alright, cast this. Go find that guy, cast it. Hit the buttons. Do it, do it, do it.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
No, the other buttons.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
No, no, the other buttons!

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
I know there's a lot figured out! Let's do it!

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Look, if I knew Ronnie's topic was just going to get me called out by Jason, I would never have read it.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Damn it, Ronnie. Alright.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Love you, Ronnie. Never met you, but love you already.

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
Moving on, one more little kick-off topic here from Flocko Jones.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
If you visit VoGnetwork.com and ever read the comments, you know Flocko Jones.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
He's the number one fan of Hoard House. He's a great guy. We love Flocko Jones.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
Flocko says, because it's Grammy night. Oh yeah, that.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Award show.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Yeah, award show. Really though, I like this topic.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Maybe a discussion of your favorite video game music since it's Grammy night.

27:23.000 --> 27:28.000
Or to be more topical, music from this year's games that should have been nominated like Journeys was last year.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
Let's go with kind of, what soundtracks have you discovered recently that are really frickin' good?

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
I'm going to kind of generalize it in that way. What soundtracks have you discovered lately?

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
I saw Frozen on Friday.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
I meant video games, damn it. Alright, that'll work though, I guess.

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
Alright. Anybody? I would say again, Guacamelee was a great...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
To tip the coffee out of your hand.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Was a great, great soundtrack. I love that one.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Hotline Miami.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Hotline Miami did have a great soundtrack to it.

28:05.000 --> 28:10.000
Oh, and Drunken Robot Pornography. No, it really did have good music.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
That name makes me giggle, how can it not?

28:12.000 --> 28:15.000
What about you guys in chat? Live.vognetwork.com.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
And Fractal, if you just want good background ambience.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Jason?

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
I know I just added a bunch of soundtracks to my library.

28:23.000 --> 28:28.000
I don't know that I've had something...

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
I've been very into a lot of...

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
I hate using the word traditional, but you know, composed music for public consumption and not just for the medium of games.

28:39.000 --> 28:45.000
It's been a while since I've had something in gaming that has been that specific for me.

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
I've been listening to an awful lot of rogue legacy music lately, and that's fun and it fits the motif.

28:52.000 --> 28:58.000
Beyond that, it's fine. I wouldn't call it the experience on the level we're talking about, though.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
We've got a couple of people in chat, including Rama and Awesome Unicorn saying Link Between Worlds.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Of course, of course, it was great.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
Let's see, Rama also says DuckTales Remastered. That was a really good soundtrack.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
It was really good.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
SG100Matt says Broken Age has a great soundtrack.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
And Tal says Banner Saga.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
So those are all some really good picks. Good job, you guys.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Thank you for picking up the slack, chat room.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
Thank you for picking up the slack, because I was blanking a little bit on that question.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
I was like, what if I played really recently?

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
I mean, I keep thinking back to older games and so forth, but I can't think of a lot of recent stuff.

29:35.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah, it's hard, because it's very much a secondary thing, and the easy cop-out is something where the music makes the game,

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
whether the obvious answers that we all know here are something like sound shapes or anything else along those lines.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
Music is secondary, which usually helps to float the obvious ones to the surface.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Ooh, TigerClaw says, what about the Bioshock Infinite soundtrack? Yes.

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
I've been listening to the Minecraft soundtrack a lot lately. That's really good, too.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
Chiptune artist C418.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
Great stuff, great stuff. I know this is really cliche of me to say, but the music in this game really, really, really is good.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
Final Fantasy XIV is so good. It's so good. So good.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
One would hope.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
All right, thank you guys for your kickoff topic suggestions. Those were all really great.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
So thank you, Internet. You helped save the show. All right, thank you to the folks there that I read.

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
Let's get into our gaming week, so specifically, what types of video games have you been passing the time with this week?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
DarkSakura.

30:30.000 --> 30:40.000
I played some Final Fantasy XIV, because I actually had a few minutes one night instead of doing everybody else's stuff that I still have other stuff to do.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.000
Wow.

30:42.000 --> 30:49.000
I've been checking up on my village at work during lunch, and that's really about all the time I've had.

30:49.000 --> 30:57.000
I've just been way too tired when I come home and having to catch up on all the stuff that I thought I had an entire month to do.

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
Tumblr will take like three hours to catch up on. It's totally true, though.

31:04.000 --> 31:11.000
That's not really what I'm catching up on. Tumblr is what I do in the 30 minutes I have when I'm trying to wind down.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Learning is exhausting. Expanding your brain is very difficult.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
I think just getting your body back in the habit of going to work.

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
Well, I just want to be on my new schedule already, because it means I get to sleep in and stay up later, because that's my normal.

31:23.000 --> 31:29.000
But because it takes so long to drive to work and back, I'm just completely worn out by the time I get home.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
I haven't even been to the gym last week, but then again, I've still had this cough.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
And thank heavens you won't be working Sunday nights, so you can still do OLR.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
Oh, no. I had an arrangement made.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
Oh, good.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
Because we could trade our schedules. We had a day to trade schedules.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.000
Oh, nice.

31:44.000 --> 31:53.000
So I said, hey, and he raids. So I was like, hey, if I get Saturday off and you get a Sunday off, we can trade like that.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Got it.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
But then it turned out he gets off in time to get home for a raid, and I have a weekend.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
Yay!

32:01.000 --> 32:08.000
So because I was like, dude, I know maintaining, and he's in whatever guild he's in is like their top ranked.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Oh, nice.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
On their server. Like they are going for progression and getting firsts. They have a bunch of firsts.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Nice.

32:15.000 --> 32:18.000
So I'll have to have him call in on Horde House one day.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.000
That'd be fun.

32:19.000 --> 32:28.000
He's a cool guy. But yeah, I know I did play something else, because I was trying to, oh, yeah, I was playing fractal to veg out,

32:28.000 --> 32:37.000
because what happened is when I tried to move over all my saves from my old Steam install, and my fractal saves for some reason never showed up.

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
So I have to start over, which sucks, but oh well.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
All right. If that's it, we'll go.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
That really is.

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
That's fine. You've been busy. We've all been sick too, which is very funny. Well, not funny.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Jason, what have you been playing this week?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
We've been sick.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
Every time I laugh, I start coughing hysterically. It's awful.

33:00.000 --> 33:11.000
As you just said, and as I said previously, between my obligations from work this week, like I knew were going to happen, and then the fact that I was completely out on Friday,

33:11.000 --> 33:20.000
I started putting together the video for 536 last night, and my brain was just saying that it wasn't going to happen.

33:20.000 --> 33:26.000
So I decided instead that I wanted to stop talking about making some progress on a game, and I wanted to finish it.

33:26.000 --> 33:35.000
I sat down, and I beat Rogue Legacy, which means completing the final two bosses and story clearing the game.

33:35.000 --> 33:45.000
I am now at the point that I'm new game plus-ing and can continue through with the Nioh versions, whatever the term is for the alternative form of the main bosses,

33:45.000 --> 33:54.000
and then just stat whoring and continuing to gather new upgrades, which I'm perfectly fine with because Rogue likes and I love them.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
That's pretty much it. Literally just about two to three hours last night.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
Beating a game is a pretty good accomplishment. That's more than I usually do, so congrats.

34:04.000 --> 34:11.000
My gaming week. Pretty much more of the same stuff like Final Fantasy XIV. It takes up a lot of my time.

34:11.000 --> 34:19.000
I don't usually review games based off the demo, but I feel like this demo is big enough that I should mention that I did play the Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns demo,

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
because I was very curious to see where this is going.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.000
No, because you can't use the Ares costume in the demo.

34:28.000 --> 34:38.000
It comes with a new costume that I guess carries over to the game, but otherwise you have like six costumes you can switch between in the demo.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
There is a point to the costume thing. That's what I learned.

34:40.000 --> 34:48.000
There actually really is a point to that because the little twist on the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns is that your party is lightning, lightning, and lightning.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
That's your party. Basically you have three lightnings. I'm not making this up. You have lightning, lightning, and lightning.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
It's just that you use this, I don't want to call it the dresh fear, but it sure feels like it to me.

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
You use the L1 and R1 to flip between the different lightnings that you have programmed.

35:05.000 --> 35:14.000
So you might have like red mage lightning, dragoon lightning, and like paladin lightning or something in your party, and you can flip between them using L1 and R1.

35:14.000 --> 35:21.000
And then you have like a meter that measures stamina, I guess.

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
So like you can use, let's say I flip to my warrior and then attack, attack, attack, attack, blitz, attack, attack.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
Well then she runs out of stamina, so I have to flip really quick to my black mage.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.000
Now fire, fire, fire, fire, blizzard, button mashing, those.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
And while I'm playing as my black mage, my warrior is recovering stamina.

35:37.000 --> 35:43.000
So it's like you play as one, run the stamina bar out, flip to another, run the stamina bar out, flip to another.

35:43.000 --> 35:51.000
So it's an interesting little twist on the battle system. The demo is like really, really short. Really short.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
It's like five random encounters, a boss fight, you're done.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.000
And then, oh yeah, 25 minutes worth of cut scenes, because this is Final Fantasy 13 after all.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
Because it's Final Fantasy we're talking about.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Yeah, especially Final Fantasy 13, right?

36:04.000 --> 36:12.000
So they do try to push a little bit too of their more connected type of thing they're doing with Facebook and Twitter and kind of like an online thing.

36:12.000 --> 36:18.000
Like you're supposed to be able to send like pictures and things online where people will be...

36:18.000 --> 36:23.000
It's kind of like a Miiverse-style integration to me, except like items can be attached to the posts.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
That's really what it felt like to me.

36:25.000 --> 36:31.000
And you can put these posts on Facebook, because like I played through the demo twice, because it's so flipping short.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
So the first time I played through it, and I figured out, oh, the boss is very vulnerable to blank.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
I'm not going to spoil it for those of you who want to figure it out yourself.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
But I figured that out.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
So the second time I played the demo, I knew how to five-star that boss.

36:45.000 --> 36:54.000
Because I was like, oh, if I pick up a blank from this guy, I can do nothing but blank and purposely being vague, try not to spoil.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
But you'll figure it out when you play this demo.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
So I was able to five-star the boss.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
So I uploaded that to my Facebook, except I made it shared only post-privately.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
But it's supposed to unlock something in the real game, because I did that.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.000
So it's kind of interesting how it all ties in.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
It sounds like they fixed Final Fantasy XIII's battle engine.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
Just from what I was watching of...

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
From what I've seen of people playing Final Fantasy XIII, just the...

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah, you could stop the gauge early, but setting everything up in advance and really letting it just play itself...

37:25.000 --> 37:33.000
I get the difficulty and especially the rating system, but if I take a backseat to gaming, I lose interest.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
So it sounds like they did a fair amount of work to work around that.

37:37.000 --> 37:44.000
Awesome Unicorn says, Rob, you get one costume for getting the demo and another for posting your battle score on the last boss to social media.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
Make sure you do that.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
See, I did that, but I didn't see anything unlock.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
So now I'm worried I didn't really get it.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
Even though I created my name and everything, and I think I did it.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Knowing me, I probably screwed it up.

37:55.000 --> 38:00.000
Oh well, so there'll be one stupid costume I won't be able to equip in the game.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I mean, it sounds like there's going to be 5,000 costumes, so whatever.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
That'll eventually just unlock for you anyways.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Right, right. Or I could pay 50 cents.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
Thanks for your support! Everybody gets the costume! Yay!

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Alright, so that was the demo.

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
Otherwise, I can't review the game, because I got to play...

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
Well, I can say I got to play 40 minutes of it, but really, 10 of it was playing.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
30 of it was watching.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
So anyways, to be continued, because I will pick up the full game later.

38:28.000 --> 38:33.000
Minecraft. I don't know if I mentioned in Minecraft, I am playing on the Vaga Network server,

38:33.000 --> 38:38.000
and I completed a project of mine this week, and that was I built a tunnel with an underground railroad

38:38.000 --> 38:44.000
that connects my old house to my new house, or where my old house used to be when the server first started,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
right under the giant orange on radio sign that somebody made.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
There's now a secret passage that will connect to an underground railroad that goes all the way to my house.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
The only thing I haven't figured out how to do yet is get the mine cart to work,

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
because I don't understand how the power and all that stuff works, and I'm still trying to learn that.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
I know some of you Minecraft experts are probably sitting there going,

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
God, Rob, it's so easy, but I haven't figured that part out yet, so I'm still figuring that all out.

39:05.000 --> 39:09.000
So I'm hoping by next week I'll actually get the mine cart that actually runs between the two.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.000
And the cool thing is, I didn't use world edit to do it. I built it by hand.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
I figured out my coordinates, and when I was building the tunnel, I figured out,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
okay, here's the point I want to build to, and then here's how I'm going to connect it from the other side.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
So that was actually a lot of fun. I was actually very rewarding.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
And a friend on the VoG network server offered to use world edit to build the tunnel for me really fast,

39:29.000 --> 39:33.000
and I was like, you know what, thank you, but no, because this is actually very therapeutic for me.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
Like building this little three by three tunnel is like popping bubbles on bubble wrap or something.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
It's very therapeutic to just sit there, mine, mine, mine. I see why people get sucked into Minecraft.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
It's fucking bubble wrap.

39:43.000 --> 39:48.000
Why do you think my house descends like 50 levels into the core of the planet?

39:49.000 --> 39:54.000
Because I'm like, oh my god, I found lava! Where did this water come from?

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
Descending into the deepest, darkest nether regions.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
Anyways, I actually downloaded, because it's been forever since I've used Minecraft,

40:02.000 --> 40:07.000
I don't know if the auto-updater would even work correctly, but I actually downloaded an updated client,

40:07.000 --> 40:14.000
and I don't think I asked Loki to add me to the whitelist, but I will check this out soon.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
Even though he's had the baby, he popped on the web chat when I was finishing the railroad the other night,

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
he was trying to tell me how to fix my railroad, so he'll be on there once in a while.

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
I just haven't asked and considered what I already said about last week. There will be a chance I will do it.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I want to figure out how to build a ferris wheel.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
I bet it's possible. You know what's funny is that everybody freaking loves railroads and minecarts in Minecraft,

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
which is fine, I understand, but it's really funny because when I built the underground one,

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
somebody actually built, or is building, an overground one, because I went out on my front lawn,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
and I was like, hey, somebody put a minecart here, and it said, it had the guy's name,

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
I'm sorry, I forgot who it was, but it had the guy's name, and it said,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I'm building a connection between Rob's house and DarkSakura's house.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.000
So somebody, yeah, without asking, is building a minecart race that gets from my house to your house.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
That's kind of fun.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.000
It's like our own, it's our light rail, it's our monorail.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
We have minecart monorail.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Eff yeah, monorail.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Alright, quickly, what else do I want to say?

41:15.000 --> 41:21.000
Oh, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, free on PlayStation Plus right now.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.000
Check that out, and if you have PlayStation Plus, you really owe it to yourself to check out this game.

41:26.000 --> 41:35.000
It's really a gorgeous game, and a very simple, yet great puzzle mechanic,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
where you control each brother, one thumbstick is each brother,

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
so that can really kind of mess with your mind when one's on the left and one's on the right,

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
but it's the other way around, and then one button that does action,

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
and it feels like an old-school PC game.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
It really, really feels like an old point-and-click type of game,

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
except it's just you're using thumbsticks, and the click is the R1 and L1.

41:57.000 --> 42:01.000
So yeah, I love that. That's great.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons, check that out.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Queuing it up right now.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Ron Chan says that Underground Railroad is racist.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
It is a railroad that is underground.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.000
Should I flip?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Stop being all Tumblr, Ron Chan, seriously.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
Should I flip it around? It's a railroad underground? All right.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
It's a subway.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You know what? Yeah, it's a subway. There you go.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Fine, I'm building a subway. You know what I'll do?

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm going to paint all the walls in rainbow colors, and it'll be the gay Underground Railroad.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
You can't stop me.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Oh, that's awesome.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Yeah. Anyway.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Will you build one under my house, too?

42:36.000 --> 42:41.000
SSG100Matt says instead of the Freedom Train, it's the Fabulous Train.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
We'll see.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
All right. Dungeon Buster's warning me. Be sure to have a box of Kleenex next to you.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.000
I'm only probably about halfway through the game right now.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.000
I hear it's short, but I don't know. I've been playing it for a couple hours,

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
and I'm probably only halfway through it.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.000
But I'm also the type that would seriously like,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
oh, there's a bench. I should go sit on it.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Check out the scenery. I spend way too much time in that Brothers game.

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
All right. Let's move on.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
Let's get into some housekeeping.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
Add us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
We're also on Google Plus. Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I already mentioned it earlier in the show, but Shane will be here next week.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
That'll be a lot of fun, so tune in for that, our Puppy Bowl Sunday episode.

43:29.000 --> 43:36.000
Also, I want to give a big congratulations to our friends over at Critical Myth,

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
which is another show you can hear on the Voice of the Geeks Network,

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
voggenetwork.com. They are hitting episode 400 this week.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
They taped it over the weekend, and it's debuting for the live audience.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
That's tomorrow, 4 o'clock Pacific, 7 o'clock Eastern.

43:52.000 --> 43:56.000

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
You can find all the links over at voggenetwork.com.

44:05.000 --> 44:12.000
If you like nerdy, cult-type of TV shows, they talk about all of them.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
They talk about all of them, and they do movies, too.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Fun show. Check that out.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
By the way, speaking of shows, because it has to be said,

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
I finished season three of Sherlock.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Did you?

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
And I was like, ugh, the whole time.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
And then Dan comes in while I'm at the end, he's like,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
why didn't you wait for me?

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Aww.

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
So he's been watching Sherlock today.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Aww. Alright, he's catching up.

44:39.000 --> 44:43.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for this week,

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
and Jason's going to start us off tonight.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
And Brothers has been purchased from the web.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Good job.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
I just bought Universe Sandbox.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
I saw something-

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
That Rageinator suggested.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
That Rageinator suggested now.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
What is Universe Sandbox about?

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Colliding galaxies?

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
You're God. No.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Alrighty then. Sounds fun.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
Yeah, you can change gravity and mess with planets and stuff, so.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Actually, the game I have to get,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
because somebody alerted me to this on Twitter,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
and I forgot who said it, so thank you,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
and sorry I forgot who advised me of this,

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
but Sid Meier's Covert Action is on Good Old Games,

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
and I've got to get that,

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
because that is one of my favorite 90s games,

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
even though, yeah, Sid Meier, of course, did Civilization,

45:24.000 --> 45:25.000
a lot of those great games.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.000
Covert Action was kind of a game that even Sid Meier,

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
I think, doesn't like in retrospect,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
but I loved it, and I played it all the time as a kid,

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
so I've got to get that this week.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
So, since we're talking about buying games. Anyway.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Well, when I edit the show and come across it again,

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
I'll message you and make sure that you got it.

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Alright, thank you. Thank you.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Over the last week to a week and a half,

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
there was a bit of a kerfuffle,

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
because Microsoft was reportedly paying Machinima,

45:48.000 --> 45:54.000
and their affiliates that are part of their YouTube network,

45:54.000 --> 46:00.000
extra rates for positive Xbox One reviews.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
These were being indicated by a tag, XB1M13,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
which apparently has been taken over

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
and used by a number of people,

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
much like Virgin Mary Grilled Cheese

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
and every other eBay hilarity product

46:15.000 --> 46:19.000
that has ever crossed paths on the internet.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
The going rate was that Microsoft was tacking on

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
for partners an additional $3 per 1,000 views.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
For people who get, you know, at least five digits,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
but more often at least 100,000 views or more,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
yeah, that's pretty big.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
It was seen as a bit controversial,

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
because the terms were considered

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
that it had to be a positive review.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
There would be no payout if an individual gave

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
any kind of a negative critiquing review

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
against the console for its release.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
I assume it extends to titles,

46:54.000 --> 46:57.000
but we actually don't know that for certain.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
A statement provided both by Machinima and Microsoft

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
was that this was a typical marketing partnership

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
to promote the Xbox One.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
Microsoft bought ad space,

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
as one does on keywords and any other ad network,

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
and Microsoft also followed up again additionally to say,

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Microsoft was not aware of individual contracts

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Machinima had with their content providers

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
as part of this promotion,

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
and we did not provide any feedback on any of the videos.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
We have asked Machinima not to post

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
any additional Xbox One content as part of this media buy,

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
and we have asked them to add disclaimers

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
to the videos that were part of the program,

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
indicating they were part of paid advertising.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
This isn't a new thing.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
A lot of people saw it as astroturfing,

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
the term technically is,

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
not that Microsoft is the underdog

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
by any stretch of the imagination,

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
but ad buys are very much a thing,

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
and with content networks going the traditional route

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
as they have to do in order to have enough content

48:00.000 --> 48:06.000
under their wing to ensure a healthy surge of content,

48:06.000 --> 48:09.000
this kind of thing, somebody pays

48:09.000 --> 48:14.000
to be able to be featured as part of that incoming content.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
I was really surprised at the amount of flack

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
that this whole thing got,

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
and the amount of shock that people were expressing

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
in the community.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
It's not that I necessarily supported or whatever,

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
but it's one of those things where it's like,

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
didn't you all know that this was already going on?

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Like, isn't this, I thought this was common knowledge.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
I know we all use ad blockers,

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
but have we ever seen a YouTube ad before?

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
It's exactly the whole thing.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
Is product placement a new concept?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I don't think so.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
This is, well, yeah, American Idol's a great example.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
A show I just watched last night,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
which I'm sure a lot of you are following too

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
because it is the nerdy content,

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
King of the Nerds, new reality show, right?

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Our friend, Asuka, is on that show, right?

48:59.000 --> 49:02.000
Member of the O.L. Army, Nicole is on that show.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
So I had to tune in to see how she did,

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
and I was very relieved at the episode.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Let me just put it that way.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
I was at a sports bar last Thursday,

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
and that happened to be on one of the many TVs

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
that was playing.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Well, the reason why I bring up King of the Nerds

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
is because I just watched it last night,

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
so it was fresh in my mind.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
They had a Radio Shack TARDIS

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
where they actually go in the little TARDIS.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
It's really funny because the way they have it set up

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
is it actually does look like it's bigger on the inside.

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
It's really cute.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
But they go in, and it's like, oh, gosh,

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
it's like all these great mechanical engineering things.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
I'm a mechanical engineer,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
and everything I could ever want is in here.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
The whole thing was a frickin' ad for Radio Shack,

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
but I didn't feel like, oh, my God,

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I'm so offended at this.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
I feel like I'm being used.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
Where is the disclaimer at the bottom of the screen

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
that Radio Shack sponsored this message?

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
How dare they?

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
No, I just accepted that,

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
oh, Radio Shack paid for this spot

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
because that's what they do now

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
because you all fast forward

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
through commercials on your TiVo.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Saw another TV show on Friday,

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
which has literally made this the whole point of the show.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
Price is Right.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Oh, yeah?

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
First time I've seen that show in like six years.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Oh, God, what a great example, though.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Oh, my God.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Everybody's, you know,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
they call out all these brands by name.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
They have to for market price.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
Ooh, what a great idea.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
And you see all their logos and everything else at the end.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
And everybody loves the Price is Right.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Oh, my gosh.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Everybody wants to win shit.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Yes, and every time they talk about the cars,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
they describe the car.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
It's beautiful four-wheel drive.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
You know, they're talking about all this stuff.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
The new Ford Fusion with stylish interior

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
and deluxe seats.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
What a great, oh, my gosh.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And you'll have to pay taxes on it if you win.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
But even in the gaming industry, you guys,

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
didn't you know that like positive reviews

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
can break embargo days

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
and, you know, certain big websites

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
pay for, you know, the exclusives first

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
and vice versa when it's positive.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
Like this is not something new.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
I hate to be rude, but y'all are being a bit naive.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
I think where y'all went wrong,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
and again, I'm in that mood where I'm just telling it

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
like it is tonight.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
I don't really care.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
You all thought Machinima was an independent thing.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
That's the problem,

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
because Machinima brought on all these indie people

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
into their corporation that exists to make money.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
I think you all feel like that trust

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
you thought you were going to get out of an indie

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
has been breached a little bit.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I kind of think that, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong,

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
feel free, live.vognetwork.com.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
But I think that's what this boils down to.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
You thought you were getting one thing,

51:35.000 --> 51:36.000
you're really getting another.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Sorry about it.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
And this actually,

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
we're actually going to revisit this topic

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
a little bit later tonight,

51:40.000 --> 51:45.000
but it also ties into something we talked about last week,

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
which the point just completely slits.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
Oh, when we were discussing the Wii U last week,

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
Dark Soccer brought up the point about the difference

51:55.000 --> 51:58.000
between a startup company and an established company

51:58.000 --> 52:01.000
with a reputation and product to protect.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
You do something new, you get popular for it,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
and you use it to grow.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
You use it to balloon in reach and popularity

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
and everything else.

52:12.000 --> 52:15.000
But then if you try it again and fail, what happens?

52:15.000 --> 52:18.000
Unfortunately, probably bad things for your company.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
So you hold on to what's working

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
just until you can find something new that works.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Kind of sucks to say,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
but this is literally the cycle of business.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
I don't, there are exceptions

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
because some people can reinvent themselves, Amazon.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
But it doesn't always happen, Barnes and Noble.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
I don't know.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
There are exceptions, the devil is in the details,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
but this is how it works.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
You get popular for something

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
and then you either cling onto it for dear life,

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
much like Bobby covered just before us,

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
or you finish and close down your company,

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
which who wants to do that?

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
RageNator in chat at live.bognetwork.com says,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Skye, actually not everyone loves The Prices, right?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
I don't, therefore your statement isn't valid.

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
You're a terrible one, Mr. Grinch.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Right?

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
Don't just kind of look at that comment and you're like, well...

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
There's so much happiness and cheering and applause.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Even the people that lose are still so happy.

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
I want to know how that's relevant.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
What?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
He's entitled to his opinion.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
We did bring up The Prices, right?

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
It's fine.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
No, I was...

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
All right.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
MM2K says my favorite comment,

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
the best phrase in the entire English language.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
I think you're right, Rob.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
Thank you.

53:35.000 --> 53:39.000
It's also Y-O-U apostrophe R-E.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Seconded.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
I'll still allow it.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
I'll still allow it.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
All right.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
Not Y-O-U-R.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
Brad from Pod Culture says Rob gives no fucks.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Yeah.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
I'm going to pay for my mouth tonight, but I just...

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
You're right.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I actually had one of those weeks and one of those weekends where it's like,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I don't give a fuck right now.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
Your body and mind have already worked hard enough to overcome sickness tonight.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
It's just...

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
Without getting too introspective here on our little podcast,

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
I'm learning in life that you really need to do the things that you enjoy.

54:10.000 --> 54:13.000
And if there's something in your life that you don't enjoy so much

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
and you continue to do it,

54:15.000 --> 54:18.000
you're going to start to associate a lot of the negative feelings with it.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
You might start to feel trapped.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
You might not to know like what the escape is.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
And there's that like fear of like letting people down or whatever.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
But the reason why I bring all that up,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
doing this show over the past 12 years is one of those things

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
that gives me a lot of joy.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
It really does.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
And the fact that you all show up and listen to it,

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
you know, sure there's what,

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
50 of you guys in chat right now listening live.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
You're still here to listen to what I have to say.

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
And I'm like flattered.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
I'm honored.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
And I get such a reward from doing it.

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
So thank you really.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
And those of you who are listening on the podcast feed and everything,

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
thank you.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
I do appreciate it.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Sorry, I didn't mean to get all deep on you,

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
but like I guess I kind of did because of that comment.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
So let's see, where was I?

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Because there was something else I was going to say.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And it had to do with the whole...

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Oh, I wanted to say to be devil's advocate

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
because I don't want people thinking like I'm just

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
like kicking machinima while I have the opportunity or whatever.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
I'm sure there's a variety of broadcasters on the network

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
who said, you know, if I don't have anything nice to say,

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I'm not going to say it at all.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
So I think there's probably people that maybe they don't agree with Xbox One

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
or maybe they don't like Xbox One for whatever reason

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
or, you know, they have a Sony related channel or whatever the thing is.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
It's not like you had to do this.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
This was not mandated.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Nobody forced somebody to do this.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
But it was just like, hey, here's a product placement campaign

55:40.000 --> 55:43.000
that you can participate in and get paid.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And, you know, there's a lot of people out there

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
that want to get paid.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
And on the heels of YouTube,

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
there was actually yet another thing.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
We covered content ID changes and all that kind of stuff in depth.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
And there was even before that,

56:01.000 --> 56:04.000
I remember some broadcasters that I follow

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
were talking about YouTube's changes,

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
Google's changes to YouTube notifications for new videos

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
and something like that that everybody noticed.

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
Like, I don't want to overstate this,

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
but they made it sound like at least a 10% and possibly more

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
just straight up drop off of views that they would expect to see.

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
Just one release to the next, just pfft.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
And then with these broadcasters that put out one video away,

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
that's pretty damn obvious. Something changed.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
And then they got the technical details, figured out what it was.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
I don't have all of the details in front of me right now.

56:38.000 --> 56:41.000
But it's like, you know, you take...

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
It's not that they take money anywhere they can get it,

56:45.000 --> 56:49.000
but if somebody was going to...

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
And I hate to say this too,

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
but if somebody were gonna...

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
If one of these companies were going to give me money

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
to pay their consult, I would take it.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
And that was a job I would have loved to have

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
for the better part of my life.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Still, not entirely sure about that,

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
but certainly for the majority of my life,

57:08.000 --> 57:13.000
I would have, you know, done ORLAR like a full-time job.

57:13.000 --> 57:16.000
I would have done this for many, many years of my life.

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
Would I have done it and, you know, the implicit,

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
done it for favors, done it for positive reviews?

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
No, that's not the intention.

57:27.000 --> 57:31.000
I like gaming, so I'm gonna talk about what I like about it.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
I've kvetched about things that I don't like with the Xbox One,

57:34.000 --> 57:37.000
and it has some problems,

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
but the games look fucking astounding.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.000
When I've been playing the games,

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
they have been incredible amounts of fun.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
The controller feels right,

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
and for a company with three gaming consoles to their name,

57:49.000 --> 57:53.000
to get it that right and continue to drill it in that well,

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
it means that I like the console, and I'm gonna say nice things about it.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
How much did you get paid for that? $1.50?

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
All right.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
I'm sure some of you guys have feedback on this.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.000
I know we've given some very blunt opinions that you may not agree with.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
I welcome feedback as long as, you know, it's tactful.

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
Instead of, you know, I don't like emails that say,

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
fuck you, you fucking fuck.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
But if you've got, you know, the opinions,

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
backed-up, thought-out statements, then I welcome them.

58:19.000 --> 58:23.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
All right. Let's move on.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I've got the next story here.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
And, you know, since, again, it's one of those nights,

58:31.000 --> 58:34.000
I'm gonna tell y'all I think this story is absolute bullshit.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
But it's something that people are talking about this week,

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
so I'm gonna bring it up anyway.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
Running around the web this week that Nintendo has got a new system in the works.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Let me start out with this.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Of course Nintendo has a new system in the works.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Surprise goes to nobody.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.000
Sony.

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Because all systems are made in just the year before they come out.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Sony has a PlayStation 5 in the works.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Microsoft has a new system in the works.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
Yes, already.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
And the new Kinect.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
These systems do not come out overnight.

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
We know this.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
So, yes, Nintendo has a new system in the works.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
But is it called the Nintendo Fusion?

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Just like the Wii was called the Revolution.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Dolphin Wii U was the Revolution.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
No, I had that right the first time, didn't I?

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Code names are hard.

59:19.000 --> 59:23.000
If this report from Nintendo News is to be believed,

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
then, yes, Nintendo is working on Nintendo Fusion.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
Now, to be fair, this is an independently produced site,

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
and they even start off this article saying,

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
hey, if it's your first time here,

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
we have an impeccable reputation when it comes to delivering information.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
Look, I understand.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
They believe in this.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
It's coming from their trusted source.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
That's cool.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I'm not trying to shade this site because they believe in it.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I just think, no.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
Because I think, A, they're basing it off a domain registration

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
because Nintendo registered NintendoFusion.com,

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
except that they actually purchased this domain back in 2003

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
because there used to be like a festival.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I guess Nintendo did a music festival back in the day that was called Nintendo Fusion.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I don't even remember that festival.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
But, God, we would have been doing the show then,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
so we would have heard about it.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But, yeah, it was a rock music video games festival that was in 2003.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But apparently, Fusion is a new console that is supposed to bring

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
a little bit more synergy between the Fusion DS

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and what they're calling the Fusion Terminal.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And I'm not going to spout off all these specs here,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
but it is just basically, as you would imagine,

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
it's a stronger DS and it's a stronger terminal

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000
that I imagine is out there to compete with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Do I believe Nintendo has something in the works

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
that is on the level of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Yes, absolutely.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
The big problem they're having with Wii U is that third-party developers

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
don't want to go the extra mile to do stuff for the Wii U game pad.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That takes development hours and so forth.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
That's one of the big problems.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Even though the Wii U was supposed to be like an Xbox 360 for developing for,

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
you have to be able to think differently with the whole game pad.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It's not working out with the third parties.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Whether we like it or not,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
the third parties don't feel like it's a worthy investment

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
because of what's being sold.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
If a new Nintendo comes out,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
it's going to be much more attractive to third-party developers

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
if their console is maybe just a slightly better PlayStation 4,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Xbox One type of thing,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
where if somebody builds a PlayStation 4 game,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
it's super easy to port that over to this Nintendo device.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And I think that's a little bit like, duh, that's coming as well.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But as far as these specific specs,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
of course they're going to change before this console's actually out.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
And I think it's a bit too easy to be able to say,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
oh, they were right.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yep, yep, it looks like the next Nintendo system,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
it did fuse the DS and the base is a lot stronger.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
This is like saying, I'm going to wake up tomorrow,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
and the sky is going to be blue.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
These are very safe bets, is what I'm saying.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
These are all things that we're kind of expecting out of Nintendo.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I think the only way this goes wrong

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
is if Nintendo really comes out of left field and says,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:16.000
hey, we've got this whole new way to play games that we believe in,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
and we're going to take a risk one more time,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
which is not outside the realm of possibility.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000
They took the risk with it with the Wii, and they won.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
They took the risk with the Wii U, and so far they're losing.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So it would not be out of character for Nintendo to come out

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
and say we have a whole new way to play games.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
This is crazy.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided a little bit of a topic back,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
but Nintendo's Fusion Tour has provided early exposure for then, 2003,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
like you said, for then-developing bands

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
such as Evanescence, Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance,

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Fall Out Boy, and Berlin, and Panic at the Disco.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Wow.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Wow! That's a killer fucking lineup.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I think Evanescence was a bit prominent quite a bit before that,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
but my mental timeline with the rest of those bands, damn.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That was actually a pretty good grab.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And this does sound kind of familiar because they demoed games.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
2003 bands Evanescence Cold, Revice, Finger Eleven, Cauterize.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Games that were featured, 1080-degree Avalanche, Madden NFL 2004.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Nintendo GameCube, it's not just a kid's machine.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
F-Zero GX was debuted at 2003, was demoed at 2003 on Nintendo Fusion Tour.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Sonic Advance 2, Game Boy Advance, Donkey Kong Country, Game Boy Advance, 007 Night Fire,

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Rogue Squadron 3, Rebel Strike, 2004 bands,

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Story of the Year, My Chemical Romance, Lost Prophets, Letter Kills,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
2005, Fall Out Boy, The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Boys Night Out, Panic at the Disco.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You see a trend in these genres, of course, but at the same time,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
these are pretty, like, this is not exactly anything to snuff out.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Is it outside the realm of possibility that maybe Nintendo's gonna bring this tour back?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I mean, I know that sounds like the crazy thought, but, I mean, what?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
This festival would have happened two years into the GameCube's life

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
when GameCube needed more of a boost with that 20-something audience.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
They are taking the tack of being their own media outlet.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
By which I mean, Nintendo Direct.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And then, prior to the Wii U's release, they had the Nintendo,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I don't remember what the specific name for it was, but they had the Wii U media tour.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I went to that in Denver, where instead of, you know, like, advertising in the common areas,

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
they rented out Office Space, whatever venue they could get,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
and they set up everything for people to play.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I had quite a bit of fun. I rather liked it.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The fact that Nintendo is being their own endpoint for all of this media

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
to do something like this again, that wouldn't surprise me in the least.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Just a couple comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Rama says, whether this rumor is true or not,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
if the hardware isn't on par with the Xbox One or PlayStation 4, it will fail.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Kaijuto says, I think that Nintendo caters to kids.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That's their demo, and right now kids are into small gaming devices.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
They don't get the console stuff like us adults do.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That's why the 3DS is doing so well.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But it's not like the Wii was 20 years ago.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
That's the only issue I have with that comment is that, you know,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Nintendo did have great success with kids and adults with the Nintendo Wii,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
and it's not like it was that long ago.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I don't know. That's the only thing I'm thinking.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
I don't think we can write Nintendo off as a kids-only company

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
when they just are writing the wave of that success, you know?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
They do the kids thing well, don't get me wrong.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
2DS, I don't think any adult understands what the 2DS is for unless they have kids.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But the 2DS is a great kiddie device.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
All right, anyhow, we could debate Nintendo all night once again,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
but we're going to move on with more stories.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Yes, once again in the dark saga.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Well, this is a rumor that was going around,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
and it was also perpetuated by the K-word.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Oh, the site that shall not be named?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Yeah, that GameStop in the US was going to be canceling Wii U pre-orders of Watch Dogs,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.000
that the game was supposed to have been cancelled by Ubisoft.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Now, what actually came out is that a spokesperson for GameStop

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000
actually heard from Ubisoft, and basically what the big problem is,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
is that they actually had an error on their system that took out their pre-orders.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Three people that replied to the article that I found this on

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
actually said that they went out and had no trouble with their orders.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000
So, it's still there, but as we know, how the K likes to get on the bandwagon.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Well, I think it also says a lot that I think a lot of us look at a story like this and go,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
it wouldn't really be that surprising.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Well, and also, an Italian gaming site called Witalia

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
said that the game was going to be out on everything but Wii U,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
but maybe it's not getting a Europe release, maybe?

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Who knows? It would be nice if Ubisoft would comment on this.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Well, it looks like that...

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Yeah, Ubisoft actually just declined to comment, but it was a problem with GameStop.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:35.000
See, when they declined to comment like that, I hate to give a K article that kind of clout,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
but when Ubisoft declines to comment, that almost says more than a comment would.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
That's the only thing, again, I'm not trying to freak out or get tinfoil hatty, I'm just saying.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Yeah, but it also could be that it's GameStop, and GameStop had already put out a statement or something or the other.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Alright, well, we'll see if they make an official comment or what happens with the game in the coming weeks.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
They declined to comment because there's nothing to say yet.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
The game's not out, there's nothing to talk about.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
The comment, look forward to Watch Dogs on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Wii U this April.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I bet you anything they had employees going in, because guess what I just read online? Is that true?

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Yeah, right?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
And if it gets delayed?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Though it is a sad thing when employees have to hear it from the news before they hear it from work.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I think the Ubisoft comment, I would have expected, is exactly what I just said.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Look forward to Watch Dogs on all these consoles coming April, get your pre-order in now.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
That would have been the comment that I would have said, oh, okay.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
It's a nice comment. Absolutely.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But the fact that instead they chose to say no comment? That's where I go, hmm, that's all.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Next story!

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Owners of Dead Rising 3 will have seen that they got a massive title update last week, clocking in at 13 gigs.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
This is on top of the base install of Dead Rising 3 itself already being 19.9 gigs.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
13 gigs?! Ain't nobody got bandwidth for that!

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Not in some states of the US, for sure.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Dead Rising 3's base install is 20 gigs as is. Of course, with the Xbox 360, you don't have to install the whole thing before you play.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000
But this title update clocked in at 13 gigs, and it was suspected to be linked to DLC.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:28.000
A couple days later, there was confirmation from Microsoft that the 13 gig update is in fact linked to Operation Broken Eagle.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:35.000
The update also does incorporate some bug fixes, add-ins, additional smart glass features, so on and so forth.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:43.000
The kicker is that Operation Broken Eagle, my assumption when I read the first two, the hint and the confirmation article,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:55.000
was that, oh, it's required for everybody, it's compatibility DLC so that if somebody else buys it, you can still play with them in co-op.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Operation Broken Eagle is single-player DLC only.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:08.000
So enjoy your diminished hard drive space and the fixes that incorporate 1% of it.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:17.000
But that download is just gonna be there, chillin', and if you buy Operation Broken Eagle, great.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.000
If not, well, you lose the space anyways.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Wow.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Yeah, that's a hefty one.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.000
It's funny to think about this now, now that the Xbox One has a Blu-ray drive.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:39.000
We're legit talking double-digit figures of capacity instead of a possible max of 9.7 gigs.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
DVD 4.7, DVD 9, 9.7, Blu-ray 25 or 50 gigs, where the majority of it is sent to the hard drive.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
We're dealing with some big shit now.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I just need to say, I'm really concerned about this, coupled with the whole net neutrality thing.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I'm really worried about the size of some of these patches, which makes sense and so forth,

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:11.000
because these are full HD games with really 1080 textures. This is gonna be big stuff, no matter what the game is.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
4K is right around the corner, even though we know PlayStation 4 and I believe Xbox One as well, they're not gonna play 4K games.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:25.000
They're not built to play 4K games. That'll be PlayStation 5 and Xbox 2 or whatever.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Because it can't get any more confusing with those frickin' console names.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:38.000
It would be hilarious. The most hilarious name would be the Xbox 4, because it plays 4K.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
So it'd be the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, and the Xbox Four.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Anyhow, I worry with this whole net neutrality thing. If Comcast is talking 300 gigabyte cap or whatever, that's not gonna be enough.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
They're not moving at the rates they need to be. I don't know.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I do serious shit online, but while they don't enforce the cap, they still have the tools in there for me to see my usage.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I am always above 250, 300, whatever they've labeled it as.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.000
We actually somehow end up below. Maybe I'm complaining too much, but then again, we just got the PlayStation 4, so we'll see.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:32.000
But with all your MMOs and all of this Skype and broadcasting and all of this online interactivity you have, it is pretty surprising that you of all people would be on there.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
It's not as much traffic as you think.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000
It's not like it's streaming the visual aspect of the game back and forth, sure. But you do a lot of it.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
And then Skype and Twitch streaming and everything else at the same time, it adds up.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I mean, yeah, I'd send whole system backups, but whatever. Differential.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Anyways, one last note for people who did not know is that Operation Broken Eagle is the first of four DLC packs.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.000
First one to come out, well, that much is obvious.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Operation Broken Eagle is the first. Buy the season pass, as everybody seems to love to do, and you will get three more as they get released over the year.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase ANSWER.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Locopoco wants to make sure an important clarification gets out here, saying, well, the thing is, Capcom put DLC on the disc, people are pissed.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And now Capcom wants you to download the DLC and people are pissed. I think that the 13 gigs are a bit much.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Well, it sounds like you have to download it whether you're going to buy it or not. That's the problem, right?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Yeah, absolutely. This was a title update for the game itself, completely regardless of whether or not you buy the DLC.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
It will happen as long as you have installed the game itself and booted up.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Well, let me do a quick story here about, since we're talking next, now we're saying next gen, except it's not really, now it's current gen.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
This gen.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Along those same lines, when you asked Jamie what her best game of 2013 was, and she answered, I wanted to chime in and say, but there's still 11 more months to figure that out.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Fucking not 2013 anymore, right?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Jesus.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Alright, so anyway, this gen, or whatever you want to call the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One gen, is that, what is it, 8th generation of games? 9th?

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I believe so.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Where the hell are we now? Whatever. Current games, big games. Resogun is a big game on the PlayStation 4.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Latia getting Resogun for free because of PlayStation Plus, although I'm sure some of you did, you know, who aren't into the monthly subscription thing or whatever, a yearly subscription, probably bought the game independently.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:42.000
But a lot of people getting Resogun for free. So how's the Resogun developer gonna really make money? I mean, I know they get some from PlayStation, I'm sure, and they were funded.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:57.000
But, Resogun developer is working on some DLC. Have you noticed, by the way, that the games they tend to give away on PlayStation Plus have DLC or have expansions coming, things that, you know, they'll get some money off of.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Like Borderlands 2, yes, the game is free, but it has-

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000
4 DLC packs?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Oodles of DLC, yes.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Not to mention all of the 360 avatar enhancements and other customizations you can get.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Bioshock Infinite has an expansion, right? Not that- I'm not complaining, I'm just saying there is a science to this.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Give away the razor to sell the blades.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Ooh, very good comparison.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I've used that a number of times.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Yes you have, yes you have. Alright, anyway. So anyway, the Resogun developer, they did confirm in a Facebook post of all places, it was a very innocent reply on Facebook.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:37.000
But now everybody's running with it, they are working on DLC for Resogun and an unannounced PlayStation 4 project.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
So, could literally be anything.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:46.000
So, yeah. But Resogun was a very popular online title, you know, for the launch of the PlayStation 4.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
No surprise at all to hear that those guys are very busy.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.000
So I look forward to seeing what the DLC will be and what their next project might be.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Hopefully it'll involve more particles flying everywhere!

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Pew pew pew, explosions!

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
That was particle.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Particle man, particle man.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Aw, they might be giants. We love you.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Shaking my head. No.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Well, how about we go into some-

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Shaking my head, shaking my head.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Meanie woman, meanie woman.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Doing the things that mean girls can.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I need to see that movie, you know.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Yes you do. Moving on!

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Okay. So how about some legal news?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Since we've been in a legal stew already.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Haha, I went there.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So, a while back I mentioned about the Madden programmer, Robin Antonick, who sued EA and won like 4 million plus bucks because they used his code.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Well, apparently that whole decision was just reversed by US District Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
And said, no you don't get it, and no you don't get the interest, and no.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So-

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You get nothing! You leave! Good day, sir!

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Yes. And so his lawyer says, girl no.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I actually said, the evidence showed that they used his source code without permission.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
So yeah, they're gonna appeal.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So basically what they said is that the jurors had no basis for their consultation because they were never shown the game side by side, which is what's necessary for copyright infringement.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
So they actually had no basis for their verdict.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.000
So does this mean we're headed towards a Supreme Court showdown over Madden? Because that could be very interesting.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
If they even decide to take it up.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:48.000
But this could set a precedent for programming code.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I'll never forget when one of the Supreme Court judges referenced Mortal Kombat in one of his decisions.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.000
And that was the whole Schwarzenegger ESA thing that happened here in California, right? Remember that?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
I was like, wow, the Supreme Court knows what Mortal Kombat is. That's so weird.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Well, it's only 20-something years old. They're catching up. Slowly.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Yes, but the image you have of the Supreme Court is, with all due respect to our government, the image of the Supreme Court that we get is old fuddy duddies with wigs.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
You know, and so to hear them talking about-

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Hey, in some countries they still use wigs.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
They should use wigs here, to be honest. But anyway.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:35.000
See, now I've got this Monty Python thing running through my head with the two judges taking off their robes to reveal lingerie underneath and going off on a date.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Only at OLR could we turn a story about a lawsuit into wearing lingerie underneath your robes.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
It was Monty Python sketch. Whatever.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
If you referenced it. Alright.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
For the record, by the way, I do have to make a little side note about Cool Job.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Oh, wait. Tangent on OLR? Get out.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:59.000
When people at lunch start breaking out into Monty Python songs too, you know you're at a cool job. Just saying.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and see what lingerie- I mean video games are coming out in a store near you.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I ain't showing, I ain't telling.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
I don't know that I'm capable of reporting on this information.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Well at Fredericks they have this lacy red thing.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Starting in the US. Starting in the US. On January 28th, the whole heap and helping of everything, Broken Age Act 1 drops on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Droid, and the Ouya.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Which is the first Ouya release of this year. Very good.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
The Ouya gets a game.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z. I think this is the first title of any particular status.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
There have invariably been other smaller, small time releases that have landed just because they were finished and got published.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
At any rate.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Also on the 28th, Dragon Ball Z, Battle of Z drops on PS3, PS Vita, and Xbox 360.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Recoil with a K drops for PC.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Tomb Raider Definitive Edition hits for the PS4 and Xbox One.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Getting that one.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
December 20- Jesus Christ.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Increment everything by one Jason. Please.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:17.000
January 29th, Recoil Liberator, Xbox Live Arcade. On the 30th, Octodad, Deadliest Catch, Windows, Mac, Linux.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Yeah, I was like, what's that?

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Octodad?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Did you not, have you not played this?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:28.000
No, I think about Octomom. I hate that name for her because she sounds like a Superman villain.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:35.000
So Octodad released as, Octodad was a game, I don't know if it was basically supposed to be a demo or not at this point.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
But Octodad was a game that was released, holy crap.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
This looks weird.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Three months ago, where you control a dad in a family who's an octopus.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And you-

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
The hell am I looking at?

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
You're looking at Octodad.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
He's carrying groceries.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000
He squirms around, it is entirely, it's not entirely mouse based.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
You still use the keyboard to decide whether you-

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
He's wearing a suit.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Clasp things or let go of them.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
If you're controlling him moving or controlling like extension, he's an octopus doing daily life tasks.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
It is completely insane.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
He's wearing a tie.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Yes.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
And he has kids.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
He has a wife and he has two kids.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Girl and a boy.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
He is Octodad.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Are they Octopi too?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
No.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
They are all humans.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Except for Octodad.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
They must be adopted.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, I played Octodad at PAX East.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
It was in the indie game Pavilion.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000
And as Joe and her mat says, yeah, I also played Octodad at PAX East.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
So basically he's chicken boo.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Black Wolf says Octodad is basically an octopus trying to fool everyone into thinking he's human.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And the antagonist, the primary-

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
He was a disguise to look like human, guys.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The primary antagonist of the game is a sushi chef.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Who-

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Taco is tasty.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Who intends to reveal Octodad to his family.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Wasn't that a scene in Monsters Inc?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Like wasn't the sushi-

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
There was a sushi chef that was the octopus.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Yes.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
But you know what?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
You know what?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Taco is tasty.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
All right.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
All I know is I'm getting this game for absolutely certain.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So good.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
I want takoyaki now.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I just want a taco.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
It came out at the same time.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Just don't go to Taco Bell and we'll be fine.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
That's not food.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Exactly.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Exactly.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000
It came out like around the same time of these other ridiculously exaggerated control games,

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Surgeon Simulator.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And it plays very similarly because there's no precision to speak of.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
He is squirrelly, some might say inky and just loose.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
So it controls like queue up.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
It controls like shit.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
But it's so much fun.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Tigerclaw gave us a link in the chatroom that you can play the original Octodad for free

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
at Octodadgame.com.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Yes.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And now this game has much more content in the same environments.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It's going to be very good.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Highly recommended.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Let's go to Japan and check out the releases there where you would expect to see the crazy

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
stuff like Octodad.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
But no, that's not a release in Japan this week.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.000
There are games that include octopuses that are a little bit different.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Settle down.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
On the Playstation 3 this week, they get Diablo 3.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
It comes out in Japan this week on the Playstation 3.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Also out.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Yeah, the console versions are pretty good.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
So I'm sure there will be some people checking that out.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Also coming out on the Playstation 3 this week, Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme vs. Full Boost

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000
because you can't have a week in gaming in Japan without a Gundam game.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Also, Rosen Maiden.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Ooh.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
They're doing a Rosen Maiden game?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Apparently.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
It's coming out this week.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Can you see?

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You sure can.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Let me bring that up.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
It's regular and limited edition, actually.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Oh, that's cool.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And trying to see.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000
There's no screenshots, sadly.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Just the box art.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Rosen Maiden is a story about dolls.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
It's actually pretty good.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.000
On the Xbox 360 this week in Japan?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Nothing.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:54.000
On the Playstation Vita this week in Japan, however, Rosen Maiden is released there as well.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Maikai Senkai Disgaea 4 Return comes out as well this week on the Vita.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Ibikore plus Amagami comes out as well.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
So a few games on the Vita this week on the 30th.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
On the Wii U this week, the Wii U Fit Meter, the Balance Board and all that,

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
that all comes out on February 1st in Japan.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So you have that to look forward to.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Lastly, checking the 3DS, you have Toshintoshi.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Girls' Gift RPG comes out this week in Japan.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I've got to see what this is all about.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Girls' Gift RPG.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
I've seen this before somewhere.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
What in the hell is that screenshot?

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
These are like up.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
This is not a G-rated game.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Tell me you're surprised.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Look at that. I can see her taint in that picture.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
She's pointing at it.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Is she fucking a bug?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I don't know what she's doing. That is disgusting.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Of course, this is where everybody's like, I wish this wasn't a radio show.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Google this, I guess.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I'll put a link in our chat room there.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Maybe Jason can put it on the video. We'll see.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I don't know. That might get us banned from YouTube.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
You know where I saw it was J-list.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Toshintoshi Girls' Gift RPG.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
I don't want to know if she's pointing at her gift in that picture.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
There you go, chatters.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Of course, on the app I'm in.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Oh, no, that's her leg.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000
The app that I'm using, it just pops up the image.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Oh, nice.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Wow, I just saw Cooch.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
There's definitely a gift for some people.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
Moving on.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Your gift goes squish.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
It's a fleshy gift. Alright.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Lalalalala.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Not attractive.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
So, on the 30th of January in the UK

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
is Octodad, Deadliest Catch.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
And...

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Rymdkapsel?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Rymdkapsel.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
R-Y-M-D-K-A-P-S-E-L.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Something vaguely German.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Rymdkapsel.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
On the 31st we have Loadout on PC,

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Naruto Shippuden,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:14.000
extra, extra names, more names added for business.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
And then that's

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And then Tomb Raider Definitive Edition on PS4 and the X-Bone.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And that's it.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Do we need to start screen?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
There's a game coming out called Ultimate Gay Fighter.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Really?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Well, it's one of those undated games listed down there.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
For January in general.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Ultimate Gay Fighter.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
Which means somebody said at one point it would be out in January.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
It's not actually, probably.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I'm trying to see if there's actually anything on it and there's nothing here.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Maybe somebody added that as a troll.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Who knows.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Alright.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
Let's move on. Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
It's me, isn't it?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
It is you, Jason.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
Xbox 3606 got released for Android

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
in the last...

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Was it just this last week?

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
It's pretty recently.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And an article went up talking about

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
the Turnerization

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
of video games artistic legacy.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Basically, in short,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
it's the fact that

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Turner would buy up

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
cheaper properties and then

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
automatically colorize them

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
to the best of their

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
automatic ability

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
so that they have some additional

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
value that they can add

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
which led to very exaggerated

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
and unrealistic

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
color tones being applied to

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
certain things in the background or what have you.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
For you younger folks that are listening

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
you may or may not be aware of this

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
so I'll just let the old man tell you for a minute

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
that back when cable was a lot newer

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
like in the 80s and late 80s

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I remember when the Turner classic

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
movies came out

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
it was very controversial

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
because they would colorize the old movies.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
And so yeah, that's what he's talking about.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
He's talking about the Turnerization is that you colorized black and white movies

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
to make them look modern

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and some people think

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
it's cool, some people hate it.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
And for what it's worth, I'm staring at this screenshot of

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
It's a Wonderful Life

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
and we actually had a rotation

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
of Christmas movies, holiday movies

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
playing in the office

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
for around the holiday

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
around the Christmas week

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
and they were all

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Christmas life and a Christmas story

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
and Die Hard randomly

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I don't exactly know why

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
but a whole bunch of black and white movies

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
in black and white on rotation.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And when I read this article

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
I was like, yeah I get it

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I know what it means to

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
for all intents and purposes port something like this

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
but now that I'm actually looking at the screenshot

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
of It's a Wonderful Life in color

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
it's actually a little bit weird

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
and this isn't the same thing as like

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
It's a neat comparison

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I think it's a very neat question

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
to be asking, I like this article

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
a lot I gotta say because

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
when you look at a game like

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Final Fantasy VI on iOS

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
it is kinda like, why did they do this?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
The argument, I haven't even gotten to the point yet

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Well I know why they did it

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
In the context of Final Fantasy VI

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
you look at comparative screenshots

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
of the original SNES version

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
and then you take the Android version

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
and all of the sprites, all of the characters

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
all of the enemies, all of the backgrounds

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
the overworld, everything

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
was meticulously crafted

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
to the limitations of the platform

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
every single

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
pixel counted

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
and we're talking about

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
what, 320 by 240?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
that's not even

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
that's not even

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
100,000 pixels on screen assuming

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
that was even the resolution

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
we're talking tiny, tiny, tiny

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
that whole era of gaming, Game Boy, NES, SNES

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
that's like what a watch does for

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
resolution these days

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
seriously, the pebbles are actually a little bit better

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
than that, I think

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
until the

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
optical media generation

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
began to be polygons and objects

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
and depth of that kind of stuff

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
basically Playstation, Saturn, etc

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
back in the cartridge generation

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
small factor cartridge generation

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
everything, we just

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
covered this with Pokemon and towns

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
everything is so specifically meticulously

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
crafted to get all of the detail

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
possible in, you know

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
as much size as you can do

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
it's a fucking wonder that Resident Evil ever fit

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
onto an N64 cartridge with

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
voice acting and the characters

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
and everything else, but you're looking at these screenshots

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
of Final Fantasy 6

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
SNES and Android

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
and SNES is

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
for those of us that played it

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
familiar, and especially very definitive

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
of Square of the saga, of the era

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
but then you look at the Android version

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
and it's muddy

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
it's a little bit washed out

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
there's a little bit more vibrancy to it

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
but at the lack of

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
any single pixel discernible

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
detail that was, you know, making

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
the point that they were trying to convey

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
the water is a bit murkier

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and calmer actually in this particular shot

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
it looks like, honest to god, it just looks like

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I think there's a certain look they're going

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
for, but it looks like bad Photoshop

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
filter throughout the whole game

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
I mean, it's really what it looks like

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
and it's interesting, because this kind of thing

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
does not happen all the time

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
there's three different things that can happen

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
it can either be completely unchanged

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
like all of the Final Fantasy re-releases

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
on the Playstation, it can be

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
done for the sake of moving it

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
to another platform, a poor port

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
like we're making the point of Final Fantasy 6

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and it's not a port

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
of an existing game, but Final Fantasy

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
4 DS was actually

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
really impressive in what they did with it

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
to still keep the motif of the

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
original game and bring the quality

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
up three generations

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
four generations, one of the two

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
but it's

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
it's interesting to try to consider

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
what the actual process was

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
of redoing all of these

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
assets because you can

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
on a different platform, not to mention you

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
have to, to fit just the technical

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
differences of resolution and everything between

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
the SNES and Android

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
but presumably because

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
you're just

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
doing it to make it look like it

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
was and slightly

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
better when you lose

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
you're basically

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
losing culture, you're losing

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
design, you're losing the point

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
of the reason that these

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
games were created in the first place

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
yeah I

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
think there's a lot of people reacting to Final Fantasy 6

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
like wow this is a cheap cash

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
grab cash in game, I'm not

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
pleased with this, because you know Final Fantasy 6

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
is kind of sacred text

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
to a lot of people, that is like the best video game

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
of all time to a lot of people

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
certainly the best in the Final Fantasy

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
series to many people

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
a friend of mine posted something

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I don't know if it

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
he's the master

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
at lack of context yet stunningly

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
good timing

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
the greatest benefit of modern consoles

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
is their ability to emulate the old ones

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
so if this kind of

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
thing is as big of a turn off as it is

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
to you rightfully so

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
there's still the opportunity

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
to play the original version

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
if you don't have the original medium yeah it's gonna be

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
a little bit different but you can still

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
get so much of that specific detail back

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
she's saying that she still has

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
all the original consoles and the original carts

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
and everything to play this on

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
we just got plastic protectors for our games that were in the box

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
and one of the games in the box says Final Fantasy

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
quote 3 unquote

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
and you can find a way to do this kind of thing

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
and it is a shame that the

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
waters are a little bit muddied

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
it's

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
it's how the company

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
has decided to take the game forward

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
into this new era

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
literally two decades later

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
awesome unicorn in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
says it's the same way that

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Theatrhythm and the Kingdom Hearts browser game looks

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
they must have some artist at Square Enix

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
who just loves that style

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
and I'm saying this comment but I imagine

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
by some artist at Square Enix you mean

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
their outsourced vendor in China

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
just saying

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Simpsons is animated by a studio in Korea

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
100% anymore

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
anyhow

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
let's move on one other

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
story here

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
because we're going to get into

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
we're going to get into what

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Jason just talked about again a little bit later

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
but I want to quickly talk about this

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
a big announcement from SOE

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Sony Online Entertainment

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
not to be confused with the folks

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
that are behind the Playstation 4

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Sony's entertainment division

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
but

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
SOE does a lot of their online things

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
EverQuest, DC Universe Online

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
and so forth

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
well SOE is going to be doing

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
this all access plan

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
they've just announced this

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
and the all access plan will include

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
top tier membership level

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
in all SOE games

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
that includes EverQuest

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
EverQuest 2, DC Universe Online

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Planetside 2, Vanguard

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
EverQuest Next

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
and EverQuest Next Landmark

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
and that will be one low monthly rate

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
of $14.99

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
there will be of course more savings

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
if you do 3, 6 or 12 months at a time

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
that's custom for most MMOs

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
this is kind of interesting that they're doing this one all access pass

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
now it probably should be noted

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
that I believe all these games are free to play anyway

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
so it's not

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
or they are now, they may not have always been

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
like EverQuest used to have a fee with it

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
and so on

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
and so did DC Universe for a short while

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
but they're all free to play now

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
so you're really paying this fee to have basically top level access

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
you know

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
which is going to be the extra perks

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
and inventory and character slots and so forth

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
that you would expect for all these games

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
so this is interesting that you have that one

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
excuse me, that one subscription fee there

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
so

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
ah yeah, it's going to happen

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
about April 2nd they say

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
any existing membership will be automatically

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
upgraded to the new plan

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
that's good news for people that might be paying separate fees

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
right now for top level access and say

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
EverQuest and EverQuest 2

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
and so forth, so pretty cool

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
so, alright

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
anyhow

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
let's take a moment to

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
travel back to when, you know, there was no

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
online entertainment

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
that was, that wasn't

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
you couldn't call in online

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
unless you had Sega Channel

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
that's how you had online

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
X-band, which was hilariously bad

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
only the rich kids had that stuff

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
not me, or if it was like the very

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
close to early 90s

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
you had AOL, you know

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
in DOS

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
so alright, here it is, your classic game

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
of the week

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
for all this fancy online

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
connectivity crap

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
you'll need it

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
go outside, DarkSocker's going to dive into

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
you should be playing this game, or you're

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
you're dumb and stuff

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
well, to keep up with my theme

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
of using games that have been represented

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
in Namco High, and I'm getting a little tired

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
of Namco games, this might be the last one

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
for now, I love you Namco

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I love you Namco, but still, I've done a bunch

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Dragon Spirit

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
it was

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
a 1987 scrolling

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
shooter game that was

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
released by Namco

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
it was very loud, sorry, we have a dragon shooting

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
fire over here, sorry about that

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I'm not sure if I'm attached to it, but

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
no, I didn't have an intro for some reason

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
but it

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
was released by Atari Games in the US

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
and it runs on the Namco System 1 hardware

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
that was later ported

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
to the Amstrad CPC

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Commodore Amiga, Commodore 64

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
DOS, Atari ST, X68000

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
the PC Engine and TurboGrafx

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
and the ZX Spectrum platforms

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
so basically

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
kind of the story is that there was

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
a

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
serpent demon named Zawel

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
that escaped its imprisonment after

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
a thousand years and kidnapped Princess

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Alicia, so a soldier named

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Amul has to

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
rescue her and destroy Zawel

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
oh, there's the intro

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I just thought it was, it's really pretty, pretty epic

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
it's a dragon taking off

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
from a cliff, and the music

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
in the game is pretty good, I mean

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
oh

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
it takes

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
a minute to get into it, so

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
anyway, so basically

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
you have to, you can

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
collect up to 13 additional

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
powers, apart from what he comes

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
with which is breathing fire and dropping bombs

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
he turns into the blue dragon, by the way

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I forgot to say that, cause anyone who turns into

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
a blue dragon and isn't in the game blue dragon

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
is pretty cool

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
so he can

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
burst flames, drop

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
bombs, which I guess would be

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
dragon poop, dragon poop has to be pretty flammable

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
and

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Amul is pretty big when he's

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
just doing the flying through the screen

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
he takes two hits

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
before losing a life, and three in some

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
versions, the power-ups

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
give you extra heads that may double

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
or triple your firepower

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
but they also

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
increase your exposure, so while you

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
were stronger, you were also a bigger freaking

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
target, and

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
bless this game for doing that even though it made playing

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
it really freaking frustrating

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
so yeah, there were other releases

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
there was a sort of sequel on

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
the Famicom that came

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
out as Dragon Spirit the new legend

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
which was a port

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
that took place a generation after the

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
original game, there was an arcade

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
sequel called Dragon Saber that came out in 1990

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
that allowed for two player simultaneous

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
play, Dragon

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Spirit was released on PC Engine

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
and TurboGrafx-16

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
and it was very close to the

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
arcade version

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
and the sound quality of that

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
I must say, since this is a game that I do own

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
it's really freaking good

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
and SSJ-100

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Matt in chat says that I always thought those were Dragon

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Vomit

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
yeah, because Dragon Vomit

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
is flammable and kills people

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
so

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
there was also

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
an emulated version that came

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
in the Namco Museum 50th Anniversary and

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Namco Museum volume 5 for the Playstation

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
also

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
the PC Engine version

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
was added

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
to Nintendo Virtual Console in 2007

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
and on December 8th, 2009 the arcade

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
version came out as part of the Virtual

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Console arcade in Japan

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
and on November 4th

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
2008 came out on Xbox 360

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
with the Namco Museum

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Virtual Arcade

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Playstation Network does have a release, it's a downloadable

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
game for PS3 and that's under Namco

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
Museum essentials

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
and as part of the Pac-Man 30th Anniversary

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
in 2010, Dragon Spirit

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
was released as part of Pac-Man's arcade

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
party, 30th Anniversary arcade machine

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
along with

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
and a bunch of other games

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
so there you have it, Dragon Spirit

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
and it's a really

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
fun little arcade shooter, it's just not

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
quite the

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
the usual thing one expects

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
yeah, I like this game

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
a lot, it's in that Namco

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
collection on Playstation 3 that's

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
got some neat games in it

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
I've played this a lot on there

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I almost wonder if this partly didn't

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
inspire other

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
there's another game that

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
involved writing

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I want to say it was Psychic Storm

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
but maybe not

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
but I honestly think

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
that this just added such a unique

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
feel

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
to a genre

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
that's been out for quite some time

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
and we don't maybe have as many shooting games like this

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
that survived, you know, anymore

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
we still get some of the Raiden games

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
but I would love to see a new

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Dragon Spirit

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
there it is, your classic game of the week, Dragon Spirit

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
an arcade game

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
I'd like to add, actually, Dungeon Buster made a good point

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
that it had a health bar

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
which was pretty unusual for the time, but like I said

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
it was a two hit

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
you know, two hits you die

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
but that was your health bar

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
and a lot of life

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
alright, well, that is going to do it for the first half of our show

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
but we've got plenty more show to come

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
including the FUGO Question of the Week

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
talking about the Turnerization of Games

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
opinion piece, which website was that from?

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
BAV Club?

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I just want to make sure they got credit

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
we're going to talk about

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
that big

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
that big name lawsuit

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
that everybody's talking about this week

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
we're going to get into that fuckery

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
it's such a sweet story, love

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
gross

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I see what you did there

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
we also have your mails, FUs of the Week, your phone calls

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
right after this

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
where we are

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
having episode number 537

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
in progress for this

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
January the 26th of

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
2014

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
myself, DarkSakura, and voice of the show

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Jason here with you guys tonight

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
not here tonight

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Loki, if you missed our announcement

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
in part A, Loki and Mrs. Loki

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
welcomed Daniel Layton

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
their new son to the world

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
earlier this week

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
on Tuesday, so Loki will be off

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
until he decides he's ready to come back

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
which knowing Loki will probably be next week

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
but we won't hold him to it

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
he'll come back when he's ready

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
alright, we still got plenty of news to take care of

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
so let's get into it

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
some rapid fire news

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Jason, if you wouldn't mind starting us off today

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
oh yeah, I guess I did a really good job of distracting myself

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
and not paying attention to the fact that I'm starting this

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
okay

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
following the discussion of Final Fantasy 6

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
on Android

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Final Fantasy 6 on Android has a major freezing glitch

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
it was released last week to the Google Play Store

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
and the new version

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
comes with graphical improvements

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
yeah, we knew all that

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
spoilerific, maybe

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
possibly, but

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
to cut a long story short

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
and to obscure any of the details

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
the glitch

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
prevents gamers from completing the game

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
play if you want, it happens

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
it happens

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
man, I

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I'm unfortunately kind of running out of my

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
knowledge with Final Fantasy 6

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
and I really don't want to give away any kind of a key

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
plot point

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
the game freezes in Thamassa

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
if you're there

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
and you don't want to have to redo the game

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
stop playing there

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
wait for an update to become available

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
update it, the problem will be fixed

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Square Enix recently registered the

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
seeds of salvation in the US

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
as the

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
speculation continues to abound

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
the current theory

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
is that this is a

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
western localization for Dragon Quest

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
to be used

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
for, this trademark could be

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
the Nintendo 3DS remake of Dragon

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Quest 7, or maybe even

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
for the suite of smartphone remakes

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
like the Unity powered Dragon Quest 8

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Journey of the Cursed King

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
we'll see a trademark

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
a trademark may not go

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
anywhere, just like a patent or anything else

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
we'll see what they wind up doing with it when the game

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
becomes available

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
more hints towards a re-release

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
of Majora's Mask are being dropped from

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Nintendo in A Link Between Worlds

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
director

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Hiromasa Shikata has teased

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
in an interview with Game Informer

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
that the remake could be

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
coming because having

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Majora's Mask in Link's house was a

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
special request from Aonuma's

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
production team

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
now why would they ask us to do

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
that?

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
well we'll just have to wait and see

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
and this can't possibly be a surprise

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
hello Ocarina of Time 3D

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
it's a matter of getting the game

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
to look correctly and since

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
I missed it the first time around I am very much looking

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
forward to playing Majora's Mask 3DS

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
on the 3DS

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
if it happens

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
if it happens

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
gee let's think about this

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
something that finally happened

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
after months and months and months and months

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
and months and months of waiting is that

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Blizzard made Hearthstone

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
in open beta

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I installed it and didn't play it

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
wrong company

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
after pretty much everybody

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
who wanted to play the beta was already in the

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
closed beta Blizzard finally

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
opened the super special secret club

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
of people playing Hearthstone namely everybody

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
to the world

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
so yeah

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Blizzard has opened up

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Hearthstone Heroes of Warcraft so for whatever reason

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
you just forgot you wanted to play it at some point

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
you can actually download that and

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
check that out fun

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
it's only available however in North America

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
right now so when will the game

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
officially launch knowing

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Blizzard it will probably be in 2017

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I didn't know Blizzard and Valve

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
were so similar Blizzard

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
does things soon

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
which again

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
I just don't care tonight so I'm just gonna tell you

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
big reason I cancelled my

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
World of Warcraft account is because that expansion

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
is not happening in the next few months

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
there is gonna be nothing to do in

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
World of Warcraft for about six months until that

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
expansion gets here no no no no

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
rep rep grinding Rob rep grinding

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
oh yay and the

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
raids that aren't really that much fun anymore

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
but anyway I digress

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
didn't mean to turn it into a

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
hate fest I don't hate

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
hate is a strong word it's just

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Warcraft

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
and I are seeing other people right now that's all it is

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
you're seeing other MMOs

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
that's right moving on

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
I did not realize

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
this was a Steam feature

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
I'm using my little quotey hands feature

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
because I've never preordered a game on

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Steam but apparently if you were to preorder a

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
game on Steam you would

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
actually have to contact customer support to cancel

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
that preorder you couldn't just like click a

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
button that's like wait never mind or cancel

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
well

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
no more will you have to do that as the

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
refund an item button is now

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
displayed on Steam so if you wish

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
to cancel a preorder

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
you can do so just as easily

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
as you can place the preorder

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
which I always thought was the way it should be

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
but whatever

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
so there you go well now it is hooray

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
hooray one thing

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
that I'm sure many of you didn't order

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
because this would cost a lot of money

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
I think this actually ended up going for over

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
$90,000 it was a copy

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
of the super rare

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Nintendo World Championship

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
NES cartridge

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
and this cartridge really looked like shit

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
there's no other way to put it but this thing looked like it had been in

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
a dumpster somebody had scratched

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
the label off and written in a

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Bic pen Mario

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
because I guess

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
the first game in Nintendo World Championship

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
was Mario you can tell like mom or dad

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
did this it's Mario

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
but anyway so it was found and

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
there's only 116 of these cartridges

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
in the world so they always

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
go for a crap ton of money even when they

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
look like such garbage like this

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
game did on the outside it's

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
a pearl on the inside because it's

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
a very rare little tournament game

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
so yeah

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
let me see if I can find the final amount

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
right now here on eBay oh it went for

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
$99,902

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
I want to know who paid that you know what do you want to bet

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
they're not going to it was just a troll bid

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
it was probably 4chan that placed that bid let's be honest

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
alright

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
there you go

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Dark Sakura sorry the moment you

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
pass it over to me and my lungs

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
protest alright

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
yeah yeah

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
well

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
there is something that was and I

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
was very impressed by this when I

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
saw it today in my browsing

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
is that there is

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
going to be a preview for Castlevania

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Lords of Shadow 2

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
but this is specifically going to happen

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
in Australia

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
and the reason being

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
is that it's also a blood drive

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
so if you are in Sydney

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
on Thursday the 30th

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
from 5 o'clock onward

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
if you go to the Elizabeth Street donor center

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
at 20 Elizabeth Street

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
you can not only play Castlevania

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Lords of Shadow 2 you could possibly

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
save up to 3 lives

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
for every pint of blood you can it's usable

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
by up to 3 people

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
so eat a lot of spinach

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
and you know steak that morning

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
and make sure you pass your

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
hematocrit and give blood

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
and let us know how the game is

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
does Australia allow the gays to donate blood?

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I don't know

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
I don't live there

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
I think that's stupid

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
it is stupid

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
well in other news

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
there is something showing up on the Wii U

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Virtual Console this week and that

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
is Mighty Bomb Jack

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
the NES game

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
also known as the scourge of Game Center CX

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
GX? CX

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
whatever

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
well basically you just use bombs as a weapon

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
and you jump and look for treasure and do stuff

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
so hooray it's 5 bucks

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
which is about what you'd pay

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
for it at the flea market

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
and then

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I want

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
dammit Rob why do you link me stuff

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
because when it

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
says these two magic words I automatically

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
know oh this is a story Jamie wants to see

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
there is a mod

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
for the Starbound beta

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
that has elements

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
from Mass Effect

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
so now it's

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Starbound Mass Effect edition

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
and it is officially my favorite

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
mod on the Citadel

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
just saying

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
but it actually

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
adds in the

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Biotics so you can

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
lift and

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
slow down things and I guess

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
singularities and what not

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
and it converts your ship to the Normandy

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
to the original SR1

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
from the first Mass Effect

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
so you have all kinds of different

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
races showing up there

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
and you just need to use the

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Kawa's Xbox

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
mode character creator

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
and the simple extend the character creation

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
mod and the stuff is up on

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
the Starbound forums so let me know

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
if it works

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I may or may not be trying this tomorrow

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
hahaha

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
alright

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
uh

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
dar2 is in our chat room saying I thought the

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Mass Effect fans on OLR would like that yeah I saw that

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
too and I said very yes

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
was my response

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
alright let's go to

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
the Foogle question of the week

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
you take Facebook, you take Google Plus and you slam those

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
words together and you get what we call

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Boogle

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
as I promised this week's

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
question on Foogle relates

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
to the Turnerization of video games

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
article that Jason

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
read earlier from ABClub.com

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
so we decided we would ask our

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
listeners what do you

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
think about remaking classic games

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
do you think it's a good thing for the classic

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
games or would classic games be better

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
left untouched and resources

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
spent on new games

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
I'm going to read just a few of these answers from Facebook

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
so I'm going to tell you guys please go check out

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
facebook.com slash orange launch radio to read all

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
of the answers on the show but I'm so happy

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
to see Princess Irene answering

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
the question this week our good old friend

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Princess Irene is back and she said

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
so succinctly in her very Irene

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
style her reply is

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
it's total bullshit

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
which I can't do in her voice because I haven't heard her voice

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
in years

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
it's total bullshit is what Irene said

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
about remaking classic

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
games

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Daniel S says they can

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
remake games all they want it won't take

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
away from what they made long ago

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I just wish devs would pay more

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
attention to the consoles they're porting to

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
that and support the game post

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
launch stupid Chrono Trigger

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
IOS port is stupid

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I vaguely remember there being some

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
series of bugs or just like

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
the selection or something

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
I forgot there was a Chrono Trigger port

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
I'm pretty sure we covered it

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I stopped downloading those IOS remakes

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I just stopped, I couldn't

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
I threw up my hands and said I can't

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
and that was it

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Moving on to Awesome Unicorn who says

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I support remakes and reimaginings that offer significant changes

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
or improvements over the original

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
a la the Final Fantasy 4 DS remake

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
or the Lufia 2 DS reimagining

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Mobile ports of Final Fantasy 5 and 6

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
just feel like they've been changed simply so new artists

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
can list the games on their resumes

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Want to put a significant work into

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
improving the graphics and gameplay experiences?

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Please feel free to do so

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Want to make a quick buck? Save yourself the time and effort

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
put your game on Virtual Console or Playstation

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Network and start working on something else

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I like it, that's an order

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Our good pal Jeremy

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
from Koopa Club answers the question

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
and says remaking a classic game is totally fine

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
if done correctly

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
A good Square Enix example

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
is the DS remake of Final Fantasy 4

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
or Dragon Quest 5

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Pretty much everybody is making exactly the same point I did

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
The Final Fantasy 4 DS remake

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
is absurdly good

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Which really started with the 3 remake

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
and I think a lot of us were hoping

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I think a lot of us were hoping

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
for that with 6

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
and then we get this

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
and we're like cash in

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Ziba replies

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
and says I love remakes

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
especially ones remade for

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
IOS because I get to play them on the go

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
SSJ100Matt

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
says when a game is remade

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
for the right reasons and the right way

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
it can be great

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
When it's used as a quick, half-assed cash grab

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
then it only hurts the legacy and image that game once had

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
A great way to remake a game

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
is with the help of the community

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Chrono Trigger resurrection

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
had a lot of promise

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
made by fans and independent people

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
wanting to share the favorite game with a new generation

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Sadly it was stopped

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
before it could be finished

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Well because they were going to do that IOS port

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
that we all forgot about

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
My friend Shane

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
who's going to be here next week says

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
I think it's okay to remake a game if it's stupidly

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
hard to get your hands on a copy

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
and you've already given up hope of a straight up port

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
coming to some device

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
Something like C code in 2 or whatever could benefit

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
from such a practice

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
The graphics was super dumb to do though

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
It's already on a lot of different platforms

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
and they made it look worse with odd script changes

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
So bad

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
I'm hearing all of that in Shane's voice

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
So bad

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Gamergirl says

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I don't see anything wrong with redoing some games

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
because it gives people who haven't played the original

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
nor can they find them a chance to play

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Looking at a few of the answers

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
from Google Plus

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Let's see

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
ActDeft gave us a haiku

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
version, we love haikus

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Remakes are okay

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
but if the devs are lazy

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
the port will be bad

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Flaco Jones

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Remakes are okay

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
No it's fine

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Don't make me police the police

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Flaco Jones says

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
I'm fine with remakes but I think the original

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
version should be bundled in there

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
as well so the classic game can still be

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
experienced and appreciated

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
That's a good way of doing it

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
I like that idea

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
AJ Twist lastly on Google Plus says

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Remakes are good as long as there are

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
no significant changes that change the

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
gameplay or story. Changes to the story

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
that make it better to understand are always

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
welcome in my opinion. I think some

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
remakes should include an original port

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
so we can better appreciate the new and

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
old versions. Kids need a reason

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
to play some classics

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Flaco Jones answer is actually pretty interesting

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
because Cave Story has really epitomized

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
this. It doesn't

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
exactly have the lifetime and the multiple

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
generation. It doesn't span

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
multiple generations to see what's gonna happen

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
but Cave Story started

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
as and still is an indie title

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
but its groundswell has just continued

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
to grow and grow and grow over the last

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
I don't even know when it

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
originally came out. I want to say two years now

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
I want to say 2012

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
but there's like three different versions of the game

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
There is the original pixel

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
art and very crude

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
synthesized music

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
and then they kind of refined it

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
and upgraded it and made it look

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
less blocky but still

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.000
a motif of that style

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Yep

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
They improved

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
everything, made it, added yet

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
another depth of detail, gave it more

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
style, improved the soundtrack and really brought it

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
up and apparently there's

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
even a third tier where the music

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I've heard the music, it's more

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
it's more full production

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
fully featured production instead of

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
like little synthesized

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
designs and then

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
the graphics are

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
fully fleshed out

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
but still kept

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
in a blocky style

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Three

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
very distinct styles

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
in two years is pretty crazy

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
but every version lets you select

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
from any combination of them

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
both independently graphics and sound

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Alright

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Those were some of the answers from Facebook and Google Plus

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
I read about half of them tonight just for time's

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
sake to keep things moving so I'm sorry I didn't read all

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
the answers, thank you to everybody that took the

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
time to answer and I encourage all of our listeners

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
to read what people had to say over

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
at facebook.com slash orange launch radio

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
and google.com slash plus orange launch radio

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Alright, let's travel on

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
with some more news

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
Loki

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Loki

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Sorry, I'm so used to seeing it

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
on the show roll

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Alright, not Loki

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Loki imposter

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Bigger beard Loki

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
As spotted on

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
LinkedIn from the profile of

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Rob Stokes, the senior level designer at

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Harmonix

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
an unannounced Kinect game

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
for the Xbox One has allegedly

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
been cancelled. In mid-2012

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
Harmonix originally announced that they had

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
several projects in the works that were not related

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
to Rock Band or Dance Central

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
or Fantasia Music Evolved

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
but no further details

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
were given on any of these outside

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
of a spotted job listing looking for a

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
combat designer in 2012

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
to be used for next generation

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
hardware. Last year

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Harmonix stopped dropping

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
DLC weekly for Rock Band

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
and went through two waves of

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
layoffs. The only comments

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
provided when asked about

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
changes to their upcoming lineup were

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
responsible for the highest rated Kinect titles

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
for Xbox 360 with our Dance Central

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
franchise and we're very excited

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
by the possibilities of the new motion sensing

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
technology for Xbox One. Right now

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
our Kinect development is focused on the already

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
announced Disney Fantasia Music Evolved

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
a title which we believe further innovates

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
in both the motion gaming and music space

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Nothing else to confirm today other than

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
a heads up that we've got a lot of stuff happening

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
that you'll hear about soon

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
and by soon they probably mean

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
six months from now at E3, five months

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
from now

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
An unknown game gets canned

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Well rest in peace

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
game we never knew you

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I mean but

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
I don't know I

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I'd hate to be all like doom and gloom but I kind of

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
worry about Harmonix like you know the Rock Band

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
bubble kind of burst we haven't really

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
seen a lot from them lately I know there's this

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Fantasia thing which is gonna be a big deal but it's

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
it's still not here and now they're canceling

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
projects we've heard about layoffs like

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
and it's not like Harmonix

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
makes a bunch of stinkers it's just like you know

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
the Rock Band bubble kind of burst like

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
They don't

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
They don't make a bunch of

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
stinkers but I don't think they get the critical acclaim

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
like we would all hope that we would

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
all prefer that they did

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Let's be honest frequency and amplitude were amazing

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
games they weren't exactly the

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
biggest sellers

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
But Rock Band was huge

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Rock Band was an absolute run away

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
And Activision really screwed that whole

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
thing up but anyway it's neither here nor there

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Yeah

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Well good luck with whatever Harmonix

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
is working on maybe they'll be able to

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
blow us away at the next E3

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
We love you Harmonix and we look forward to seeing everything you do

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
for now and

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
as long as you continue to be able to do it

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Which we hope is a very long time

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
I somehow doubt that Harmonix's

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
next game would be called Music Saga

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Because

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Thank you

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
I'm bowing

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Because as I'm sure many of you have heard this week

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
King

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Is it king.com or king? I guess they're

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
king and they're located at king.com but anyway

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
This company, you know what they're Zinga2

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I'm gonna call them Zinga2

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Because that's what they are to me Zinga2

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Has decided to

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Trademark the word candy

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
They now

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
And they got it

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
So they basically own the trademark on the word candy

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
When it comes to video games I mean if you want to sell

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Candy in the grocery store that's one thing but you will make a

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Video game with the word candy in it that's another

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
And by the way they also

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Got the word saga

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
So if you want to make a game with the name

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Saga in it you will have to

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Answer to king

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
The makers of the banner saga learned in this the hard way

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
When king sent them a cease and desist

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
In king's defense

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
King came out and said well

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
We're not really like we really

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
We don't really think the banner saga is like

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Trying to infringe on our trademark

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
We have to do this because if we don't

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
Defend it then people are gonna come

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Along and you know

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Will lose the trademark and then people

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Will try to make their you know

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Clone games

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
And to be fair

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
On the iOS marketplace and the Google

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Android play market

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
There's a lot of shitty clones

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
To try to ride the success of these games

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
But where do we draw the line people?

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
I've even seen those at 3am shitty advertising too

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
And you all

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I know you're all sitting there expecting me to say

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
LOL

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Square Enix, Saga Frontier

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
LOL, 7th Saga

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
LOL, Candy was a song

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
In DDR, etc, etc

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I mean yeah I mean it's

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Ridiculous that they own the trademark on

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Those words because

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Especially in the case of Saga

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
There's so many other games

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
That have nothing to do

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
With a game that was ripped off

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Fucking bejeweled in the first place

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
Again I'm just keeping it real tonight

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
It's a little silly that when their game is a rip

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Off in the first place they get the

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Right to these words

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I think I

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I played Candy Crush

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
A little bit I couldn't even tell you how much

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I'm pretty sure I thought it was a

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Zynga game and I stopped

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Only for

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Not only for lack of interest but also in the

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
The great Zynga

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
But

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Not petition

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Boycott?

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Thank you the great Zynga boycott of 2013

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
And the previous fucking 3 years

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
2 anyways

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
The thing about

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Them saying that they have to go through

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Due process and they don't actually want it to happen

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Is that it doesn't work out that way

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Either they

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
Either the

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
The person they charge follows the cease and desist

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
And makes a name change or

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Cans the project out right

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Or the person they charge with it rebukes

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
And King loses the

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Trademark

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Only if they

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Only if the

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Party doesn't like

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Countersue or whatever the appropriate

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
Motion is will the whole

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Process just get settled and dropped

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
But if anybody balks at this

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
They're gonna lose the trademark

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
That's what happens

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
They shouldn't have been given this trademark in the first place

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Oh absolutely, everything else about this

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Is fucking absurd

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
They should have been given the trademark for

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Candy Crush Saga

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Because Candy hasn't

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Existed for I don't even know

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
How many decades

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Candy Land

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
How does

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Who owns the Milton Bradley suite now

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
God they've all changed hands so many times

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
Somebody should have a yell it out

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Is it Hasbro?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
They have every right

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
To make the game Candy Land

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
As a pour on iPhone

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
If they want

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
I fucking double dog dare King

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
To go sue the makers of Candy Land

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
Yep

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
And then it'll throw the whole thing

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Honestly what I would like to see happen

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Is Milton Bradley

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Or whatever holdings

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Go after them

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Just to prove a point I would love to see that

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Hasbro you were correct

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I would love to see them prove a point

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Just to go bitch please

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Um

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
You know it's

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
Weird though because in a roundabout way

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
It's actually given a lot of additional exposure

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
For Banner Saga which is um you know

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
That's a good thing for them

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
But yeah it's just so ridiculous

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Like those people that are working hard

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Making the Banner Saga they should not have to deal

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
With this fuckery

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
That's the real problem it's a waste

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Of resources

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
This is not their fucking problem

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
It's really gross

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
That they're having to even deal with this

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
The only silver lining is that the entire

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Internet community backs them

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
And so it's a great amount of exposure

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
For their game at least take solace

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
In that a lot of people heard about Banner Saga

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
That wouldn't have heard about it otherwise

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Let's be real

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
So that's the positive

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
So what are they going to change it to like Banner story or

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
But here's the other problem with

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Zynga 2

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
Is just like the mother ship Zynga

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
They have a history of fucking copying

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Games

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Candy Crush Saga is a copy of

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Jewel Quest

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Which in turn is a copy of Bejeweled

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
So yet they want to prevent

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Other people doing what they did

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Anyway in my opinion

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Allegedly just throwing those words out there

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Just in case

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
But it is on record that King

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Supposedly

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Copied another game

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
And they called it Pack-a-void

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
They tried to go after another developer

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Back in 2009 because they wanted to

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Basically buy their game and put it out

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
But King put out a statement this week

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Because you know Reddit's going to find it

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
4chan and all the internet community people

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
They're going to find it and they're going to bring it to light

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
There'll be a NeoGaf post and then everybody goes

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Yeah take them down, take them down, show King

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Stick it to the man and so forth

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
And that's exactly what happened is that it came out

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
This developer said hey King tried to buy my game

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
In 2009 then they just copied it

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
And put out Pack-a-void instead

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
So King had to put out a statement

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
King does not clone other people's games

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
King believes that IP

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Both our own IP and that of others

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Is important and should be properly protected

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Like any prudent company we take all appropriate steps

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
To protect our IP in a sensible and fair way

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
At the same time we are respectful

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Of the rights and IP of other developers

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Sorry just letting that comment sink in for a minute

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Before we launch any game

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
We do a thorough search of other games

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
In the marketplace as well as review of

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Trademark filings to ensure that we are not

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
Infringing anyone else's IP

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
However for the avoidance of doubt in this case

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
The game which was coded by a third party

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Developer five years ago has

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Been taken down

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Let's see I believe

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
What happened is that

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
The developer who made this

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Clone actually

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Came out and said yeah

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
King kind of hired me

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
To do this and I had to do it quickly

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
And I had to get it out before the

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Original game Scamper Ghost was set to be

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Released essentially

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
So

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
What happened is that they came out and said

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
King contracted the third party

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
To make the game he made it at their

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Request to their specifications so King is

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Responsible I'm fairly certain 99%

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Of people everyone except King

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Would agree that Pack Avoid is a clone

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Of Scamper Ghost and that was a statement

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
From Matthew Cox

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Who was the developer who

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
Made Scamper Ghost

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Essentially so

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
I mean it's

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Ridiculous that they were given this trademark in the first

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Place

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
The old laws are not

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Working when it comes to intellectual property

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
In this country I'm gonna say

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
In this country a bunch of the laws aren't

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Working when it comes to anything

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Well seriously I think

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Well at least we're not in an all out full blown

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
War I mean there are some things that are

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Working but you're right there's a lot of

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
Fucked up shit period

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
There's a lot of broken things that need to just be completely

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Thrown out and revamped

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
No one wants to

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Alright

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Ah

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
There you go

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I think we all agree it's

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Fuckery does anyone want to try

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
To take the devil's advocate position even if I'm having a hard

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Time in this circumstance I mean

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I understand there is a lot of clones

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
There's a lot of people and there's some guy that

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Spoke out that made

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
A game and get a load of this name

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
What was the guy

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
He made a game call and he's been contacted

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
By King's legal team the creator of

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Quote all candy casino

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Slots jewel craze connect

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
Big blast mania land

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Yeah that's not SEO bait

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
Look girl

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
You're the reason why

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Zynga 2 has

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
This leverage

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
To be like those types

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Of games are the reason why even though

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
A slot machine game may have nothing to do

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
With candy although I'm surprised candy crush

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Saga is not you know rip that off too

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
But

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
Like you know even though the the slot

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
Machine game may be kind of different let's

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Be real that name is

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Fuck you're fucking baiting people with that name

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
That's why they got that trademark

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Is because of you

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Just think about that for a minute

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
I guess that's as far as the devil's advocate

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Position I can go

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Let's move on let's do something happy

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
I need happy news dark soccer give me some happy news

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Happy is like me I don't have any

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Oh yeah I do have happy

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Well you know we talked about Ubisoft in

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Part A well how about some more

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Ubisoft news

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
They are going to be adding

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Roughly a hundred

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Jobs for their Quebec

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
City studio

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
They're planning on investing

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
25 million and

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
About 460,000

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Of that is from the government of Quebec

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
That's going to strengthen

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
The company's infrastructure

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
So they

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Are they already have about

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
360 employees and they're going to be

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Bringing on about another hundred so

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Yay for boosting

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Canada's job market

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Because they've been hit hard too

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Right yeah so I

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Just think when we have a story about that there's jobs

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Being added as opposed to taken away that's a good thing

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
That's good news

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Like hearing that so congrats

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
To Ubisoft that means things are going well over there

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Indeed

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
And you know I

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I honestly hope to see

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I mean clearly Ubisoft

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Is running kind of you know

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Strongly right now so I'd like to see what

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
You know the spells for the future

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
I'd like to see you try to say you don't have the resources

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
To port things to Wii U

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Yeah

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Oh burn

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Had to

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Alright Jason what do you got

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Minecraft's sales have exceeded

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
One million in just

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
A month

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
It's first month of life on the PS3

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Um

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Since its release

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
As an overall recap since its release

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Eleven million units of the PC version

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Have been sold as of last June

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
So even that figure is

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
Probably pretty grossly out of date

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
At this point

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
The Xbox 360 version has another

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Ten million sales

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Ten million players which I think

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Is a bit of a misnomer

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Attached to sales but at any rate

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
The Xbox 360 version has another

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Ten million players

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Has another ten million

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Players joining that number

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
There's a lot of people that own both or all three

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Like I own the 360 version and the PC version

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
But Notch still says that it ain't gonna make it

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
To the Wii U

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
So we continue to cry

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
But eleven plus ten plus one and invariably

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
I would throw out very

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Like another four million or something like that

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Just PC sales alone

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Not half bad for the

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
For the survival

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Blocky create everything

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Yourself kind of adventure

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
I'm looking forward to seeing those crisp

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Graphics on the Playstation 4 when that

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Version is released

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Pixel art like you wouldn't believe

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
It'll look exactly the same

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Of course that was a joke

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Well I would imagine some of those limitations

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
When it comes to you know the space you have to work with

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
And so forth like that's gonna change but

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
I was reading something I don't know if this

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Translates to the console versions

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
I'll save I need I wanna

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Read more about it I'll save it till the end of the show

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Okay good sales for the PS3

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
It's gonna be a powerful source again

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Powerful force against the PC and Xbox as well

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Ummm

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
You think it's not

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Gonna jump up to the double digit millions?

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Oh on the Playstation 3 and 4

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
The only reason it wouldn't is because

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
I think most people that are interested in it

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Have already bought it on PC or Xbox 360

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
But I mean don't

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Underestimate what a huge flipping game

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
Minecraft is I am always surprised

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
I think I talked about this in a prior week but I overheard

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
One of my co-workers talking

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Like you know the middle-aged

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Ladies that I work with one of them was talking about how

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
She was playing Minecraft got addicted to it over the holiday

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
And like not the type of gal

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
I usually expect to be playing video games when I heard

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
She was playing Minecraft I was kinda like that's kinda rad

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
She was talking about the creepers and you know

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Trying to dodge and she's like you gotta build houses

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I was explaining it to another person you gotta build these houses

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
And stay away I was

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
You know this game is huge

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I was actually gonna wear a different shirt tonight

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
But the fact that I had this on

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Is pretty coincidental

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Two three weeks ago

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
I was at Wells Fargo

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
And the lady that I was working with

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Asked me about my shirt

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
I'm wearing

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
If anybody has checked out the

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
GitHub shop I'm not gonna go too crazy with it

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
But GitHub has a bunch of themed shirts

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
The shirt that I'm wearing right now

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Is a pixel art version

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Of the Octocat

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
The GitHub mascot and it's in a

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
8-bit pixelated version

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
And so the person that I'm working with

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
Sees this and she's asking me

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
If it's Minecraft and I had to kinda

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
I had to kinda dance around the issue

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Because I was like

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
It's that kind of a style

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
It doesn't have anything to do with Minecraft

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
But they were both inspired from the same thing

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
And you know

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
Of all of the things that

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
8-bit would mean something to someone

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
The fact that Minecraft

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Can kind of be that common

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Thread of understanding

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Is reasonably interesting

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
And to notch

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
And to notch's credit

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
It is very

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Obvious, very definitive

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
And it is very well done

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
When you're seeing Minecraft stuff at Walmart

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Yeah right?

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Yeah

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
That says a lot right there

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Well I don't go to Walmart

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
But that's the course that Angry Birds took

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
So yes, I agree with that statement completely

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
I don't like to give them my business

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
But I was there helping Becky

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Find stuff for her son for Christmas

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
That's fair

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
I ended up there too for something

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
It was the one place in town

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
That supposedly had a Playstation 4 camera

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Because I've been trying to get that one

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Oh my god, it is impossible

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Sorry for the tangent train

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
It is fucking impossible to find a Playstation 4 camera

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
They are all gone

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
I was on a tip

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
On Twitter, I went to Fries.com

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
To order a

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Playstation camera which they said would ship

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
January 26th

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
And I was like, alright, I'll wait the week, whatever

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
So I placed the order, you know, 70 bucks or whatever

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
New update, 2015

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
No, I get an email, we're sorry

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
We're not going to be able to ship on the day

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
We'll hold your pre-order if you want to cancel

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
Call such and such a number

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
I was kind of irritated

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Why did you advertise something you knew you couldn't

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Uphold?

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
I was a little irritated at that

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Anyhow

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
I mean, I don't need it

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I want it for broadcasting

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
That would be fun and doing other things

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
But it's not changing my opinion

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
It's a little frustrating

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
They're so flipping hard to find

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Anyhow, let's talk about something that will be

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Maybe a little easier to find

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
When it comes out

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Sanity?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Sanity 2? This game is

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Slightly punishing

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Some people see it as, you know, it's like

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
The Dark Souls of 2D platformers

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
But anyhow

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
They first announced the

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Sequel for WiiWare and PC

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
And now they're going to raise

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
$200,000 to try to get this

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
It looks like it will probably, actually I'm kind of

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Curious where they're at right now

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
120, nope, go away

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
127,000, 26 days to go

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
26 days to go

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
So four days they've already

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Comfortable funding

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
Now that I've mentioned it here

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
They'll get another 100,000

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
But anyway

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
Yeah, if you like

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
The retro adventure games

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
You're going to get a kick out of this

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
For $15 you get

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
The Steam and DRM free copy

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Of the game on release

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
So it's basically pre-ordering a game that will be done in a year

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
If they get certain stretch goals

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
They're looking at 3DS and Vita versions

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
At 1.15 million

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Wii U, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Versions at 1.65 million

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
At 2.35 million

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Those stretch goals are quote

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Subject to negotiation

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
Be interesting to see how that goes

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
So yeah

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
Pretty cool

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Fans of La Mulana like Dark Tetsuya

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I know are very happy about that

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Alright

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
Pretty happy to see it's a new character too

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Sugi, fun stuff

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
This game is really

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
In the same vein of everything that we've talked about before

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
This game is so incredibly

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Meticulous as well

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
From when it was originally released in 20

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Shit

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Before 2010 it was originally like

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
2007

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Or so

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And the PC remake

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
That they made is

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
The Wii version was rather tame

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
But the PC remake that was released last year

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Or 2012 I can't recall

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I remember the Wii one was delayed

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Dramatically improved

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
And yet another game with a storied history

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Of something that has just been

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Refined and refined and refined

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
For the better

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
And now they're continuing forward with new content

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Perfect, wonderful

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Alright

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Well let's look at the wonderful content that sits inside our mailbag

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
Mailbag at

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place to send us emails

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Every week Dark Sakura dives in the

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Mailbag head first

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
And pulls out a couple emails that she

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Believes are worthy of repeating

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Here on this program

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
How many emails do we have tonight? Three

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Three emails

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
I haven't checked for anything else and I'm only going to read these three

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Probably just a bunch of spam

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Howdy gang stars

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Howdy

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
I'd like to expand on the thoughts that I tried to express

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
In the FUGL question of the week from last week

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
I was unable to do so due to the confines of an outdated

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Artform that only exists in the modern world

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
For the purposes of nostalgia

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
QQ more

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Also known as Haikus

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Haikus

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
For people who didn't catch that

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Like I didn't catch that mic

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Just now

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
By the way Haiku is not outdated

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
It is still in use

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Nintendo has a unique place in the marketplace

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
But only

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
But one only also held by Sony and Microsoft

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
In addition to being a video game developer

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Nintendo is

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
As is well known a console creator

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
While their role as a video game developer

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Allows them to be much more unique

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
In how they approach the market

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Nintendo's role as a console creator is much different

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
In that role Nintendo must not

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Offer a product

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
That is tailored for any specific use

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Or function

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
They must instead provide a product that allows for

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
A wide variance

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Of products and services

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
A narrow focus on specific tasks

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
And function serves to only limit

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
The products the company other than Nintendo

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Can utilize on their console

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
If not incentivize companies

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
To avoid the console altogether

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
For that reason

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
Nintendo should work to broaden the kinds of products

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
And services

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
That companies other than Nintendo can put on their

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Current console the Wii U

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
One of the ways they can do this is by providing

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
A decent stable and safe online environment

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
That can be utilized through the Wii U

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
And I need to renew my chat room

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Because it's not working

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Where was I?

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
It doesn't have to be a robust service

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Like Xbox Live or PSN

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
I help my nieces spend hours a day

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Playing games on the Disney website

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
They don't have to sign in or provide any

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Information in order to play

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
My nieces can just call up the Disney games website

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Click on whatever particular game they want to play

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
And enjoy

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Perhaps Nintendo could come up with something like that

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
Also boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs, additionally boobs

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Stay black, Redertainment

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
For history's sake

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
January

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
No, January

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
19th

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Last week's

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
Fugu question of the week

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Redertainment's haiku was

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Create a better platform

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
For online gaming

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
Also boobs, boobs, boobs

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
At least his email

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
His email did truly expand on that

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Because he added more boobs

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
No

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
I don't necessarily disagree with what he's saying

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
At all

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
They've got to figure out how to get those third parties back

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
The thing about

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
The very last point about

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Creating a safe environment

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Is what the definition

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Of a safe environment

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
Is going to be

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
What you just described

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Your nieces being able to go on Disney and play games

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
I don't know this for certain

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
But I'm pretty damn sure that yes

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Games become available just like

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
Getting a disc into the Wii U

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Or downloading something from the shop and going to it

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
That's an online environment

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Kind of

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Super Mario 3D World and the Miis

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
Gravitating around

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
That is an online environment

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
That those online aspects come into your game

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Xbox

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Microsoft and Sony provide a

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Robust messaging and communication system

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Alongside matchmaking

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Multiplayer, etc, etc, games

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Um

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
As soon as you allow

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Two people to communicate

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
It is inherently unsafe

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Period, that's why every single game has

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
Online interactions not rated by the ESRB

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
Because people will say

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Type, gesture, do whatever

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
They can possibly do

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
Based off whatever they want to do

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
Indeed true

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
So it's difficult, that's all I'm saying

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
It's quite difficult

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Yes, let's

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
But thank you for the email, it's very

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Very pointed considering the

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Lengths of the debate we went to last week

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
Thank you and I agree with the boobs

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Seconded

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
This email comes from Andy R

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Hey OLR

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
First time writers who forgive me for any

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
Grammar mistakes, okay

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Just wanted to say that I agree with Jason

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
About the Wii quote failing

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
As a game console, it didn't succeed

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
On the strength of its library at first

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
It succeeded at being

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
The Tickle Me Elmo of Insert Year Wii

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Came out

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Even my parents bought one and there's no way

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
They would have bought any other video game console

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
It was a runaway success because

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
It managed to strike a chord

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
With a casual crowd who tend to be more

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Fickle about what catches on and what doesn't

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
Wii U has failed to capture

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
That market again, myriad of reasons

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
In my opinion

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
And I don't think it ever will at this

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Rate, it's now the more hardcore gamer

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Crowd feels scorned after

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
How the Wii was largely marketed

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
To a different crowd

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
Anyway, just my two cents, I don't think Nintendo

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Is necessarily in dire straights

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Mario Kart and Smash

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Still have a chance to turn things around

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
And at least get the gamer crowd back

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
On board, they'll keep cranking out

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
Their first party games and I think they'll be

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Fine by the end of the generation

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Can I just, I just want to say real quick

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
While you cough up a storm there, the whole

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
Tickle Me Elmo comparison, like I

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Get that angle, like the Wii was kind of like

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
The hot thing that year, so like I get the position

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
There, but could you kind of say the same thing about

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
The Xbox One and the Playstation 4 this year?

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Nope. Why?

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Because what's the

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
There was nothing really to rival

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Sorry, there was nothing really to rival the Tickle Me Elmo

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
When it came out, I'm just saying

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
In terms of that type of toy and things that

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Had that much hype, but now we've got

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
First of all, direct competitors

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
So there's two of them

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Offering comparable deals

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
And each with their dedicated fanbases

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
It's really

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
An

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
It's like

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Comparing

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Apples and oranges

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
To a

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
A potato

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Well, but

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
To be fair, the Wii and the Playstation 3

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Came out the same year, yet the

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Wii dominated the conversation based off

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
The strength of Wii Sports and the other launch titles

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
This generation's consoles are still on the shelves

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Maybe not so much the PS4

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Because of stock for the overseas

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
For the overseas launch

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
But this is exactly the point that I was trying to make

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Is that the Wii was gone

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
For so long

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Yeah, you could pre-order

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
You'll get stock when you get it

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Like the 360 had been the year before?

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Gotcha

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
It's really hard for me

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
To have a mental

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
A particular map of this

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Because I've been a latecomer to every single console

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I've never done it on launch day

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
I've never tried to get it on launch day

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Failed and had to

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
Continue to follow up to actually

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Take physical stock

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Of when this stuff is available

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Yeah, they work out

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Supply issues

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
They ramp up, people buy them with less frequency

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
And they start to show up again

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
Jamie just made the point

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
That their dedicated camps

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Are responsible for these

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Millions of sales in the first month

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Yep

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
100% true

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
But the Wii persisted

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
The Wii was the perfect storm

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Because it had this huge up front

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Rush that had an incredibly

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
Long tail and incredibly long wind down

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
And

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Something I came up with

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Listening to last week's episode again

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
They had good

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Late

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Late life releases

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Galaxy was absolutely phenomenal

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Uh

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Fucking

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Every single Wii game

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
I have on the shelf literally just

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Erased from my mind

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Nintendo had a good late life library

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Which is

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Stereotypically Nintendo

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
These releases keep going the entire time

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Which only boosted its numbers

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
But that initial surge of

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Everything

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
Was all because of a new audiences

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
And Wii Sports

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Carried over to Wii Fit

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Let's move on with the rest of the email

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Oh yeah we didn't finish that did we

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
No we did not

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Also quickly on the topic of the Magic the Gathering movie

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
You guys were comparing it to Battleship

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Or Clue or other board games

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
But there's already a strong narrative in the game

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
There have been a ton of books and comics that flesh out the story

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
And they've even got an entire team devoted to making sure

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
That all the properties stay true to the world

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
That game has created

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Pausing here

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I did read a lot of the Magic the Gathering comics

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
When I was really into playing it

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
And

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I just

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Wasn't that interested in the backstory

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
It was just a fun game to play

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Piggybacking on your pause here

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
I get the whole

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
It's not Battleship or Clue

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Okay I get that angle

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
I kind of think about Dungeons and Dragons

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
Obviously there's a very rich story there

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
There's the books and everything else

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
And then the movie came out and it was kind of

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
This crap

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
And I wanted to like it because Tom Baker was in it

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
And a lot of times those books

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
And everything else they kind of get ignored

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
I mean the World of Warcraft movie is going to

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
Face this problem, you know how much of the books

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Is it really going to pay attention to it

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
There is a rich story

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
For the Warcraft stuff too

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Star Trek and Star Wars, this new Star Wars

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Movies, it ain't going to follow any of the books

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Well they already said that the books are pretty much

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
Now Apocrypha

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
To finish this up

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Almost all the blocks

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Magic term for three consecutive

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Expansions tell a story

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
And while it can be tough to figure

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
That out just through individual cards

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
It is there

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Just pointing it out because I doubt this will be like

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
A Yu-Gi-Oh type thing

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
And definitely not something like Battleship

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
I know we're being cynical

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Because a lot of video game movies turn out like garbage

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
I think it would be awesome if the movie

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Turns out really well

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Like if they can actually pull it off

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
It would need a freaking Lord of the Rings treatment

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
To make it good

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Honestly

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
What does that say about all the negative critique

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Of The Hobbit though

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Yeah but then again

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
The Hobbit is a children's book

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Therefore it was actually

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
A relatively short story

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Did not need

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Stuff pulled from

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
The side books and short stories

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
And every other little doodle

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Tolkien happened to put on paper

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
It needed to be one fucking movie

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
I love this comment from Bobby in the chat room

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Land will be tapped in a theater near you

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Love it

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
I get it

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
I just keep having flashbacks

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Of how many hours of my life I wasted

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Playing Magic

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Finally Rob

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Why so much hate for the non indie podcast

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
I listen to a ton of podcasts each week

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Some indie and some not

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Even the ones that are affiliated with the company

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
I listen to people who love video games

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
And talk about video games

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Thanks and keep up the podcast

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
As Andrew are

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Thanks for asking that actually

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
So I can kind of set the record straight

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
On some things here

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Hate is a strong word

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Hate is a very strong word

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
I don't hate non indie podcasts

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
I don't hate them

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
I really like to support indie podcasts

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
And my fellow people that go out there

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
And really work their butts off

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Because indie podcasters

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Have to work ten times as hard

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
To achieve something that

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
A corporate backed podcast

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Can achieve very easily

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Whether the quality be good or not

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
And that's just the way it is

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I'm not saying that out of a jealousy thing

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
But it really irks me in the indie scene

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
When I see people

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Striking each other down

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Why are you fighting with each other

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
And having these silly little wars

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
When we have to fight

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
There's so much to get noticed anyway

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Amongst these corporate backed things

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And look to the story we talked about earlier

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
With the whole

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Paying off

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Paying for the plugs

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Product placement and so forth

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
It kind of gets into some of the other things

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
You really have to consider are a factor

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
When you talk about corporate games

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Does that mean all the people

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
That work for these corporate companies

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
And work for corporate podcasts are shrills

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
No no no

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
That really pursued their passion

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
They do it for a living, I applaud them

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
There's a lot of very talented people that do

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Happen to do it for a living

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
I don't necessarily need to be

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Plugging them because they've got their audience

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
They're easy to find, you know where to look

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
But I will say

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Again, having a night where I'm just going to

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Tell it like it is, there are also

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Some people out there in the industry

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
That are doing these shows

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
That don't have that level of passion

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
On some shows

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
That's been very obvious to me

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
As a listener, maybe I'm just

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Old or picky, I don't know

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
I definitely have heard those corporate based

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Podcasts where somebody was only there

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
Because they had to be

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
And that just

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
When we

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Put so much effort into this

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
And do it for nothing

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
That really stings sometimes

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
When you hear people talking up

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
This particular podcast where people plainly

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
And obviously don't want to be there

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
That's the really tricky part

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
However, granted, that is the minority

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
So

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
I think that's great that you have your shows

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
That you support and listen to

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
And there are some great corporate based shows

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
Out there, but I just

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
I choose to support those that have to

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
Work a little bit harder to get noticed

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
I would add to that that

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
The situation is getting

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
A bit more diverse and by the same token

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
A little bit muddier because

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
The rise of YouTube and

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
It's the same story over and over and over again

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
You affiliate, you partner, you whatever

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
But these

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
You know, corporate backed

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
Networks that

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
Pick up individual

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
I don't quite know the business

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Details of it, but corporations

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
That pick up

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Indie producers

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
Because their content is

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Engaging and they have an established base

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
And they

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Do so so that they can provide

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Um

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
So that the

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
Said originally

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
Indie can start doing things

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
For the company, for the corporation

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
But it also

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
The theory is that it's a two way street

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
The individual is able to

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Continue doing what they're doing

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Take on additional responsibilities with the company

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
But also do events

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
Personally taking advantage of company

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
Resources

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
And also literally

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Legal protection, YouTube fuckery

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
To some extent, that kind of thing

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
There's a lot of interesting

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
Indie organized

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Networks on YouTube

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
And various other locations right now

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
And it's

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
It is really hard

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
To figure out

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
On what side of the coin

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
These people lie

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Sometimes

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
But the point is that

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Be there for the content that you enjoy

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
And that you can tell the people enjoy as well

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
That means, that probably means

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
You're having a good time listening to it

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
It's really the whole point

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
There are some people out there very passionate about

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
Games who are gamers and

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Are very good at what they do

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
And have a lot of good things to say

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Unfortunately, not everybody's in the game industry for those reasons

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
And that's a harsh reality

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
That

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
You know, you'll find out for yourself

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
If you go to some of these press events

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
And see it first hand

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
That's all I'm going to say

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
That individual lives in Arizona

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Or did by the area code

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Thank you Andrew

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
Well, last email

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Give away his home address while you're at it Jason, jeez

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Well that's not in the email

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
I would if I, no no no

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
I did want to say thank you for the email

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Because the beginning said it was a first time emailer

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
So I love those whole long time listener first time callers

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
First time writers?

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
And your grammar was excellent

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
What's up gang?

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
So funny enough

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
I just got done posting

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
On the Frugal Question

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
And my email is kinda sorta about the same thing

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
I'm playing through Devil May Cry

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
The 2013 one

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
And I've come to realize

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
I love the raw gritty and cocky new Dante

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
And the game itself as a whole

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I was wondering what your thoughts were on the game

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Haven't played it, that's just me

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I remember when the game released

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
And it was, cool topic of the month

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Was to hate the new Dante

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Do you think that gaming in this generation

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
Has an unfair advantage

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Due to the internet negativity

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I remember when the only gaming news

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I would get was just for magazines

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Oh well I guess we were just getting old

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
It was a P

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
I have to admit I have not

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Played the new Devil May Cry

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
It went cheap on Steam, I was thinking about buying it

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
It's free on Playstation Plus right now actually

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Let me, he's gonna hate me

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Alan!

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Alan! Help!

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Help me!

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Cause he has played it

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
Can you hear us in there?

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
Do you know what we're talking about?

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
We're talking about the new Devil May Cry game

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
And none of us have played it

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
But I know you have played it

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
And what did the emailer want to know about the Dante

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
First question was

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
I wonder what your thoughts were on the game

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
And he said that he liked the new Dante

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
It has

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
Like

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Everything is super edgy

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
And grim dark

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
And the new Dante

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Drops the F bomb a lot

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
And it's very try hard in that regard

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
But as far as the play style

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Like the art direction

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
And the settings, I really enjoy that

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
The new Dante, he's cute

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
I mean you get to see him naked

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I'm downloading this

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I don't care

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I will say it does do a very good job

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
At bringing a quality to, well you know somewhat

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
To objectifying the man

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
I would like to see him objectify some more

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
And

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
There on the PC version

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
There are mods, not nude mods

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Damn!

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
But I think there's a shirtless mod

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
How do you know about this stuff you perv?

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Cause when I got it on Steam for like

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
17 cents, I googled Devil May Cry mods

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
And there's a site for it

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
I think you might have googled

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
More specifically than that

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Just saying!

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
I think a lot of the original franchise

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
Devil May Cry fans are upset

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
About the reboot

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
It's because there was no real resolution

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
To the original franchise

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
The new Dante is a lot

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
He's different from the original one

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
In kind of shitty ways

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
So there's some anger there

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
It's a fun game

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Thank you for letting me pick on you, appreciate it

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
I just like that the whole Devil May Cry thing

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Actually came from a Resident Evil

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Type thing

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
My last experience with Devil May Cry

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Was playing Devil May Cry 3

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Failing so hard

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
That I unlocked easy mode

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
And I have not played another one since

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Not because

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Not out of personal scorn or anything like that

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
But because I didn't get a PS3

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
For two or three years

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
And still to this day

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
My PS3 library is

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Literally nothing compared to the 360

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Devil May Cry 4

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Eventually came out on the 360

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
But not until after it's PS3

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Oh my god, it's still 50 bucks on Steam

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
It's free right now on PS3

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Yeah, but I don't

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
I don't play my consoles

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
My hand hurts

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
At any rate, PlayStation Plus

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
I picked it up

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
I will definitely pick this series back up

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I don't know, I've loved this series

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
I don't remember much of the second one

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
But I'm sure I enjoyed it

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
I definitely love this kind of play style

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Terrible at it, obviously

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Easy mode

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
But I now have Devil May Cry reboot

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
And I'll pick it up

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
As soon as the opportunity presents itself

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
But it's in my library

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
So I can, in theory, do that

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Whenever I want

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Yeah, whatever

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
I'm paying 50 bucks for it

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
There'll be an Uber sale soon enough

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Oh, there was more to that email

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Yeah, Rob, geez

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
PS, on a side note

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
I just finished Brothers A Tale of Two Sons earlier this week

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
If you've not played this game, pour yourself a nice glass of wine

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Sit down and prepare to play

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
One of the most beautiful games you will ever play

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
It is three hours of an amazing score

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Gorgeous graphics

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
And one hell of a memorable story

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Congrats, Loki, on the new edition

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
And that comes from Travis

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Not our Travis D, but a Travis H

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
The same one that we answered on Google earlier, right?

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Yes

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Thank you for the email, Travis, appreciate it

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
And another recommendation

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
For Brother A Tale of Two Sons

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Yeah, but oddly enough

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
His name just like sent a song

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
Sailing through my head

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Because for the moment I first read his name

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
I actually read Trevor

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
So now I have the magical Trevor song stuck in my head

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
So thank you, Travis

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Alright, thank you to all our emailers

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
Mailbag at orangesontrated.com

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
This is the place to send your thoughts for a future episode

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Alright, in the meantime

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
We got to get to our FUs of the Week

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Let's do it

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Why do we do the FUs of the Week?

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
Because we're mad and stuff

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
This is bad

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
This is justice

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
This is punishment

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
This is fucked up

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
FU to free pastries that I can't eat

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
That's it

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
It's tragic

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
It is tragic

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Because I'm being a good girl

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
My FU goes to not knowing when to say when

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Jason

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
I don't know

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
I don't know

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I don't know

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Jason

02:42:53.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Is this the part where I kill the pity party by saying that because San Francisco is kind of sort of vacation for me

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
For a month vacation

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
Since it's vacation for me I relax my diet a little bit

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
And then I'm gonna do this kind of stuff

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Be more serious about this stuff when I get back home

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
No, FU to being sick

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:15.000
It actually impacted this week a hell of a lot harder

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.000
This week was gonna be really important to me

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
And it still was a lot of shit

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
A lot of productive shit happened

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:29.000
But I had a really bad feeling about it going into Friday

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:37.000
I was having trouble staying awake during the day every single day this week

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:42.000
And then me and a bunch of coworkers go out for a nice time on Thursday night

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
And I get back into my hotel room

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
I'm more or less fine

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Friday hits and I'm just destroyed

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:52.000
And so were about 20 other coworkers of mine

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000
Probably even more than that that I haven't seen or talked to to actually know the final numbers

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
FU to being sick

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
FU to being miserable

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000
FU to the kind of sickness that doesn't let you sleep laying down

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Sitting up to sleep does not work so well

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Thankfully I'm basically over it

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:12.000
FU to somebody else who may have gotten me sick

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Maybe, not really

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
There was another one

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.000
I've said this probably for the last two to three weeks

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
FU to sleep schedules

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:25.000
I'm gonna be up all night tonight of my own doing because I'm like that

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Finishing off 536 because I don't want to get in a rut of being behind YouTube videos

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:38.000
FU to having to catch up and having to sleep and having obligations and everything else

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Sorry to hear you, well I was sick too

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
I should have given a nephew to being sick myself

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
But luckily it didn't last long

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
That's the good news

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Basically better yesterday and then today I woke up

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:54.000
I felt pretty damn good this morning

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
And that's the best part about being sick

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:00.000
Even though I couldn't do too terribly much to recover

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.000
As soon as I did, oh my god, it was so rejuvenating

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
That's all one word, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000
But not just yet, we're gonna first do just a couple more stories here for you

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:20.000
Before we open that up

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Bethesda has announced last Thursday the members of the VoiceOver cast

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:28.000
That will be working on The Elder Scrolls Online

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:32.000
Which is due to come out three days after April Fool's Day

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Why did I read it that way? I don't know

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:35.000
I felt like it

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
Everybody knows what day April Fool's Day is

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
And if you don't, well

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:42.000
You'll find out what, you'll find out when it happens

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:45.000
The cast members as announced

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:48.000
I'm just gonna go, I'll do it all

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
John Cleese as Cadwell

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.000
The cheery and endearingly mad lost soul who is not afraid of anyone

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Bill Nighy, High King Emmerich

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.000
A merchant prince whose determination won him the throne

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:04.000
Kate Beckinsale, Queen Iryn

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Leader of the Ald...

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:08.000
Man, I'm very good at pronouncing these, aren't I?

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Leader of the Aldmeri

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:13.000
There's some real garbage words in The Elder Scrolls

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
They're classical

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Leader of the Aldmeri Dominion and Queen of the High Elves

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Alfred Molina as Abner Tharn

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:26.000
A wily old wizard who is head of the Empire's Elder Council

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Linda Carter as Azura

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:33.000
The Daedric Princess from Skyrim who is a popular part of the lore

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
Fuck yes Wonder Woman

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
These are, these are, these are

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
A celebrity cast exactly as they said

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
Michael Gambon, The Prophet

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:44.000
A blind man who guides the player through their journey

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Can we talk about this?

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
I get it, mystical history and all that kind of shit

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
But a blind man who guides the player through their journey

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Come on!

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:55.000
Sorry

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
I don't understand, what's the...

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
A blind man who guides people

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
Well, why not?

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I'm in one of those moods

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Malcolm McDowell as

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.000
You think it's fine? What about, like you see the blind fighters

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:14.000
Yeah, it's possible

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
There's the stories, people, echolocation

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
I've even heard of blind people riding a bike

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
I get it, I don't know

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
We've got blind people who listen to the show

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
And do the video game

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:28.000
Like the crazy video game clears

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Like on Killer Instinct and stuff

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
I'm trying to think of the games that are out there

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Where they do everything

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
It's so impressive

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
Okay, I'm being an idiot, I accept that argument

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
I don't know, something about these descriptions

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
Something about these descriptions

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
The way they worded it

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
The way they worded it

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
They worded it, they got to you

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
Malcolm McDowell as

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
The Daedric God who schemes to

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
Enslave the mortals of Tamriel

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Some extras

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Peter Stomer

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
The Skulled King, a monarch who led his people

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Into an unlikely alliance

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Jim Ward as

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
A renegade high elf wizard

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Exiled from the realm for raising the dead

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Jennifer Hale as

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
A Nord high giant who

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
Along with the prophet, aids the player

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Michael Richardson, Sai Sahan

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
A noble martial artist and

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Master swordsman

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
Getting it, I don't care what it is

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
This is a pretty amazing cast

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
And then the mosaic of all of the actors

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
And actresses, voice actors and actresses

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
At the bottom, even if you don't recognize the names

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
You're gonna recognize these faces

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Good for them, Bethesda

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Fucking awesome work, thank you

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Akuma JP is talking about

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
You see it in almost all Chinese movies

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
What's wrong?

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Yeah, it was

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Hold on, cause you got support here in the chat

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
SSG100Matt says, I think Jason just feels the notion

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Of a blind prophet leading someone is cliche

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
And overused

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
These are all completely valid

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
I

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Distilled into its simplest

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
Form, it seems hokey

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Predictable and typical

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
But that's also what makes it the best possible

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
Thing, because the fact that without sight

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
You can do anything of this nature is

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Absolutely stupendous and

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
Amazing of the individual

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
You're all correct, thank you

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
It's true

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
A white flag, I surrender

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
I surrender

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
Alright

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Well, one thing

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
We need to wrap up the show cause we're dying over here

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
One thing we can all agree on

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Is that the Super Nintendo is rad

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
And Super Nintendo is still having

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
Games made for it, which is pretty cool

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Super Fighter Team

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
Is a retro publisher

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
And they are shipping a Super Nintendo

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Run and gun platformer named

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Nightmare Busters

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
And if you pre-order the game you will be

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
Seeing this shipped to your house very very soon

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
This game was originally supposed to launch

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
In 1994

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
You thought Duke Nukem

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Forever had a long development

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
Two decades in the making

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
That's quite a bankroll

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
No more Duke Nukem jokes

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
Anyhow, it never happened

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
And yeah, a completed version

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
Was discovered years later

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
And Super Fighter Team started taking the pre-orders

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
Of the cartridge

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
If you want it, it'll cost you just $70

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Plus shipping

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
How many years is $70?

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
Well, keep in mind that if you inflate the cost

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Of what the cartridge used to cost back in the day

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
It was about $70 in today's money

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
It's very strange, I don't remember

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
I still have some very beat up

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
SNES boxes

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
I don't really remember the cost

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
A new SNES game

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Probably because my mom and dad bought it

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
But that was my age

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
When I had my SNES

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
Oh, when Street Fighter 2

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
And Mortal Kombat with those complex

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Chipsets that were in them

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
They were like $69 or even

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
I think it might have been $79

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
I remember exactly how much the killer instinct

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Cost when I got it

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
It was exactly $60

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
I got it at Montgomery Ward

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
If that doesn't age it

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Didn't Phantasy Star IV on the Genesis

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Cost like $99 or something

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Like really expensive?

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
I don't know that it was that much, was it?

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
I don't know, for some reason my mind goes

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Tigerclaw, look it up for us

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Every once in a while I just hear

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
These figures and it's

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
It's outrageous by today's

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Standards, yet it seems somewhat

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Expected and also you account

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
For the fact that cartridges aren't in mass

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Production, which means they're more expensive

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
To produce

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
It's a strange conflict of trying to

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
Figure out where exactly

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
My mind is in regard to

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
How appropriate this cost is

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
But it looks fun, looks like a fun game

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Good on them

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
It's open now, 1877 Game OLR

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
If you want to give us a call and talk about any of tonight's topics

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
Or anything else we might have discussed tonight

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Please go ahead and give us a

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
Call, it is the show after all

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Where every gamer has a voice

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
Let's see

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
I'm going to try and pull up any tweets

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
I didn't see any earlier though

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Remember how I said I was going to save an

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Article for the end of the show?

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
Oh yeah, I do

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Gee, thanks

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
In my defense

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
Two days away from being sick

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
I'm not at 100% yet, not that I remember

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Thought you were going to help to bridge things together

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
Alright

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Let's go to the phones

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
Because we do have a call coming in, hooray

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
It's DJ Ronimaz, how is everybody in the studio today?

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Hey good, good to hear from you buddy, what's up?

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
We are all equally recovering

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
I feel that

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
I feel your pain

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
I just finished rebuilding my entire machine after my hard drive crash

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
Late last night

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Oh

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Yuck

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
But it's okay, all my important data

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Including the porn, was saved

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Yay

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
Okay

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
I got a couple of things I want to get off my chest

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
Then I'm going to get up on out here and let other people call in

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Fair enough

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Now, I was trying to call in last week

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
And get in this whole Wii U

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Debate and debacle

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
And

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Granted, the Wii U is

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
Not a disaster

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
According to what some people are saying

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Because people forget

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
For every console that Nintendo sells

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
They make a profit

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Compared to other manufacturers

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
In Microsoft, they take a loss

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
So whether people think that Wii U

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
Is an abysmal failure

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Nintendo is still laughing all the way to the bank

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
I thought that wasn't true anymore after they did the $50 price cut

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
I could be wrong

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
Well, maybe after the initial

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
$50 price cut

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
But then as parts get a little bit cheaper

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
I mean, in the beginning they were losing money

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Off the 3DS when they did the initial price cut

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
But now

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
They're making profits off the 3DS

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Because

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Parts become cheaper, make your money back

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Alright, I'm with you

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
So I am saying

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
When Nintendo gets their next console out

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
It's gotta have that hardware power

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Of what's out there now

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
They can't be like

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Skimming on the cheap and be like

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Well, we'll be the budget console

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
For everybody

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Well, wait a second

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
If they match the current generation by the time the new one rolls around

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
What will that have bought them?

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Well, what I mean is they need to

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
Not match, but make it to the next level

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
I mean, you see what I'm saying?

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
They have to add a little bit of hardware prowess

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
To make them step above everybody else

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
That's what I'm saying

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
Got it

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Alright, fair enough

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
We've got to come in our chat room

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
AkumaJP says, I'm so sick of this topic

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Why do we keep debating the Nintendo stuff into the ground?

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Even when people

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Like, love to get

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
People out there that really get pleasure out of just

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Kicking Nintendo when they're down, I think, sometimes

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
People like to see the giants fall

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
I guess

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Very much

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Well, why don't you tell us more about that porn collection

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Well, there is a reason why I had to go get a

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
3TB hard drive

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Any cons coming up that you're getting excited for?

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
Yes, I will be

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
Going to Katsukan next month

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
And I will be debuting

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
Dr. Luigi

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Oh god, Katsukan, oh man

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Man, it was years ago when I went to Katsukan

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
I had such a good time though

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Yes, and somehow, mysteriously, the picture of you as the

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Black Mage disappeared

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
So I have to go digging for it

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Oh no

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Well, it's probably for the best, let's be real

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
I've got to work on a cosplay for Dragon Con

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
Because Travis Donovan is fully expecting

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
That I'm going full on cosplay this year

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
I've got to figure that whole mess out

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
I don't know what I'm going to do

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
I'm going to lose a little weight first

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
It will determine if I'm going to do sexy cosplay or not

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
You need to do Joker

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
Joker? Oh, I was like

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
My mind went to Batman Joker

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
Oh, Joker from Mass Effect

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Yeah, I guess that would be pretty mean

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
We can get you the SR2 hat

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
That might be something

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Especially when Donovan and Jenna

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
Do the whole Miranda and Shepard thing

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
I guess the Joker would fit right in with that crowd

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
So, why not

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
Awesome

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
I said hi

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
Will do

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG Network

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
Listen in, kids

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
It's what's good

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
For LG, you know

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
Alright, take care, buddy

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
Alright, take care

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
1877 Game OLR

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
If you want to give us a call

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
And comment on whatever's been going on in the news

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Bobby Blackwolf, I forgot, had sent me

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Some messages earlier saying I should

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
And I thought this was really funny

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
He noticed that earlier in the show

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
Guitar Hero 3

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
Was trending on Twitter

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Isn't that weird? Guitar Hero 3 is years old

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Yeah, it's depressing

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
The reason why

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Because Metallica just played

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
One at the Grammys

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
And all the little kids were going

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Hey, this is from Guitar Hero 3

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
Even though

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
It's like one of the biggest

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Facepalm right now

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
Is like of epic proportions

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
Oh no

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
You're talking about songs that like

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Defined the

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
No

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
No, no

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
It's sad

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
But it's hilarious at the same time

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
Do I need to get the

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
I mean, at the same time, that's not a surprise

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
And

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
It's great that they're saying

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Guitar Hero 3 specifically

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
I don't know if it was on that, but

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
I'm surprised you could unstick your hand

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
From your face with that

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Alright, I gotta go to the phones

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Quickly, quickly

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Hold on, hold on

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
Just one thing

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
You be quiet, I hung up

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
One thing that has to be said

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Is that

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
If anyone ever doubts that

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Metal music isn't

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
Music music

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
You need to listen to that whole fucking Metallica album

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
It's black album, isn't it?

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
No, I don't

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Was one all black? Oh, Ride the Lightning

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
Alright, Zaku's calling back

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Are we ready for Zaku this time?

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
Yes, it's all working

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Alright, here we go

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Hi Zaku

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
How's it going?

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
Because I'm too lazy to turn on my PC at night

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
That's fine, what's up buddy?

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Ah, nothing much

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Just kicking back

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
What is that you're playing over there?

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Is that Forza?

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
No, Gran Turismo

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Oh, Gran Turismo, okay

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
What's up?

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
Ah, nothing much

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Just, you know, as I said

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Still playing, getting through my PS3 as usual

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
But, other than that

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
I managed to pick myself up a

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Pretty spiffy racing wheel that I'm gonna pick up tomorrow

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
From eBay

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
Yeah

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
So, figured I may as well get used to

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
Like, the last throws of playing

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
On a controller

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
But other than that, it's like

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
I'm still kind of like

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Still kind of shocked

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
That the patent office

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
Would go so far as to give

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
A single company the trademark

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
For an entire word

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000
That's like giving Crayola the patent

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
Or the trademark for the color blue

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
I mean, for King

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
To get that much, wield that much power

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
You know there's gonna be other people

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:28.000
Obviously Hasbro

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:30.000
Or anyone who's already

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Had products with the word candy on it

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
In the past and want to target mobile

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
Or pretty much

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
They're pretty much in the crosshairs

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Because once they do, they'll get the C&D's immediately

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
Well, I would actually like to see

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
I think Hasbro would fight that

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:46.000
And I would actually kind of like to see that happen

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000
I think a lot of us would be

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:50.000
Rooting for that kind of throwdown to happen

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:52.000
Well, Dark Soccer had joked

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:54.000
During Bobby Black Wolf's show earlier

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:56.000
That Disney should do a game based on King Candy

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.000
I like your macross shirt by the way

02:59:58.000 --> 03:00:00.000
From Wreck it Ralph

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Doing a King Candy game

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:04.000
And I was like, yes, Disney should do that

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:06.000
Because Disney's legal team

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000
Is a force to be reckoned with

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000
And that would be a fun little court case

03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:12.000
To watch go down

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
But who's hand

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
King ended up greasing

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000
In the patent office?

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
There has to have been some sort of

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Backroom deal

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:24.000
Of sorts

03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000
Definitely a little bit of hand skin ball

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:28.000
Going on over there at the patent office

03:00:28.000 --> 03:00:30.000
Thanks Ralph

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
There's no way

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
You would be able to get

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:36.000
The trademark for a single word

03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:38.000
That's so common in

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:40.000
Universal

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:42.000
Well

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.000
Even English

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
There's no way you would have done that

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:48.000
Without having to grease someone's palm over there

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Well, Bethesda

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
Bethesda trademarked the word

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:54.000
There went my dreams

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000
Of making the boob scrolls

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:58.000
But still it's like

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:00.000
Candy

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:02.000
Which is something that it's really

03:01:02.000 --> 03:01:04.000
Really delicious honestly

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.000
Not just delicious

03:01:06.000 --> 03:01:08.000
It's a noun

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:10.000
Of something that's already common

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:12.000
How could you

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Trademark something

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:16.000
That is so ubiquitous

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:18.000
That even candy makers

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:20.000
Are in danger because if they try

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:22.000
To promote their

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.000
They try to create a promotional app

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
The technical answer

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:28.000
The literal reason why that's allowed

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:30.000
Is that they don't have carte blanche

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
On anything that has the word candy

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
They have carte blanche on video games

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
And interactive media

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:38.000
That uses the word candy or saga

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:40.000
Well there goes

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:42.000
Any hopes for Hershey's

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:44.000
Doing promotional games on mobile

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:46.000
I'm gonna ask the real tough

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.000
Questions here at Orange Lounge Radio

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:50.000
How did they not

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
Get the trademark on the word crush

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
Why are we not hearing about the word crush

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.000
Because that makes me think if that's the unsaid thing

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Because you know they tried it

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
So why are we not hearing about them getting the trademark

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:02.000
On the word crush

03:02:02.000 --> 03:02:04.000
I really hope it's because of grape crush

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
I really hope

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.000
The people that made crush soda were like nope

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000
More of an orange person myself

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:12.000
But I digress

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:14.000
Isn't crush already

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:16.000
Not already a trademark

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
So it kind of conflicts

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
So I think they would have to give them candy

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Because no one else has trademarked

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Or let alone used it as a brand

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
As a single word

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
I mean it's getting to that point

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
It's almost bizarre

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
That they gave them

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Something like that

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
That could easily be invalidated

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
As long as

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
They try to go after the

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
Wrong entity

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
Like Disney

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:48.000
But it goes to show that

03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.000
Our patent system

03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:52.000
Is completely broken

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.000
It's where you can

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
I mean the point is that

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:58.000
If you have software patents

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.000
And then you have trolls going after you

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:02.000
For having certain features that are

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Obiguous to all other

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Mobile phone platforms

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Like barcode scanning

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Or even sending

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:12.000
Communications like network calls

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
Someone must have

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:16.000
You know that process

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.000
Even sending secure calls

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.000
Zaku

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Since I'm asking the tough questions here tonight

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:24.000
How do we fix it?

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:26.000
We all sit here and say it's broken

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000
How do we fix it?

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Well I mean this is something that Congress would have to

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
Enact laws for

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:34.000
But it's not

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.000
The same one that got us in

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Is going to get us right back out

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
Out of the frying pan

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
And into the fryer

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
It's gotten paid for by

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Special interests

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
So there will be people, there will be certain entities

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:50.000
Certain software companies that wouldn't want

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:52.000
The status quo to change

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.000
It would benefit from having

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:56.000
To patent software

03:03:56.000 --> 03:03:58.000
Ideas

03:03:58.000 --> 03:04:00.000
Instead of the whole

03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:02.000
Instead of actually building something

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
Or creating a single idea

03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:06.000
That can be patented as opposed to actually

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
Creating the code

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000
Alright Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show

03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:12.000
It is broken

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:14.000
And I'm gonna complain some more

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:16.000
Take care buddy

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000
Have fun with your steering wheel

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:20.000
All new way to play

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:22.000
Take care buddy

03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:24.000
I think that it's gonna do it for calls tonight

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:26.000
Cause we're well past 9 o'clock

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
Here and we only gotta work tomorrow

03:04:28.000 --> 03:04:30.000
So we're gonna

03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.000
Quickly I think I saw a tweet come in here

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.000
At the last moment

03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:36.000
It was a story I wanted to address

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:38.000
And I should have

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.000
Mentioned it earlier in the show but I didn't

03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000
Cause you know

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
I was too busy ranting about something

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
When I said I prefer Orange Crush

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
I was actually talking about the R.A.M. song

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
Playing at drums on Rock Band

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
Also

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
I was thinking about

03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:56.000
Pineapple Crush was really

03:04:56.000 --> 03:04:58.000
Actually the superior brand of Crush

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Pineapple Crush was amazing

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
We do have a couple quick tweets here

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
Let me get to it

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
Tigerclaw tweeting us saying

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
So we brought them up earlier in the show

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
Because they're gonna have that online

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
The subscription pass that works for all their game

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
But it's gonna come at the cost

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
Of Free Realms

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:18.000
Closing down

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
That game was pretty shitty anyway

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
It's on the PS3, it's awful

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
Star Wars Clone Wars Adventures

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
Vanguard Saga of Heroes

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
And Wizardry Online

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
All shutting down

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
Most of them on March 31st

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
But Wizardry will be last to close

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
On July 31st

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
Rest in peace

03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:40.000
SSG100Matt says

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
What?

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Oh yeah there was something about this

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
They conspired to sell

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
Counterfeit game packs for the UltraCade

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
Unit

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
It also involved global VR

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
And MAME developers

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
He reached a plea deal with the state of California

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
And the sentencing has happened

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
41 months in prison

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
How about that

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
I don't even remember why we were so mad at him

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
In the first place

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
Because they were replacing our legit old machines

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
And they were making people pay for MAME

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
I just want to give a shout out though

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
Because we had some nice people pimping our stuff tonight

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
So I just want to give a nice shout out

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
To some people that were pimping our stuff tonight

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
Pixel Pacas

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
Said not interested in watching the Grammys

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
Listen to the video game podcast OLR

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
Thank you Pixel Pacas

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
That was quite kind

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
It was very kind, so did Koopa Club

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
Said almost the same thing, forget the Grammys and listen to

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
OLR Live instead, though if the Grammys

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Were like best grandma awards

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
Then we totally watch it

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
You know what though, I do have to say

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
And thank you to Tumblr for keeping me in the loop

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
Daft Punk

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
Did they win stuff?

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
Best Album

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Oh did they win Best Album?

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
Good for them

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
I know they were nominated

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
They won 4 Grammys and

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
Paul McCartney won a couple

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
Actually

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
There was an amazing tweet earlier

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
That can sum up my thoughts on Macklemore

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
Perfectly

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
This is my personal opinion

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
What was the retweet?

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
I had retweeted a user named Randall Chris

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
Macklemore dropping

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
The actual queer musician from

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
Same Love so Madonna can

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
Sing the hook instead is so comically

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000
Appropriate

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
That sums up my thoughts exactly

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
Thank you

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Anyhow

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
That's gonna do it for

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
Another show here at

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
Orange Lounge Radio, thank you guys for downloading the show

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
And checking it out, really appreciate it

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
And I do say this at the end of every show, if you liked what you heard

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
All we ask, help grow

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
Our family, I talked to her a little

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Earlier in the email segment about we are an independent podcast

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
We do have to really work hard for the

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
Exposure we do get, word of mouth is

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
So valuable, please

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
Consider leaving us a nice review in

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
iTunes or Stitcher, tell a friend

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
Or five about the show, help spread the word

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
It really really helps and it has

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
Kept us going for the past 12 years

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
We live and love

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
Pay your tribute

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
Jason

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Thank you again for being here

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
As you have been

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
Really appreciate it, thank you for stepping up into

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
A full blown host role tonight

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
I did reasonably well

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
Other than completely resetting

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
My brain in part B and thinking

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
Oh shit, I was supposed to read these articles

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
Something's happened

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
To be fair, I called you Loki

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
At one point

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
That reset happened

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
Immediately after you called me Loki

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
It happens to the best of us

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
It all works out

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000
Stay healthy folks

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000
Our one listener

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000
Stay healthy, keep it together

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
Drink your orange juice

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
Or whatever

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
That is what I was doing all day yesterday and today

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000
My final thought tonight is

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000
I'm gonna have to shave this beard in a couple weeks

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
And it's gonna be sad

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000
You need to shave your beard

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
You just need to trim buddy

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
I need to shave the beard

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000
That's the problem

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
You need to shave something fierce

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
Alright, and last but not least

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
It's winter, I ain't gotta shave shit

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
That's it guys, thank you so much for downloading

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000

Of the year, Puppy Bowl Sunday

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
We'll be back next week to talk about

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:38.000
Video games and probably

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
Say aww and shucks at those

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
Cute puppies and kittens

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
