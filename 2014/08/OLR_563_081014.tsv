7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, Sierra Entertainment, the legendary 90s adventure game comedy, sprung back to life.
18000	21000	No longer a redirect to Activision's website, the future is bright above ground.
21000	27000	Join us for a trip down memory lane as we bring you more news from the week of gaming on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live on this August the 10th, 2014 with the 563rd episode of our show.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts here to talk with you about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with you guys.
50000	57000	Live at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show.
57000	60000	And if you are listening live, I encourage you to join chat and have your voices heard.
60000	67000	Live.vognetwork.com. And you will hear such interesting things such as Seattle in chat saying,
67000	71000	And my sister stole my only USB 3.0 cable.
71000	78000	Well, you know what, if we're going to learn something tonight about the way America works, you clearly need to sue her.
78000	82000	You're going to need to sue her to get that cable back. We'll get into more about that in a little while.
82000	89000	Joining me here in studio, always here to lend their voices to the week in news and let you know what they think.
89000	94000	And this woman certainly never has a shortage of opinions. Say hello to Dark Soccer, Jamie Sommers.
94000	97000	I have an opinion about that slice of pizza I just ate.
97000	98000	Yes.
98000	102000	It was delicious but my stomach hates me now because I got sick from the big black cock yesterday.
102000	107000	What? What? What? Dan and I went to...
107000	112000	Right now, somebody's editing that as a little clip for a future OLR soundboard.
112000	115000	She went to the Castro and put a big black cock in her mouth.
115000	117000	There's photographic evidence.
117000	118000	Thanks, Techmaster Loki.
118000	119000	Wait, what?
119000	120000	There's photographic evidence.
120000	121000	OK.
121000	122000	We went to visit Grandpa.
122000	124000	For all the... OK.
124000	128000	There's some people who are listening to this show for the first time that are like,
128000	132000	What the hell are these people on? I thought this was a video game show.
132000	137000	OK, first off, Grandpa from Hoard House, another podcast that I do about all things online gaming but never too seriously,
137000	140000	lives in the Castro, right? Or right above the Castro.
140000	143000	Above it. He hovers over the Castro like the queen.
143000	144000	To judge people.
144000	145000	To judge.
145000	147000	He just sits out on his balcony and judges.
147000	150000	Him and his wife, Lady Victoria, are out on the balcony.
150000	154000	By the way, Grandpa's gayer than Christmas. It's not really his wife, but that's what we all call her.
154000	157000	Lady Victoria, they judge everybody out in the Castro. That's what they do.
157000	158000	Oh, yes. All our subject.
158000	161000	Now, you went to go be judged this weekend.
161000	162000	No.
162000	163000	Among other things.
163000	165000	I went to participate in the judgment.
165000	170000	So you went down into the Castro and you actually bought a penis shaped, what, cookie?
170000	171000	Macaroon.
171000	172000	Macaroon.
172000	176000	Because I love the macaroons at Hot Cookie.
176000	180000	And I don't even care, y'all. I'm going to give Hot Cookie a shout out right now.
180000	184000	Thank you for making macaroons that were so delicious I threw up.
184000	185000	Okay.
185000	190000	We were already full from eating at Harvey's, which really, really good food.
190000	196000	But I went and had to shove because they would put whipped cream on it if I started eating it now.
196000	203000	So I had a big chocolate covered macaroon dick with whipped cream on the tip.
203000	204000	Only in the Castro.
204000	206000	Only in the Castro.
206000	208000	And how was it, our soccer?
208000	210000	Oh, it was freaking amazing.
210000	213000	Better than the real thing.
214000	215000	Amazing.
215000	218000	I cannot believe our chat is not responding to this whatsoever.
218000	219000	Did the internet die?
219000	220000	Ronchon did.
220000	221000	Or are they all in shock?
221000	222000	I don't know.
222000	223000	Ronchon is in shock.
223000	224000	Look at his face.
224000	225000	Look at that.
225000	226000	All right.
226000	231000	But it was totally delicious except I think I might have already had a bit of something going on wrong with my stomach.
231000	236000	Because it was like we got home after a long, long visit and everything.
236000	240000	And I laid down for about 15 minutes and all of a sudden my stomach's like, nope.
240000	243000	You got to be careful what you eat in this day and age.
243000	245000	I mean, we were just talking before the show with Shane.
245000	247000	Yeah, but that was Jim Boys and that's to be expected.
249000	250000	All right.
250000	251000	Anyway.
251000	252000	Jim Boys is...
252000	253000	Garbage.
253000	254000	Yes, it's garbage.
254000	255000	Thank you.
255000	256000	Okay.
256000	257000	Sometimes it's delicious garbage.
257000	258000	I like it.
258000	259000	I like it.
259000	261000	But it is not fit for human consumption and your body will let you know.
261000	262000	Watch out.
262000	263000	Watch out.
263000	266000	Because they're going to contact the show because they found Shane's Twitter.
267000	269000	When he wrote, like, he didn't even put an at sign or a hashtag.
269000	272000	He just mentioned and they were like, what's wrong?
272000	274000	All right, Jim Boys, this is your chance to prove us wrong.
274000	278000	By cooking us some food that does not make me sit in the bathroom for two hours.
278000	280000	I'll eat whatever she does.
280000	281000	I love Jim Boys.
281000	283000	I've never had a problem with Jim Boys.
283000	285000	Anyway, enough local eatery talk.
285000	287000	It's because your insides are made out of cast iron.
287000	290000	How are you, Tech Master Loki?
290000	291000	Full.
291000	295000	But, you know, I should have stopped at Jim Boys now that I think I had the time to do that.
295000	302000	I was going to actually almost stop it because we went there earlier this week at Dicky's Barbecue.
302000	304000	They have fried okra.
304000	307000	They have pretty awesome barbecue.
307000	311000	I thought it was just like this cheapo chain thing, but it's actually really good.
311000	312000	Really good.
312000	314000	It's legit southern food.
314000	316000	You're going to make all the listeners hungry, you guys.
316000	319000	Go get us tacos while you're at it, listeners.
319000	321000	I had like a beef brisket sandwich yesterday.
321000	322000	It was awesome.
322000	324000	But yeah, I almost stopped there, but I didn't.
324000	330000	Instead I went to Round Table and got pizza, but I got pan pizza, and so it's way more filling.
330000	333000	What kind of show is this?
333000	336000	Is it a game show or a food show?
336000	338000	We'll get to the games.
338000	340000	It's a three hour show.
340000	345000	Quickly, how's Unity programming going to try and bring this to games a little bit?
345000	347000	How's your programming adventures going?
347000	348000	Good, actually.
348000	356000	I think I'm close to finished with fixing my editor because I had tweaked some stuff,
356000	360000	and I wanted to do something differently, and then it got way too complicated,
360000	362000	and then I dialed it back.
362000	365000	Now I think I've gotten it to the point where everything should be okay.
365000	373000	I put my palette that I was using into a script now so that I don't have to actually have a palette for it,
373000	377000	and I can add stuff, custom colors if I want to on the fly.
378000	380000	Yeah, so I'm just finishing that up.
380000	385000	Hopefully going to have that done this week, and I can get back to kind of where I stopped before.
388000	389000	What else?
389000	391000	That was pretty much it, actually.
391000	395000	I've been still trying to figure out a way to do ambient occlusion,
395000	399000	but I just don't think it's possible with Unity free.
399000	404000	I think you really need to have that registered version, or I'm sorry, the pro version,
404000	407000	which is $1500 that I don't have.
407000	412000	I thought, well, I'm sure they've got their way of doing it.
412000	415000	Why can't I just look up a way to do it?
415000	419000	How would you do it outside of Unity and just apply that to Unity?
419000	427000	It just doesn't work because they have these things for graphics cards like texture buffers.
427000	431000	Instead of writing to the screen, you can write to a texture file,
431000	437000	and then you take that texture file and do something with it, like capturing the screen or something like that.
437000	444000	Say you want to do a blur, you'd capture the screen, and then you would apply a blur to it,
444000	448000	and then you'd put that back on the screen again.
448000	455000	I don't have that access to that buffer in Unity free, so there's not really a way to do that.
455000	458000	Or if there is a way to do that, it's incredibly slow. It just wouldn't work.
458000	461000	I've seen you out there trying to get help on Twitter and stuff, though.
461000	465000	I know I see Tim sometimes answer some of your questions, and I'm sure you have other people.
465000	468000	Just because a lot of times I don't know what I'm talking about.
468000	474000	I want it to look like this, but I don't know what that is, so I don't know what questions to ask.
474000	480000	Even earlier this week, I ended up trying to get depth textures to work.
480000	486000	I'm like, I don't even need that. I don't know. It just got way too complicated.
486000	493000	So now I'm just keeping it as simple as possible, just vertex colors, and I'll figure the rest out.
493000	497000	Well, best of luck. We look forward to it.
497000	501000	Didn't we get something in the mailbag with music or something? I never got that forwarded to me.
501000	503000	I thought so.
503000	507000	If it did get forwarded, it might have gotten lost in the stacks of junk mail that I get.
507000	510000	I'll look it up again and send it over to you.
510000	514000	Meanwhile, letting the chat room drive the show a little bit over at live.vognetwork.com.
514000	517000	I see a lot of people talking about the big geek movies in theaters right now.
517000	522000	Guardians of the Galaxy, obviously a big one. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles opened this past weekend.
522000	526000	You guys, I never get out to movies anymore.
526000	533000	We had a screening for Ninja Turtles on Wednesday, but I couldn't go because of kids.
533000	535000	Have you seen Guardians?
535000	537000	No, I really want to see it.
537000	539000	I want to see them both.
539000	541000	I want to sneak out at some point and do that.
541000	543000	I thought you and Dan went to go see Guardians.
543000	545000	No, Dan went to see it without me.
545000	546000	What a punk.
546000	548000	Because I was working.
548000	551000	Hi, I have to earn money so that you can go see movies.
551000	554000	Okay, so wow, we're all on cool. We didn't see.
554000	556000	Shane's in the other room. Shane, didn't you see Guardians?
556000	557000	Yeah.
557000	558000	Did you like it?
558000	560000	Everything, but why don't we just get up?
560000	562000	Yeah, okay.
562000	564000	Shane's like, everything, but why don't we just get up?
564000	566000	Shane had to get up so he can come talk.
566000	569000	I know, I'm getting him away from his Pokemon.
570000	572000	Somebody didn't have a game tie-in with that.
572000	575000	I mean, they had infinity, but yeah.
575000	577000	It's not the same thing. Make sure that's on.
577000	578000	Is it picking me up?
578000	579000	We can hear you just fine.
579000	580000	Okay, so Guardians of the Galaxy.
580000	581000	Yeah, I saw it.
581000	582000	How was it?
582000	586000	It was good, except for the part after the credits.
586000	588000	Oh, I actually read a spoiler on that. I won't say anymore.
588000	589000	Why? I'll say it.
589000	590000	No, don't you dare.
590000	592000	It's been out for like two weeks.
592000	593000	No, no, no, don't. That's not cool.
593000	596000	It's garbage. You don't need to stay for the end.
596000	598000	Just leave when the credits start. You're not going to miss anything.
598000	600000	For the first time ever in a Marvel movie.
600000	603000	But you didn't see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
603000	604000	No, I refuse to see that.
604000	605000	Why?
605000	606000	That is terrible looking.
606000	608000	Because, like, from what I read...
608000	612000	Everything I've seen on Twitter from TigerClaws, like, 10 of 10, A+, 100%.
612000	614000	Okay, so he said all three of those.
614000	615000	I think so.
615000	618000	Well, there's your three reviews from one person.
618000	621000	I am going to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because I've seen them all.
621000	625000	I will see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because, and I've said this before,
625000	627000	I'll see literally anything with Whoopi Goldberg in it.
627000	629000	She's in there? Poor her.
629000	632000	She plays the Chief. They changed the gender swap to Chief.
632000	634000	Her and Will Arnett I feel bad for.
634000	635000	Stop.
635000	637000	But, no, I heard, like, the Turtles...
637000	639000	It can't be worse than the one from the 90s. Come on.
639000	640000	No, no.
640000	641000	And the one from the 90s was really bad.
641000	642000	Which one?
642000	644000	The original. It was bad.
644000	645000	No.
645000	646000	We all loved it because we were kids.
646000	650000	No, it cannot. There's no way that the first two movies at least will be worse than this.
650000	653000	That third movie was garbage.
653000	655000	It's 90s charm, I guess. I don't know.
655000	659000	It wasn't terrible, but it was, I don't know, it was okay.
659000	662000	Granted, yeah, it's like, okay, Ninja Turtles 2.
662000	664000	Yeah, they had a rap scene in it and who cares.
664000	666000	That's what you do in a 90s movie.
666000	668000	The third movie had ancient Japan.
668000	670000	Yeah, and nobody liked that one.
670000	671000	I liked it.
671000	672000	Two people liked that one.
672000	673000	No.
673000	675000	That's why I'll like the new one.
675000	677000	I liked Ninja Turtles 3.
677000	683000	This is why the first one succeeded because it took part of the storyline from the first comic, the original comic,
684000	690000	yet blended it with what people expected to see with the less violent, more fun.
690000	699000	I've never realized this, but did you know that original Ninja Turtles movie was the highest grossing independent film of all time until Pulp Fiction came out in the mid-90s?
699000	700000	I never did. I didn't realize that.
700000	704000	And it was done by, I believe the animatronics were done by Jim Henson.
704000	705000	They were.
705000	709000	But he expressed that he was not happy with how it turned out because there was too much violence.
709000	710000	Yeah.
710000	717000	Which, here's the thing. I feel like just right now with the new Ninja Turtles movie, because I know they reference a lot of the stuff from the new cartoon,
717000	723000	and god, I don't even know how many different shows they have now with Ninja Turtles because I know the one on Netflix right now.
723000	728000	It's just like, it looks like fucking terrible. It's like live action or something. No.
728000	731000	Oh, that's the one that was on Fox then that has the girl turtle.
731000	732000	Yeah.
732000	734000	And they had a Power Ranger crossover.
734000	735000	That was weird.
735000	737000	I liked the CG movie, by the way.
738000	746000	But yeah, oh yeah. CG movie's awesome. But here's the thing. A lot of the stuff they're referencing, oh yeah, that's this version of Shredder.
746000	751000	I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? I don't even know what the hell you're referencing. Oh, it's part of the cartoon.
751000	758000	I'm like, well shit. I haven't, I'm not a little kid anymore. I haven't watched all this Nickelodeon stuff.
758000	760000	Taking it back to games a little bit here.
760000	762000	But I didn't get to finish.
762000	763000	Finish. Hurry.
763000	767000	Okay. I don't want to see it because A, I hear the turtles are only in about 40% of the movie.
767000	768000	Really?
768000	773000	Yeah. They only say Cowabunga once. And come on, that's a Ninja Turtles thing.
773000	783000	I am a little bit like, I heard there's no Casey Jones. I heard there's no Shredder in it, but not, I keep wanting to say Crain.
783000	786000	I keep wanting to say Crain, but I'm like, that's Metroid stupid.
786000	788000	Crain is not in this movie. You're right.
788000	790000	Okay. But Crain, thank you.
790000	796000	It focuses, I guess, mostly on April O'Neil. And apparently, I've never seen a movie with Megan Fox, but she can't carry it, I guess.
796000	798000	All right. All this stuff aside.
798000	800000	We're just going to get off topic in a minute anyway.
800000	805000	Going back to Guardians of the Galaxy, trying to bring it back to gaming. Would you play a video game based off of it?
805000	809000	No, because I didn't even like, I had no interest really in the movie, but I thought it'd be fun to see.
809000	815000	So those characters and Chris Pratt's acting really didn't do anything for me except for Groot.
815000	819000	And if there was a Groot game, maybe I'd just play as Groot.
819000	821000	Because you would have to have Rocket Raccoon with him.
821000	824000	I love Rocket Raccoon because I loved him in the comics.
824000	830000	I just, I didn't know that was Bradley Cooper until after the movie. I was like, that just sounded weird.
830000	837000	But to kind of bring it back still, you know, as definitely someone that has had a game already, but yet no movie.
837000	844000	Deadpool, the Deadpool movie, they're still trying to get some sort of like, hey, let's rally up on the internet.
844000	846000	That clip was awesome.
846000	850000	It was fucking awesome, okay? Let's get that clip clear.
850000	860000	Now, you know, they're trying to rally support for that movie. I don't understand why, you know, they can make like, I don't know, all these really terrible movies.
860000	870000	And yet, I mean, fuck, you know, there was a Daredevil and Elektra movie, yet, oh, we can't fucking make this really kickass Daredevil movie.
870000	876000	I, you know, I'm going to say something y'all aren't going to like me for, but it's how I feel. I don't want another goddamn comic book movie.
876000	883000	I don't want none of them. I don't want Deadpool. I don't want, I don't want any of them until, until I get my goddamn Wonder Woman movie.
883000	886000	Which we practically are anyway.
886000	891000	You and I both know that we would have huge reservations.
891000	895000	That's about the most we're going to get to one. Now, you know what I would rather see than a Wonder Woman movie?
895000	896000	What?
896000	897000	I want to see him as a Marvel movie.
897000	898000	Alright.
899000	901000	Because Carol Danvers could kick her ass.
901000	905000	Now, chatters are seeming to love this chat, so I guess we can entertain it here a little bit.
905000	908000	Tigerclaw is saying they greenlit the sequel to Ninja Turtles already.
908000	909000	Boo.
909000	913000	There's possibilities. There's possibilities. Casey Jones and Bebop and Rocksteady will be in the sequels.
913000	918000	As Jotunner Matt says, the original movies were campy, silly, and it held up in its time and it played off the cartoon.
918000	924000	My problem with the new movie is that it's forcing the campy feeling with big budget special effects and trying to piggyback on the nostalgia factor.
924000	926000	And the turtles are ugly. Let's just get that out of the way.
926000	930000	Rama says Casey Jones didn't show until much later in the comics.
930000	933000	Alright, speaking of games, try to get to games a little bit.
933000	939000	One little tiny thing, tiny, tiny thing. I want to see them do a turtle movie that's like the original comics. That would be awesome.
939000	940000	Super dark.
940000	942000	Super dark and bloody.
942000	950000	Switching topics here for just a minute. Before the show, quickly, you were talking about a new TV show that you're into that's kind of like a game.
950000	952000	Tell us about this TV show.
952000	953000	The Quest.
953000	955000	Okay, but most people are going to hear you say that.
955000	957000	How am I supposed to talk about the show if you interrupt me?
957000	963000	Because you're going to say reality TV show and everybody's going to be like, nope, nope, nope.
963000	966000	So make it nerdy. Go. What is it then?
966000	968000	It's an unreality TV show.
968000	970000	Tell people why they should care even though it's a reality show.
970000	975000	It is a reality show. First of all, with no price. So these contestants are competing for nothing.
976000	985000	And they are in a fictional fantasy world where they live in a castle and they are becoming paladins to save the kingdom from an evil force.
985000	990000	So as Rob put it, it's real life LARPing. Wait, is that redundant?
990000	992000	LARPing is a TV show.
992000	997000	Yeah, yeah. And it's really good and it had a plot twist at the end of the second episode.
997000	1002000	The first episode made me uncomfortable to watch for a little bit because it's really awkward.
1002000	1007000	It's filming people LARPing and then they add special effects in post-production and stuff, right?
1007000	1011000	I've only seen, only at the very end of each episode is there special effects.
1011000	1018000	Everything else is like actors and sets. And apparently there's going to be animatronic monsters too.
1018000	1023000	It's just interesting to me. This is from the same network that last year brought us.
1023000	1025000	Ah, whodunnit. That was so good.
1025000	1028000	Clue IRL where they made it look like people legit died.
1028000	1029000	Which was really good.
1029000	1034000	Contestants got voted off, or they didn't vote, but they lost. And when they lost the show or whatever, they got killed.
1034000	1035000	Yeah, it was awesome.
1035000	1038000	There'd be a whole special effects team that would make it look like they actually got murdered.
1038000	1042000	And then they'd have to investigate the bodies. That was cool too.
1042000	1044000	That's such a good show.
1044000	1050000	I got to hand it to ABC. Even though they never let their reality shows last more than one season, they always have the best.
1050000	1056000	The best reality shows. I understand when people are like, I don't like reality shows because I don't like Real Housewives.
1056000	1057000	Yeah, those aren't garbage.
1057000	1060000	But the stuff on ABC, like the mole, was awesome.
1060000	1062000	Just think of it as an elaborate game show.
1062000	1064000	It's just really what they are.
1064000	1068000	It's just an elaborate game show, and that's it. I mean, fuck.
1068000	1072000	It's just like the shit that they used to have on Nickelodeon stuff.
1072000	1074000	They weren't really raiding a temple, okay?
1074000	1079000	Yeah, those temple guards took those kids and never gave them back.
1081000	1084000	And these people on the show, they take it so seriously.
1084000	1088000	I think that's part of the reason why I get uncomfortable watching it, because I don't do anything like that.
1088000	1091000	I don't roleplay. I don't do Dungeons and Dragons or anything like that.
1091000	1096000	So it's very awkward to me to see these people get so into it.
1096000	1101000	But at the same time, there's been some really good heartwarming moments because of it on this show.
1101000	1104000	But now you heard that it's already coming back for a second season.
1104000	1107000	They are casting or have finished casting for the second season.
1107000	1112000	So in case it does come back, because they said they have at least 12 kingdoms or whatever.
1112000	1115000	So they said they already have 12 storylines that they can do.
1115000	1121000	If they're going to bring it back for a second season, I'm just going to nominate Dark Sakura to be on the show.
1121000	1126000	Because I think Dark Sakura would be great in a LARP on TV.
1126000	1132000	You know, I actually haven't LARPed since like 1997.
1132000	1135000	So what kind of competitions do they have on this show?
1135000	1140000	Because obviously, pretending who can pretend the best is not really good TV.
1140000	1143000	Oh my god, that was part of the heartwarming moment tonight.
1143000	1145000	I won't spoil it for people that will watch it.
1145000	1151000	But the first competition they had to do was they had to practice their...
1151000	1157000	I don't know, they had these big crossbows that they would load up like a bolt and then fire over a wall at enemy targets.
1157000	1162000	So one person on their team was overlooking the entire field to tell them where to point.
1162000	1164000	One person was the runner to get the arrows.
1164000	1170000	And the other person was the person that was moving the big bow and arrow machine and pulling it back and firing.
1170000	1173000	So that would be the first thing they did.
1173000	1177000	And then today they had a horseback competition where they were all in horseback.
1177000	1179000	And they had different stations they had to go through.
1179000	1184000	And they had to shoot an arrow horseback, they had to throw a spear, they had to joust.
1184000	1188000	And then they had to bash a skull with a big hammer at the end of that.
1189000	1192000	Looking in our chatroom over at live.volgnotwork.com, Actf says,
1192000	1195000	Legends of the Hidden Temple, Cross-Survivor. Somebody kickstart that.
1195000	1198000	They had that, didn't they? It was called the Eco-Challenge, right?
1198000	1200000	Was that what it was called on Discover Kids?
1200000	1205000	That's not like Legends of the Hidden Temple. There were no temple guards.
1205000	1206000	It was Survivor for Kids.
1206000	1209000	Yeah, but I don't think that's the part where he's saying Legends of the Hidden Temple.
1209000	1210000	Whatever, alright.
1210000	1213000	You would have said Kids plus Survivor and they'd be like, oh, Kidnation.
1213000	1215000	That was a good show.
1215000	1219000	Alright, anyway, we got to get to video games, so we are going to get to our gaming weeks.
1219000	1223000	Shane, before you leave us and say goodbye, I know you're playing Pokemon now,
1223000	1225000	but what other video games have you been playing this week?
1225000	1227000	I just finished Dragon Age 2, like a complete pleasure.
1227000	1228000	Oh, you finished it?
1228000	1229000	Mm-hmm.
1229000	1230000	I spent like 52 hours.
1230000	1231000	You did your romance.
1231000	1232000	Fenris?
1232000	1233000	Yes.
1233000	1234000	Who else would you romance in that game?
1234000	1235000	Fenris.
1235000	1237000	Maybe Isabella, maybe Meryl, but no, Fenris.
1237000	1240000	You know what, if Varric, though, was a possibility, I would have gone that way.
1240000	1242000	He's pretty funny, but Fenris is hot.
1242000	1244000	I tried to romance Meryl.
1244000	1245000	She's fun.
1245000	1246000	I love her.
1246000	1247000	Because, I mean, Eve Miles, hello.
1247000	1248000	I don't know.
1248000	1249000	She was in Torchwood.
1249000	1250000	She was in Torchwood.
1250000	1251000	She wrote for everyone.
1251000	1255000	But then she started really pissing me off and I was like, oh, Fenris.
1255000	1259000	For Dragon Age 2, for all the people that hate that game, I don't understand now,
1259000	1260000	because I've gone through it.
1260000	1267000	Yeah, there's a lot of repetition in your locations you go to, but the story was actually
1267000	1272000	really, really good, and the companion dialogue and writing.
1272000	1280000	I might say it rivals Mass Effect in terms of characters I like to play alongside.
1280000	1286000	I think they were probably written better than most characters in other games.
1286000	1289000	Definitely better than the original Dragon Age characters, at least.
1289000	1290000	But I loved it.
1290000	1292000	Oh my god, how could you stand romancing Anders?
1292000	1293000	Ugh, creepy.
1293000	1294000	No, I killed him.
1294000	1295000	Spoiler, I killed him.
1295000	1297000	I let him live, but in my brain she went back and killed him later.
1297000	1300000	I stabbed him in the back with a knife.
1300000	1303000	It's like a three year old game, so it's okay.
1303000	1305000	Oh, that's really it that I've been playing, though.
1305000	1306000	But I did do everything.
1306000	1307000	You excited for Inquisition?
1307000	1310000	Yes, I am ready for it to be November 17th.
1310000	1311000	How do you feel about that delay?
1311000	1313000	I don't care if it makes it better, it's fine.
1313000	1317000	I'm ready to go romance Dorian, because he's the gay romance in the game.
1317000	1318000	I want romance Vivian.
1318000	1323000	Believe it or not, a story that somehow didn't make our show roll tonight, but I'm sure you
1323000	1326000	and Jamie have something to say about it, so I'll bring it up now.
1326000	1333000	It was announced this week that Casey Hudson, the producer of Mass Effect, left the company.
1333000	1334000	How do you feel about that?
1334000	1335000	Good for him.
1335000	1336000	I never hated him.
1336000	1341000	I never understood all the hate for him, so I'm sad because at least he was a constant there.
1341000	1343000	Just don't put him in charge of any more games.
1343000	1347000	I'm still fine with all the stuff he did for Mass Effect.
1347000	1352000	Without him, we could have had a completely different game that may have been quote unquote worse.
1352000	1355000	But we also could have had some story consistency.
1356000	1359000	If you squint, it's pretty consistent.
1359000	1361000	Aren't we scapegoating with that, though?
1361000	1363000	Because it's not just him.
1363000	1365000	It wasn't just him.
1365000	1375000	But when you're the creative director, you have to be the conduit from which all creativity flows,
1375000	1381000	or through which all creativity is coalesced into a final thing.
1381000	1383000	Some comments in chat for Shane before you go.
1383000	1384000	Act-Def says,
1384000	1386000	Shane, opinions on the new mega pokies revealed?
1386000	1389000	And 5th Dream says, cosplay Pikachu, motherfucker.
1389000	1392000	Cosplay Pikachu, that's a stupid name.
1392000	1398000	I don't care about any of the new megas, except kind of like Mega Salamence,
1398000	1400000	because he turned into an airplane.
1400000	1405000	Or he kind of looks like, I guess people are saying like Star Wars, like a Star Wars insignia,
1405000	1408000	but I think he kind of looks like a Cylon Raider.
1409000	1415000	When I get my Salamence and I get his mega stone,
1415000	1420000	I will name him something Battlestar Galactica related, because he totally turns into a raider.
1420000	1423000	And cosplay Pikachu, worst name ever.
1423000	1429000	But I'm totally going to use the Lucha Libre whatever, the Lucha Pikachu,
1429000	1435000	so I can see the awesome flies up into the air and then does like a belly flop on the flying press move.
1435000	1437000	Love that.
1437000	1442000	Or maybe I'll use Bell Pikachu, because that one's silly and looks like a southern bell.
1442000	1447000	Alright, anything else you want to share with us before you go back to the other room to breed oshawottes?
1447000	1452000	I have bred like 800 oshawottes now with no shiny.
1452000	1454000	So that shiny charm?
1454000	1455000	Oshawottes?
1455000	1456000	Oshawottes.
1456000	1459000	Okay, I was about to say, because I might be offended in a moment.
1459000	1460000	Oshawottes.
1460000	1462000	He's an adorable little sea otter.
1462000	1463000	Okay.
1463000	1470000	I've bred like 800 of those now, and I have a shiny charm, and I still have not got a shiny oshawottes.
1470000	1476000	So there are a lot of like underprivileged kids that are getting oshawottes coats this Christmas,
1476000	1479000	because I'm going to kill them all.
1479000	1481000	You should make a coat out of them.
1481000	1483000	Yeah, I'm going to make a whole bunch, because I have 800.
1483000	1485000	And you'll furline your house.
1485000	1488000	Oh yeah, I'm also going to make slippers, because those are year round.
1488000	1490000	So I'm going to keep making oshawottes.
1490000	1495000	By the way, we need Kickstarter for Final Fantasy XIV so people can give me money to make my room.
1495000	1497000	Why would we give you money to make a room?
1497000	1498000	Because you love me.
1498000	1501000	Because people give money to someone to make potato salad.
1501000	1505000	My cause is far worthier than potato salad and cosplay combined.
1505000	1506000	Potato salad's gross anyway.
1506000	1507000	It's delicious.
1507000	1509000	Alright, thanks for dropping in, Shane.
1509000	1511000	Come say hi if you have something to say later, which I'm sure you will.
1511000	1512000	I probably won't.
1512000	1513000	Alright.
1513000	1515000	Do you have a Power Rangers story again this week?
1515000	1517000	I do not have a Power Rangers story again this week.
1517000	1518000	Skylanders?
1518000	1519000	No.
1519000	1521000	We already talked Dragon Age and Mass Effect.
1521000	1523000	I don't know what else I'm about, so...
1523000	1525000	Yeah, you never know. You never know.
1525000	1526000	Alright.
1526000	1528000	Let's move around with the rest of us.
1528000	1529000	And how was your gaming week?
1529000	1530000	What types of video games have you been playing this week?
1530000	1531000	Darasacra?
1531000	1538000	I've been doing Silph quests over and over and I'm getting sick of the stupid Silph quests in Final Fantasy XIV.
1538000	1544000	I kind of forgot to play Bravely Defart, because I've had lots of stuff going on.
1544000	1551000	I'm playing a lot of Bejeweled, for some stupid reason, because I'm really good at Butterfly mode in Bejeweled 3.
1554000	1557000	It's one of those games you can just really easily zone out to, you know?
1557000	1558000	Yeah.
1558000	1560000	That's what makes those PopCap games so addicting.
1560000	1561000	They're all zone-out games.
1561000	1562000	Yeah.
1564000	1567000	I don't know. I just really...
1567000	1573000	It's been kind of a weird week, because I got really, really good news and I was so excited I couldn't sit down.
1573000	1575000	Well, that's good though, right?
1575000	1578000	Yes it is, but I'm not going to tell anybody yet.
1578000	1579000	Alright.
1579000	1580000	Keep it to yourself.
1580000	1581000	You know what it is.
1581000	1582000	I do. I do.
1582000	1586000	I got really shitty news this week and you know what it is, but I don't want to talk about it either, so there you go.
1586000	1589000	We're even, I think. Not really.
1589000	1590000	Alright, moving on.
1590000	1592000	Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
1592000	1598000	I only played one thing this week and that was the Kickstarter edition of Vanguard V, because I backed it.
1599000	1606000	Even though there's no way in hell it's going to make its goal, but I have to support, you know, Maximiliano Moreau,
1606000	1614000	who is the host of one of my favorite YouTube series, Cooking with Unity, and he's actually doing some programming on the game.
1614000	1619000	And I was a little disappointed before, because it is an Oculus...
1619000	1626000	Well, it was a VR-only game at one time, but they made a non-VR demo version that you can play,
1626000	1629000	so I actually got to try it out and it's awesome.
1629000	1631000	And the best part about it is it's super easy.
1631000	1635000	Like, I want to actually have my son try playing it, because it just uses the mouse and you look and that's it.
1635000	1637000	There's no fire button, no nothing.
1637000	1639000	It just moves and looks.
1639000	1640000	It just looks, actually.
1640000	1642000	It moves where you look.
1642000	1647000	But the soundtrack is pretty sweet and, I don't know, it's just a fun game.
1647000	1649000	It's like a rail shooter.
1649000	1650000	That's it.
1650000	1652000	That's all I played this week.
1652000	1654000	I played a few things this week.
1654000	1658000	I played more of Crypt of the Necrodancer, which I talked about a little bit last week,
1658000	1664000	which I'm having fun with that one, even though I'm still not sure I've completely figured out what I'm doing,
1664000	1666000	because it's one of those games where you have to kind of...
1666000	1670000	You learn more about the game the further you go and what the items really do.
1670000	1672000	There's not a whole lot of tutorial in the game.
1672000	1675000	I mean, in the very beginning, you kind of figure out, oh, move to the beat of the music,
1675000	1677000	but you have to kind of unravel everything else.
1677000	1679000	But as a roguelike, that's what it should be.
1679000	1682000	But anyway, I talked a lot about that last week, so I'll leave it at that.
1682000	1687000	This week, I've been playing more of, believe it or not, Fez, which I know is a couple years old at this point,
1687000	1691000	but it just came out on PlayStation 4, and it was free on PlayStation Plus.
1691000	1695000	So I'd given that game a whirl when it was originally out on Xbox 360,
1695000	1698000	so I decided to give it a whirl again on PlayStation 4.
1698000	1703000	And this time, I'm going to fully admit I'm using a guide to get help a little bit with some of it,
1703000	1705000	so I can just, you know...
1705000	1709000	Some of the puzzles are really, really, really, really intricate in the game,
1709000	1715000	so I kind of like being able to take it a little more at a casual difficulty, if that's even calling it that,
1715000	1718000	by using a guide to kind of help me when I get stuck.
1718000	1722000	And now that I'm able to explore more of the world than I did the last time,
1722000	1725000	I like what he did in, like, some of the zones.
1725000	1728000	There's this one area that I went into that I don't remember what it was called,
1728000	1730000	but it's like this...
1730000	1734000	The graphic style suddenly goes from the 8-bit pixelation thing, you know,
1734000	1740000	to a more CGA monitor from, like, the 1980s that only shows, what, it only shows four colors,
1740000	1743000	white, black, magenta, and cyan, right?
1743000	1745000	There's a whole cave where you...
1745000	1749000	And the music, which is actually Fez's strongest point out of everything is the music,
1749000	1751000	is great in that game.
1751000	1757000	You have to, like, jump up the little platforms in, like, a Mega Man-level style thing to the music.
1757000	1760000	And I just, I don't know, I thought that was frustrating,
1760000	1764000	but they're at the right level of difficulty, little thing to get through as a platforming thing.
1764000	1765000	So, yeah.
1765000	1769000	So Fez has been kind of fun to re-explore on PlayStation 4, so I've been doing that.
1769000	1771000	Robert M. in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
1771000	1774000	I just downloaded Fez from PlayStation Plus as well,
1774000	1777000	but I haven't touched either that or the one I got in the Humble Bundle.
1777000	1779000	And BlackWolf says, yeah, I revisited Fez too.
1779000	1782000	So, yeah, I think there's a lot of people revisiting that this week.
1782000	1784000	Ragenator says, I played Wing Commander 3 too.
1784000	1787000	I forgot about that. That's the Origin game right now, right?
1787000	1789000	The free game on Origin is Wing Commander 3?
1789000	1794000	I gotta pick that up. That was, like, Malcolm McDowell and Mark Hamill and shit doing the live acting.
1794000	1798000	Like, that was, like, the pinnacle of, like, 90s full motion video games,
1798000	1803000	which console gamers remember from, like, Night Trap and Sewer Shark and that stuff.
1803000	1807000	But there was a whole mess of PC games that did that stuff.
1807000	1813000	You guys know there was a remake of SimCity that I always loved to make fun of on this show
1813000	1818000	because it was so poorly acted and overacted with the whole, like, news report on SimCity Action News and all that, right?
1818000	1821000	That was a CD-ROM game. Mega Race, I know that's one you really liked, right, Logan?
1821000	1822000	I love Mega Race.
1822000	1828000	Right? And then there were just some really awesome ones we'll get into a little later in the show.
1828000	1831000	One developer that really got into this a little bit was Sierra.
1831000	1835000	And, like, I think of games like Phantasmagoria, which I'm pretty sure you've done as a classic game of the week in the past.
1835000	1836000	Yes, I have.
1836000	1839000	Dark Sakura, which was really ahead of its time in some ways.
1839000	1845000	So, yeah, anyway, now I'm going down nostalgia lane with these 90s CD things.
1845000	1849000	But, yeah, Wing Commander 3, I gotta check that out because that was really the peak of all that.
1849000	1852000	The other game, I actually spent quite a bit of time with this.
1852000	1857000	A friend of mine recommended this to me, and I dabbled with this game, I think it was last year,
1857000	1860000	maybe it was a year and a half ago when it first, first came out, like, in the beta.
1860000	1865000	I dabbled with it a little bit, but I was playing way too many other MMOs at the same time
1865000	1869000	because that was when XIV Realm Reborn was new and I was still into Warcraft.
1869000	1876000	Well, now that I don't play XIV as much and I cancelled World of Warcraft, I have time to add a new MMO in the rotation show.
1876000	1882000	I checked out. Neverwinter was the game I decided to check out, which is free to play.
1882000	1889000	Perfect World, I believe Arc System Works, those guys put this one out as a free to play.
1889000	1894000	And it's in Steam, if you want to check that out, and it is an MMO.
1894000	1903000	Because it is free to play, they do have the premium currency that does things like name changes and stat rebalancing.
1903000	1909000	Now, granted, I only got a character to level 5, so I haven't seen a whole lot else what you can buy with it,
1909000	1913000	but I'm assuming, based on some things I've seen, there's like fashion outfits,
1913000	1916000	like what your character actually looks like as opposed to the armor you wear.
1916000	1919000	I'm sure a lot of that is premium as well.
1919000	1926000	But I gotta say, being a fan of Warcraft for so many years, I like that Neverwinter has a lot of the same tropes,
1926000	1933000	but I like that Neverwinter also felt kind of action-y, which is obviously based in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.
1933000	1940000	So if you play D&D, you'll see some familiar things that you know from D&D, like the rolling of stats,
1940000	1947000	and a lot of the classes are very classic. A lot of the races, like half-elves and things, are things you would see from D&D.
1947000	1952000	So a lot of that is in the game, but I liked that it felt almost kind of action-y,
1952000	1957000	like, oh, I was playing a mage in the game, and I'm like, oh, I'm going to channel my ice and freeze this mob,
1957000	1960000	and oh, he's frozen, so now I'm going to quick swing my mouse over this way,
1960000	1963000	and I'm going to hit this guy with magic missile and attack the darkness.
1963000	1966000	Okay, I wasn't really attacking the darkness, but I had to throw that out there somewhere.
1966000	1968000	But yeah, some of the fights in there were kind of fun.
1968000	1971000	I did this thing in the very beginning that kind of felt like a one-man instance,
1971000	1975000	because I had another little guy with me, and I was running through the little instance,
1975000	1979000	and there was like a boss monster, and I had to freeze him, that I'd run away a little bit and fire magic missile,
1979000	1981000	and then freeze him again. So that was kind of fun.
1981000	1985000	So I got to admit, I wasn't expecting much out of Neverwinter, because it is free to play,
1985000	1990000	but I was pleasantly surprised with how well put together and how fun it was.
1990000	1995000	Keep in mind, I've only experienced through level five, but that was still a good couple hours of entertainment the other night.
1995000	1999000	So yeah, Neverwinter. Good times. I like that.
1999000	2003000	Dungeonbuster in chat says, whoa, Neverwinter. Yeah, I know, it was kind of random, huh?
2003000	2006000	Dungeonbuster also says, a lot of the costumes are premium in Neverwinter.
2006000	2008000	Yeah, I figured that was going to be as much.
2008000	2015000	And Bochacawa says, it's not based in D&D, it's based in Farin, which is going to be D&D when the next edition is official.
2015000	2020000	Cial says, did you attack the gazebo sky? No.
2020000	2028000	But I went in like the back of the king's throne room. I don't remember what the whole thing was.
2028000	2034000	I had to go get some, protect some crown from being stolen, but spoiler alert, it got stolen anyway,
2034000	2038000	which sets the plot for the rest of the quests, I'm sure, for a few levels.
2038000	2040000	Dun dun dun.
2040000	2045000	As I was playing it, I actually was like, this feels a lot like a Dragon Age story that I'm playing right now or something.
2045000	2050000	Are you going to shame your dice? What's that? Are you going to participate in dice shaming?
2050000	2057000	What? Oh, oh, the whole Dungeons and Dragons stuff on Facebook. You don't actually roll dice in Neverwinter.
2057000	2062000	No, I just, that's why I got confused. I was like, what? Dying clothes? What?
2062000	2066000	I'm going to start back to Star Trek Online, by the way, again.
2066000	2072000	Are you? Grandpa. Yeah, he's really into that and they have an expansion coming.
2072000	2078000	I've had a Rear Admiral sitting at Quark's Bar for the last two years.
2078000	2083000	Appropriate. Yeah. All right. So there you go. That's my gaming week.

2106000	2110000	Upcoming shows, we will be here next week. We will not be here Labor Day weekend.
2110000	2114000	There will be no show Labor Day weekend because that is huge convention weekend.
2114000	2116000	Dark Sakura will be at SacAnime here locally.
2116000	2118000	Possibly. Oh, I thought you were going for sure.
2118000	2120000	If it works out because of reasons.
2120000	2124000	Gotcha. Well, hopefully you'll be at SacAnime here locally.
2124000	2130000	And if not, I'm sure Jonas and Diego, some of our friends from last week will come back and talk about that.
2130000	2138000	I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta. So for those of you guys, I'm pretty sure within like probably about a 500 mile radius of Atlanta and then some.
2138000	2142000	All the nerds I know convene on Atlanta for that convention.
2142000	2144000	So if you're going to be there, be sure to stop by and say hi.
2144000	2149000	The VOG Network panel is 1130 a.m. on Monday.
2149000	2151000	So just before it's time to go.
2151000	2155000	But we will also be on some various panels in the podcasting track throughout the weekend.
2155000	2157000	And I'll be around the convention.
2157000	2161000	I'll have a VOG shirt on. I'm hoping my Joker cosplay is finished.
2161000	2163000	But I'm being a horrible, horrible procrastinator.
2163000	2164000	So we'll see.
2164000	2167000	But I know I'm going to get so much shit from Travis if I don't finish something.
2167000	2173000	So I'm going to try for Dragon Con, which is like it's like two weeks from today.
2173000	2175000	No, three weeks. Better get on it.
2175000	2177000	I know it's three weeks from today.
2177000	2183000	Last minute cosplay is never a good idea unless you'd like for me to remind you of the time Evan and I didn't sleep for three days.
2183000	2189000	Girl, you're talking to somebody who did Rocky Horror and has done last minute costumes forever.
2189000	2193000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm talking about a whole brand new costume.
2193000	2194000	I know. I know.
2194000	2195000	Yeah.
2195000	2198000	All right. Well, the good news is I already have the hat thanks to Dark Sakura.
2198000	2202000	And I have pants that work too. And I kind of think I know how I'm going to do the top.
2202000	2208000	I think I'm going to do a layered thing, which use like because he has like a gray shirt underneath.
2208000	2211000	So I was thinking gray long johns would work very well for the top part.
2211000	2216000	And then it's just about basically painting the black jacket is the big thing I have to do and cutting it and making it look right.
2216000	2222000	So I just and I have to find that right material that will make it look good because I don't want to look like a jacket.
2222000	2226000	Keep in mind. Well, it's not. Joker doesn't wear a jacket.
2226000	2229000	It's not. But I'm thinking that's what I can use if I cut it.
2229000	2234000	So because he has like these cuts, like I'm drawing on my body, which you can't see.
2234000	2238000	No. And if you if you need it, I've actually got a heat bond.
2238000	2243000	OK. Material. So so we'll make it work. Yeah, we were. I will.
2243000	2246000	Robert M in chat says last minute Halloween costumes never work out for me.
2246000	2251000	Always works out for me. Always, always looks out for me.
2251000	2257000	All right. There we go. That is what's coming up for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
2257000	2262000	Let's get into some gaming news. No more movie talk, no more food talk.
2262000	2265000	It's gaming news talk. Loki, start us off.
2265000	2278000	So Sony is found themselves as part of a class action lawsuit in California regarding deceptive marketing of Killzone Shadowfall for the PlayStation 4.
2278000	2284000	The reason being is because it was advertised that the game was running in 1080p.
2284000	2292000	However, Digital Foundry found that the multiplayer portion of Shadowfall runs in an upscaled 960 by 1080 resolution.
2292000	2304000	It's like a step below 1080p. They do that in a lot of multiplayer games to make sure, you know, the frame rates, you know, up there with multiple people in the game, stuff like that.
2304000	2315000	And of course, because of this, somebody feels that they should, you know, pay damages because it's not really 1080p. It's just upscaled.
2315000	2320000	And right now they said that they seek damages more than $5 million total.
2320000	2336000	And they basically said, Sony admitted that it did not, in fact, design Killzone to display multiplayer graphics in 1080p, but instead use technology shortcut that's supposed to provide subjectively similar results.
2336000	2343000	But Sony never advertised or convinced consumers to buy a technological shortcut.
2344000	2372000	This is just dumb, is what it is. This is basically kind of what's been going on in, like, NeoGaf and other places where, you know, usually it's more between the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, where PlayStation 4 will, you know, display at native, you know, 1080p, but the Xbox One will be upscaled to 1080 or, you know, the PlayStation 4 will be upscaled from a slightly higher resolution or something.
2372000	2392000	But I don't know. I don't think there's really any deceptive marketing. It's displaying at 1080p whatever you do to get, you know, that. If it's not, it didn't say native 1080p. I don't think they advertise that at all. It's just kind of a money grab, it seems like.
2393000	2413000	This whole thing obviously reeks of fuckery, you know, the whole lawsuit, but to the credit of this or whatever, I think some people are starting to get real sick of feeling like in gaming, and this happens a lot with gaming, like even more so than movies.
2414000	2428000	Like, we all know trailers make the movies look better than they are, but at least for the most part, things that are in the trailer are going to be in the movie, although that actually doesn't always happen either. I've seen trailers where scenes are in the trailer that aren't actually in the movie, but anyway, I digress a little bit.
2429000	2443000	With video games, and this happens all the time, you see Shitty 3, you see all this stuff that doesn't end up actually happening with the game. The Aliens Colonial Marines, a classic example, right? Everybody was expecting one thing and got another.
2444000	2454000	And unlike movies, video games are such a pre-order heavy industry that one could argue that a lot of this stuff really does kind of influence people's purchases.
2455000	2473000	And to kind of go along with everything, this law firm, this is the first lawsuit that they've done in the gaming industry. For example, they also had a suit against Zynga, I guess there was some information leaked out of Farmville or something like that, personal information.
2473000	2487000	Aliens Colonial Marines, because of the poor quality of that game, and the whole Battlefield 3, I believe the Playstation 3 copies were supposed to be getting free copies of Battlefield 1943 and that never happened or something.
2488000	2491000	And so they were suing for that. So they've done this a lot.
2492000	2507000	Now, so yeah, please do not mishear me, I'm not siding with the lawsuit, because at the end of the day, the game does run in 1080p, it just doesn't all run in 1080p. The title screen can be 1080p and technically it runs in 1080p.
2508000	2524000	We're talking multiplayer, the regular game does run in 1080p. Here's how they explain multiplayer mode. It says, however, we use a technique called temporal reprojection, which combines pixels and motion vectors from multiple lower resolution frames to reconstruct a full 1080p image.
2525000	2532000	If native means that every part of that pipeline is 1080p, then this technique is not negative.
2532000	2552000	And to which I say, you know what, is the game fun? Yes or no. If yes it's fun, then shut up. It's just pixels. I was just talking about a game called Fez I was playing this week, and Fez runs in 1080p on the Playstation 4. Do you think it really utilizes that 1080p to its full extent?
2552000	2569000	Not really. But is it still fun? Yeah, it's fun. So, I don't know why we're going so fucking crazy over this graphic thing, but the only little credit I am trying to give to it is that, okay, we are getting a little sick of games being misrepresented.
2570000	2581000	And it does need to be more about what is actually in the game, and even if it's not actually 1080p, oh well, is it fun? Yes or no? That's the more important question.
2582000	2588000	Anyway, but as far as this lawsuit goes, it's ridiculous and seems very frivolous to me. In my opinion.
2589000	2590000	Like many of them.
2590000	2600000	Unfortunately. Which, as Loki pointed out, seem to all be coming from the same place. Can a judge call them out in court on that? Probably not.
2601000	2603000	They can throw out a case as being frivolous.
2604000	2610000	Yeah, but can a judge tell a company like, hmm, I noticed you have a tendency to do this type of shit and you really ought to knock it the fuck off.
2611000	2616000	They can put them under investigation for a potential disbarment for abuse of...
2617000	2618000	Oh, like what happened to Jack Voldemort.
2618000	2631000	Well, I think in this case, though, it's a legitimate concern, but is it that important? No. I don't think it's that big a deal.
2632000	2641000	Is it that deceptive, I guess? I mean, are we talking a significant difference between what was advertised?
2641000	2653000	I'm not saying 1080p native on the box or something like that versus what's actually being shown, but are the visuals that different from what was being shown in trailers and stuff like that?
2654000	2670000	I mean, if it was significantly downgraded, then maybe yes. But if it looks pretty much the same, I mean, if you couldn't tell without Digital Foundry doing actual...
2671000	2678000	you know, analyzing footage and counting pixels and stuff like that, I mean, if you couldn't tell that it was downgraded, then I don't see the problem.
2679000	2684000	It's one like, you know, Aliens Clone-O Marines where it looks significantly different than what they were showing off.
2685000	2691000	Or Watch Dogs looks significantly different than what they were showing off during their E3 demos. That's a little bit more deceptive.
2692000	2699000	Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com because I'm really curious what you guys, our listeners, have to say about this because we do say it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
2699000	2706000	Dungeon Buster says, reading his explanation for why he was so offended by the game, the person suing Sony sounds like the most shallow person on the face of the planet.
2707000	2712000	Had he known the full story, he allegedly would have not purchased Killzone at all or would have paid substantially less for it.
2713000	2715000	And I think we're all sitting here going, yeah, right.
2716000	2719000	And Bochi Kawa simply says, first world problems.
2720000	2727000	Cial says, Jack Voldemort, a lawyer turned dark wizard. I forget, we haven't brought this guy up in a very, very long time and for good reason.
2727000	2729000	And that's good because as soon as you bring him up, then he comes back.
2730000	2739000	I will, for our newer listeners, Jack Voldemort was our name for Jack Thompson, a very famous, at least a few years ago, anti-video game lawyer.
2740000	2743000	This guy was, in my opinion, batshit crazy.
2744000	2745000	Yes, Starcyra?
2746000	2747000	And he hated Ice-T.
2748000	2757000	And he was just, yeah, but he ended up getting disbarred in Florida, but we always called him Jack Voldemort because we felt he was an attention whore and we didn't want to help get his name out there.
2758000	2759000	So, oops, we broke that a little bit tonight.
2760000	2762000	But for reference purposes only, did I say his real name again.
2763000	2766000	If I see an article with his name in it tomorrow, I'm blaming you.
2767000	2773000	And I will deserve it. I will take my beatings with your shoe or whatever you're going to hit me with because, yeah, I shouldn't have brought it up.
2774000	2776000	But for the sake of listeners, I want to remind them where that comes from.
2777000	2781000	Alright, let's move on with some more stories. I'm surprised he's not involved somehow.
2782000	2783000	He doesn't have anything to do with violence.
2784000	2791000	Yeah, I guess that's true. This is some news that has some people disappointed, but these things happen in the industry, people move on to new jobs, right?
2792000	2793000	We just talked about Casey Hudson with BioWare a little bit ago.
2794000	2804000	Well, also this week, Nintendo lost Dan Adelman, and if you don't know who Dan Adelman was, he was big on indie developers and getting them to work with Nintendo of America.
2804000	2809000	Because after all, the Wii U, especially when it launched, really did have a pretty strong lineup of indies.
2810000	2814000	And to be fair, has continued to have a pretty good strong lineup of indies on the console.
2815000	2818000	And I think we've heard about that the Wii U shop is pretty easy to work with.
2819000	2827000	But we also saw that Dan Adelman would sometimes be a little bit vocal in some of the challenges he would face with Nintendo.
2828000	2833000	And at one point, he got squelched by the big N and didn't use his Twitter anymore.
2834000	2840000	And all of a sudden, earlier this week, he just let the floodgates loose and was talking everything. It was a very honest conversation.
2841000	2844000	He wasn't anti-Nintendo in anything he was saying, don't get me wrong.
2845000	2850000	He's very kind to them in his departure, but he says he's very excited about the future as well.
2851000	2857000	He says that, I'm going indie. As the indie games business matures, a real need for business expertise has started to develop.
2857000	2868000	I've been working with the indie community for almost nine years now, and one consistent theme I've noticed is the tension between developers following their passion to make the game they want to make, and needing to be able to make a living doing it.
2869000	2874000	Unfortunately though, there are a lot of business types who at best just don't get what indies are trying to do, or are at worst pretty much unethical.
2875000	2881000	So I kind of get the sense that he's moving into this position where he's going to help indie developers get published on all game systems.
2881000	2887000	Kind of work the system a little bit, if you will. Handhold these indie developers through what can be a scary process.
2888000	2897000	I'm not sure how one makes money off of that, but perhaps you would get a cut. Like if you're somebody's manager, you get 20% of whatever they make.
2898000	2903000	Like when Tom Cruise makes $15 million off of him, is he even worth that much anymore? Who makes all the money on movies now?
2903000	2906000	Oh, Robert Downey Jr. He's like the highest paid actor in Hollywood, right?
2907000	2918000	Okay, his agent gets like 20% of that $20 million that he makes. That's why these fees are negotiated so freaking sky high, because his agent, or in the case of Robert Downey Jr., agents, I'm sure, they all get a cut of it.
2919000	2928000	So maybe, and I'm theorizing, I don't know this to be true, but I would think that there could be a pretty good business model in there somewhere where essentially Dan Adelman may work as your agent.
2928000	2940000	Seems fair enough, right? Loki, if you knew that there was a guy out there that could help you get your dream game that you're making published on all these systems, would you be like, yeah, you can take 20% to help me do that?
2941000	2953000	No, because, well here's why, because it's so easy to do that. I mean, it's easy to register with these companies and get it published.
2953000	2966000	I mean, with Uni, you can just export to all these different game platforms and it's signing up there. And hell, if Nintendo's gonna, if it's gonna be really hard to sign up with Nintendo, then fuck it, I just won't do it. Oh darn, everyone.
2967000	2982000	Well now, in the tweets, I get the sense, and he's swearing up and down that Nintendo is not gonna suddenly stop supporting indies. I get the sense, again, from his tweets, I'm hugely paraphrasing here, that he seems like I helped that relationship with indies, and now it's gonna stay that way.
2983000	2992000	Like, the door is open for indies, Nintendo gets indies now, and we're gonna continue to have this relationship. That's the impression I get from what's going on. And that's a good thing.
2993000	2994000	They might see other people, though.
2995000	3009000	Yeah, but that's okay. I like to see the indies flourish on all the consoles. I mean, the indie development is very important. Without the indie scene, you would not have something like Minecraft, you would not have something like Crypt of the Neko Janser I talked about earlier on the show, or Rogue Legacy, which I've talked about at length on previous episodes.
3010000	3030000	I mean, everybody's played an indie game that they like probably an unhealthy amount. Right? So, anyway. Best of luck to him in his travels. I hope that, you know, if he is moving into something that's an agent role, that could be a very good thing for all game consoles, not just Wii U. So I do hope that's a good thing.
3031000	3033000	Let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3033000	3060000	Well, this is not quite so indie. This is possibly the resurrection of a name lost to our past. There has been a teaser up from Activision about Sierra's return. And, I mean, keep in mind, Sierra did King's Quest, Space Quest, You Don't Know Jack, Half Life. So...
3061000	3066000	Originally, yeah. Sierra published the first Half Life, I believe. Yeah. And the expansion.
3067000	3085000	Yep. And there was the big rivalry going on with LucasArts and Mythic and all that, you know, but there's a chance they might come back. There is maybe a classic game being rebooted. Who knows? But maybe Activision will go away and we'll get Sierra.
3086000	3087000	That would be great.
3087000	3089000	Rebranding! We're gonna be someone that sucks less.
3090000	3091000	Can I put on my tinfoil wishful thinking hat?
3092000	3093000	Oh, do it.
3094000	3108000	Please? Okay. So do you guys remember Telltale was working on a King's Quest game? A King's Quest reboot, but then it was mysteriously cancelled. Could this be the reason why, fingers-toes-crossed, Return of King's Quest?
3108000	3119000	That hopefully is more like King's Quest 4 or 5 and less like the later King's Quest games, which were kind of hot garbage? I'm hoping it's something like that. That would be fantastic to see something like that come back.
3120000	3132000	Maybe people are looking at Telltale's success because Telltale has had a lot of success. I know the Jurassic Park game kind of got, eeee, reviews, but clearly Walking Dead, phenomenal, right, does very well for them.
3132000	3150000	Lots of good things about the Fables game, The Wolf Among Us. Lots of good feedback on that. Back to the Future. They've had a lot of really well-received games that they've done. Maybe other companies are looking at that going, oh, maybe this point-and-click thing isn't as dead as we all thought it was.
3151000	3155000	Well, but it could also be possible that their name is just coming back for the sake of publishing.
3156000	3175000	Could be. It could be. Yeah, because remember now, on the flip side, EA brought Origin back. Remember the Ultima games originally, before Ultima 1. I'm talking about Ultima 1-2. That was Richard Garriott's thing was Origin, and then EA bought it, and now Origin means something completely different.
3175000	3194000	So hopefully that's not what's happening with Sierra, because I'm like, Activision doesn't have a storefront right now. Please don't let it be that. Please don't let Sierra be the name. Please do not tarnish another classic computing games company name with a freaking storefront.
3195000	3200000	Enough! But we'll see. I guess we'll find out soon enough, right?
3201000	3217000	Bobby Black Wolf, yelling out some other games they did. They did a few non-Quest games. The Colonel's Bequest, Codename Iceman, Jones and the Fast Lane. Love that one. Oilswell, Mixed Up Mother Goose. I keep on saying Incredible Crisis. Incredible Machine. That was a Sierra game, too.
3218000	3244000	Curse of Dr. Brain. Loved those games. The Dr. Brain games were amazing. Island of Dr. Brain. Those games were freaking great. What else did Sierra do? Did they do Chirandia? The Hoyle card games were really good, too. Chirandia was not. Chirandia was not LucasArts. There was another one involved. Maybe they were LucasArts. No, it wasn't LucasArts. Somebody in chat will know. You're right. It was somebody else. It wasn't Sierra. It was the third group.
3245000	3255000	Did they do 3D Ultra Mini Golf? I think so. Or at least they published it. I love that game. I know. I think it'd be great. It'd be great to see some of that come back.
3256000	3273000	I should do a Mini Golf game. And Bobby Black Wolf says Leisure Suit Larry had no Quest. And Alan Alchemy says let's not forget their Dynamix subsidiary. Which is right. Willy Beamish was a Dynamix game. Which that game ended up on Sega CD. Willy Beamish? I could be wrong.
3274000	3285000	Dark Soccer, do you remember? Willy Beamish. I remember it, but I didn't care about playing it. I had that game on, I want to say it was 14 three and a quarter floppies.
3286000	3301000	I would love a new Space Quest. Well, we had an opportunity for a new Space Quest game, but I would love a legit new Space Quest game, I guess. Thank you, MXC. MXC, you get a cookie. Here it is. Here's your cookie, MXC. Chirandia games were Westwood.
3301000	3312000	That's right. And Black Wolf says Willy Beamish was on Sega CD. I have it. You know what, I might actually have it. I've got like some, I have no idea what I own anymore.
3313000	3323000	If you have Willy Beamish, I want it. Can I have it? I'll give you a taco, but not from the place you don't like. No. You can come over and play it though and I'll purl. Alright, fine. That'll work.
3324000	3330000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase, cartoon.
3331000	3339000	Alright, there you go. Well, I'm hoping this means some of the classic Sierra stuff coming back. Although, I think I read online that Incredible Schween has a spiritual successor that's out there.
3340000	3346000	Yeah, they do. It's those original guys that made it. I forget what it's called now, but yeah, they've got that. They have several games, I think.
3347000	3348000	Well, moving on, Loki.
3348000	3355000	Alright, so speaking of another company that's come back from the dead, or will be coming back from the dead, because they have their website up right now, but there is a countdown.
3356000	3365000	It's going to be one week from today, I guess, or maybe a week from Monday, it looks like, that this will go live.
3365000	3375000	But it's a new company called TSI. I don't know if you may remember SSI, which is Strategic Simulations Inc.
3376000	3382000	It was back in the 80s and 90s. They put out a bunch of these Goldblox games, including some of the Dungeons and Dragons games and that kind of stuff.
3383000	3398000	Well, now, formed by the alumni from SSI, they have the new company, Tactical Simulations Interactive, TSI, and it's going to be a new video game studio with old-school RPG sensibilities, they say.
3398000	3417000	Of course, saying that they're drawing on their experience of the old studio, and not sure if they're going to be bringing back any of the old Advanced Dungeons and Dragons games or anything like that, but I guess we'll find out soon, when their site launches a week from Monday.
3418000	3419000	So, pretty cool.
3420000	3424000	What is up with all these classic computing companies all of a sudden making a comeback? Not that I'm complaining.
3425000	3427000	It's indies, indies coming back, that's what it is.
3428000	3433000	Great. I just hope they're coming back in ways that we want to have them back, and again, not storefronts.
3434000	3435000	As long as it's not mobile games, please.
3436000	3438000	Oh, no, why did you say that?
3439000	3444000	I don't think so. I don't think it's going to be mobile games, but I just hope that it's not. I mean, at least not this sense.
3445000	3455000	I don't have a problem with a mobile version of a game, but like, you know, the mobile game design, I guess, model, you know, where it's free to play and energy and all that stuff.
3456000	3465000	And a lot of that classic stuff just doesn't translate to touchpad. I'm sorry. It's not, like, when you port a lot of that stuff to mobile, it doesn't work.
3465000	3476000	The mobile games that are successful work because they're designed with mobile in mind. Things like Temple Run, Kim Kardashian, believe it or not, that crap is designed with mobile in mind.
3477000	3484000	And that's why they work where Sonic the Hedgehog being ported doesn't. Because the fake joystick, it just doesn't work.
3485000	3497000	So, anyway. Moving on. There's some other big, big news going on in gaming this week that doesn't affect the game companies directly, but more of a new thing that has been born of that.
3498000	3505000	And Dark Soccer and I have a pair of stories here touching on what has gone on this week at Twitch TV. And there were a lot of changes at Twitch TV this week.
3505000	3517000	And the first big change that happened, Justin TV shuttered its doors. Closed. As of Monday, no longer in service. Shut down. If you were streaming on the network, too bad, so sad. You're done.
3518000	3523000	Which, just to give you a little bit of backstory, Justin TV was what was there before there was Twitch TV.
3524000	3532000	We actually used to broadcast this show on Justin TV. It was like a simulcast thing because a lot of listeners were like, we want to see a webcam while you do the show.
3532000	3540000	And we actually used to, we had a better setup in the garage studio we used to use, which I don't live in that house anymore, so we don't have that.
3541000	3551000	But I distinctly remember one episode, because it's probably the most viewers we ever got on Justin TV. You were streaming Final Fantasy 13, a demo that you'd imported from Japan, Loki.
3552000	3556000	And you were playing that on the little TV and we were streaming it on Twitch with the show audio in the background.
3556000	3560000	So we used to do that stuff on Justin TV because there was no Twitch at the time.
3561000	3568000	And I did, a couple years ago, though, have the Justin TV channel converted to a Twitch channel.
3569000	3575000	So I believe some of our OLR archive stuff is still there at Twitch Orange Launch Radio, but I'm telling you it's really, really old stuff.
3576000	3579000	And it might get deleted soon anyway, but we'll get to that in a minute.
3579000	3592000	So yeah, a lot of history with Justin TV. And speaking of history and things, no secret that we were once a network on live 365, then we were a part of the All Games Radio Network, right?
3593000	3602000	And I remember Scott, over at All Games, Scott Rubin, the guy when he was doing All Games Interactive and all that, he was really big on adopting the Justin TV.
3603000	3606000	Because I think he did the whole live streaming cam stuff for a little while, which was a big part of Justin TV.
3606000	3612000	I distinctly remember one E3, he was wearing that camera and took it to like an Xbox conference or something, or maybe it was GDC.
3613000	3616000	One of those things, like he took a camera to and was kind of streaming that stuff.
3617000	3623000	So, you know, snaps for Scott, he kind of predicted that this is where things would end up, that it was going to end up a big gaming thing, right?
3624000	3628000	And sure enough, Twitch TV got so huge, it literally swallowed Justin TV.
3628000	3638000	So, I mean, you know, it's unfortunate, but, you know, again, how many live streamers were there compared to game streamers?
3639000	3648000	It was a lot smaller. And the live streamers, they have other places they can go. There's that actual live stream site, it's like livestream.com, but they don't want gaming content.
3649000	3652000	Ustream is a very popular alternative as well, so you have all that.
3652000	3658000	But the father of Twitch TV, Justin TV, had closed their doors this week.
3659000	3668000	Let's see, Rageinator says, speaking of OLR simulcasting, will you three bring back the simulcast, please?
3669000	3675000	I'm iffy on it. I just don't think, it's Orange Lounge Radio, not Orange Lounge Video.
3676000	3678000	When I have a compelling reason to use video, then we'll do it.
3678000	3682000	It's also the bandwidth. I don't know if it can handle, yeah.
3683000	3692000	I kind of like the fact that people, and we have a YouTube channel, but a lot of that is for ease of consumption, because YouTube is on every single stinking device.
3693000	3697000	It's really easy to get a YouTube of the show as opposed to downloading an MP3 of the show on your 3DS, right?
3698000	3701000	You can't do that. You can't download an MP3 of the show on your Vita very easily.
3702000	3707000	But you can bring up the YouTube channel, so I sort of see OLR on YouTube as that type of thing.
3708000	3712000	And for those that do want to watch, Jason does take the time to enhance the videos and kind of does that.
3713000	3719000	But I also get emails from people that are like, I listen to you guys at work. I can't watch it.
3720000	3725000	I listen while I do my job, my data entry job or my other job that I need my eyes for that, but I don't have to listen to my work.
3726000	3730000	Or Commuter is another big thing we have too, and obviously you can't watch a video while you commute.
3731000	3734000	So I kind of like that we fill that need, and I don't really see the need to change it.
3734000	3740000	Yeah, and also if you do video, then that's less people that are on the regular stream and that kind of skews numbers.
3741000	3742000	And that'll steal my soul.
3743000	3750000	Exactly, exactly. So I just, I don't know. I'm not saying no. I'm just saying I can't think of a compelling use for it at this time.
3751000	3753000	So that's what I'm saying there.
3753000	3762000	Let's see. And Tigerclaw points out that the archives are still there. That the Twitch TV archives are apparently still there.
3763000	3766000	At least for now. I don't know if they're highlighted or what, but there it is.
3767000	3774000	So, alright. Moving on. A related story with all this. So that happened first, and then what, DarkSara?
3774000	3787000	Well now, after all the crap going on and the, I'd probably say the fallout from what's going on with Twitch, they are working, well, I don't know if it's there yet.
3788000	3797000	It looks like they're going to be putting up an appeal button so that for anyone who's been affected by that copyright issue, they're going to be able to appeal it.
3798000	3811000	In fact, the direct quote coming from DiPietro, I'm sorry, who is the VP of Marketing and Communications at Twitch says,
3812000	3818000	We're deploying an appeal button for VODs that have been flagged for copyrighted music by the new audio recognition system.
3819000	3825000	We recognize that the system is not yet perfect. We want to make the system as fair and unobtrusive as possible and we greatly appreciate your help.
3825000	3832000	He didn't say anything about how it works. He didn't say anything about response time. There's no big FAQ on this or anything.
3833000	3839000	Just that there's a way to appeal it, which doesn't really help people much. So, there's that.
3840000	3850000	I honestly think that it's just throwing a bone in that, you know, yeah, they may review it, but they're going to, you know, listen to who has more money, so.
3850000	3856000	There's a lot to say on this and I'm sure you guys have comments in our chatroom as well over at live.vognetwork.com.
3857000	3865000	And Loki, I'm dying to know what you think too, but I'll start. This may surprise you, my initial thought on this, but listen to what I have to say on this.
3866000	3877000	I support Twitch doing this. That's right, I said it. I am totally fine with Twitch wanting to get the copyrighted music that people play in the backgrounds of their streams
3877000	3883000	while they're playing video games off of the network because that's not what the network is about. Totally support that actually.
3884000	3894000	I think if that's what you're relying on for the content of your stream, if what you're doing as you're playing the game is not compelling enough that you need to have music in the background to make your stream more interesting.
3895000	3903000	If that's what you're doing on Twitch, then guess what? Step up your game. Wake up call. It's not interesting and it's not legal.
3903000	3913000	So sorry, I know that's a painful thing to hear, but that's the reality of it. Try banter. Get a friend to stream with that you guys can talk while you're playing the game.
3914000	3921000	Narrate the game that you're playing. Take questions from chat. Do something a little more interactive, but don't just leave Pandora playing in the background while you're trying to play the game.
3922000	3930000	If that's what you rely on for your content, this is your wake up call to do something different. That's not what Twitch is about and so on that end, I support what Twitch is trying to do.
3930000	3938000	Now, before you put down your pen and paper and your angry emails, because the other thing I have to say is I don't like at all how Twitch is doing it.
3939000	3949000	And I think that's a big problem a lot of people are having is that they just sprung this out of nowhere, ran this automated system through everybody's content, which flagged even Twitch's own crap.
3950000	3958000	And then if you don't like it, too bad, so sad, you're bleeped for 30 minutes with the audio dropped and all this and no warning whatsoever. That was shitty.
3958000	3967000	Now, they went out and did the Reddit, the Ask Me Anything, which Reddit, being the angry mob that it was, voted down all the answers anyway.
3968000	3984000	So, yeah. So there was all that. They did come out and say, I think that's where that appeal button was born of and all this stuff was because of the AMA and they said the two hour length for highlighting and so forth, that would go away and all that.
3984000	3992000	So that is good that some changes were born of that, but I still don't like the whole automated system because I fucking hate the way YouTube does it.
3993000	4000000	And what pisses me off about YouTube to no end is that their appeal system is shit and it doesn't put the consumer first, the content creators first.
4001000	4015000	YouTube does not care about its content creators when it comes to this copyright stuff. They always side on the side of these third parties who can flag something incorrectly with no recourse whatsoever when they do it incorrectly.
4016000	4028000	And that's happened one too many times on videos I have made, and I don't even have that big of an audience, but I've made videos for games where the people who did the music and the games say it is okay to monetize this stuff on YouTube.
4028000	4035000	And it still gets flagged by some third party. There is nothing I can do about it. I can appeal it, but I'm at the mercy ultimately of those companies.
4036000	4041000	That is not where I want to see Twitch end up, and that's what makes me nervous about this whole thing where they're going to get acquired by YouTube.
4042000	4051000	So, okay, they put an appeal button in, but how's that really going to work? What I would have liked to have seen Twitch done is I would have liked Twitch to have said,
4051000	4063000	we no longer permiss the third party music in the background while you're playing the game. Please stop. Because in the future, if you continue to do this, XYZ will happen.
4064000	4077000	Twitch is now a billion dollar company. They're about to get acquired by YouTube for a billion dollars if all these rumors are going to be true. Don't tell me they don't have the staff to have a couple people go in there and screen content when it gets flagged for repeatedly violating those rules.
4077000	4087000	Somebody's looking at who's screening the Twitch content right now to make sure somebody ain't fucking on their Twitch channel instead of playing a game. I'm playing a game. It's called porno.
4088000	4093000	Somebody's looking for that content right now, so Twitch can go through and figure out who's following the rules and who can't.
4094000	4099000	Well, YouTube doesn't do that. And Google's a multi-billion dollar company.
4099000	4109000	Right? Now, the other problem, and I'm sure a lot of you are sitting there screaming this out. Rob, you're not addressing this. Well, hold on. This is where things get weird.
4110000	4122000	Because you get games like Rockband, Rocksmith, Grand Theft Auto, Saints Row that have licensed soundtracks in the game that you stream these games on the network.
4122000	4130000	And I could be talking over it, but the automated system's going to pick it up anyway. So my options are I could stream Grand Theft Auto and turn the music off.
4131000	4138000	Or I guess maybe put it on the classic station, although I'm not even sure that would work because the performance is still copyrighted and they could match on that.
4139000	4148000	So if I'm playing those games, I'm still going to get flagged. I'm not quite okay with that because I do feel like, and I realize this is not the way the law is today.
4148000	4153000	You're going to say, well, Rob, that's not the way the law is written. Well, I'm saying this is the way the law should be written.
4154000	4170000	I kind of think if you get the license for the game and you're going to be broadcasting on Twitch, then when the game companies acquire these licenses for music, that you should be able to rebroadcast as you can the video games today.
4170000	4185000	That should be allowable under fair use, under criticism, and those sorts of laws. And if you sign the agreement with the game company to have your song in the game, then you should therefore have those rights subject to your Twitch broadcast.
4186000	4191000	And I'm well aware that ain't how it works today. I'm saying it should. That's the way things should work.
4192000	4195000	Loki, your thoughts on this while I look at chat over at live.vognetwork.com?
4196000	4203000	I just think that as long as they don't go crazy with it like they did with YouTube, I know it's gotten a lot of backlash just with how it's handled there.
4204000	4213000	And it doesn't seem like it's too smart that they didn't have a way to appeal them even in the beginning. It's like, gee, you know, this just happened on YouTube and you really didn't pay attention to what happened over there.
4214000	4221000	Maybe go, hmm, we shouldn't do that too. Maybe we should approach this a different way. And they just didn't see that is the reason.
4221000	4227000	And you know why they did this? They did this because of YouTube. Google probably told them to do this.
4228000	4233000	Either in preparation to purchase them or because they've already purchased them is why they're doing this.
4234000	4243000	And so, you know, the way Google did it, I mean, I don't know. It's not good.
4244000	4250000	And I just kind of wonder, though, if Twitch is like, ah, fuck it, who cares? We're going to get a billion dollars.
4251000	4259000	So, you know, let's try to keep as many people happy as we can right now because we're the only kind of source for a lot of this game streaming right now.
4260000	4262000	Or at least the easiest because it's integrated in the consoles and all that stuff.
4263000	4267000	But yeah, I agree that it's kind of a hassle that, you know, games have music in them.
4268000	4275000	I mean, it's just it's stupid, though, that you would just because you hear a song on the radio in the game, there's like other crap playing over.
4276000	4283000	It's not like I'm going to record it with my tape player and fucking, you know, oh, I've got a copy. Now I don't need to buy one.
4284000	4289000	Come on. That's just like that's the whole cassette tape argument from years ago.
4290000	4294000	I'm totally going to make a mixtape of stuff I hear in video games. Just saying.
4294000	4301000	I don't know. I kind of I remember being younger. I used to put the little tape recorder up to the Nintendo and tape the songs I really loved.
4302000	4306000	In fact, I remember one year. All right. Already for Tangent Time. This is a huge one.
4307000	4312000	Anybody ever heard of Odyssey of the Mind? Something we used to do in grade school where you have these big projects and things.
4313000	4318000	So every year in Odyssey of the Mind, one of the somebody, so at least one person in chat will fucking know what I'm talking about.
4319000	4320000	Look it up on Wikipedia or something. All right.
4320000	4328000	Well, Odyssey of the Mind, when I was in like fourth or fifth grade, there's always a competition to build structures and who can build the structure that can hold the most weight.
4329000	4332000	And that's the thing we did one year. But you do a performance around it as well.
4333000	4337000	So we did like a little Egyptian themed performance. Don't ask. It made sense at the time. Okay.
4338000	4344000	But here's the deal. To get the music for the Egyptian themed performance that we were doing for the balsa wood structure that we made in like the fifth grade,
4344000	4354000	I took a tape recorder, held it up to my Game Boy. No, I took a cord and took it from the Game Boy output and put it in the boombox and taped that way.
4355000	4360000	I taped the background music from Super Mario Land when you're in the Egyptian temple. You remember that?
4361000	4362000	No, that was great.
4363000	4364000	That was the music we used when we did the performance.
4365000	4366000	That's awesome.
4367000	4372000	So it's funny that you joke like, oh, I'm going to make mixtapes of video game music, but like I actually did do that shit back in the day.
4372000	4378000	When I lived in Alabama and I didn't have a Nintendo 64, Dan, this is when we were still in our phone phase.
4379000	4383000	I said, I want Orchid's music from KI Gold.
4384000	4392000	And he kept, because it starts you at a random stage every time, he kept restarting the game until he got it to start at that and recorded the music for me.
4393000	4394000	Because he's a good husband.
4394000	4406000	Let me just put it this way. Okay, game companies or people that license music to game companies, you do realize it's so much fucking easier to pirate that song off the internet than try to fucking record it off of a livestream of a game.
4407000	4414000	I mean, it just doesn't make any sense why you would even do that, other than the fact that you're just evil is the only thing I can think of.
4415000	4416000	Do you know how easy it is to find music on YouTube?
4417000	4422000	It's seriously easy. It's like, oh, I like that song in Grand Theft Auto. Well, I can't buy the soundtrack for it, at least at the time.
4422000	4434000	So it's like, well, fuck, I'm gonna look up the artist. I'm gonna look up the song. Hey, look, it's a video on YouTube. Oh, look, I can just download it off of YouTube because there's a billion programs out there or websites or whatever to download the music off of YouTube.
4435000	4444000	Or I can just play it and run another audio program and just record it straight off that because that's a thing. So why is it?
4445000	4451000	I used to, with my full duplex sound card, used to be able to get the music off of people's Myspace.
4452000	4455000	I would record while I play and there you go. Perfect digital copy.
4456000	4463000	It's so dumb. I know you're well within your rights to do that, but you're also a dick. You're also a dick for doing that.
4464000	4477000	Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should do it because, if anything, and I did legitimately buy some of these songs I liked from Grand Theft Auto, and I found them because of Grand Theft Auto.
4477000	4487000	So, I don't know, it's just really dumb that they go about this. It doesn't help your image, RIAA. I mean, seriously.
4488000	4498000	Raginator in chat says, I actually had my Super Nintendo's audio cables hooked up to the aux on a stereo and I made mixtapes of game music. Games like Actraiser, Super Girls and Ghosts, Super Castlevania IV, the Star Wars games, etc.
4498000	4503000	Robert M says, Google's actions are due to pressure from the labels, publishers, etc.
4504000	4511000	VX Jason XV says, Twitch doesn't have the staff to screen content as a matter of fact. The fact they're a hundreds of million dollar company is moot.
4512000	4517000	Twitch is made of engineers, designers, administrators, sales, and very few community reps. So, policing is hard.
4517000	4528000	I understand what you're saying with that, but my whole thing is that if you want to be a billion dollar company, you have to have a department that's able to handle some of these regulations and things like that.
4529000	4534000	It's very common in many industries that you have a department that makes sure the products you're putting out there are in compliance.
4535000	4538000	Well, business is hard, so get fucking staff to cover it.
4539000	4544000	That's what I'm saying. And if they don't have the money to cover it, well then it's not a profitable business.
4545000	4554000	I feel so bad for Twitch not having the staff to cover that. Oh, they'll show their money. They're gonna get sued by these guys. I mean, come on. I don't feel bad for them at all.
4555000	4562000	The World 2 in our chatroom says, to add legitimacy to the company, they had to do this. The issue is how they didn't talk to gamers prior to this.
4562000	4569000	The backlash will go away very quickly. YouTube had a big issue with copyright and had to fix a bit of it to get bought by Google.
4570000	4577000	Yeah, and that kind of brings, you know, what a lot of other people are saying is, oh, everybody's abandoning ship and going to Hitbox now, Hitbox TV.
4578000	4585000	Here's the thing with that. I think competition would be great. I would like to see something like Hitbox get bigger.
4586000	4594000	I mean, I know Ustream's kind of a thing right now, but Ustream isn't exactly focused on gaming either. Ustream's kind of gaming's like a little bit of an afterthought over there.
4595000	4602000	Even though it is built into the PS4, I know. But I would like to see something like Hitbox that could really compete with Twitch on that same gamer level.
4603000	4613000	I'd like to see that happen because I think if there was something like Hitbox that had been at that same volume competing for that billion dollar cash from Google with Twitch TV,
4613000	4626000	I don't think Twitch would have made these very quick decisions that, you know, would cause their community to take issue with it and easily pack up and go somewhere else as some of the most extreme people have had.
4627000	4634000	At the end of the day, however, if you think Hitbox TV is some magical island that is immune from all of these problems...
4635000	4636000	Nope.
4636000	4647000	Because when Hitbox gets big enough, guess what? They're going to have the RIA knocking on their door too or whatever company wants to legitimize them and get their money too.
4648000	4650000	And then there'll be another competing company and then we can jump to that one too!
4651000	4655000	I agree with AxeDeft. I blame Metallica. Thank you, Lars.
4656000	4659000	Take it all the way back, right? All the way back.
4660000	4661000	Isn't that kind of where things started?
4661000	4670000	And The World 2 makes a comparison there in our chatroom saying, people said they abandoned Vimeo or Daily Motion or other video sites. YouTube's still alive and well.
4671000	4686000	So, you know, and really, here's the thing about that whole Napster mess. All it took was for somebody to legitimize what Napster was doing and make it just as easy to do things the legal way as opposed to the illegal way.
4686000	4694000	And that's all it took to get people to go to the bright side. And that was Apple with iTunes finally did that. And then, of course, there's millions of knockoffs.
4695000	4697000	And then Napster decided to do that, but it was already too late.
4698000	4707000	It was already too late at that point. But once iTunes was a thing, you had a lot of people that were willing to pay money because it was just as easy as Napster was.
4707000	4713000	I don't necessarily know that tons of people pirated. I mean, this is God. This is like a 20-year-old conversation.
4714000	4725000	But I'm not sure that people were pirating off Napster just because they wanted to steal. They did it because it was easy. I want to hear that song right now. Oh, Napster's got it.
4726000	4733000	It was easy, and I could find, like, if I typed in, you know, an artist's name or something like that in Remix, I could find all these, like, things I've never heard of before.
4733000	4736000	It's like, fuck, I didn't know there was remixes of this song. That was awesome.
4738000	4749000	Alright, anyhow, lots of opinions on this, and I'm sure you guys have more opinions as well. Be sure to email us. Participate. If you want to participate with the show, participate at orangeloungerated.com is the email address.
4750000	4756000	For now, let's travel around the world and check out upcoming release dates. We're almost to the Classic Game of the Week, but first, what's coming out this week? Loki?
4756000	4763000	Not a whole ton. There's the disc version of World of Tanks, at least I think it's a disc version. It's a retail version for $19.99.
4764000	4771000	It's the World of Tanks, was it the, what's their, Combat Ready Starter Pack. It's got a bunch of shit in there.
4772000	4779000	But yes, so you can purchase that at retail now on Xbox 360. This guy of four I promised revisited on the Vita.
4779000	4792000	Akiba's Trip, Undead and Undressed on PlayStation 3 and on Vita. And Risen 3, Titan Lords on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. That's it.
4793000	4805000	Alright, going to Japan and looking at the releases in Japan this week on the Wii U. There's actually nothing on PlayStation 4, there's nothing on PlayStation 3, but on the Wii U this week has the huge release.
4806000	4809000	Zelda Musou comes out this week. You guys know what that is?
4810000	4811000	Hyrule Warriors.
4812000	4818000	It is Hyrule Warriors coming out on the Wii U this week in Japan, so I'm sure there's lots of excitement around that. So that's the big, big release in Japan this week. That is out on the 14th.
4819000	4829000	Going quickly to check the other platforms. The Vita does have Clannad comes out on the Vita as well, and checking the 3DS really quick. No, nothing there.
4830000	4833000	Hyrule Warriors really the big, big release this week in Japan.
4833000	4834000	Dark Sakura.
4835000	4843000	Well, in other releases there's a 1. 1 for the 13th in the UK. And that's Gravity Crash Ultra. That's it.
4844000	4848000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week. Loki.
4849000	4856000	So Capcom announced that they are remaking Resident Evil. It's gonna be coming out early 2015.
4857000	4873000	And it's basically the original Resident Evil getting an HD remix and supposed to be out on, I guess, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Sorry Wii U, no Wii U.
4873000	4882000	And it'll be 1080p and support 5.1 surround sound and, you know, classic and modern schemes and blah, blah, blah.
4883000	4889000	And I gotta be honest, I like the screenshots of this. It doesn't look that great. I mean, I don't know, it doesn't look that updated.
4890000	4896000	But I guess at this point, no, we've run out of ideas for Resident Evil, so let's remake them now.
4897000	4904000	Because they, you know, did that before when they ran out of ideas, so why not? Let's re-remake them.
4905000	4912000	How do you guys feel about remakes? Dark Sakura, I know you're into Resident Evil. Do you think this is a good direction for the series? Or God, no, make it stop.
4913000	4919000	I really have no more feelings about Resident Evil anymore. I was done. I was done after the third one.
4920000	4929000	It could be smart. I mean, they probably are realizing that they've probably pushed the story a little bit further than where they feel comfortable.
4930000	4931000	Or where it can go.
4932000	4936000	Six was really kind of a departure, I guess, from the series. They made it more like action and over the top.
4937000	4943000	Kind of like the movies, actually, if you think about it. Because the movies are like, okay, there's zombies in there.
4943000	4950000	But then it's also Mila Yomich just like fucking going crazy and doing kung fu and all sorts of crazy stuff.
4951000	4952000	The movies are pretty fun if you don't take them seriously.
4953000	4962000	They are fun. See, that's the thing. I don't know anything about Resident Evil. I mean, I kind of get the basic plot, but I can't follow that in the movies.
4963000	4966000	But the movies you don't really need to follow because it doesn't make any sense.
4966000	4976000	Dan and I played through the first three together. And then we played through Code Veronica together. And then after a while, we were sort of like, what can they do? Done.
4977000	4987000	Although I will have to say that Biohazard 2 Gun Survivor is really fun in the arcade. Which is basically Resident Evil with a gun.
4988000	4994000	Look at our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. TigerClaw says, if they're going to remake Resident Evil 1, they can finally get better voice acting.
4994000	4995000	I already did that once anyway.
4996000	5000000	I kind of don't want that. Or at least let me pick. Let me pick.
5001000	5002000	I hope this is not Chris's blood.
5003000	5007000	Oh God, I wish I had that MP3 readily available because that was so frickin' funny.
5008000	5009000	Just relax and play.
5010000	5017000	Raginator says, I'd rather buy play remakes of the first four Resident Evils than buy or play Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6.
5018000	5023000	I would think Resident Evil 4. I mean, I haven't played that game in a while, but I would think it still holds up pretty well today.
5024000	5028000	I mean, I realize it was, what, two gens ago? GameCube, right? PS2?
5029000	5034000	But they've remade it. They've already remade four. They remade four, I think, for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3.
5035000	5036000	Oh, you're right. I think they did.
5037000	5040000	That's why I can't keep track of all these goddamn remakes because they've remade all these games several times.
5041000	5042000	It's true.
5043000	5047000	I don't even know anymore. It's like, okay, he had all these remakes and then Resident Evil 5 and then Resident Evil 6.
5048000	5049000	You know, giraffe fellatio edition.
5049000	5054000	I can't think of Resident Evil 6 without thinking of the frickin' logo that looks like somebody blowing a giraffe.
5055000	5056000	Yeah, it's giraffe fellatio edition.
5057000	5062000	I couldn't tell you anything about actual Resident Evil 6 except, oh yeah, that's the logo where it looks like someone's blowing a giraffe.
5063000	5071000	I know that there's a motorcycle jumping from an explosion and that there's, you know, the logo looks like, you know, a giraffe getting blown. So, that's about it.
5071000	5072000	That's about it.
5073000	5081000	Alright, well, in less giraffe fellatio news, news about Mario Kart 8. Hey, Mario Kart 8 still driving along.
5082000	5087000	Lots of people enjoying that on the Wii U. There will be new content coming out for Mario Kart 8 later this month.
5088000	5094000	August 27th, the day that Mario Kart 8 gets more stuff, including Mercedes-Benz themed DLC.
5095000	5098000	This is already out in Japan, but we're going to be getting it finally on August 27th.
5098000	5103000	And what's pretty cool is that there's also a major update happening to the game on August 27th.
5104000	5113000	Some things that are happening is that your preferred kart customization will be saved to the system, which will shorten the process of choosing what you want your kart to be.
5114000	5118000	Plus, you can copy and edit other players' highlights in Mario Kart TV. That's pretty cool.
5119000	5126000	And the scoreboard area can be selected so you can view your total coins, online record of wins and losses, selection of characters, and so on.
5126000	5131000	The online communication and races will have improved stability, that's a good thing, and other minor fixes to problems.
5132000	5141000	And I believe I read somewhere as well, the button will default to, when you're done with a race, it will default now to next race as opposed to view highlight.
5142000	5146000	Because I don't know how many times I've done that where I hit the A button, I'm just like A-A-A, like I'm just pressing the button real fast, and it goes in the highlight reel.
5147000	5151000	And I'm like, shit, I didn't want that, I wanted the next race. So that's nice to see that happening.
5151000	5161000	Thoughts, hearing that Nintendo is patching Mario Kart and adding new things to it after the fact? I think it's good.
5162000	5168000	It's nice. I don't know about the DLC, it's a little stupid, but whatever, it's free.
5169000	5176000	But Yaris is free. I don't know, it's just skins for cars, it's not really new cars, it's not like anything new to the game.
5176000	5181000	It's just kind of like, ooh, now this car looks like, you know, a different, you know, car.
5182000	5190000	I feel like what this DLC amounts to is it's like, okay, well I'll check it out and I'll play it like one time, after it comes out I'll update the game, play it one time, and then be like, alright, I saw it.
5191000	5193000	And then I'll save it until I have a party, and have people over to play.
5194000	5200000	And it totally kind of throws you out of the whole Mario Kart universe, I mean, because it looks a little weird.
5201000	5203000	Whatever, I mean, you can pretend that you're driving the monopoly car.
5203000	5206000	Just imagine they're cardboard boxes, because it's kind of what they look like.
5209000	5214000	Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, actdef says, this Mario Kart 8 update is going to be awesome.
5215000	5221000	DarkTetsuya says, I'm stoked for the new Mario Kart update, also I believe the MK8 DLC isn't out in Japan yet.
5222000	5225000	There's a trailer that also says 8.27, but it's the Japan trailer.
5226000	5232000	I believe the Mercedes-Benz thing is already out there.
5233000	5239000	So, there you go. Very, very, very, very, very cool.
5241000	5246000	That's that for that, let's go to a simpler time.
5247000	5252000	Before we, when you could not patch games, you could not download and patch games, you could not do that.
5253000	5256000	If the game was broken, it was broken. It's a more classic time for games.
5257000	5258000	Or they would release another cartridge of it.
5258000	5266000	The classic game of the week, where Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find the game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this.
5267000	5269000	There's no Mercedes-Benz in it, but it's awesome.
5270000	5275000	I think I'm going to actually go with a theme for the next few weeks of Capcom CPS2 arcade machines.
5276000	5280000	Because, the CPS2 is awesome. We had some of our best games.
5281000	5282000	As long as you do Quiz and Dragons.
5283000	5287000	Maybe. But, the game I'm bringing up first is Alien vs. Predator.
5288000	5289000	Sweet.
5290000	5294000	Which was one of my favorite beat-em-ups. Ever.
5295000	5300000	You had, basically, a bunch of aliens all over the world. What happens?
5301000	5307000	They have two cyborg soldiers, who was Dutch Schaeffer and Lin Kurosawa, who I would always play at.
5308000	5309000	And then two predators, a hunter and a warrior.
5310000	5314000	And then, they all have melee weapons. Lin has a katana.
5314000	5319000	There's a bladed staff for the hunter, an extendable spear for the warrior.
5320000	5324000	And Dutch doesn't have one, but he has a big cyborg arm and can punch the fuck out of him.
5325000	5329000	I mean, basically, they've got different types of ranged weapons.
5330000	5334000	Like a smart gun, a rapid-fire handgun, all kinds of different things.
5335000	5342000	And, basically, you just play through the whole game, beating up aliens and beating up people who are working with the aliens.
5342000	5345000	Working with the aliens and or trying to breed said aliens.
5346000	5352000	And you sometimes fight the mama alien a few times, especially at the end.
5353000	5356000	Which actually shows a man being ripped in half.
5357000	5361000	It's true. You watch the, he's like the main boss of the game.
5362000	5366000	And then, spoilers, the alien thing comes down and stabs him in the gut.
5367000	5369000	And then she bites his head off and rips his body in half.
5370000	5371000	This was the 90s.
5372000	5373000	So that's species?
5374000	5375000	No, she wasn't trying to fuck him.
5376000	5378000	She was just trying to fuck him over.
5380000	5384000	Anyway, so the game was, I mean, it was really awesome.
5385000	5389000	It was voted as one of the top beat-em-up games by Heavy.com.
5390000	5391000	It was ranked number 12.
5391000	5406000	And it really is one of, I would probably say, it was well received, but I don't think it's appreciated when you compare it to some of the other CPS2 games.
5407000	5417000	And also Kurosawa made appearances in other Capcom games, like Street Fighter Alpha 2, Street Fighter 3, and Namco X Capcom.
5417000	5427000	And her design was actually reused for Ibuki in Street Fighter 3, who had a friend named Sarai Kurosawa.
5428000	5432000	I never realized that those characters were kind of related like that. That's awesome.
5433000	5444000	And then the character, Simone from Cannon Spike, was derived from her appearance as well.
5444000	5459000	There was one of Treasure's designers, Tetsuhiko Kikuchi, said that Mad Stalker, Full Metal Force, and Alien Fish Predators were his inspiration for Guardian Heroes.
5460000	5463000	So there you go. And there's really not too much else to be said about it.
5464000	5471000	It is a beat-em-up. You have, you know, your food hidden in boxes and stuff to help you replenish life.
5471000	5477000	The cabinet does allow you to play up to three people simultaneously. Smaller ones are only two.
5478000	5485000	And you do get the four characters. You have, like I said, you have the two human and the two predator warriors.
5486000	5492000	They also, you know, they have their melee weapon, they have a gun, and then they can pick up grenade launchers and flamethrowers.
5493000	5498000	And the joystick is one of the eight directional joysticks. It has three buttons. Attack, jump, and shoot.
5498000	5504000	So, and the game is set in California, in a place that doesn't exist.
5505000	5506000	Sandrad.
5507000	5511000	Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster having some comments on this game saying,
5512000	5515000	an Alien vs. Predator came out for the Super Nintendo in 93, but it was nothing like the arcade version.
5516000	5521000	And Dungeon Buster says it also never came out in a Capcom collection of any kind, as far as I know, and it stayed in the arcade,
5522000	5524000	which is really too bad. The beat-em-up is really one of Capcom's greats.
5525000	5526000	Obviously it has to be a licensing thing, right?
5526000	5534000	I would think so, and also keep in mind there was an Alien vs. Predator on Jaguar that was probably one of the few good Jaguar games,
5535000	5539000	well at least one of the ones that people mostly got the Jaguar for, that and Tempest 2000.
5540000	5551000	There, and if you think about it now, this was sort of a wishful thinking, you know, type of game at the time, combining the two licenses.
5551000	5556000	And, of course, eventually it led on to us getting an Alien vs. Predator movie, there were comics going on forever,
5557000	5559000	which of course these characters had nothing to do with comics.
5560000	5564000	But, you know, I would have liked to have seen, I would have liked to have seen more, you know.
5565000	5567000	But, unfortunately, no.
5568000	5569000	It was not meant to be.
5570000	5572000	But you do get to see someone torn in half.
5573000	5574000	Just to reiterate.
5575000	5576000	By the Alien Queen.
5577000	5579000	Ripped in half with blood splatter.
5579000	5580000	Awesome.
5581000	5582000	In a 90's Capcom game.
5583000	5584000	Rad.
5585000	5586000	Alright, there it is.
5587000	5588000	Yes, the Jaguar game was a first person shooter.
5589000	5594000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Alien vs. Predator, in the arcade on the Capcom CPS2 system.
5595000	5598000	And did we mention, guy gets ripped in half, blood everywhere.
5599000	5600000	Squish.
5601000	5602000	Alright, not for the squeamish.
5603000	5607000	Alright, that is going to do it here for the first half of our show, we're going to take a quick break guys,
5607000	5608000	and we'll be back with more.
5609000	5612000	We have the football question of the week coming up, including also rapid fire news,
5613000	5615000	and some discussion on some upcoming things.
5616000	5618000	Diablo 3, a little bit of news coming out about that,
5619000	5622000	because the release of that game on Playstation 4 and Xbox One is coming right up.
5623000	5627000	And also, we've talked a lot in the past about Twitch plays Pokemon,
5628000	5630000	but now who's playing Pokemon on Twitch?
5631000	5632000	Glub, glub.
5633000	5635000	Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you guys know, but we'll talk about that.
5635000	5640000	And what could possibly be next when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5647000	5655000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 563 for August the 10th, 2014 already in progress.
5656000	5657000	Welcome to the second half of the show.
5658000	5660000	I'm Rob Roberts, she's Dark Sakura, he's Loki.
5661000	5663000	Continuing on with the second half of our show tonight.
5663000	5665000	Dark Sakura, I don't know if you saw this going on,
5666000	5669000	but there's a little bit of chatter on the Twitter Zs and the Facebooks and all this,
5670000	5672000	but it sounds like GamerX, which was the convention you and I went to a couple weeks ago,
5673000	5675000	doesn't sound like it's going to necessarily be dead after all.
5676000	5681000	And this seems like it might be as a result of all those companies jumping in a little while back,
5682000	5683000	saying that they would kick some money in.
5684000	5686000	Definitely sounds like they're going to go the Kickstarter route with GamerX 3.
5687000	5690000	So sometimes fussing about stuff on the internet is good?
5690000	5695000	Perhaps. I sort of get the sense, and again, it's not like I can speak for them in any official capacity,
5696000	5697000	I can just go off of what I see on Twitter and Facebook,
5698000	5699000	but I'm getting the sense that they're kind of going at this place where it's like,
5700000	5703000	okay, everybody's talking about, we need to do another, we need to do another,
5704000	5705000	so let's see if people put their money where their mouth is.
5706000	5707000	That's kind of the impression I'm getting from it.
5708000	5709000	I'm all for it. I'm all for it too.
5710000	5712000	I don't want to see those guys lose money out of their own pockets,
5712000	5719000	so I hope, I just hope they don't get it out there now to get the money before they have some sort of plan,
5720000	5722000	because my impression is they don't know where they're going to have it yet,
5723000	5725000	and so I hope they at least have that somewhat figured out,
5726000	5730000	because there's talk about, it seems like they're certainly taking it out of San Francisco,
5731000	5733000	but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be out of the Bay Area.
5734000	5740000	It could be in, what, San Jose or near SFO, but I'm seeing talk about what, Portland, Texas, possibly.
5740000	5741000	Portland's been a big one.
5742000	5743000	Yeah, Portland.
5744000	5746000	If it's in Texas, I can't go, and I'm serious.
5747000	5753000	Portland would make a lot of sense, actually, as would Seattle, but Seattle has packs, so I'd support Portland.
5754000	5759000	You can drive to Portland in ten hours, and it's beautiful up there, so we'll see what happens,
5760000	5765000	but best of luck to all those guys over at GamerX. Hope to see you guys back next year, or in two years, however long it takes.
5766000	5771000	Alright, we've got some more gaming news to get to. Let's do some rapid-fire news, some quick stories we want to hit on,
5772000	5773000	even though we might not discuss them in depth. Loki.
5774000	5780000	Alright. So, let's see. More delays, unfortunately. The game evolved,
5781000	5786000	which is going to be the four-on-one multiplayer game by Turtle Rock Studios.
5787000	5793000	Remember, they did the Left 4 Dead series. Unfortunately, it has been pushed back to February 10th.
5793000	5796000	Pac-Man versus the first-person shooter, right? Kinda.
5797000	5802000	Except, instead of Pac-Man, it's like, you know, a giant Cthulhu.
5803000	5806000	This was one of the big, big games at E3. I believe it's Evolve-a, singular.
5807000	5808000	Yes, it's Evolve.
5809000	5813000	Yeah, you said evolved at first, but that's alright. Anyway, yeah, I was looking forward to that game,
5814000	5816000	so that's a bummer to see it pushed back, and everybody's talking about,
5816000	5819000	oh my god, all the games this year are getting pushed back, every game that's coming.
5820000	5823000	This happens every stinking year, that all the Christmas games get pushed back.
5824000	5828000	Well, I think this year it's less more, or less of, we don't want to compete with Call of Duty,
5829000	5830000	and more of, it's just not done.
5831000	5835000	Yeah, and you know what, I'd rather the game be finished, and bugs worked out, and all that good stuff.
5836000	5839000	Hey, I'm just glad that Grand Theft Auto, the PlayStation 4, Xbox One version,
5839000	5846000	still on the financial report for holiday of 2014, so I don't give a shit about Evolve.
5847000	5851000	I want more Grand Theft Auto 5 that you will play, since you said you would.
5852000	5853000	Yes, I will play.
5854000	5855000	Alright.
5856000	5857000	I will punch a hooker in the face just for you, Loki.
5858000	5859000	They have cats, you can kick a cat now, too.
5860000	5861000	Why would I kick a cat?
5862000	5863000	If I throw a cat at a hooker.
5864000	5865000	Why? It's a cat.
5866000	5867000	Can you throw a hooker at a cat?
5867000	5869000	If it was Saints Row, you probably could.
5870000	5872000	This is the power of the PlayStation 4, and I can't throw a hooker?
5873000	5875000	Hookers are people, too. Naked people.
5876000	5880000	No, no, they're not really naked, they're just drawn that way.
5881000	5882000	Yeah, exactly.
5883000	5889000	And then finally, we knew that there was going to be an Assassin's Creed coming to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and Wii U.
5890000	5891000	Assassin's Creed Rogue.
5891000	5893000	Unfortunately, it's not coming through the Wii U.
5894000	5897000	Because Ubisoft has this thing against the Wii U now, I guess.
5898000	5901000	So Assassin's Creed Rogue coming on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
5902000	5907000	The twist this time is that you were an Assassin, but you've switched sides.
5908000	5910000	Now you are, you know, what was it?
5911000	5912000	An Assassin traitor.
5913000	5914000	Nah, you're not with the Templars.
5915000	5917000	Oh, you switched sides, so you're finally a woman?
5918000	5919000	No, you're with the Templars now.
5919000	5921000	I have my hopes up for the Assassin's Creed series.
5922000	5923000	Hey, do you want to play woman Assassin's Creed?
5924000	5925000	No, there's the Vita one, there's the Vita one.
5926000	5927000	It's technically on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5928000	5931000	I have to give a little jab, come on.
5932000	5940000	Remember, hey, you know what, if the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One can't render a woman, what makes you think of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 again?
5941000	5942000	I don't know what I was thinking, Loki, you're right.
5943000	5945000	And definitely not the Wii U. The Wii U can't render anybody.
5946000	5947000	The Wii U can't render anybody.
5947000	5948000	It can only render cartoons.
5949000	5951000	It can only render Mario. Hey, Assassin's Mario.
5952000	5961000	Dude, Mushroom Kingdom Assassin's Creed game, but like with Mario, and just like straight up violence against, you know, everything, that would be totally awesome.
5962000	5966000	Mamma mia, my princess is in another castle, your death is in this one.
5966000	5984000	Alright, and then, let's see, yeah, so, apparently, the compensation rules from the NCAA lawsuit thing are, they're violating antitrust laws.
5984000	6003000	See, I don't understand much of this stuff, but apparently, the US District Court, Judge Claudia Wilken, she ruled that the NCAA rules prohibiting student, you know, the student athletes that were in those games, from receiving compensation for use of their likeness, violates antitrust laws.
6003000	6019000	So, does that mean now that they're gonna have to get rid of those rules, and, you know, allow them to receive compensation?
6020000	6025000	Because if that's the case, then EA's probably like, cha-ching, we can do NCAA games again.
6026000	6029000	Basically calling it unreasonable restrained trade.
6029000	6045000	So, that's kind of interesting, and this is especially, you know, interesting after they've already kind of settled and paid each student $1,000, but it may open it up for more NCAA games now that they've kind of ruled that.
6046000	6048000	Kind of cool to see what happens.
6049000	6051000	I'm sure EA's looking forward to that.
6052000	6064000	The whole legal stuff, there's so much legal stuff, I just don't understand. I don't think anybody does. I don't, I don't, oh my God, I don't, I, how am I supposed to make sense of it even between this and what we were talking about earlier in the show?
6064000	6083000	Basically, you know, they said, you know, enforcing any rules to prevent its members, schools, and conferences from offering to deposit a limited share of licensing revenue in a trust for their FBS football and Division I basketball recruits, payable when they leave the school or eligibility expires.
6084000	6099000	Let's see, so, I guess the injunction allows the NCAA to cap the trust fund at $5,000 for each year of college athlete is academically eligible to play, and the students would be paid upon graduation.
6100000	6111000	So, maybe it opens it up, I don't know. I'm sure EA's looking to anything they can to get that because, you know, that was their big month, cash cow for July.
6111000	6113000	And now they don't have it.
6114000	6120000	Alright, well, let's move on and talk about Rise, Son of Rome. You guys check this out on Xbox One?
6121000	6123000	I don't have an Xbox One, so I can't play that game.
6124000	6129000	If you missed Rise on Xbox One, you can check out Rise, Son of Rome on PC.
6130000	6131000	What?
6132000	6138000	I know, Crytek will be putting the game out on PC at some point this fall, teaming up with publisher Deep Silver, who's going to handle the boxed version of the game.
6139000	6143000	That's crazy, next year you're going to tell me Dead Rising 3 is coming to PC.
6144000	6148000	Or am I going to tell you that, you know, you should have figured this out because of Homefront, but anyway.
6149000	6158000	Rise on the PC will feature some DLC from before, the Colosseum pack, the Mars Chosen pack, the Duels of Fate pack, all this, all this packs, packs upon packs.
6159000	6164000	PC players are also going to have the Ruins multiplayer map, and the game will support 4K resolution.
6165000	6166000	Yeesh.
6166000	6173000	Alright, not supporting 4K resolution, but should still be a heck of a lot of fun, and I know people looking forward to this on the Wii U.
6174000	6184000	That is Hyrule Warriors, and there was a whole Nintendo Direct about it this past week, where they confirmed Ganondorf, Zant, and Ghirahim confirmed as some more playable characters.
6185000	6189000	Who the fuck are these characters? I mean, I understand who Ganon is, but who the fuck are all these other characters?
6189000	6196000	I mean, I really only skipped Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask. I mean, are there that many fucking characters in these games?
6197000	6199000	Yup. There were that many characters.
6200000	6201000	Well, I guess I also skipped Twilight Princess, and...
6202000	6203000	There you go, that's what's wrong.
6204000	6205000	Twilight Princess is great.
6206000	6209000	So, anyhow, you have all that to look forward to. Lots of other stuff about the game to mention too.
6210000	6214000	There's an adventure mode where you get a grid of challenges that looks like the NES Legend of Zelda map.
6214000	6219000	So, Nintendo never afraid to milk that nostalgia a little bit, but you know what? When it comes to Zelda, I say milk it.
6220000	6228000	If you're a club Nintendo member and you buy and register Hyrule Warriors within four weeks of launch, you get alternate Ganon costumes as free game DLC.
6229000	6236000	Unfortunately, I'm hearing there's some other costume DLC that's going to be exclusive to retail, one of them being GameStop, but it sounds like they're going to offer it to...
6237000	6242000	I think they said three different retailers, so hopefully Amazon or Best Buy or somebody else is involved too. We'll see.
6244000	6247000	Also, a Chain Chomp will make a guest appearance as a weapon.
6248000	6249000	Yee, Chain Chomp.
6250000	6255000	And if that isn't your cup of tea, perhaps in Nintendo you are a fan of Princess Peach.
6256000	6260000	And this kind of cracks me up, because you know how we had the Year of Luigi last year, right?
6261000	6264000	Which actually went on for like a fiscal year, because it went on the way to like March, right?
6265000	6266000	Before they finally said, okay, no more Year of Luigi.
6267000	6269000	And then the angry Luigi meme happened after the fact.
6269000	6275000	Well, whereas you had the Year of Luigi, we're going to get the month of Princess Peach.
6276000	6278000	Nintendo putting out a tweet.
6279000	6280000	Gender equality.
6281000	6287000	It's kind of fucked up in a way, but Nintendo putting out a tweet saying, August is National Princess Peach Month.
6288000	6292000	So tell us what you love about the Mushroom Kingdom's glorious rulers. So there you go.
6292000	6297000	The month of Princess Peach. I don't know what else they're going to do to celebrate the month.
6298000	6303000	Maybe they're doing DS games on the, maybe they'll put Super Princess Peach out or something, or I don't know.
6304000	6305000	So there you go.
6306000	6308000	The month of Princess Peach.
6309000	6312000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us? Our very own Princess Dark Sakura.
6313000	6314000	Who would like to have-
6315000	6316000	Connie Queen.
6317000	6319000	How about some Borderlands 2 news?
6319000	6327000	Borderlands 2 has shipped 10 million copies. It is 2K's highest selling game.
6328000	6330000	And Borderlands 2 is awesome.
6331000	6335000	Plus, Borderlands, the pre-sequel is going to be coming out, which is awesome.
6336000	6340000	I got to play it. I sucked at it, but it was fun.
6341000	6342000	That's my song about it.
6343000	6346000	By the way, that's going to be out on October 14th for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
6346000	6353000	In other news, how about Xbox One is getting some in Europe?
6354000	6367000	There will be the digital TV tuner out in October, which is a USB peripheral that will allow you to watch TV on your TV, but with your video game system.
6368000	6370000	Because cable boxes are overrated.
6371000	6374000	I wonder if that's going to bypass the TV tax in the UK.
6374000	6376000	You know about the TV tax, right?
6377000	6378000	Yes, I do.
6379000	6382000	And then, last but not least, more X-Bone news.
6383000	6390000	There will be a white Xbox One coming out with Sunset Overdrive and or Madden.
6391000	6398000	Madden 15 bundle will be $399 without a Kinect and will be out on August 26th.
6398000	6405000	And then, of course, there is the Sunset Overdrive edition on October 28th.
6406000	6408000	Well, the game is scheduled for October 28th.
6409000	6411000	I would only guess that the bundle will be out at the same time.
6412000	6413000	Yeah.
6415000	6418000	This might be finally what gets me to get a white Xbox One for the Sunset Overdrive.
6419000	6420000	I think we'll be good.
6421000	6424000	Because I don't have an Xbox One yet, but I'm going to buy one this holiday.
6424000	6427000	And I wanted to get Sunset Overdrive anyway, so it works out, right?
6428000	6429000	Yeah.
6430000	6433000	Loki, would this bundle encourage you to get an Xbox One?
6434000	6435000	You know, I have to ask.
6436000	6441000	Money is really going to be the factor, being that I will be getting laid off right before that happens.
6442000	6446000	So, not really looking to add any consoles to my library at this moment.
6447000	6449000	But yes, if I was going to buy a console a holiday...
6449000	6455000	Actually, I would probably wait closer to the end of the holiday, because what kind of bundles are they going to be doing?
6456000	6457000	That's what I want to know.
6458000	6460000	The color doesn't really matter. White Xbox will only be pretty cool.
6461000	6463000	I did want to pick up Sunset Overdrive.
6464000	6468000	Well, I hope, if nothing else, I hope you can land a new job quickly.
6469000	6471000	And if anybody in Sacramento is hiring, contact the show.
6472000	6477000	I hope you can land a new job quickly and buy yourself an Xbox One as a celebratory gift would be great, right?
6477000	6478000	Right.
6479000	6481000	Actually, I'd want a PlayStation 4 first.
6482000	6484000	Fair enough. Let's get to the FUGL Question of the Week.
6491000	6495000	You take Facebook and Google+, you slam those words together, you get FUGL.
6496000	6501000	Every week in our Facebook and Google Plus communities, we ask a question of our communities and we read our favorite answers here on the show.
6502000	6505000	I'm a little disappointed at the lack of participation this week.
6505000	6506000	We did not get a lot of answers.
6507000	6509000	Did I just ask a shitty question? I guess I did.
6510000	6511000	What's up with it, you slackers?
6512000	6514000	Alright, maybe the question was just too weird. I don't know.
6515000	6518000	Sometimes we get millions of answers. It's also that Facebook algorithm.
6519000	6522000	Sometimes our statuses will get seen by like 600, 700 people.
6523000	6525000	This one got seen by 140, so maybe that's why. I don't know.
6526000	6528000	You know what I'll blame? I'll blame Messenger.
6529000	6531000	Why not? Everybody else is blaming that for their problems this week.
6532000	6533000	I blame Facebook Messenger.
6534000	6537000	Here's the Facebook Question of the Week and Google Plus Question of the Week.
6538000	6543000	What indie game, not out on Wii U yet, would you like to see ported and released ASAP?
6544000	6548000	After all, we were talking earlier in the show about Dan Adelman and he was a big part of the indie games on Wii U and now he's not going to be there anymore.
6549000	6553000	So what does Nintendo need to get on putting on the Wii U right away? Let's get to the answers.
6554000	6558000	Over on Facebook, Andy R. replies and says, is Rogue Legacy on Wii U?
6559000	6562000	If not, then Rogue Legacy. I just picked it up on Vita and I'm loving it.
6563000	6568000	I probably wouldn't buy it again on Wii U since I can just play on my PS4, but I want to see that game reach as many people as possible.
6569000	6571000	That's a good answer. I mean, you could have the mini map, right?
6572000	6575000	I mean, that's the quintessential use for the gamepad, right? You have a little mini map there, maybe your item.
6576000	6581000	Well, there's not a lot of items, but you can sometimes switch magic or you can see the little profile of your character.
6582000	6585000	I could see that working very well, actually, so that would be cool.
6586000	6595000	Fabrice A. replies and says, the Kickstarter, 90s Arcade Racer. I remember that Kickstarter. That's on its way, right?
6596000	6597000	You were following that a little bit, right, Logie?
6598000	6604000	90s Arcade Racer is still on its way and yeah, one of the platforms it was expected to be out on was Wii U, actually, and it looks awesome.
6605000	6608000	I don't know if they've done any updates recently, but yeah, it looks pretty sweet.
6608000	6618000	Dark Tetsuya responded and said, how about one of the behemoth games like Castle Crashers, Battle Block Theater, or something new in that same style with four-player simultaneous action?
6619000	6625000	Good answer. I think that Castle Crashers is a great, fun little title. I think that would be a lot of fun to see there on the Wii U.
6626000	6632000	All right, let's go over to Google+, where I think now, for the first time, our Google+, and Facebook almost got the same amount of answers.
6633000	6637000	We had three on Facebook, we had two on Google+, so getting close there. Who said Google+, is dead?
6638000	6643000	Act F seems to agree with one of the Facebookers, saying Act F says Rogue Legacy is one I've been thinking about recently.
6644000	6645000	Getting a Wii U port would be pretty sweet.
6646000	6651000	Redertainment says, what titles on a platform I don't own would I like to see released?
6652000	6655000	How about that detox album Dr. Dre is supposed to be working on?
6656000	6665000	What? Is that a game? Do you want to see C&C Music Factory making the video, or what was the other one, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch?
6665000	6667000	It's Criss Cross One, don't forget that.
6668000	6669000	You want to see that on Wii U?
6670000	6671000	I'll make you jump jump.
6672000	6680000	There it is. Those are the answers there. How about you guys here in studio? Any indie games you think ought to make their way over to Wii U?
6681000	6683000	All the games.
6684000	6687000	Yeah, there's a couple indie games I can think of that actually would be really good for the Wii U.
6688000	6690000	There's this indie game called Grand Theft Auto 5.
6691000	6692000	That is not an indie game.
6692000	6698000	There's an indie franchise called Madden. Let's see, what else can we put on there? That would be really good.
6699000	6700000	I want Fairy Solitaire.
6701000	6703000	At least that's actually an indie game.
6704000	6710000	How about, there's another indie series I love. Saints Row would be great.
6711000	6712000	Dude, how about Hotline Miami?
6713000	6720000	Thank you, Darth Vader's actually giving us one. How about, Loki, if you got to go with these, how about Minecraft would be a great indie game?
6720000	6725000	That would be fantastic, since it's on every other fucking platform on Earth, but Nintendo, you just...
6726000	6729000	I think that was Notch's thing, where he's like, I'm not doing it.
6730000	6734000	Well, he pissed them off. Obviously Nintendo pissed them off.
6735000	6738000	Maybe they said, hey, you got to put Mario in there somewhere.
6739000	6743000	The thing is that the Wiimote would actually lend itself well to some of those puzzle games that aren't exactly timed.
6744000	6746000	Like the ones that I like.
6746000	6751000	What about Drunken Robot Pornography?
6752000	6755000	Drunken Robot Pornography wouldn't work on it. It just wouldn't control right.
6756000	6761000	But Fractal, and you can use the Wiimote as a pointer instead, or you ever play Kami?
6762000	6764000	It's an origami-based puzzle game.
6765000	6767000	But you know what I really hope that they put on that platform?
6767000	6778000	I hope they put a really interesting game where you play as this giant robot and you have to move your limbs around and stuff like that.
6779000	6783000	And maybe it could be made by Miyamoto and completely be boring when he showed it off.
6784000	6788000	Because that's really what I want to see, is his fucking stupid ass game.
6789000	6792000	Or maybe, hey, let's make a security game where he guards some building from Rob the Robot.
6793000	6794000	Because that's fucking stupid.
6794000	6796000	I thought you were talking about Mega Man Legends 3 at worst.
6797000	6800000	No, Mega Man Legends 3. Yeah, an indie game like Mega Man Legends 3 would be awesome too.
6801000	6802000	Well you just said Grand Theft Auto.
6803000	6806000	Yeah, but I'm just saying, you know, because that's what we want to see.
6807000	6811000	We want to see a fucking security game, or a game where you play like a bumbling robot.
6812000	6818000	Star Fox? Fuck that. We're not going to show much of Star Fox, but we'll show this piece of shit that he's working on.
6818000	6825000	Look, I understand that you don't want to keep making sequels of games and stuff like that or rehashing old stuff, but make interesting shit.
6826000	6827000	Splatoon looked interesting.
6828000	6831000	Yes, but that wasn't Miyamoto. Okay, that was a team that made interesting games.
6832000	6833000	Well?
6834000	6838000	Well, let's get him making some interesting games. Maybe he doesn't make interesting games anymore.
6839000	6845000	Fuck, I'll take, you know what, Splatoon guys, you make Splatoon and you make some more interesting games because they're fucking not doing it.
6846000	6851000	And, you know, props to the guys making, you know, like the new Zelda game and stuff because that looks fucking interesting.
6852000	6860000	But this shit that Miyamoto's working on, because I, you know, he's the designer of Mario and many other great, you know, properties and stuff.
6861000	6865000	Let's let him work in the corner and work on some more hopefully brilliant ideas.
6866000	6869000	But it's just not happening anymore. He just doesn't have the spark anymore.
6870000	6874000	He's coming up with like a jump to conclusions mat is what he's coming up with.
6875000	6881000	Participate at Orangelaungerator.com for your cards and letters and candy vouchers for Loki.
6882000	6883000	Participate at Orangelaungerator.com.
6884000	6888000	Speaking of Loki, let's get back into some other gaming news now that the frugal hush is over. Loki.
6889000	6898000	Alright, let's see here. This is kind of neat. Duke Nukem Critical Mass on PSP. Never released. Disappeared.
6899000	6907000	But it was supposed to be coming out on the PSP and it was found in the most unlikely of places. The Library of Congress.
6908000	6922000	Apparently, David Gibson, a moving image technician, stumbled upon the game and media related artifacts, I guess, in the library, including a complete playable but never released version of the game.
6922000	6931000	And also it was, I guess, a different version of the game than what was released on the DS.
6932000	6935000	And apparently it was on like a DVD rom or something.
6936000	6943000	So he actually dug through some of the code in there and actually looked at and they showed some of the 3D models. He posted a video.
6943000	6954000	I got to wonder, is that like violating some sort of thing? You know, put digging through someone's source code. I mean, I know it's part of Library of Congress, so maybe everyone has access to that stuff.
6955000	6958000	Exactly. I think that you're answering your own question, I believe.
6959000	6973000	I don't know if he should have been doing that, but whatever. But it's still kind of neat. I don't know if it would have been a great game because it's on PSP and it's not exactly like Duke Nukem 3D or something, but I guess it can't be worse than Duke Nukem Forever.
6974000	6985000	That almost sounds like a dare. That's kind of neat, though. Like, that's a weird way to kind of unearth this new game in a series that is extremely well known, you know.
6985000	6997000	And he's like, you know, now he's saying, hey, you know what, I'm actually going to kind of start digging through here to see if there's any more of these games that are unreleased that have stuff in the Library of Congress. So, hopefully he finds some more stuff.
6998000	6999000	Yeah, I'll be curious to see what else is discovered.
7000000	7013000	Alright, well, something a lot of people will be discovering soon is the new Diablo 3 release. Now, Diablo 3 was already released, of course, on PC, and it was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 last year, I believe.
7013000	7023000	But we have next week, or coming August 19th is the day, Diablo 3 Reaper of Souls, or the Complete Edition, if you will, or Ultimate Evil Edition, they're calling it.
7024000	7032000	It's going to be on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and will also be on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but a little bit cheaper since those platforms already had Diablo 3 releases on them.
7032000	7040000	This is kind of neat, though, is that because the original Diablo 3 on console was out before the generation shift started happening,
7041000	7053000	Diablo 3 is going to have a cross-manufacturer, cloud-saving feature, meaning you could actually take a saved game from Diablo 3 on the Xbox 360 and move it to the PlayStation 4.
7053000	7060000	It's going to be all through saves in the cloud. It's that way it gets around the infrastructure of Microsoft and Sony.
7061000	7071000	You can head over to Blizzard's blog if you want more information on how to do that. What they did is they patched the current Diablo 3 games with a patch where you can export saved data to the cloud with Blizzard,
7072000	7077000	and then you can download that data onto the new game when it's released on the 19th, so that's pretty cool.
7077000	7088000	You can't use it for PC saves, which makes sense because the PC versions of the game, not only are they on a different patch, but they play completely differently.
7089000	7093000	The keyboard and mouse controller makes a huge difference, so they're not going to allow those saves to be cross-platform.
7094000	7102000	I was a little hesitant on if I was going to get Diablo 3 Ultimate Evil Edition or not. I ended up getting it because I do really like Diablo 3, and I'm curious to see what they do with console.
7102000	7109000	They promised, and Blizzard better fucking stick to this or I'm going to be so angry. I'll sue them like that guy did Sony.
7110000	7120000	For real, they said that they're going to be better about the patching this time because the infrastructure of the systems will allow them to be a little more competitive with the PC patches.
7121000	7129000	I am really looking forward to the next PC patch that's going to be doing the greater rifts and some of the seasonal rolling of the characters and things like that.
7129000	7135000	I really, really want to see that. I hope that makes it to the consoles. That would be great.
7136000	7139000	Anybody else interested in Diablo 3 Ultimate Evil Edition?
7140000	7143000	I'm trying to get myself interested in Diablo 3 Any Edition.
7144000	7147000	The game is in much better shape now than it was when it was first released.
7148000	7149000	I've just got tons of other crap to play.
7150000	7154000	It's always sad to hear that it's in better shape now than it was at release.
7154000	7159000	It has more content than it did at release. That's how it should be.
7160000	7166000	And it does. But here's the thing, Loki, it actually does have less content and that's a good thing because that would be the real money auction house.
7167000	7175000	But it's just, you know, come on, folks. You're developing a game and you just release it and you're like, ah, fuck it, I'll fix it later. That's terrible.
7175000	7179000	SSG100mad in chat says, did Shane convince you to get it, though?
7180000	7187000	Sort of. He's yelling from the other room. I helped. He said, what do you want, Rob? Do you want to buy it or not?
7188000	7191000	And I'll just pretty much support your answer and tell you that that's what you should do.
7192000	7194000	And I said, I think I want to get it. And he's like, then you want to get it?
7195000	7198000	I was like, you're right, I want to get it. There it was.
7198000	7208000	So, I'll check that out. I'll be sure to stream that on Twitch or whatever as I'm sure a lot of people will be doing on their PlayStation 4s and Xbox Ones when this game is released on the 19th.
7209000	7212000	Just don't play copyright music in the background or you'll get bleeped.
7213000	7214000	Moving on, DarkSakura.
7215000	7221000	Well, this is a fine kettle of fish that are playing Pokemon.
7221000	7227000	Yeah, we've had Twitch plays Pokemon. Now we have a fish plays Pokemon.
7228000	7239000	Where basically it's, um, a fish is being watched by a webcam that has button inputs over the top of it in a 3x3 grid.
7240000	7248000	So when the fish, by the way, his name is Grayson Hopper, goes to a certain tile in the tank, the camera says, oh, he went up.
7248000	7256000	Oh, he did this. So basically there's a Twitch feed where you can watch a fish play Pokemon.
7257000	7264000	This is the dumbest thing I've heard of all day and it was so stupid that I had to share it with everybody.
7265000	7267000	With our dozens and dozens of listeners.
7268000	7269000	Fucking fish.
7270000	7275000	What's going to happen when that fish is just floating at the top of the tank? Is the Pokemon trainer going to move up forever?
7275000	7277000	You go up and up and up and up and up.
7280000	7281000	Then you get the flute.
7282000	7286000	Then it'll be just like, uh, it'll be just like, uh, Twitch plays Pokemon.
7287000	7290000	Except they did beat it eventually. Do you think a fish will beat it eventually?
7291000	7292000	The fish will die first.
7294000	7295000	I liked Loki's idea.
7296000	7297000	What was Loki's idea?
7298000	7303000	My idea was to have two fish playing a game and it would be a fighting game.
7304000	7306000	So you have two fish fighting each other in a fighting game.
7307000	7310000	Maybe like, you know, Street Fighter or something.
7311000	7314000	Obviously you'd have to have an infinite round time, but it'd be kind of fun to see.
7315000	7319000	Would that be like, um, those beta fish that will like totally get?
7320000	7322000	Sure. You could use those beta fish if you want. I mean, that's fine.
7323000	7326000	It'd be more interesting if you have more fish in there too, I think.
7327000	7331000	Especially in a fast paced, you know, fighting game. It'd just basically be fish button mashing.
7332000	7334000	So they'd be playing Tekken 3?
7335000	7339000	They could play Tekken 3. That's the best part about it is you can adapt it into multiple fighting games.
7340000	7341000	You have a whole tournament.
7342000	7344000	Don't give the internet any more ideas.
7345000	7346000	Kittens play Pokemon.
7347000	7348000	That would be funny.
7349000	7353000	Just have like, smear tuna all over a controller and then have the kittens bat at it.
7354000	7356000	Or lick it until something happens.
7358000	7363000	Now it's going to be insert thing here plays Pokemon. It's like this joke that won't die.
7364000	7365000	Make it stop.
7366000	7367000	Loki.
7368000	7369000	Alright.
7370000	7373000	So speaking of stuff here, let's see.
7374000	7375000	Speaking of stuff?
7376000	7377000	Yeah, speaking of stuff here.
7378000	7379000	Best transition ever.
7380000	7381000	Speaking of stuff.
7382000	7383000	Speaking of stuff stopping.
7384000	7391000	They are reducing the amount of preorders on your, you know, the Destiny Ghost Editions.
7392000	7402000	That's right. If you want the embodiment of Peter Dinklage, you're going to have to just play the regular game and not have like an actual physical thing.
7403000	7406000	This is because it's extremely limited and the preorders have been crazy.
7406000	7410000	They are actually canceling preorders for the Ghost Edition.
7411000	7416000	And honestly, I don't know why you'd spend that much money on a game in the first place, but.
7417000	7419000	Whatever. 150 bucks, I guess.
7420000	7421000	And you got a bunch of cool shit with that.
7422000	7424000	So you'll have to make do, I guess, with the limited edition.
7425000	7428000	So are you saying for the Peter Dinklage version of the game they had to cut it short?
7430000	7432000	They had to reduce the amount.
7433000	7434000	I see.
7434000	7435000	The volume that they had.
7436000	7437000	I see. I see. They only had a small amount available.
7438000	7439000	They only had a small amount available.
7440000	7441000	Gotcha.
7442000	7444000	Dark Sakura, you looking forward to Destiny?
7445000	7446000	No, not really.
7447000	7450000	Were you off the week we talked about Destiny? I can't remember. Were you here?
7451000	7454000	I think I was here, but I didn't get the beta because somebody didn't give me a key.
7455000	7456000	Somebody didn't ask for a key.
7457000	7459000	Somebody didn't care to ask for a key, so that's really what the issue is.
7460000	7462000	But Dark Sakura, it was like Phantasy Star Online with a gun.
7462000	7463000	Good.
7465000	7468000	How long did I play Phantasy Star Online 2? Like a week?
7469000	7471000	It's because they won't release it here.
7472000	7474000	You know why? Because Sega's bitches.
7475000	7476000	I played a patch.
7477000	7478000	Alright.
7479000	7484000	Moving on here to something that will be coming out in an arcade near you soon.
7485000	7487000	It's a redemption machine.
7488000	7492000	I don't know how I feel about arcades, you guys. It's all redemption games these days.
7493000	7494000	It's going downhill.
7495000	7496000	It's just going up and down, up and down, up and down.
7497000	7498000	That's right. Just like this game.
7499000	7501000	That's all you're going to do. You're going to go up and down and up and down forever.
7502000	7505000	It is called Flappy Tickets.
7506000	7509000	As if there weren't enough flappy bird clones in the world.
7510000	7512000	Which, by the way, have you checked out Flappy VoG? Available at VoGnetwork.com.
7513000	7515000	Here's the worst thing about that.
7515000	7521000	And I gotta say, it's because they're using a giant HD monitor for that.
7522000	7527000	First off, I have a big problem with putting a monitor vertical like that and not have a space shooter on it whatsoever.
7528000	7531000	But the fact that they're using it for Flappy Bird is stupid.
7532000	7534000	iPhone games are the new things for arcades.
7535000	7538000	When I went to Milpitas Golf Land it was like Doodle Jump and Infinity Blade and...
7539000	7540000	Oh my god, I've never played this game!
7541000	7542000	Wait, yes I have. It's on my phone.
7543000	7544000	Right?
7545000	7547000	So now you can play Flappy Tickets.
7548000	7549000	And guess what it is?
7550000	7551000	It's Flappy Bird.
7552000	7553000	It's fuckery.
7554000	7555000	That's right.
7556000	7559000	Now what my question is, is how do they make it so that you never hit the jackpot?
7560000	7562000	I'm assuming it just starts scrolling faster and faster.
7563000	7564000	Easy, it's Flappy Bird.
7565000	7567000	Hey, I can get a pretty high score on Flappy Bird.
7568000	7569000	But see, here's the trick.
7570000	7573000	Now Bobby did Flappy VoG and he made sure the game got harder as you play.
7573000	7576000	So I'm assuming they did something similar to that in the Ticket Redemption game.
7577000	7578000	Because I never win the jackpot.
7579000	7582000	There's two games in the arcade that I can win the jackpot on.
7583000	7589000	One of them is the little slot machine game they have at Dave and Buster's where the light spins around in a circle and you have to hit 777.
7590000	7594000	Because the light moves slow enough that it can hit the 7 every time.
7595000	7596000	That I can win the jackpot on.
7597000	7598000	And the only other game I've ever won the jackpot on?
7599000	7600000	Flame and Finger.
7600000	7604000	Sorry, the Namco game where you trace the maze with your finger to loud techno music.
7605000	7606000	I got one on Smoke and Token once.
7607000	7608000	What the fuck is Smoke and Token?
7609000	7610000	It's like a ski jump one.
7611000	7612000	Where you have to roll it down the little thing.
7613000	7616000	It was when I worked at Aladdin's Castle.
7617000	7620000	ActDeft in our chatroom over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says, Flappy Dead Horse.
7621000	7624000	Yeah, this does feel a few months late, doesn't it?
7625000	7626000	Don't give them ideas.
7627000	7633000	As much as I sit here and I bitch about arcades and how I miss the golden age, and I'm sure we all do,
7634000	7636000	I do sometimes have fun like when I go to Dave and Buster's.
7637000	7639000	But you know why? Because alcohol is involved.
7640000	7643000	Mixed with those ticket redemption games. It makes everything fun.
7644000	7646000	You know what's always fun is our mailbag.
7647000	7648000	Why? Because we get to talk to you.
7649000	7651000	You send us emails to participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.
7651000	7660000	And Dark Sakura in our mailbag segment jumps into mailbag, dives in, pulls out from the masses and masses of email
7661000	7664000	that is sent to us every, and I'm saying email in the singular tense this week.
7665000	7666000	Oh, one of it.
7667000	7668000	The email that she's going to read tonight.
7669000	7672000	So Dark Sakura, wow, we had such incredible participation on Facebook and Google Plus,
7673000	7674000	and now our mailbag has one email in it.
7675000	7677000	I want to see four emails next week.
7678000	7679000	Or else what?
7680000	7681000	Fuck if I know.
7682000	7683000	Four of them.
7684000	7686000	We will sit here and play, you know what, if, okay.
7687000	7688000	I'll make you all listen to me sing.
7689000	7690000	Nope, I got it. I got it.
7691000	7692000	This is it, and this is going to work. You ready, Dark Sakura?
7693000	7695000	If it involves Politary, fuck no.
7696000	7699000	No. If we don't get, it's worse, if we don't get four emails in the mailbag,
7700000	7701000	they've got to be quality letters, too.
7702000	7703000	Just not really long.
7704000	7706000	Yeah, don't make them too long, but they've got to be good enough to get Dark Sakura Stars of Approval.
7707000	7708000	If we don't get four emails-
7709000	7711000	If we don't get four emails in the bag for next week,
7712000	7716000	I'm going to play for the Break Music next week, music from Kim Kardashian Hollywood.
7717000	7718000	The fuck you are.
7719000	7722000	So I'm just saying, you're going to get Kim Kardashian Hollywood for your music.
7723000	7724000	I will plug the iPhone into the mixing board.
7725000	7727000	You're going to get Kim Kardashian Hollywood music during the break next week.
7728000	7730000	Shane is running in here going, it has good music.
7732000	7733000	I would rather you torture them with Politary.
7734000	7737000	Well, if I don't get emails, you're all going to find out if it's good or not next week on the show.
7737000	7738000	Just get ready.
7739000	7742000	All right. That's my threat to the listeners this week.
7743000	7746000	The people on the podcast are like, I don't care. I don't listen live. I don't have to hear that.
7747000	7748000	I'll think of something for you, too.
7752000	7755000	Dark Sakura will sing the Politary Hollywood.
7756000	7760000	In the worst possible attempt at singing, which is normal.
7761000	7762000	Read the email, Dark Sakura.
7762000	7766000	Hey, Orange Lounge. Thanks for the entertaining midnight release answers.
7767000	7770000	I waited in line at a GameStop for a full hour for Modern Warfare 3.
7771000	7775000	When I got to the counter, they didn't have my copy and I had to go back at 8 a.m. to pick it up.
7776000	7781000	I watched all my friends play all night in my living room while I ate pizza and drank too much beer. Ugh!
7782000	7786000	Let's pretend it's summertime Christmas! Exclamation point times three.
7787000	7789000	And there are three presents under the tree for you.
7789000	7792000	What are you praying is in those three presents?
7793000	7797000	My sanity, humanity, and a fuck to give. No.
7798000	7799000	No.
7800000	7802000	I got that summertime, summertime Christmas.
7803000	7805000	I'm going to want all Jewish presents, so pencils.
7806000	7808000	You want summertime Hanukkah. You want gelt?
7809000	7811000	Yarmulke and peace in the Middle East.
7812000	7814000	All right. Loki, what do you want?
7815000	7817000	No, that's not actually right. Go ahead and answer, though. I have to think of something.
7817000	7819000	Answer what I want for summertime Christmas.
7820000	7821000	What do you want for your summertime Christmas?
7822000	7823000	Three presents. Three presents.
7824000	7826000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and a UD Pro license.
7831000	7838000	I want world peace. I want, no, what would I want? Totally superficial things I would want.
7839000	7840000	Superficial. Go for it.
7841000	7850000	I want a license to Adobe Creative Cloud so that I can play with Captivate at home.
7851000	7852000	Rob, get an EDU email address. Trust me.
7853000	7854000	I used to have one years and years ago.
7855000	7856000	I'm paying 20 bucks a month for my Creative Cloud.
7857000	7860000	Nice. That's, yeah, because I want access to Adobe Captivate.
7861000	7863000	It's 40 bucks a month if you're not a student.
7864000	7868000	I want, something I don't want to say on there.
7870000	7873000	It's not dirty. It's just something else going on.
7874000	7875000	Beated. What?
7876000	7879000	He wants a huge beaded popsicle.
7880000	7887000	I want dinner at Ruth's Steakhouse or somewhere comparable.
7888000	7891000	I will take Espritu's Brazilian Steakhouse as well. That's what I want.
7892000	7894000	Take you to Rudy's Hideaway for actual good seafood.
7895000	7897000	Anyway, and I want an Xbox One.
7898000	7899000	Mortons. We'll take you to Mortons.
7900000	7901000	I'll go there. It'll work.
7902000	7904000	Alright, Darsakra. What do you want for your summertime Hanukkah?
7905000	7908000	What I want is a house.
7910000	7913000	I would like a PS4.
7914000	7920000	And I would like for all of those poor, poor kittens out there to have happy homes.
7921000	7922000	That's not superficial though.
7923000	7924000	I want a shopping spree at Sephora.
7925000	7928000	I want a shopping spree just like they had on Supermarket Sweep.
7928000	7931000	I want Supermarket Sweep, but I want it to be at Target.
7932000	7938000	Oh my god, that's all I really want. For my one gift, I want Supermarket Sweep to come back on television.
7939000	7942000	I want to be on it at Target in the video game section.
7943000	7945000	You just want it at Fry's.
7946000	7951000	To be honest, I already have the one thing I really want for myself.
7952000	7955000	You know what it is. My good news.
7955000	7956000	Oh yeah, Midna.
7957000	7958000	Oh, my Midna baby is awesome.
7959000	7960000	Dan. I have my Dan.
7961000	7962000	Alright, anyway.
7963000	7965000	What else do I need? I have Dan and a Midna and I have Perler Beads.
7966000	7967000	That's right, Perler Beads.
7968000	7970000	Alright, there you go. That's the email. So participate at Orange Lunch.
7971000	7972000	No it's not. There's more.
7973000	7974000	Oh, sorry.
7975000	7976000	Rob.
7977000	7978000	Then finish the email.
7979000	7983000	By the way, you guys are the most informative, news-based video game podcast I've ever found.
7983000	7985000	And I absolutely love you guys for it. See what you interrupted?
7986000	7988000	Clearly you're not looking very hard. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
7989000	7992000	Much love, EA Skizie from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
7993000	7996000	PS Jamie's the best, grin.
7997000	7999000	Oh, that's why I couldn't interrupt the damn email.
8000000	8004000	Hell yeah. Thank you, EA Skizie. You can come sleep on my couch if you want to.
8005000	8006000	Alright.
8007000	8010000	There you go. Now remember, four emails next week or Kim Kardashian Hollywood.
8011000	8012000	Which, by the way, the chatters.
8013000	8018000	The chatters are saying, uh, nobody email. No emails next week. I'm actually more curious than horrified.
8019000	8021000	And Act Def says, we'll see if Skye lives up to the hype.
8022000	8023000	Oh really now?
8024000	8025000	You dare to challenge me?
8026000	8029000	This bitch will do it and I will be in the bathroom during the entire break.
8030000	8031000	You dare challenge me?
8032000	8033000	I don't even care.
8034000	8036000	Fine. Have it your way.
8038000	8039000	Moving on. On that note.
8039000	8043000	An Anakin is not better than Midna because Midna will bite the fuck out of your cat.
8044000	8045000	Just saying.
8046000	8049000	Moving on. This is an appropriate time to get into the FUs of the week.
8050000	8051000	Why do we have the FUs of the week?
8052000	8058000	Um, because the chat room dares to challenge me on certain things and so we say FU.
8069000	8082000	I have a big FU that I want to say but it is highly politically charged so I will say this way.
8083000	8091000	Research world events before you go around saying one side does this and one side does that because you're not there.
8092000	8093000	You don't fucking know the story.
8094000	8110000	The other thing too is, um, FU to my own general antsiness and to people who don't say anything at Whole Foods but they will block the aisle and just stand there looking at things blankly forgetting that there are other people in the universe.
8111000	8112000	That happens in more places than just Whole Foods.
8113000	8114000	But it really happens a lot at Whole Foods.
8115000	8122000	It's like all of the people with the I'm the only person in the world mentality seem to congregate at Whole Foods and you know what's actually really funny Rob?
8123000	8129000	Try engaging one of them in conversation and then you will see this, is someone talking to me? I don't know what to do.
8130000	8137000	And then they'll be super nice and awesome and have a great day but that's just what happens when you stop and fucking say words to other people.
8138000	8140000	It's a California thing. No one fucking talks to each other.
8141000	8145000	It's like, what are you doing in my world? Ah, this is my world. Bitch, I will talk to you and you will like it.
8146000	8147000	Just saying.
8148000	8149000	Alright, Loki, you're up. Who's the week?
8150000	8155000	Umm, note to self, need to make a new song for F because this one's getting old.
8156000	8166000	And then umm, I think it's a little unreasonable that it took them five minutes at the window to pour me a soda at McDonald's today.
8167000	8168000	Five minutes.
8169000	8174000	Because originally he gave me my soda with ice in it. Yes, I know, first world problems.
8174000	8182000	That's not the point. It takes literally 30 seconds to, not even 30 seconds, like 10 seconds to dump ice out, fill soda back up again.
8183000	8189000	Yeah, five minutes of him wandering around and he comes back, do you have your receipt? I'm like, oh, that's where you get the soda. Sorry, sorry.
8190000	8191000	I'm like, what the fuck are you doing in there?
8192000	8193000	You should have threatened to go Super Siam.
8193000	8200000	I'm like, seriously, I'm like sitting here and there's like cars backed up all through the drive-thru and it's just like, you are fucking dumb.
8201000	8214000	If you cannot get this job, then you do not stand to fare very well in the workplace out there, I mean, because it's just, it's a lot harder than pour soda, pour drive-thru window, I mean, come on.
8214000	8230000	Alright, my F.U. of the week, I can't get into details because I just pretty much have a policy that I don't really talk about my daytime stuff here on OLR, but there was a lot of drama this week and I'm just going to say F.U. to all of that in general. Thank you very much.
8231000	8232000	I will double that too, Rob.
8233000	8234000	Thank you, I appreciate it.
8234000	8247000	Alright, let's move on into just a few more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your phone calls at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, but you got two more stories to get through before we get there. Loki.
8248000	8269000	Alright, so Sony is killing off PlayStation Mobile on Android. They are removing support after Android 4.4.2 and I guess access and re-downloads on 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 will be up to the publishers.
8270000	8282000	They're saying that, I guess, I don't know, it's really just their Android devices. They had some really weird Android devices, I remember, and I guess the Xperia Play would fall into that as well.
8283000	8293000	Now, let's not forget that this doesn't mean PlayStation Mobile is going away because PlayStation Mobile is still pretty prevalent on the Vita and, of course, the PlayStation TV or Vita TV.
8294000	8306000	So, yeah, they'll still be available to that. I'm actually looking forward to, hopefully, being able to publish on that someday because you can do that for free. So, that's awesome.
8307000	8311000	So, yeah, check those out. That's it.
8312000	8317000	Do you think, is this a surprise at the end of the day that this got canned?
8318000	8330000	No, I don't think it's a surprise because, I mean, after all, it was only available to certain devices and who really needs another fucking storefront out there in the Android marketplace? It's already fragmented enough.
8331000	8337000	I think anyone that's really going to publish on PlayStation Mobile probably could just publish to Android pretty easily.
8337000	8347000	Fair enough. All right, I got one more story for you guys here and that has to do with some hilarity that happened on the mobile marketplaces this week.
8348000	8353000	Have you checked out this awesome new game that's on the iPhone marketplace called Dargan Quest?
8354000	8360000	That's right, Dargan Quest 4 from Square Enix hit the iTunes Store this week.
8361000	8372000	As you might be aware, the legendary series Dragon Quest was being released on the iPhone, iPad, and all this stuff. I believe it's coming out on Android as well.
8372000	8384000	It's available on the iTunes Store, but when it first came out in the New Zealand App Store, it was called Dargan Quest, who's misspelled, which led to Twitter hashtag hilarity.
8385000	8394000	So, there it is. And everybody was getting into a hashtag called Dargan Quest My Game, where they would purposely misspell things.
8394000	8403000	And that led to things like Bored Lands, Mince Craft, and my favorite, Murdered Soup Suspect.
8404000	8409000	So, there you go. Love it. Dargan Quest there. Obviously, that was fixed.
8410000	8421000	What was not a typo, the price that they were asking for the game, $18.99. I don't know if that was New Zealand dollars or something, but Square Enix games tend to be a premium price.
8421000	8422000	Square Enix Premium.
8423000	8433000	Yeah, I don't know. As much as I would like to play this game, I have not really been swayed by a lot of the Final Fantasy releases on iOS.
8434000	8436000	3 and 4 were okay, I guess, but they really were just the DS.
8437000	8438000	It's just the lack of buttons that does it for me.
8439000	8446000	Yeah. I would rather see it on the Vita or the 3DS. I would much rather see it there, where I can actually have buttons.
8446000	8455000	You know what's still awesome? It was a PSP game, but it's still awesome on the Vita, too, is the Final Fantasy IV, the After Years collection.
8456000	8461000	Sorry, the After Years wasn't exactly a great game, but the remake of Final Fantasy IV, the sprite-based remake that was with it, was great.
8462000	8465000	And, you know, playing the After Years is okay, because at least it's still pretty much the same game.
8466000	8467000	Yeah, that'd be awesome if they did that for 6.
8468000	8470000	I would love to see that, but I'm just not going to hold my breath.
8470000	8477000	Alright, that is it for the news that we had tonight, so it's time to open up the Skype line and let you guys have a say.
8478000	8485000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call, and talk about whatever is on your mind tonight.
8486000	8490000	We have a little bit of time, so hopefully we get some calls, or it's going to be a short show tonight.
8491000	8496000	We'll see. I'm going to check in with Loki while I bring up the tweets to see if we have any Twitter topics at twitter.com.
8497000	8499000	Let me check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute topics tonight.
8500000	8506000	Yes, there was supposed to be a brand new Elgato game capture card, and it's been leaked out already what it is now.
8507000	8522000	Game Capture HD 60, it's going to record Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Wii U gameplay, built-in live streaming to Twitch, YouTube, and more with webcam and overlays, and 1080p and 60 frames per second capturing for $179.99.
8523000	8525000	It probably is exclusive to Best Buy.
8526000	8530000	Still sounds pretty nice. Hey, we have a call coming in already, let's get to it. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8531000	8532000	Hey guys, it's Jason.
8533000	8534000	Hey Jason, buddy, how you doing?
8535000	8536000	I'm busy, needless to say.
8537000	8541000	Yeah, I miss having your face in studio, but I understand you've got your own life to live, so glad to hear things are going well.
8542000	8545000	I have my own life to live in the greater western states of the United States.
8546000	8548000	Hey, you know what, travel while you're still young, right?
8549000	8551000	Well, never stop traveling, fuck your age, but you know.
8552000	8554000	That's true, that's very true. So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8554000	8563000	I'm really, really disappointed with how the Twitch discussion turned. Your point, Rob, up front, was the correct point.
8564000	8567000	It was heavy-handed, and they rolled it out wrong, period.
8568000	8575000	That's like, if the conversation had just stopped there, or kind of made better alternatives, I mean, you said that.
8576000	8583000	You went on to say, well, if they had said that this was going to be a change, that it may not have been as visceral a reaction as they got.
8584000	8593000	But, if there's one thing I cannot stand, and I very much developed this over the last year, I cannot stand trivialization of decisions.
8594000	8601000	The way that Twitch was personified was, fuck the users, we're making millions, we don't care if you're inconvenienced.
8602000	8610000	Nobody has that attitude. No business owner will ever have that attitude. Ever.
8611000	8612000	Are you sure you want to put that out there?
8612000	8615000	Have you heard of this company? It's called Comcast?
8616000	8624000	I'm just saying, Jason, I respect that viewpoint, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not sure you really want to say that.
8625000	8628000	That's not the way Twitch went about this decision. That's the point that matters.
8629000	8634000	And even Comcast, yes, they fucked over their support decision. It sucks.
8635000	8639000	I've never had a problem on the phone with them anymore, but fuck Comcast, that's not what this discussion is about.
8639000	8649000	Twitch did not choose to dole this out so poorly. They made a mistake in their implementation, but this is business.
8650000	8655000	We made the point about the fact that this is going to happen to any other company, and you want to know what's even worse?
8656000	8661000	Music copyright enforcement is worse in Germany. Do you guys know that Hitbox is based out of Austria?
8661000	8679000	If they get remotely popular, at least the people in country are going to be dicked over even worse, super fast, because GEMA, the German musical association, whatever German word it actually corresponds to, European enforcement is a hell of a lot worse than it is in America.
8680000	8685000	So far, Jason, I really don't disagree with you. Yes, I made a Hitbox account. Like I said, I like the competition.
8686000	8687000	Which I did at the same time as soon as you said that you did.
8687000	8697000	But the very next day after all this, Jason, I did a two-hour stream on Twitch over the weekend. So it's not like I'm planning on abandoning Twitch. But I also don't play copyrighted music in the back of my streams.
8698000	8704000	However, I'd like to be able to stream Grand Theft Auto 5. What the hell game are they on?
8705000	8711000	I'd like to be able to stream Grand Theft Auto 5 when it comes out for the Playstation 4 and not have to worry about the soundtrack and things like that.
8712000	8722000	But I also kind of take the good with the bad. They're not going to do anything to live. And that is a point that we didn't say that I really should make sure is out there.
8723000	8728000	They're not changing anything with live. They can't run this software on live and do that type of stuff.
8729000	8736000	And I don't have this delusion that people are going into my feed and saying, oh, I'm going to watch two hours of Rob Roberts playing this game.
8736000	8747000	There might be like, I could probably count on one hand the people that might actually do that. But I can do more YouTube things or something that balances out the Grand Theft Auto 5 I play.
8748000	8756000	So I'm not totally heartbroken about this. But you're right. It's the way that they did it. And I, in general, you know I hate this about YouTube.
8756000	8766000	I really hate the whole thing where it's, I have no power against these people that I would argue don't really hold the copyright either. Copyright trolls.
8767000	8774000	To be fair, nobody besides Twitch potentially knows what the actual appeal button is, how that's going to work.
8775000	8783000	And that's not cool either. But I'm willing to cut them a little slack because at least in the AMA they said we made a mistake.
8784000	8791000	Okay, this shit's going to take a little time to iron out. Nothing's going to change overnight, even when the YouTube buyout happened.
8792000	8794000	You know, we all knew the changes were going to happen tonight, but they were going to come slowly.
8795000	8797000	Not so slowly in this case.
8798000	8803000	Yeah, I guess that's true. It may not have happened overnight, but when it happened, it happened big, didn't it?
8804000	8810000	Yes, yes it did. And all of these points, all of these points are valid and correct and I love the fact that you made them.
8811000	8818000	There was a streamer, speedrunner that I follow, a friend of mine from New Mexico growing up that really, really irked me at the same time.
8818000	8828000	Because, hey guys, let's move to Hitbox. And I ask him why. He says, oh, because Twitch fucked around my stream and my viewership went from 60 to 8 numerous times over the course of the stream.
8829000	8837000	Because that couldn't be the flagrant abuse and bullshit that people were causing on a single network because they were pissed off about these sweeping changes.
8838000	8842000	Like, legitimately or not, I don't fucking care. There was a lot of bad stuff that was going down that day.
8842000	8849000	And what a surprise, a massive influx of bullshit is going to hamper a network. I'm shocked. No, I'm not.
8850000	8854000	The fucking first day, MMO, SimCity, Diablo, everything.
8855000	8861000	Like, scale is the hardest thing to do for people and for everything. For people, technology and for anything else.
8862000	8872000	And I'm, I just, I don't want to, I don't want to dissuade people from their choice and if something is wrong, you should absolutely use something else.
8873000	8884000	But just the slightest bit of consideration of the fact that one day later, things will probably be okay, but the day of when the news and the blogosphere and the Twittersphere and everything else is going apeshit over something.
8885000	8886000	Yeah, shit sucks. It goes sideways.
8886000	8893000	To be fair, and you clearly are very passionate on this topic, but I love that. You know, as an independent broadcaster, I'm passionate about this stuff too.
8894000	8899000	But to be fair, isn't this kind of internet culture? Don't we do this all the time? Isn't there somebody we're mad at every day?
8900000	8908000	Of course it is. And I was thinking, when I was thinking about this topic, when I was thinking about the fact that I was going to call in, my brain jumped back to the last time that I did exactly this.
8908000	8914000	SimCity. That everybody was dogging on the fact that SimCity was fucked up because it was such a server-side geared game.
8915000	8931000	And I came out in defense saying, this happens every MMO, this happens every online game, and yeah, you can capacity plan, but until you have hundreds of thousands of users at the same time, something inevitably fails. Period. That is technology.
8931000	8937000	That's true, but not to dredge an old topic, but I think the real question was, should SimCity have gone online only in the first place?
8938000	8939000	Definitely a whole different topic.
8940000	8950000	And maybe the answer is no, considering where we are. But yeah, anyway, I just call it the fact that I know somebody that works there now, and he's a really, really good friend of mine.
8950000	8961000	Call it the fact that I've now been in the middle of this professionally because I work for a startup, and because I've always been interested in this culture.
8962000	8971000	Gaming, technology, anything modern is basically the way that I would describe it. Modern technology in gaming and media. I've always been super interested in it.
8971000	8987000	And until the last two, three years, I've always been on the outside in. I feel, I consider myself, I have my visceral reactions about things. I say stupid shit. I've gotten called out for it. I'm going to continue to make these mistakes.
8987000	9007000	But especially for something like this, where I feel I have a lot more hands-on knowledge than most other people. It is rude. I consider it rude to personify anyone with the quickest decision to fuck over their users when they entered into this business.
9008000	9021000	Twitch was started for a reason. That hasn't changed yet. They went all in on that by the closure of Justin TV. And it's just a really big deal to me, possibly also because I'm involved in these sort of processes now.
9022000	9032000	And I know what goes into any sort of a technical decision. The reason why this was such a joke is because copyright enforcement is not built for gaming and exceptions like Rock Band and Rocksmith, etc.
9032000	9043000	It says this person has a legal claim to it, so we have to throw the blanket law enforcement on top of it and oh shit, there's an edge case. A very big one in the world of gaming.
9044000	9046000	And so here we are with no easy answer.
9046000	9073000	Right. Yeah, we really don't. And I truly do hope that one, the drama is going to subside. It already did as far as I can tell, as far as I care. But two, I can only hope that they continue to make these worthwhile, call them backtracks, but enhancements to make sure that their resolution to any of these complaints and more is handled responsibly.
9073000	9077000	Jason, I love the call. I love the passion. I gotta get some more calls, however.
9078000	9080000	Would you like me to end it on a positive note? Please.
9081000	9085000	Why did Susan bring two pairs of pants to her golf game? Why? In case she got a hole in one.
9086000	9091000	Thank you, popsicles that I ate just about ten minutes ago. I'm hanging up on you.
9091000	9092000	Works for me. Have a good night.
9093000	9104000	Bye. Well, very well stated case. Very, very good. Let's move on. Our phone is ringing and we got more calls coming in, so let's get to it. Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9105000	9107000	Hello. This is 13X Forever.
9108000	9118000	Hello, 13X Forever. I have seen your name on like the Twitters, and I see your face. Hello. I have seen your name on the Twitters and so forth. I don't think I've heard you on this show, but maybe like one other time. Welcome back. What's up, buddy?
9118000	9120000	No, no. I never called in.
9121000	9123000	Oh, well, first time caller then.
9124000	9132000	Yes. I live on the other side of the planet, so it's kind of hard to call in when you're on the face.
9133000	9134000	Wait, where are you from?
9135000	9136000	I'm from Russia.
9137000	9146000	Oh, my gosh. From Russia. Wow. So, I don't think we've had a Russian caller before that I can think of. I know we've had, you know, Switzerland and we've had Europe and I think Scotland we had a guy.
9146000	9147000	Not Russia.
9148000	9150000	Switzerland is in Europe and so is part of Russia.
9151000	9156000	Sorry, I meant Britain. But anyway, all that American ignorance aside, what's up, my friend?
9157000	9164000	So, I want to talk about great injustice that you did last week.
9165000	9166000	Uh-oh, what'd I do?
9166000	9173000	I want to talk about a great game that just recently came on Steam. That is Trails in the Sky.
9174000	9182000	Uh-oh. Your audio is cutting out. I don't know if you can hear me, but your audio just cut out. Just check your connection there.
9183000	9184000	Hello?
9185000	9187000	Yep. Can hear you. What is the game?
9188000	9191000	Oh, you're cutting out again, my friend. I don't know if that's...
9192000	9193000	I think it was Trails from the Sky or something.
9194000	9195000	Trails in the Sky was the game?
9196000	9197000	That sounds like it to me.
9198000	9202000	Yeah, but the audio is cutting out. I can hear myself though. Try again.
9203000	9204000	Yeah.
9205000	9207000	Oh, it's like he says something and then it just like cuts out right away.
9208000	9213000	No, I want to hear what our Russian friend has to say. He's even making a face like, God damn it.
9214000	9220000	Yeah, Jason is suggesting shut off the video for a minute. Go ahead and shut off your video and that'll help your bandwidth.
9221000	9222000	Can I shut it off on my end?
9223000	9224000	Hello?
9225000	9234000	Yeah, you're cutting in and out and we probably have to have the video cut in order for you to have the bandwidth. That's probably what is happening.
9235000	9237000	Okay, the video just shut off. So try again, my friend.
9238000	9239000	Is this better?
9240000	9243000	Yes, we can hear you now. Okay, so what was the great injustice we did?
9248000	9249000	Hello?
9249000	9256000	Yep, we, uh oh. Oh my gosh, it cut out again. I am so sorry, my friend. I hate to do this. I've got to cut it out.
9257000	9258000	Send us an email.
9259000	9261000	Please send us an email. Please. I'm so disappointed. Stupid internet.
9262000	9264000	Email us and I'll read it. I promise.
9265000	9270000	Akuma JP in chat says, thanks Obama NSA. Seriously. Alright.
9270000	9276000	All right. It says this guy's calling in from a Russian sub. I don't think it was a sub cause I could see, I could see his background.
9277000	9281000	He had like a giant copy of bravely default sitting back there. So that's a sub.
9282000	9283000	You're right. They don't let those on subs.
9284000	9290000	That's right. I'm sad or I'm so sorry, my friend. I was excited to have an international call and then it cut out.
9291000	9295000	But I want to know what I did, what the injustice was that we did. We didn't find out what that was.
9295000	9302000	And I first thought when Jason called in, he was mad at us too. Cause I thought that whole point of that call was you said this, but.
9304000	9308000	All right. Who else is mad at us tonight? Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9309000	9312000	I have no reason to be mad at you whatsoever, Mr. Rob Roberts.
9313000	9314000	Hey Rama. How are you doing?
9315000	9316000	I'm pretty good. How about you?
9317000	9322000	I'm, I'm sad because I wanted to talk to our Russian guy, but internet is internet. So, Oh well.
9323000	9324000	So what's up buddy?
9325000	9335000	Yeah. I have to, you know, this whole pulling down, take down notices and so forth coming from a person that goes to conventions.
9336000	9340000	I deal with this shit every single time I go to YouTube.
9341000	9345000	Interesting. How, how, how, how is it similar in that context?
9346000	9355000	Okay. Let's say team team OLR goes up one stage and we do this awesome skit to ABBA. Okay.
9356000	9367000	Yep. I go and upload it a couple of days later, I'll get an email saying that either the copyright people who hold music from ABBA don't like it.
9368000	9374000	They want it pulled, or it can be blocked in certain countries or it gets muted altogether.
9375000	9378000	I have seen that type of thing happen now that you're mentioning that. Yeah, totally, totally.
9379000	9385000	Like, uh, yeah, those, like the performances that are camcordered and that automated stupid software picks up a match, right?
9386000	9387000	Yes.
9388000	9389000	And how dare somebody try to rob me of my ABBA?
9390000	9398000	Exactly. I mean, I just got an email from YouTube last night of a complete masquerade that I recorded got muted.
9398000	9405000	So I pretty much had to go in and explain, I'm using this under fair use. I'm just putting it out there for everybody to watch.
9406000	9414000	And I have allowed, um, I'm looking at my list here. I have anywhere between 30 to 50 videos I have to manually go in and argue fair use under.
9415000	9423000	And I usually will win them because number one, I don't have to monetize because you really can't make any money off of somebody making a fool of themselves on stage.
9424000	9426000	Right, right. Exactly. Yeah. It's like you're not making money off it. So.
9426000	9432000	So what, what can Twitch do in this situation?
9433000	9447000	Um, well, this is something that that's done at conventions. If you notice how we go to various con video rooms, you'll see they're showing different series and so forth before they're able to show the series.
9447000	9458000	They have to get permission, whether it's this Warner brothers, whoever, whoever holds license. And if they give you the permission to do it, you can.
9459000	9468000	That's what Twitch needs to do. This might go into a monetary licensing thing. Like the reason why, you know, we gave y'all gave middle finger to lie at 365.
9468000	9480000	Right. But this is what it might come down to. If Twitch, if they want to keep the Twitch users happy, they can do this trees, whatever means they might have to go out and drop money on a blanket license in order to do it.
9481000	9492000	And depending on the cost, they might have to send that out there. I don't stream on Twitch. I don't know. So if it's free to do certain amount, but then you have to pay for a certain tier.
9493000	9503000	If you, if those price quotes jump because licensing, they'll have to straight out say, look, we had to get this blanket. They had to get this license. You have to pay more for it.
9504000	9514000	So you could do whatever you want on Twitch done and done. It's either you could do your less plays in this with, with your favorite music or without your favorite music.
9514000	9526000	And if you want your music that badly, contact the licensee holders and see they'll give you a license to do it. But between you and me, most people on Twitch, YouTube don't even have that type of money.
9527000	9539000	There's a pretty well known list out there that somebody is keeping. And it's like, I don't know if it's like a Wiki or whatever it is, but it's like a list of these are the game companies that will allow you to monetize things on YouTube.
9539000	9549000	I kind of feel like I'm getting from what you're saying that Twitch needs to be responsible for having their own list that is built into the system of what you can and can't broadcast. Is that what I'm kind of hearing?
9550000	9559000	Yes. And, but, but you, sorry, just saying what's interesting about it is that what's interesting about that whole thing Rama is that Twitch is built into the PlayStation four.
9559000	9572000	And that's a huge selling point of the PlayStation four is the ability to instantly share your gameplay. So I kind of feel like if you release a game on the PlayStation four, you know that your game's going to be able to be streamed on the internet.
9573000	9579000	And I've heard of that, you know, they can actually block, like, I don't know what it is, like the ending or certain scenes or things like that. You can block that.
9580000	9588000	But I have not heard yet of a game released on PlayStation four that just flat out would not stream on Twitch with the exception of play room. But that was a completely different circumstance.
9589000	9604000	Because honestly, you, okay, in the, in the Sony kingdom, do you really think Sony music is going to pop shit with Sony computing entertainment? Think about which division brings home the most bacon.
9605000	9610000	Right now? It's not the television branch, that's for sure.
9610000	9621000	Right now it's like Sony computing is pretty much bringing in more, probably bringing in more money than Sony music, probably. I may be wrong, but I'm just saying, you know.
9622000	9623000	I don't know, Sony Pictures probably does alright too.
9624000	9636000	Yeah, of course. And same thing happens with AMVs. A lot of times when it comes to AMVs, you're either going to catch a copyright strike from either the licensee of the anime or the licensee of the music.
9637000	9647000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat saying, and I didn't realize this, NBA 2K14 won't stream the audio. It also won't save the audio on Xbox One record that.
9648000	9656000	So it won't save the licensed soundtrack audio or it mutes all gameplay audio because that's very interesting. It's almost like a little bit like we knew this was coming.
9657000	9664000	And so EA did that or EA maybe saw ahead of the curve or something or maybe it was part of license agreement. I don't know. But, uh, interesting.
9664000	9673000	I'm going to say it's the whole thing because with these new sports games, it's like they have like these feature tracks by these artists and it's like, yeah.
9674000	9682000	If you stream this, these artists are not going to get their money and they're going to pitch off it. Sorry, something got caught in my throat. But you see the point I'm trying to get at.
9683000	9699000	And Bobby says it's all audio. See, I would think that it would just mute the lights. Like it would be better if they could build it into the game where at least you could still have, you know, the sneakers squeaking on the court and that type of sound effect, but just not have the license audio when you're streaming online. You think the game could be smart enough to do that, but I don't know.
9700000	9715000	No, it's probably like the same audio output is going through. And besides, I don't know about you, I probably have more fun watching people on Twitch streaming NBA 2K14, hearing the conversations between each other, like the insults and the shit talking because that shit's funny.
9715000	9729000	Yeah. So weird. All right. Well, Rama, thank you for the interesting comparison with the conventions and a thing to think about. It just goes to show that, you know, we need to re-examine some of the copyright law in this country with a lot of this new technology we have.
9730000	9734000	All right. Rama, take care, my friend. Anime Jam session Tuesday nights here at VOG.
9735000	9736000	Damn right.
9736000	9737000	All right. Take care, buddy.
9737000	9738000	You too.
9738000	9739000	All right. Bye.
9739000	9750000	That is it, you guys. I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line. Thank you guys for calling in. I'm sorry to those who didn't get through, and I'm really sorry to our friend 13 Forever who had the internet connection problem there.
9751000	9760000	But again, please email us. Participate at orangelaundry.com. You can always tweet us as well. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We look forward to hearing from you guys in one way or another in a future week.
9761000	9765000	Other last minute stories, Loki, real quick before we close up shop tonight.
9765000	9776000	Yeah, actually I got a few things. So Microsoft apparently is going to be offering indie developers on Xbox One free Unity Pro licenses.
9777000	9787000	It's going to be specific, though. Xbox One only Unity Pro licenses will be offered to qualified developers, and they're basically on the lookout for promising titles.
9788000	9801000	All right. This is kind of cool. Apparently, the original Pikmin on GameCube could be played on Windows.
9802000	9814000	There's a file actually on the disk if you dump the ISO and add a DLL to it and do a couple of folder renamings and add some stuff to a shortcut.
9814000	9819000	You can actually play the game in debug mode through Windows natively, which is kind of cool.
9820000	9827000	And then, let's see here. Apparently, Resident Evil is going to become a TV show.
9828000	9829000	Oh boy.
9829000	9837000	Yes. Along the lines of, they're saying, Gotham. They're saying it's going to be called Arklay.
9838000	9839000	Hmm.
9840000	9842000	And I have zero interest in that.
9843000	9847000	And then, I'm predicting the future right here, okay?
9848000	9857000	There is a guy who goes by Chromemods that does, like, Grand Theft Auto mods right now, and he's got some really powerful one for Grand Theft Auto Online.
9858000	9862000	And he's added the ability to do different animations that they have built into the game.
9863000	9872000	And they have a scene in the game where you're taking a picture of this starlet or whatever that's getting fucked, basically.
9873000	9875000	So, how did they spin this?
9875000	9880000	Now, there's a mod that allows you to rape other people on Grand Theft Auto Online.
9881000	9882000	Hmm.
9883000	9887000	Because it allows you to do the fucking motion, and you lock down a player on the ground.
9888000	9895000	I mean, granted, it's just trolling and silly, but how long is it going to take a news outlet to do that forehead line?
9896000	9898000	Yep. That is a Tumblr tag waiting to happen.
9899000	9902000	That is definitely, you might want to rethink those mods.
9902000	9904000	Quick, sorry, was there other last minute stories?
9905000	9906000	That's it.
9907000	9909000	Alright, I want to do some quick Twitter questions, topics here before we close out shop tonight.
9910000	9911000	Some tweets from last week's show.
9912000	9916000	Flaco Jones tweeting us about the Lay's Talk, the chip talk at the beginning of the show. Remember that?
9917000	9923000	Flaco says, yay for Lay's Talk. My take. Wasabi, amazing. Bacon Mac, okay, but way better cheese and bacon chips out there.
9924000	9926000	Mango and cappuccino, both gross.
9927000	9931000	I feel pretty much the exact opposite of Flaco. I thought mango and cappuccino were the two best.
9932000	9933000	Nasty.
9934000	9935000	Mango was kind of an acquired taste.
9936000	9946000	My rank, just saying, the bacon mac, cappuccino, the mango, which I actually did not hate the mango, and then I will not try the wasabi just because I hate fake wasabi.
9947000	9954000	My final ranking would be cappuccino was the best because they tasted like Taco Bell Cinnamon Twist to me.
9954000	9957000	Cappuccino was way the best. Way, way, way up there. Mango would be next.
9958000	9963000	Followed by probably wasabi, actually, because I don't have the hatred for wasabi that my co-hosts do.
9964000	9970000	And then last place, bacon mac. Just unoriginal and it'll win anyway and it's going to piss me off.
9973000	9979000	Blinrich on Twitter tweeted us saying, just saw your featured game from last week's show on Inside Edition.
9979000	9986000	Reminds me of the old 900 number controversy. Was that Mylon's Secret Castle? I was trying to figure out how that related to the 900 number controversy.
9987000	9991000	I don't remember. Was there something with that or it could have been about ZZT from two weeks ago.
9992000	9993000	Maybe.
9994000	9997000	Maybe because I'm not sure sometimes when they say last week that could actually be the week before that they were listening to.
9998000	10000000	I don't remember there being a 900 number controversy for anything.
10001000	10008000	Brad from Pod Culture, by the way, says, that is our geek cuisine on this week's Pod Culture.
10009000	10011000	Pod Culture's got a huge week ahead. By the way, Brad was sharing some stuff.
10012000	10014000	If you haven't heard Pod Culture, you should check it out Monday nights at the Voice Geek Network.
10015000	10017000	6 Pacific, 9 Eastern. They have a huge show.
10018000	10022000	He just went to this local convention out there and got all these bumpers from people.
10023000	10025000	I don't even think I can say who, but it's really, really, really big.
10026000	10028000	He sent me one of the bumpers and I was like, you suck.
10028000	10030000	But in a loving way.
10031000	10035000	Lastly, Pika Uno sent us a tweet that says, the golden rules for credit cards.
10036000	10039000	Always pay off in full each month. Remember we talked about the GameStop card last week.
10040000	10044000	Always pay off in full each month. Get paid to use credit cards with reward cards.
10045000	10049000	And budget with YNAB, which I believe means you need a budget.
10050000	10052000	I think that was a game that was on Steam during the game.
10053000	10055000	An app that was on Steam during the sale.
10055000	10058000	I know a lot of people were picking that up because it's very popular budgeting software.
10059000	10060000	I don't think it's on Steam.
10061000	10062000	It is. It's an app. Because Steam has apps.
10063000	10064000	Oh, yeah.
10065000	10066000	They have some music software. I think you need a budget.
10067000	10068000	I have an app. It's called a ledger book.
10069000	10070000	Okay.
10071000	10072000	In our online banking.
10073000	10074000	I'm sure there's a lot of similar iOS apps.
10075000	10079000	What is it about YNAB that makes it so popular?
10080000	10081000	It's supposed to be pretty foolproof.
10081000	10083000	Yeah. I've heard a lot of people really like big fans of that.
10084000	10087000	As opposed to like, I don't hear anybody sticking up for Quicken in that same way.
10088000	10089000	You know what I mean?
10090000	10091000	Quicken is...
10092000	10093000	But that's my point. Or Microsoft money or any of that.
10094000	10095000	I don't hear anybody like going, oh, man, you got to pick that up.
10096000	10097000	It's only YNAB.
10098000	10099000	Mostly because those charge. They're more expensive.
10100000	10101000	Yeah.
10102000	10103000	And they're more like business accounting.
10104000	10105000	You don't need something like that for your home finance.
10106000	10109000	All right. Well, that was it for the Twitters. That's it for the phone calls.
10109000	10112000	I believe that's going to do it for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10113000	10115000	So I'm going to say, as I always do at the end of every show,
10116000	10117000	thank you guys very much for tuning in and listening to the show.
10118000	10119000	Thank you for supporting independent radio.
10120000	10123000	We don't get paid to do this show. We just do it because it's a way for us to hang out.
10124000	10128000	And it's a way for us to spend time with you guys and have a lot of fun doing something we really enjoy.
10129000	10130000	If you've enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
10131000	10133000	or even if you hated it but you think you might know somebody else who might like it,
10134000	10138000	be sure to tell a friend or two or 15 about the show because that's all we got is word of mouth.
10139000	10142000	We don't have a $1 website or game company or Kickstarter backing us.
10143000	10146000	So we need your help to spread the word about Orange Lounge Radio.
10147000	10149000	Thank you guys so much. If you didn't like this show, try another independent podcast.
10150000	10153000	Support independent broadcasting and all the people that are very hardworking out there.
10154000	10156000	And if you are an independent podcaster, I tip my hat to you.
10157000	10158000	Thanks for taking the time to listen to us.
10159000	10162000	Unless you go around hating on other podcasts.
10163000	10166000	Yeah. If you should talk other podcasts, then seriously, you need to get out of the pool.
10167000	10168000	Stop podcasting because that's not what it's about.
10169000	10170000	Keep it clean.
10171000	10173000	Thank you. I love that. Love that. So important.
10174000	10176000	And especially, oh God, you know what pisses me off more than anything?
10177000	10184000	More than anything is when you try to go around writing negative reviews on other podcasts to bolster your own.
10185000	10186000	Do you know how awful that makes you look?
10187000	10192000	It makes you look so awful. And if you think you're fooling anyone, it's so easy to look at your profile
10193000	10197000	and see which podcast you gave five stars to and how all the rest you gave one star to.
10197000	10200000	I'll let you know that'll never happen for me because I'm too damn lazy to do any of that.
10201000	10202000	Right? Just saying.
10203000	10205000	And because I don't listen to any of your podcasts. No, that's not true, right?
10206000	10209000	Cooking with Unity. I love that show. Seriously, watch that show. It's awesome.
10210000	10211000	I listen to history podcasts.
10212000	10216000	I do listen to some other gaming podcasts. I don't listen to as much as I would like.
10217000	10218000	Mr. Poops.
10219000	10220000	Yeah. I try to listen to everybody as well.
10221000	10222000	I was on his podcast once, sort of.
10223000	10226000	I remember. I remember. All right. Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up the show tonight.
10227000	10228000	Loki, I'll start with you. Loki, your final thought tonight.
10229000	10233000	Yeah. Since Act Def just put a comment on there, it says, unless it's the ball pit.
10234000	10240000	You know what, Ranma? I think that they need to have a new show that talks about cons called Live from the Ball Pit or something.
10241000	10242000	That would be hilarious.
10243000	10244000	And the host could actually sit in a ball pit.
10245000	10246000	Yeah, sure.
10247000	10248000	Although, here's my concern. The ball pit joke is going to get played out real fast.
10249000	10256000	Like, I'm already seeing the cosplays about it and I'm like, okay, we're approaching Fonzies getting on the water skis about to head towards the shark.
10257000	10263000	And I know some of you are like, the ball pit joke will never get old. I don't know about that. Some memes get old.
10264000	10266000	When was the last time you saw a dramatic prairie dog? Just saying.
10267000	10270000	Actually today. Someone on Tumblr busted that out.
10271000	10272000	Of course it was Tumblr. Of course.
10273000	10274000	It was great.
10275000	10276000	All right. Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
10277000	10283000	I still feel kind of sick to my stomach. Damn that delicious macaroon cock.
10284000	10296000	And my final thought tonight is, um, I, I'm just, everything's been really weird this week, but I'm happy that OLR is here.
10297000	10298000	You need some pinkberry.
10299000	10307000	I do need some pinkberry. Again. Because I already had some this week. Because on my, on my bad day, Alan was like, we need to go get pinkberry. I'm like, yes we do.
10308000	10309000	But I'll take more.
10310000	10311000	I want to try the vanilla latte.
10311000	10319000	It's not that good. All right. Thank you guys everybody. You guys are the best. Thanks for tuning in. We'll be back here next week to do it all over again.
